My name is Shannon, and I will be your operator for today's call. As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded for replay purposes.","I will now turn the call over to David Chaika, Vice President, Treasurer and Investor Relations. You may begin.","David Chaika - Masco Corp.","Thank you, Shannon, and good morning. Welcome to Masco Corporation's 2016 Fourth Quarter and Full Year Earnings Conference Call. With me today are Keith Allman, President and CEO of Masco; and John Sznewajs, Masco's Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Our fourth quarter and full year earnings release and the presentation slides that we will refer to today are available on our website under Investor Relations.

Allman - Masco Corp.","Thank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I hope all of you in the northeast are staying warm and safe as the storm rolls in.","Let's turn to slide 4. I'm very pleased with our 2016 results and the progress we have made. We continue to execute the strategy laid out two years ago to realize the full potential of our businesses, to leverage opportunities across our businesses, and to actively manage our portfolio. This strategy delivered strong results in 2016. We gained share in our Plumbing and Decorative Architectural segments, and our powerful KraftMaid brand continued to gain share in our Cabinetry segment. And we invested in new products and new programs, positioning us for growth in the coming years.","Our revenues for the year grew 4%, excluding the impact of currency, and our operating profit increased by $148 million as margins expanded 160 basis points to 14.6%. This performance demonstrates our strong operating leverage and our continued improvements in cost productivity. We also strengthened our balance sheet by retiring $400 million in debt while maintaining $1.2 billion in liquidity. Our net debt to EBITDA now stands at 1.5 times, providing us a potent tool to create shareholder value.","Now let's discuss some of our key accomplishments in 2016. In our Plumbing segment, we delivered strong performance across our diverse global plumbing platform. With our four largest businesses Delta, Hansgrohe, Watkins and BrassCraft, each achieving record sales and record profits for the year. Our Delta Faucet Company had another great year with its growth outpacing the segment, both in its trade and retail channels. Additionally, Delta's luxury brand, Brizo, drove strong double-digit growth for the year. Hansgrohe continued to gain share in its core European markets and passed the \u20ac1 billion revenue mark for the first time in its 115-year history. My congratulations to the Hansgrohe team for achieving this historic milestone.","In our Decorative Architectural segment, Behr continued to gain share in the Pro paint market. Our Pro initiative experienced double-digit growth throughout the year, and we will continue to make investments along with The Home Depot to capitalize on this significant opportunity. I'd like to congratulate the Behr team for being recognized as the Supplier Partner of the Year by The Home Depot. This prestigious award recognizes Behr's innovation, quality, focus on the customer, and drive for results and is indicative of the strong relationship we have with the outstanding team at The Home Depot.","Turning to Cabinetry, we continued the rapid improvement in this business that began in 2015. Operating profit doubled to over $100 million as we continued to drive operational efficiencies, exited lower-margin business in the builder direct channel, and achieved profitable growth in our dealer and retail channels. KraftMaid generated strong growth in both the retail and dealer channels, and we are excited about our new product introductions that are expected to drive further growth in 2017 and beyond. These launches included trend-forward finishes to capitalize on the growing demand for great paints, new door styles, decorative accessories, and functional SKUs.","Moving to windows, we had a challenging year at Milgard, our West Coast U.S. window business. We are implementing a focused improvement plan, which is being led by Joe Gross, our executive who led the very successful operational improvements in our Cabinetry business. While this will take some time, we are confident that Joe and the team will significantly improve this segment's profitability in 2017.","Turning back to our consolidated results, our strong operating performance generated $535 million in free cash flow. Strong cash flow is a hallmark of Masco, enabling us to drive shareholder value through reinvesting in the business, selectively pursuing acquisitions with the right fit and return, and returning cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Consistent with our balanced capital allocation strategy, we returned over $585 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends in 2016. I want to thank all of our employees worldwide for their hard work, dedication, and a great performance in 2016.","I'll now turn the call over to John who will go over our operational and financial performance in greater detail.","John G. Sznewajs - Masco Corp.","Thank you, Keith, and good morning, everyone. As Dave mentioned, most of my comments will focus on adjusted performance excluding the impact of rationalization and other onetime charges. Turning to slide 6, our 2016 performance was characterized by solid sales growth and strong operating margin expansion, driven by customer-focused innovation, new programs, operating leverage, productivity improvements, and a continued focus on cost control.","The fourth quarter was our 21st consecutive quarter of year-over-year sales and operating profit growth. We finished the year strong with both our fourth quarter and full-year sales increasing 4%, excluding the impact of currency translation. Currency translation negatively impacted our sales in the fourth quarter by approximately $25 million and the full year by approximately $68 million as the U.S. dollar strengthened against most major currencies including the euro, British pound, and Canadian dollar. Based on year-end exchange rates, we estimate that currency will negatively impact our 2017 sales by approximately $100 million.","North American sales increased 3% for both the fourth quarter and the full year due to strong demand for our repair and remodeling products across all channels of distribution and across the price continuum as consumers are trading up to our better and best product offerings. As a reminder, repair\/remodel activity represents approximately 83% of our total sales.","International sales increased 8% in local currency in the quarter and increased 6% in local currency for the full year as our international plumbing businesses continued to drive growth and profitability. Gross margins expanded approximately 150 basis points to 32.8% in the quarter, expanded approximately 200 basis points to 33.6% for the full year.","Our SG&A as a percent of sales increased 170 basis points to 20.2% of sales for the fourth quarter. This was primarily due to increased medical insurance costs of $10 million, which negatively impacted EPS by approximately $0.02 per share, and as we discussed last quarter, approximately $15 million of planned strategic investment to drive profitable growth.","For the full year 2017, we believe SG&A as a percent of sales will approximate the same level as full year 2015. We delivered solid bottom line performance in 2016, as operating income increased 16% for the full year, with margins expanding 160 basis points to 14.6%. For the fourth quarter, our EPS increased 14% to $0.33, and for the full year, it increased 27% to $1.51.","Turning to slide 7, to put it simply, our Plumbing segment had an outstanding year. The segment continued to deliver profitable growth and margin expansion in the fourth quarter with Delta, Hansgrohe and Watkins, each posting a record quarter for both sales and profits.","Segment sales in the quarter increased 7%, excluding the impact of currency, driven by strong sales increases in faucets, showers, and spas. Currency impacted sales in this segment by approximately $15 million in the quarter and approximately $44 million for the full year.","North American sales increased 6% with strong growth in both the retail and the wholesale channels. We are pleased with this result as North America was up against a difficult 14% sales growth comp in the fourth quarter of 2015.","Our European performance was very strong in the quarter as our international plumbing businesses grew sales by 9% in local currency. We continued to experience sales growth around the globe, with particular strength in Asia and Northern Europe. Additionally, our premium price point products continued to outperform as Hansgrohe's luxury brand, Axor, grew double-digits again this quarter.","Operating profit in the quarter increased 15%, driven by incremental volume and a favorable price commodity relationship. These benefits were partially offset by higher medical costs and increased strategic growth investment, which collectively aggregated approximately $15 million for the Plumbing segment.","Turning to the full year, Delta, Hansgrohe, BrassCraft and Watkins, all experienced record sales and operating profit for the year. Excluding the impact of currency translation, sales increased 7%, driven, again, by faucets, showers and spas.","North American sales grew 7%, excluding the impact of currency translation related to the Canadian dollar, as we continued to experience strong growth in both the wholesale and retail channels during the year.","More specifically, Delta Faucet's luxury brand, Brizo, grew double-digits in 2016 and continues to drive consumer demand in showrooms for our innovative new products. In addition, Delta gained share in faucets and showers with new product introductions at both retail and trade.","Our European businesses continued to outperform, delivering 7% sales growth in local currency, as Hansgrohe grew its share in its core central European markets with new faucet and shower offerings. Full year operating profit grew 26%, driven by volume growth and a favorable price commodity relationship.","Turning to slide 8, the Decorative Architectural Products segment grew 5%, as we continued to experience strong growth across our Behr Pro business as well as our core DIY products. Our high single-digit gallon growth in the quarter was partially offset by the timing of incremental promotional expense that we previously discussed on our third quarter call.","Liberty Hardware also contributed to the top and bottom line growth, as they set their innovative shower door program in the remaining 800 plus Home Depot stores in the quarter. Operating income decreased 12% as increased volume was more than offset by approximately $5 million of planned strategic growth investments as we staffed the 100 new hub stores with Behr Pro reps and approximately $15 million in rebates, promotions and an unfavorable price commodity relationship.","Full-year sales grew 4%, driven by Behr's strong Pro growth, solid performance in our core DIY products, and Liberty Hardware's continued share gains from successful new product introductions and program wins in the retail channel.","To provide more color on our Pro business, our initiatives continued to drive results as this customer segment grew strong double-digits in 2016, and we gained share with the Pro. This outstanding performance demonstrates our commitment together with The Home Depot to invest in and capitalize on this significant opportunity.","Full year operating income increased 7%, principally due to operating leverage on higher volume, partially offset by an unfavorable price commodity relationship. As a reminder, going into 2017, this segment grew 9% in the first quarter of 2016, a difficult comp.","Turning to slide 9, in the Cabinetry segment, sales declined 8% in the fourth quarter and 5% for the full year due to our deliberate exit of lower-margin business within the builder direct channel in the U.S. and at select low-margin accounts in our UK Cabinet business.","KraftMaid's strong performance in the quarter partially offset this decline. In the retail channel, KraftMaid experienced double-digit growth in the fourth quarter as well as year-over-year share gains. In the dealer channel, KraftMaid drove mid single-digit growth in both the fourth quarter and the full year through increased volume and favorable mix and as its new products continue to resonate with kitchen designers and consumers. We are proud of the improved operating performance as full year segment profitability doubled to $101 million with operating margins of 10.4%.","Improved mix through the continued growth of our semi-custom KraftMaid offering and the benefits associated with operational and other cost savings initiatives drove this result.","2017, we believe the revenue impact of our decision to exit builder direct business and our retail kitchen countertop business will be complete by the end of the second quarter. This exit will negatively impact sales by approximately $20 million in the first quarter and by approximately $5 million in the second quarter.","With this exit nearly behind us, we are positioning this business for growth as we have several major product introductions in Q1 and Q2. We will incur approximately $5 million in launch costs in Q1 related to these new product introductions.","Turning to slide 10, our Windows segment sales increased 2% in the fourth quarter and 5% for the full year, excluding the impact of currency, driven by growth in Milgard, our leading western U.S. window business. Milgard's continued growth is due to a positive mix shift toward our premium window and door product lines and favorable pricing. Excluding the negative impact of a stronger U.S. dollar, our European window sales increased 6% in the fourth quarter and 7% for the full year, driven by volume and share gains. Foreign currency translation negatively impacted this segment sales by approximately $9 million for the fourth quarter and $22 million for the full year. Segment profitability in the fourth quarter matched the prior year and decreased $59 million for the full year.","Full-year performance was primarily due to the additional warranty accrual in our Milgard business, incremental labor costs and inefficiencies, and ERP-related expenses, which we have discussed on previous earnings calls. Despite the segment's recent performance, we are executing the Milgard turnaround plan, and it is on track to deliver improved results in 2017.","Turning to slide 11, our year-end balance sheet was strong with approximately $1.2 billion of liquidity. We continue to produce some of the best working capital results in the industry as working capital as a percent of sales was 11.3% at year-end. This is a result of the great supply chain execution that helped us generate $535 million of free cash flow, which includes an incremental $50 million pension contribution made in 2016.","During 2016, we repurchased approximately 15 million shares valued at approximately $460 million, putting more than $200 million in the fourth quarter. We currently have 12.9 million shares left in our $50 million share repurchase program, which we plan on completing in 2017 subject to market conditions. We also increased the annual dividend by $0.02 to $0.40 per common share. Since 2014, we have returned more than $1.4 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.","Finally, one of our strategies has been to achieve an investment grade credit rating. We have worked hard to improve our credit metrics. The strong earnings growth we have delivered over the last several years, coupled with the strengthening of our balance sheet through debt reduction and excellent working capital management, has led to significantly stronger credit profile. Today, net debt to EBITDA stands at 1.5 times. These improvements led Fitch to raise our credit rating to investment grade in late December. We are extremely pleased with this outcome and the financial flexibility it provides us.","With that, I'll turn the call back over to Keith.","Keith J. Allman - Masco Corp.","Thank you, John. 2016 was a great year for Masco, and we have tremendous opportunities in front of us. The fundamentals driving our business are strong. Demographics, namely the large millennial group, are increasingly favorable and should drive household formations and housing for years to come.","Home prices are appreciating, boosting consumer confidence to invest in their homes. Housing turnover, a leading indicator for our business, increased approximately 4% in 2016 to 5.4 million units. And U.S. residential housing stock is aging, a key driver of repair and remodel spend with 50 million homes in the United States now over 40 years old, an increase of over 6 million units over the past 10 years.","Given our leading positions, strong channel relationships, robust innovation pipelines, and the ability to drive growth and productivity through our Masco operating system, we are well positioned to capitalize on these strong fundamentals. Combined with our strong balance sheet and robust cash flow, we will drive shareholder value through reinvesting in the business, selectively pursuing acquisitions with the right fit and return, and returning cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. We are confident that we will exceed our 2017 earnings per share target of $1.80 that we set in 2015.","We hope to see many of you at our Investor Day on May 16 in New York City when we will update you on our progress towards this goal and our longer-term strategy.","With that, we'll now open the call up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Michael Rehaut from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks. Good morning, everyone.","John G. Sznewajs - Masco Corp.","Hi, Mike.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC","The first question I had was on some of the margin results, in particular, Cabinets and Plumbing. Earlier in the year, we saw a great margin increase year-over-year in both segments actually, cabinets and Plumbing. Still strong performance year-over-year in the fourth quarter, but maybe a little less than we were expecting. I don't know if others were similarly \u2013 maybe had a little bit higher margin outlook. But we're just trying to triangulate if you think about some of the improvement in the first half versus the second half, what were the differences there. On an absolute rate, it came down by a few hundred basis points. And how to think about, as you look at 2017 versus 2016, the trajectory for further margin improvement?","John G. Sznewajs - Masco Corp.","Sure, Mike. I'll take part of this, and Keith can also chime in on this one. So, let's start with the Cabinets segment. To your point, the first half of the year, we showed some pretty strong margin improvement in this segment. You may recall that we did cite in Q1 we had $4 million of favorability due to underspending on marketing and other initiatives in that segment, and then we also cited a similar favorability in the second quarter. We tried to guide the Street not to think about the margins that we are posting in the first two quarters of the year to be reflective of what our current run rate is but rather what our long-term potential of that business is.","And so, what you saw is more normalized investment in the back half of the year as we introduced new products and programs that just require investment as you reset displays and other things out in the field. So, while we are significantly up from prior years, I think what you'll see in the Cabinet segment going into 2017 is continued steady margin expansion. And long term, we did say that we do believe that this business can be kind of low to mid-teens business. And I think just what happened is people got maybe a little bit overly aggressive in their forecast in terms of timing as to when we might experience those types of results.","In Plumbing, you're right. We did experience some nice margin growth in the first half of the year, and that really continued into the back half of the year particularly in the third quarter. Where we did see a little bit of margin compression is in the third quarter. And we tried to outline that for you here on the call. We had the $5 million of medical insurance costs that we incurred unexpectedly in the quarter plus about $10 million of strategic growth investment, which was elevated a little bit. And we pulled some forward \u2013 we had foreshadowed about $5 million for the quarter back on our third quarter call and that did increase to $10 million for the fourth quarter, so a little bit more than we had expected.","Sp we're not lacking any confidence as to where our margin profile is going to go in the Plumbing segment. We feel really good about the performance of the segment. So, no significant change on where we believe that business will perform long term.","Keith J. Allman - Masco Corp.","Yeah. Just to piggyback a little bit on John's comments, we've been consistent in talking about our number one capital allocation priority, being to invest in our existing business. We've got great brands, strong innovation pipelines, and putting our money behind these brands and pipelines is the best returns for our shareholders. So, that's really what we're doing. The growth investment that we've had this quarter in Plumbing focused on Hansgrohe and Delta.","With regards to Hansgrohe, we're driving share gains in our core European markets with increased marketing spend and some feet on the street to drive that. It's very productive for us. Obviously, it takes some time to work into those investments. There's a bit ahead of revenue. But we've proven frankly that we can leverage these, and we're going to do that.","For Delta, we're putting money into our showrooms and our showroom displays. I was just out in the Midwest looking at some of those first displays, and they look great. And they're going to drive great volume and foot traffic, and our showroom customers are loving them. A lot of buzz out in the market for that. And we've made significant investments in e-business. We've got a great dedicated team at Delta that's focused on that. We've got variable comp and P&L metrics focused on that along with growth metrics, and that business leader is doing an outstanding job, and we believe we have the leading position in that online channel. And long term, as we look into next year and beyond, we fully expect this Plumbing segment to be in the high-teens margins.","With regards to Cabinets, as John said, it's a similar story. We're investing behind that brand. In this particular case, it's really about product introduction and listening to the voice of the customer and delivering on that. So, we had some product launch costs here in this quarter. And if you look at prior quarters, we're a little light as we talked about and we're fully transparent on. We had a little bit of higher promotion that's been very productive for us. So, we had a great year. Our margins expanded 560 basis points in Cabinets, and we expect ahead of our exits of builder direct to grow this business and to continue to expand the margins as we look at 2017, so really about investing in our brands and our innovation pipelines and continuing with those investments to drive margin expansion.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC","I appreciate that, Keith, and thanks for the additional comments on the new products. Obviously, it's a key part of managing the business. Secondly on Decorative, this quarter, again on the margin side, kind of switched to down year-over-year versus being up year-over-year in the last couple of quarters. And there were several drivers, John, that you cited that was behind that. And I'm thinking in particular about the $15 million rebate or promotional rebates and the unfavorable price commodity relationship. On the rebate side, was that something greater than expected? How should we think about that in terms of a \u2013 I don't know if it's a onetime issue or just a year-end issue that may be was bigger than usual. And also, going into 2017, price commodity, we've talked a lot about TiO2 and how to think about \u2013 and you've had a couple of years of roughly 20%, slightly better than 20%. How should we think about the trajectory for 2017?","John G. Sznewajs - Masco Corp.","Yeah. Sure, Mike. In terms of the rebate question that you asked, because of the strength of our performance both at Behr and as well as Liberty Hardware in that segment, a couple of our customers did reach higher rebate tiers, which drove that. So, your question was unanticipated, yeah, we knew they were approaching it and we weren't certain they were going to reach it, but indeed they did. So, that's good news for both us and our channel partner that they're growing rapidly.","In terms of the second part of your question on TiO2, yes, we have seen some relatively modest inflation in titanium dioxide, particularly as we entered the back half of the year. And as I'm sure you're aware, you've seen some of the manufacturers put out further announcements on future price increases for the first half of 2017.","And so, we continue to work on this with our suppliers and we're going to continue to monitor the situation. We don't think inflation is going to be extraordinary in 2017. We do think, again, it will continue to be modest, kind of low single-digit inflation in 2017. But you never know how these things play out, so we'll stay on top of that. And to the extent that we need to, we'll put through pricing if we have to.","Keith J. Allman - Masco Corp.","Yeah. In terms of as expected or not expected, there's always a little bit of fluctuation when you're talking about growth investments and promotions and rebates. But we really did call this out last quarter and we're on plan to continue to invest in this business.","Making the hub store investment, we did the first 100 stores, and it worked out fabulously for us. We're making the next 100-store investment. We know why we're doing it and how we should do it. We're doing it close to the existing hub stores, so the Pros in a given city are free to go to The Home Depot wherever they are around that city to get their paint. So it's efficient for us. And we're confident that while the investment obviously is ahead of revenue a little bit, that we will grow our way and work our way into that.","We expected some modest TiO2. We talked about that last quarter. We're seeing that. It remains to be seen what'll happen on the resin side, but as we've have talked over time, we remain flush with regards to price and commodities. And overall, when we look at this business, we're continuing to expect growth in 2017. And if there is margin degradation, it will be modest, and this business will continue to be in the high teens.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dennis McGill from Zelman Associates. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Dennis Patrick McGill - Zelman Partners LLC","Hi. Good morning, guys. Thank you. I guess, the first question is just, I think you had mentioned that Joe was moving over to run the windows business or maybe he's just assuming the windows business as well. Just want to clarify that. And then if that's the case, how we should think about where Cabinets is in sort of restructuring efforts or recovery efforts? Is this a sign that you feel very favorable about the direction there and that's now more about executing as opposed to restructuring?","Keith J. Allman - Masco Corp.","Cabinets is in great shape, Dennis. I was intimately involved with the improvement plan with Joe. And a big part of that improvement plan is this business is long-term in our portfolio. We wanted to build a solid bench, and Joe did that. Our CFO, Gordie Fournier, while he's a Michigan State Spartan, he still does a pretty good job. He's doing great. And Joe was still over that business. Gordie has stepped up his game and is running more and more of that business. Joe is spending a good portion of his week out west with the team at Milgard, rebuilding that team, and he's also spending time in Ann Arbor and helping Gordie run the Cabinet business. So very confident in the team at Cabinets as we've talked about.","We're going to execute and finish up the final exit of some of that business that we purposefully are exiting in builder direct. We're driving good solid growth and profitable growth in retail. And in our dealer business, we're investing both at the lower opening price point in our Merillat and Quality brands, and KraftMaid is absolutely cooking. So, feel very confident in both continued margin expansion and overall net growth in Cabinets. Cabinets is in good shape.","In terms of the Windows team, Joe is out there. We've made significant changes with eliminating positions, restructuring the organization. The general manager of that business has retired. And we're recruiting for a general manager for that business. And we have folks from our Masco operating system team that are out there. As we've talked last quarter, we had our senior executives and supply chain from Delta out there helping. And frankly, we're getting very nice traction. So, we expect very nice profitability improvement and continued growth out of that segment.","So, the bench and the management team and talent development, frankly, is something that's top of mind for our organization and for me personally, and we are comfortably in good shape both at cabinets and windows.","Dennis Patrick McGill - Zelman Partners LLC","Well, Keith, I think as long as you don't hire any Buckeye's, you should be in good shape there.","Keith J. Allman - Masco Corp.","Couldn't agree more.","Dennis Patrick McGill - Zelman Partners LLC","Just a quick follow-up on Cabinets as well. With some of the exits that you've mentioned on the direct builder side and I think others have talked about this as well and it seems to be something that's pretty prevalent this cycle, at least this portion of the cycle, do you think the new construction piece of the business is just going to operate differently going forward than it has in the past, whether it be size of supplier or how you have to get to the builders?","Keith J. Allman - Masco Corp.","That's a good question. I think we are seeing overall a shift from the bigger cabinet companies moving away from some of those larger but regional builder direct models, where, frankly, a local competitor can do a better job and can survive or be content, if you will, on lower margins in a model where they're working for their wages, and it works out well for them. So, I think that shift is probably there.","I would tell you that there certainly is components of the builder business and I would include in that large national builder business that makes sense for a company like ours to serve. It's driven by a combination of local density in the area where we can optimize the last mile delivery and the management of the install and punch out of the job. It has to do, to a good extent, with some mix and the relative take per unit because the cost really doesn't vary for a home when you talk about last mile and install and warranty and punch out. But it certainly does vary on the top line and take per home when you start to move the mix.","So, I think clearly, there is a shift where there's going to be more regional players that are taking some of the tighter business. But we're going to ultimately, very quickly here by the second quarter of next year have this business where we want it, and we think there are some growth opportunities there.","Dennis Patrick McGill - Zelman Partners LLC","Okay. Thanks again, guys. Good luck.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Dahl from Barclays. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Michael Dahl - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Keith, I wanted to start with paint and going back to your comments in response to Mike Rehaut's questions related to the hub store investments. And it sounds like you're now embarking on the rollout of the next 100 stores. Can you just give us a sense of where you are in that process? Is this something that we should now think of as kind of layering on 100 a year over the next couple of years? And then if so, maybe this is John as well, but is this investment then \u2013 should we just think of this as kind of a recurring investment for the next couple of years?","John G. Sznewajs - Masco Corp.","So, Mike, just where we stand in terms of the 100 hub stores. Just for everyone's benefit, we've hired 100 hub store representatives to serve these \u2013 just for everyone's knowledge \u2013 these are Behr employees that we're putting in The Home Depot stores to assist the Pro contractors that come into the stores with their sales. And so, we placed 100 hub store representatives in the third quarter, and we placed and hired the second 100 hub store representatives in the fourth quarter. So, we're fully staffed with our 200. In terms of the way we're looking at it, right now, just because of the timing of things, we got a little bit of cost ahead of sales. So, we're funding their salaries, but we're still building up the revenue generation for each of the representatives.","In terms of the go forward, will we incur additional hub stores? That really depends on the productivity of the first 200. And as you might expect, we've seeded the stores with what we think and The Home Depot think are the most productive Pro paint stores within their network. And then if there are going to be a third 100 reps, they would be the next most productive stores. That really depends on the productivity of the first 200 before we and The Home Depot would move to add anyone else at this point.","Keith J. Allman - Masco Corp.","I'd tell you, Mike, we're committed to investing in the Pro business. It's worked out well for us thus far, and we definitely see a direct path to it continuing to work. What I love about how this initiative has played out is the flexibility that both the Behr team and Kevin Scott and his team at The Home Depot have shown. And in the case of the hub store staffing and rollout, we've shown that it works, so we're going to increase that.","The team has also looked at information technology aspects of this segment, how we can invest in information technology so that it's a smoother transaction for the Pro in terms of how they're able to access data about the tinting of a particular job to how quickly they can get in and out of the store with regards to where they pay and how they pay to how quickly we get the product to them, et cetera. So, we're committed to continuing to invest in this Pro segment and this Pro initiative because it works. I think that's the key message.","In terms of specifically if we're here to say that there's 100 a year and plan on that investment, no, I wouldn't go that way. We're going to make sure that this works out. We're going to drive leverage in this investment, continue to drive our productivity because at the end of the day, we need that to continue to invest, and then we'll invest. This double-digit growth that we're experiencing is a nice pace for us, and we intend to continue it.","Michael Dahl - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thanks for that. And it makes sense. Certainly, the top line would suggest that there's some good traction there. Then just shifting gears back to windows, this is the one business where there have been some real challenges in terms of tracking towards your longer-term goals and how you think about what that business needs to do to earn an appropriate return. And appreciate that there's a lot of work to do, but is there any more quantification you can give us about kind of what Joe is tasked with as far as getting to the 10% margin that I think is still your long-term target? What type of timeframe is involved there and how we should think about the progression?","John G. Sznewajs - Masco Corp.","Yeah. So, as you heard us say in our prepared remarks, Mike, that we think that the business is on track for its improvement plan that Joe and the team are initiating, and they're focusing on a couple of things. You may recall up until the first quarter of 2016 that this business had experienced 14 consecutive quarters of high single or low double-digit growth. So, the company's ability to grow is unquestioned. And they lost their path in the last couple of quarters, but we think Joe and the team are doing the right things in terms of not only the internal operational improvements that they're going after but then again, also reengaging with the external customers and continuing to drive the growth of this business.","So, we do think long term that this business can exhibit those very nice growth dynamics that we had experienced several quarters back. And we do think also long term that this can be a double-digit business. But long term is not 2017, but it's probably 2018 or beyond. So, still got some work to do. We do think for this year, 2017, we think this will probably kind of a mid-single-digit business as Joe and the team continue to work their plan.","Keith J. Allman - Masco Corp.","I'd tell you, a bump in the road doesn't change the city we're driving to. This is a part of our platform. We haven't changed that from a strategic perspective. We did have a challenging year. Joe and the team are doing a great job. We like what we're seeing initially, and it's going to continue. And as John said, we expect this to be back in that mid-single-digit margin range and to continue to grow and march on our way towards our long-term objectives.","Michael Dahl - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thanks for that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Nishu Sood from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks. Wanted to ask a question about taxes, just all the discussion in Washington about tax reform. John, I was wondering if you could maybe give us an update on the cash balances overseas that might be subject to any tax changes. The border tax, if you can give us a sense of how much imported quantity there is that might be affected by that. And then the corporate tax rate, I think that's pretty straightforward or maybe there are some tax credits, like the Section 199. So, just maybe your general thoughts on that (45:50) might be impacted.","John G. Sznewajs - Masco Corp.","Sure. As you know, it's a fairly dynamic environment now around taxes, and there's not a lot of clarity to where the final outcome may be. So, we do have our tax group internally, a team that is evaluating the proposals. As we learn more about each, we kind of focus on it. So, in terms of what we're seeing out there in terms of the cash overseas, we do have about $600 million of cash over in Europe and other jurisdictions. Some of them would be easily brought back to the United States if there were a favorable tax regime put in place that we could bring it back. So, other foreign cash, though, recall, is trapped. It's more difficult to get cash out of certain jurisdictions like China and some of the other Asian countries. So, that will probably be able to be freed up as easily.","In terms of the broader overall corporate tax rate, as we've been guiding you, we've been experiencing 36% tax rate and we are a 36% cash taxpayer. So, any relief on corporate taxes would be a benefit, subject to any of the other provisions that may get put out there such as the border adjustment tax that you alluded to and the Section 199 issue that you alluded to as well. So, a lot of kind of ambiguity out there, and we really won't know more until later in the year when some of this comes into clear focus.","Keith, do you want to talk a little bit about the border adjustment tax?","Keith J. Allman - Masco Corp.","Yeah, I think about the three issues regarding the border adjustment tax. Number one and John alluded to this, there's a lot of moving parts here, and we really don't know where it's going to ultimately land and when, if it does land, when it does land, if it will be on finished goods or on components or how it will be structured. So, nothing is set yet. So, the key here is to be diligent and to watch what's happening and to have scenarios around what potentially could happen. And we're doing that with our outstanding tax department.","The second thing is this potential tax puts a premium on supply chain flexibility. And when you look at our supply chain, we really have outstanding teams in both our business units as well as here at corporate to drive synergy across our business unit, and that's obviously easy to say.","But take a look at our working capital as a percent of sales. To me, that is one of the most all-encompassing, ultimate, if you would, metric around the quality of our supply chain leadership teams, and we are industry leading and we've continued to improve these outstanding results. So, we have a great team, and they've got the tools to use. We've got 40 factories in the United States and roughly I think 13 factories outside the United States. We've talked over several quarters about the ability of our supply chain to handle our planned growth without significant capital investment. Said another way, we planfully kept some capacity in our chain. And that capacity can be used together with this outstanding team to take advantage of flexibility. So, that second point of flexibility, we're very strong.","And then thirdly, it's really about competitiveness. It's about how do we stack up against the competition because this will happen to everybody in terms of our mix of business and our flexibility. And when you think about it, our windows business and paint business really is not an issue. This is a make it here, sell it here supply chain for those two.","In terms of Cabinetry, we import a little bit of lumber and wood, but we import significantly less lumber than our main competition. So, we have a structural competitive advantage there. And then Plumbing, which would be our most impacted segment, we have significant manufacturing facilities in Indiana, Tennessee, California, North Carolina, Texas that are very flexible. And we've demonstrated that flexibility. You may recall there was an anti-dumping issue a while back on plywood. So, we changed the value added. We decided to laminate the melamine here, and we decided to cut it to size here to reduce the value added and essentially, avoid the impact of that anti-dumping tariff, and we did that in about six days. So, we've got the flexibility. We have the competitive advantage. And I am not concerned about this issue.","Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Got it. No, that's very, very helpful. Switching gears to Plumbing, the international sales component has had a good run here. So, I just wanted to dig into that a little bit. You touched on \u2013 I imagine, obviously, Hansgrohe driving most of that. You touched on the core European market growth in your commentary. Just wondering if you could dig in to the drivers of that a little further. Is that mainly core market, new product growth as you were mentioning? Is that continued expansion into new territories? If you could just kind of give us the rundown there, please.","Keith J. Allman - Masco Corp.","A combination of several things. Not so much expansion into new territories per se. We're focused on seven core markets. China, United States are two of those seven, and then we have the rest primarily in Central Europe. So, it's regions where we have solid teams, where we know the markets, where we have great customer relationships. So, it's more about increasing the share of wallet, if you will, of a region where we're already established. And that's important because that's the highest leveraged place for us to go with our investment.","In terms of the type of investment, again, it's a combination. We are increasing our marketing spend to build a consumer brand and get Hansgrohe more known and create consumer pull. We have very strong trade pull, and we've been very diligent in cultivating that. And now, we're moving a little bit more into the consumer pull. Honestly, this is a similar playbook to what we did in Delta, and it's very effective. So, there's some advertising and promotions, marketing spend, if you will. And then there's feet on the street. Thorsten Klapproth, our CEO over there, is carefully putting in folks to help drive in segment-focused areas to achieve our objectives of continued growth. So, it's a combination of salespeople, of restructuring to go after targeted segments, increasing brand spend to drive consumer pull, and of course, taking care of the core.","Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","At this time, I would like to remind our participants that in order to ensure that everyone has a chance to participate, we would request that you limit yourself to asking one question and one follow-up question during the Q&A. Your next question comes from the line of Keith Hughes from SunTrust. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Keith Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thank you. Just going back to windows, I know it sounds like we have several things and problems going on, but ERP install was one that hit the segment. Can you talk about what the spend on that was in 2016 and how much in timing of that will fall away in 2017?","John G. Sznewajs - Masco Corp.","Yeah, Keith. So, you may recall on our third quarter call, we talked about the fact that we're going to slow down the rollout of the ERP. And so, roughly, we spent approximately $15 million and a roughly $3 million to $4 million a quarter that we've been spending on that. And we continue to roll out the ERP over the course of 2017, and we don't expect that $15 million to increase at all. It will be a very similar spend level going into 2017 and beyond.","Keith Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","So, the comments earlier of that business getting back to mid single-digit EBIT in 2017, what's driving that? It doesn't look like it's an ERP cost falloff. What kind of things will be coming in to help out?","John G. Sznewajs - Masco Corp.","Yeah. A couple of things, Keith, that should be driving. Obviously, the big one is that we incurred $31 million of warranty expense in 2016, which we know won't recur in 2017. So, that's a big mover. The other thing is, recall, when we got into the issues in the second and third quarter, we were running a fair amount of labor inefficiencies. And there's one thing that Joe Gross is really good at doing is going into a facility and identifying those inefficiencies and streamlining processes to make them better. So, while they won't go to zero, I think Joe and the team have got a really good view as to how to improve the underlying efficiency of the operation.","Keith Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Yeah. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bob Wetenhall from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC","I can't believe you have a Spartan on payroll, but we'll move past that. It's great that you guys have returned $1.4 billion, and you got a great investment grade credit rating. Kudos to Sznewajs for that. Just trying to understand, Keith, it's been transformation story since you became CEO. You got rid of the installation business and spun it out. You got close to $1 billion cash and immense liquidity. Do you want to go out and buy something like a big windows business or a door business or where do you want to grow? What makes sense? You got a great Plumbing business. You're very clear in terms of your objectives with the paint business at Behr. What's the next step for the business? Is it more of a balanced capital allocation approach? Would you like to expand in adjacent categories? What do you see in the landscape today?","Keith J. Allman - Masco Corp.","I think it's the way you characterize it as a balanced approach, that continues. I would put mergers and acquisition up a little bit in terms of how we're looking at it, but we haven't changed our approach to those, to mergers and acquisitions, that being our focus is on bolt-ons and paint and plumbing. And we are looking at other areas. The pipeline is growing and our velocity through that pipeline is faster than it was a year ago.","So, I like how the team is looking at it, but we're going to be patient. We're going to be careful that we don't overpay. And our focus is on return on invested capital. We need to be able to bring value to a business that we buy and the business that we buy needs to fit in to our portfolio. And for us, as I said, our focus is on bolt-on. Paint and plumbing is the center of the target of the bull's eye, if you will, but we're looking at other areas.","In terms of the relative size and if we would make a big one, we would if it made sense. That's not our focus. But if we were able to find a bigger, call it, transformative deal that added shareholder value, that was a solid return for us above our cost of capital and where we had a real no-kidding ability to add value to the business in terms of both top line and profitability, then we would look at it.","Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you. That's helpful. And I'm glad you guys are getting more forthright with that. You mentioned in your prepared remarks that you're comfortable that you're exceeding $1.80 EPS target for 2017. And I was just hoping you could kind of give a big picture overview of what your thoughts are in end markets on the new res and the R&R spending side. And if you're already comfortable at this early stage in the year saying we're going to get ahead of that, what specifically? Is it better top line growth or better margin performance after a year of investment last year? What's getting you over the line and kind of how much better do you think you can do than $1.80?","Keith J. Allman - Masco Corp.","In terms of the overall macros, as I said in my prepared remarks, we really do think that the fundamentals are strong. And we're 80% plus in \u2013 83%, I think, is accurate in terms of our R&R as a percent of our mix. And we think that's stable and growing.","On the new construction side, the demographics of those millennials, as the average age gets up to 30 over the next five years, is very positive with regards to the increase in families and the need for moving out of the basement and starting to form households, which then starts the move-up cycle.","So, we think the macros are very solid. While interest rates are going up and could maybe put a potential bit of a drag on new home construction, we still think it's going to grow in that 8% range. That's our call on that. And we see a pivot to faster growth in single family than multifamily. And in single family, we have a greater take per home than in multifamily.","With regards to how we see exceeding our $1.80, mainly on margin expansion. We're off, as you know, on our estimates and how we called the market, particularly in the coatings market. We thought the coatings market would grow a little faster than it did. We're taking share, we believe, call the market flat to down a little bit last year. So, we're off a little bit in that, but we're making it up in better margin performance and better conversion costs.","With regards to specifically how much we think we're going to beat it by, Bob, that's why you got to come to New York in May and we'll talk about it.","Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC","So, 2017 for Masco is going to be like healthy top line, kind of low to mid-single-digit growth, you got the right people in place on the Windows business, you're getting rid of less profitable business in Cabinets. So, it's really going to be a margin story with a free cash flow focus.","John G. Sznewajs - Masco Corp.","Yeah, Bob. I think that's right. Because if you recall, when we set that $1.80 target, we assumed constant currency from May of 2015. Currency has moved against us pretty significantly. So, the fact that we're expressing the fact we're going to beat the $1.80, just goes to the confidence we have in the operations of our business.","Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Good stuff, guys. Love the confidence. Good luck this year.","Keith J. Allman - Masco Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Kim. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Stephen Kim - Evercore Group LLC","Okay. Thanks very much, guys. I had a question for you about the Plumbing business. My recollection was that last winter, there was like a pull forward that benefited your 4Q, which means that you had kind of a tough comp in this past quarter on a year-over-year basis, and that, therefore, my expectation would be that you might have an easier comp as you get into the 1Q. I just want to make sure I was thinking about that right on the Plumbing business. And then with respect to the marketing spend there, I was curious whether you think this is going to continue at the same rate in 2017 as it did in 2016.","John G. Sznewajs - Masco Corp.","Yeah. So, I'll take the first part, Stephen. You're right. We did have a pretty tough comp in the fourth quarter of 2015. In my prepared remarks, I said we grew 14% in the Plumbing segment in Q4 of 2015, so what we posted in Q4 of 2016 is a really good result coming against that tough comp. You're right. We have a slightly easier comp going into Q1. I think we were up 5% ex-currency in Q1 of 2016. SO, I think we do have a slightly easier comp than we did in the fourth quarter. But with respect to the second part of your question, I'll let Keith take that one.","Keith J. Allman - Masco Corp.","Yeah, our market spend, particularly as we think about Hansgrohe, we think that will continue. And we're going to drive leverage across Central Europe as we continue those investments. So, yeah, I would anticipate that we're going to continue these kind of investments because they're working for us. And these are strong brands, and we have, as we've talked about in the past, particularly with Hansgrohe, we have outstanding coverage across the globe, doing business in over 135 countries, but we have relatively thin market share in most of those countries, but we're able to make money because of our strong gross margin. So, we have a nice white space in those spaces. So, yes, I would anticipate that investment to continue.","With regards to state side here with Delta, there is some lumpiness to the spend, right? So, sometimes we have new product introductions or we have displays that we change. So, quarter to quarter, there will be some lumpiness. But with regards to this overall Plumbing platform and the business, I think it's a smart move to continue to invest it. We're going to continue to grow this business, and we're going to keep those margins up in the high teens.","John G. Sznewajs - Masco Corp.","One of the things, Stephen, just to call out for Q1 of 2017 is we is do have our large biennual trade show, ISH, in Frankfurt that there may be some incremental spend in Q1 in the Plumbing segment on that one, several million dollars. So, just you might want to factor that into your thinking about Q1.","Stephen Kim - Evercore Group LLC","Right. Yeah. Thanks for reminding us about that. Okay. Great. And then in Cabinets, obviously, retail had very strong results. I think you mentioned up strong double digits, which is great. So, it looks like you kind of gained some share there in retail. I was curious if you could comment on what role promotional activity and marketing spend maybe played in that. And we had expected about $5 million in marketing expense in 4Q. I was wondering, did that actually happen? And what should we expect in fiscal 2017 beyond that $5 million in the first quarter that you talked about?","Keith J. Allman - Masco Corp.","Promotions in retail did play a factor in the growth, no question about it. And we do that because it works. It drives profitable growth in our Cabinet segment. And when you have the advantage that we have of having fewer brands and stronger brands, this is the type of thing that happens. The retailer comes to us and says they want to do exclusive promotions, and we do that together with them. So, it makes good business sense to drive profitable growth in this fashion. Think about it. We've got leading market share in both big boxes, and when you think about the mix of retail in our Cabinet business versus our competition and then you look at our overall margin, we're right there. So, the numbers don't lie. That tells the story about us being able to leverage this competitive advantage with our brands and do it in a very profitable way. And interestingly enough, we did it with the same calendar we've been using for the last 2,000 years. We didn't change anything on our calendar, and we're driving this business profitably.","Stephen Kim - Evercore Group LLC","Great. Okay. Thanks very much, guys.

Thank you for joining us today. Please turn to Slide 4. We experienced a slow start in 2019, as a combination of factors impacted our results. Some of these factors were anticipated, such as sales pull forward into the fourth quarter of 2018 and a large ERP implementation in our windows business.","However, other factors were external and not anticipated such as inventory rebalancing and certain Plumbing and Decorative channels and softer end market demand early in the quarter. Despite our slow start to the year we saw sales trends improve in March and believe that markets are now performing as we expected.","For the quarter, excluding the impact of currency and acquisitions, sales decreased 2%. Operating profit decreased $20 million principally due to lower volumes in our Plumbing Decorative and Windows segments. These were partially offset by pricing actions we took across all segments. Our earnings per share decreased 2% due to the lower operating profit.","Turning to our segments, excluding currency, Plumbing sales were flat. Volume decline in North America was the biggest contributor to flat sales, as volume was affected by the sales pull forward into Q4 of 2018 that we discussed last quarter and lower demand earlier in the quarter. While Plumbing sales worldwide were flat, we did see continued strong performance with our high end Brizo brand in the wholesale showroom channel and good growth in Hansgrohe in both China and Germany its largest markets.","Watkins, our leading spa business continued to see good demand for its products and achieved record first quarter sales. In our Decorative Architectural Product segments pain volumes were lower in the first quarter due to the $20 million of sales pull forward into the fourth quarter of 2018 that we mentioned on our last call, inventory rebalancing and lower end market demand. Paint volumes did accelerate in March and this has continued into April.","We also continue to invest in our pro paint initiative in the first quarter by hiring additional employees to sell and service the professional painter. And we expect to continue to gain share in the pro paint market in 2019. Our lighting business was also softer than expected, notably in landscape lighting which was impacted by weather in the quarter.","Turning to Cabinetry, sales grew 9% in the first quarter with growth in both our repair and remodel business and strong growth in our new construction business. Our repair and remodel growth was led by our new program with Menards which we anniversaried in the first quarter of 2019. We are very pleased with this new business and it is meeting our expectations.","In our Windows segment sales were down in the first quarter as we went live with an ERP system at our largest window manufacturing facility, which caused us to stop taking orders for about a two-week period as planned. This implementation has gone well. Additionally, our UK business continued to be challenged by softer market conditions for its products.","Turning back to Masco overall, we continued our disciplined capital allocation by repurchasing 3.5 million shares for $122 million during the quarter. Before turning the call over to John, let me give you a brief update on our review of strategic alternatives for our Cabinetry and Windows businesses. We have engaged outside advisers to help us with this evaluation and we are close to completing carve out audits of the business units. We have made good progress and are on track to complete this review as planned by the end of June and we will update you accordingly.","Now I'll turn the call over to John to go over our first quarter results in more detail. John?","John Sznewajs","Thank you, Keith and good morning everyone. As Keith mentioned, most of my comments will focus on adjusted performance. Excluding the impact of rationalization and impairment charges inventory step up related to purchase accounting for the Kichler acquisition and other one-time items.","Turning to Slide 6, sales decreased 1% on a reported basis, but grew 1% in local currency. Excluding the acquisition of Kichler sales decreased 4% or 2% in local currency. Foreign currency translation unfavorably impacted our first quarter revenue by approximately $33 million. In local currency North American sales increased 2% in the quarter, but decreased 3% excluding the Kichler acquisition. This performance was due to lower volume in all segments except Cabinetry as we experienced sales pull forward into Q4 2018, inventory rebalancing at certain customers and overall softer demand in January and February.","In local currency international sales decreased 1% in the quarter driven by solid growth in China and Germany which was more than offset by softness in other smaller regions. Gross margins were 31.4% down 120 basis points largely due to lower sales volume and the impact of a full quarter of Kichler. We expect gross margins to expand in the remaining three quarters of 2019.","Our SG&A as a percent of sales decreased 20 basis points to 19.3% reflecting continued cost control. We reported operating profit of $230 million with operating margins of 12.1%. In the quarter we booked two impairment charges, the first charge was a write-down of Kichler's trade name for approximately $9 million. This was driven by revival in our long-term revenue growth forecast incorporating market softness we experienced late last year and in the first quarter of this year.","The second charge was a write-off of the UK Window Group's goodwill balance for approximate $7 million. Our EPS was $0.44 in the quarter a decline of 2% compared with the first quarter of 2018 due to decreased operating profit partially offset by the benefit of a lower share count. Finally, we are reaffirming our annual EPS estimate of $2.60 to $2.80. This guidance assumes that tariffs remain at the 10% level for the remainder of the year and a normalized tax rate of 25%.","Turning to Slide 7, our Plumbing segment sales decreased 3% on a reported basis. Excluding the impact of currency sales matched prior year. Foreign currency translation unfavorably impacted this segment sales by approximately $29 million in the quarter. Our North American sales decreased 1% in the first quarter as this segment sales comparisons were impacted by approximately $20 million of one-time items.","On our fourth quarter call we discussed that approximately $10 million of sales were pulled forward into Q4 2018 from Q1 2019. Additionally, as you may recall, last year's first quarter sales benefited from approximately $10 million of sales that were pulled out of Q2 and into Q1 ahead of Delta's ERP implementation in 2018.","North American performance was also impacted by inventory rebalancing in the wholesale channel, softness in our rough plumbing business, and overall lower demand early in the quarter. Our international plumbing sales increased 1% in local currency as Hansgrohe experienced solid growth in both China and Germany. The segment's operating profit declined due to lower volume which also resulted in inefficiencies.","Mix negatively impacted the quarter due to lower inventory levels in the wholesale channel in North America and a mixed shift down in our international markets. Segment results were also impacted by a trade show expense which we discussed on our fourth quarter earnings call. These were partially offset by favorable pricing actions. For 2019 we continue to expect the Plumbing segment sales growth to be in the 3% to 5% range, if margins are similar to 2018.","Turning to Slide 8, the Decorative Architectural Product segment grew 5%. This performance was driven by low single-digit growth in Behr\u2019s pro paint initiative and our acquisition of Kichler. Excluding the acquisition, sales declined 7%. As we discussed on our last earnings call, the Decorative segment results were impacted by approximately $20 million of sales pulled forward into the fourth quarter 2018 due to increased year-end customer purchases to achieve incentives. In addition, first quarter results were lower than expected due to inventory rebalancing and softer demand earlier in the quarter. Despite a slow start to the year Behr\u2019s did see improved sales trends in March which have continued into April.","In addition, Liberty Hardware experienced growth in the quarter with strength in both its retail and e-commerce channels. Operating income in the first quarter declined versus the prior year due to lower volume, a full quarter impact of Kichler, and the addition of employees servicing pro paint customers partially offset by reduced spending. For the full year of 2019 we expect the Decorative Architectural segment sales growth will be toward the lower end of the 4% to 6% range including the benefit of the Kichler acquisition and margins to be in the range of 17% to 18%.","Turning to Slide 9, in the Cabinetry segment sales increased 9% in the quarter. The strong performance was driven by solid growth in both our repair remodel and new home construction businesses, the increased volume and favorable price. Additionally, our performance was supported by our program win at Menards when anniversaried in the first quarter of this year.","Segment profitability increased in the quarter by $16 million principally driven by lower spending due to the ramp-up costs related to the Menards win in the first quarter of 2018, favorable pricing actions and increased volume. This increase was partially offset by unfavorable mix resulting from our growth at Menards and a double-digit growth in our new home construction business.","While the growth was strong in the first quarter we continue to expect sales growth will be between 0% and 3% and segmental margins to be similar to 2018 as comps get tougher now that we have anniversaried the Menards win, particularly in the second quarter due to the significant ramp up of Menards in Q2 of 2018.","Turning to Slide 10, our Windows segment sales decreased 16% and excluding the impact of currency decreased 14% in the quarter. Foreign currency translation unfavorably impacted this segment's sales by approximately $2 million. This performance was driven by lower volume offset by favorable pricing. As we discussed on our fourth quarter earnings call Milgard executed on the limitation of an ERP system at its largest facility during the quarter and as expected the plant did not take orders for approximately two weeks which impacted Milgard's volume. The implementation went very well and that facility has returned to normal production levels.","The segment's performance was also impacted by continued market softness at our UK Windows operation. Segment profitability in the quarter decreased $7 million driven by lower volume and inefficiencies partially offset by favorable pricing actions. For 2019 we continue to expect sales growth for this segment to be in the 1% to 3% range excluding currency with modest margin improvement.","Turning to Slide 11, our balance sheet remains strong with net debt to EBITDA at two times and we ended the quarter with approximately $1.2 billion of balance sheet liquidity. In the quarter we further improved our liquidity and flexibility by entering into a new five-year credit agreement which increased availability from $750 million to $1 billion. Working capital as a percent of sales improved 150 basis points versus prior year to 16.5%. For the full-year we expect working capital as a percent of sales to be approximately 14%, which is similar to where we ended 2018.","Lastly, during the quarter we continued our focus on shareholder value creation by repurchasing 3.5 million shares valued at approximately $122 million.","And with that, I'll now turn the call back over to Keith.","Keith Allman","Thank you, John. The fundamentals of our business and our core repair and remodel market are healthy. Consumers remain confident and wages are growing. This increase is our consumer's willingness to invest in their home. Home prices continue to appreciate. This is highly correlated with repair and remodel spending. The age of the housing stock is increasing with 15 million owned homes greater than 30 years old. This drives increased remodel spending and household formations have steadily increased throughout 2018 driven by the millennial demographic. This trend is projected to fuel housing demand for the next decade. We believe these fundamentals are supportive of good long-term growth.","We are also positive on our current markets. While we had a slow start to the year, we are encouraged by our recent trends and the acceleration of demand we saw coming out of the quarter and continuing into April. Given the strong fundamentals, improving market conditions, and our ability to execute our plans for 2019, we reaffirm our expectation to achieve 2019 adjusted earnings per share in the range of $2.60 to $2.80.","With our strong balance sheet and expected full year 2019 cash flow conversion of over 100% we intend to deploy approximately $600 million towards share repurchases for the full-year of 2019 consistent with our balanced capital allocation strategy. With our focus on executing our strategy, doubled with our strong balance sheet and liquidity, we will continue to create shareholder value.","Lastly, please save the date for our planned Investor Day on September 17 in New York City, where we will update you on our progress towards our previous goals and our long-term strategy.","With that, we'll open the call for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Nishu Sood with Deutsche Bank. Nishu, your line is open.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi this is actually Morrison [ph] for Nishu. I have a quick question about the rough plumbing, I think over the last six years, when you called out rough plumbing it was always a driver of growth, and this time around you are saying there was softness in rough plumbing and I was just wondering if you could give us a little bit more insight into that?","Keith Allman","When you look at our plumbing segment and you compare, where we have particular concentration and new construction, rough plumbing tends to be a little bit more skewed towards new construction than repair and remodelling and that really is the primary driver some of the softness that we\u2019ve seen.","Unidentified Analyst","All right, thank you. And then given the combination of a slow start and the fact that you are maintaining your full year guidance, does that imply that you expect to come at the lower end or do you anticipate that the second half of the year will make up for the slow start?","Keith Allman","We did expect a slower Q1 due to the pull ahead that we mentioned in a couple segments, but I would say that the quarter was a little softer than we expected. We didn\u2019t expect the inventory rebalancing and I would say that the weather was probably a little worse than expected, but we did see things pick up in the back part of the quarter and into early April here. And it looks like the 25% tariff is coming off the table, so that could help us with volume a bit. So all in, we feel good about our ability to execute and achieve our plans and that\u2019s why we\u2019re reaffirming our range of $260 million to $280 million.","Unidentified Analyst","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Kim with Evercore ISI. Stephen, your line is open.","Stephen Kim","Yes, thanks very much guys, I appreciate it. So I just want to clarify on the tariff guide, you are now assuming a 10% and you said that couldn\u2019t provide a little bit of a lift, but I just wanted to make sure that in your guidance you are incorporating a 10% is maintained and doesn\u2019t go to 25%. I just want to clarify if that is different from what you were assuming last quarter?","Keith Allman","Yes, you may recall that we assumed that it was 25% for the year as we started out the year, so that is correct Stephen, that we\u2019re assuming that it is 10% and that 10% stays throughout the year.","Stephen Kim","Okay, and you had also assumed I think that you were going to recover the bulk of that and through pricing actions, so the EPS impact probably wouldn\u2019t be that meaningful I assume.","Keith Allman","And Stephen, excuse me, I should also just point out, when we assume that we were going to recover in price, we also assumed because of those pricing actions that we may have some reduced volume as a result of those pricing actions.","Stephen Kim","Correct.","Keith Allman","So, just to make sure you are clearing that.","Stephen Kim","Yes, thanks for that clarification. On Kichler, you talked about landscaping lighting being impacted by weather in the quarter, we also know there were, there were obviously some other issues there at Kichler. So my question overall is, can you give us a sense for how much of the Kichler sales decline you thought was impacted by weather and how much was related to other issues and when do we think we can see sales grow on a year-over-year basis in Kichler?","Keith Allman","We\u2019re off plan a little bit on the revenue side with Kichler. We took a fresh look at our long term revenue forecast and we have seen some softness in the lighting market overall going back to say the last quarter, quarter and a half of 2018 and that softness has continued into the early part here in 2019. As I mentioned, probably some weather related due to landscaping, but also I, we, believe that the industry is digesting the impact of tariff pricing and we need to get through that. This industry is more of an impact from tariff as a proportion than most of our other segments for sure.","We\u2019re also applying more discipline to our pricing as it relates to retail and wholesale programs. This is consistent with how we run our other businesses we think that has an impact on the overall revenue in this business. In terms, Stephen, specifically, of growth in 2019 we\u2019ll be challenged to achieve growth in 2019 at Kichler due to the slow start to the year and as I mentioned our discipline around pricing in both retail and wholesale programmes, and with that impact on tariff that will be factor as well.","We are confident that as we get through this rough start to 2019 that lighting will grow in a similar trajectory to repair and remodel over the long term and we're working on some exciting new programs to get after that. But in terms specific at 2019 growth is going to be challenging at Kichler.","John Sznewajs","Yes, Stephen, well I would supplement Keith's comments which is, on the operational side I think we made some good improvement there and there are some further opportunities for us to go after by implementing our Masco operating system. So, from a bottom line perspective we seeing a good opportunity there too, to continue to improve that business.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Bouley with Barclays. Matthew, your line is open.","Matthew Bouley","Hi, thank you for taking my questions. I wanted to ask about the strategic review kind of, understanding there is different potential outcomes there, how would you guys think about capital deployment upon the completion of these transactions, as you know the expectation that you may buyback additional stock or are there I guess acquisitions that might be closer to the vest in paint or Plumbing, just kind of any thoughts there? Thank you.","Keith Allman","Yes, in terms of use of proceeds if we go in that direction, we really do not see a change in the capital allocation strategy that we\u2019ve articulated and consistently executed against. That being consistent with regards to funding our business we would use, we\u2019ve talked about the $600 million of share buyback in 2019, we certainly are continuing to look at acquisitions. We have a solid and strong pipeline that we are continuing to evaluate, but as I've said consistently we will be patient as it relates to acquisitions to ensure that we\u2019re deploying capital to our businesses that have the right strategic fit and can give us the right return. So, no real change to our capital allocation strategy.","John Sznewajs","Yes and Stephen or William or Matthew, I\u2019m sorry, maybe to give you a little bit more clarity, we would probably focus a little bit more on share repurchase activity if we were to go to the sale route acknowledging the fact that our balance sheet is in good shape now. So if an acquisition were to come along we could use our balance sheet to help fund any acquisition that were to come along. So we wouldn\u2019t be afraid to deploy a little bit of those you know, fair amount of those proceeds if that\u2019s where it goes, to share repurchase activity.","Matthew Bouley","Okay, I appreciate that detail. And then secondly just back to Decorative, you mentioned the trends around sales pace accelerating in March and April in Paint, but you changed the revenue guidance slightly. So is that simply just, as you mentioned the slower expectations around Kichler or is that just a reflection of the 1Q results? I guess ultimately it is the expectation that sales growth 2Q to 4Q is going to be a bit slower than what we had previously envisioned? Thank you.","John Sznewajs","Yes, in terms of the segment growth I would say that it comes down to the two factors that you mentioned, one, the Kichler revenue was a little bit softer here in the first part of the year, and then also we had a little bit softer first part of the year in our other businesses in that segment, and so that\u2019s why we\u2019re kind of guiding down to the lower end of that range here is for 2019.","Matthew Bouley","All right, thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Rehaut with JPMorgan. Michael, your line is open.","Michael Rehaut","Hi, good morning. The first question I had was on the improvement in trends that you saw during the year. You said that you started off the year a little softer due to weather. I was, and then March kind of more met your expectations. I was wondering if you could give us a sense specifically, by month, how the sales progressed on a growth basis, how bad was it in January, February, and what type of rate, did you finish the last months of the quarter and so far in April are you seeing similar to March or perhaps a little stronger any color on the progress here would be helpful?","Keith Allman","Mike, first to reset, just keep in mind as you know that Q1 is our smallest and most volatile quarter often impacted by weather and sometimes the timing of purchasing from the prior year end et cetera. So we were encouraged by the turn in the trends that we saw in March. Volumes picked up noticeably for many of our products including Plumbing and Paint. We\u2019re seeing a strong backlog and reports from the field for example in our spa business which we think is a great barometer for consumer spending, so that\u2019s going very well.","So along with the macro fundamentals and what we\u2019re actually seeing, in terms of orders and backlogs, we\u2019re also hearing anecdotal evidence from our customers and channel partners that the consumer is healthy, that there\u2019s spots of very good traffic in fact, and we\u2019re positive for the remainder of the year and feel that we\u2019re well set up for the 260 to 280 guidance that we've given. In terms of specific month by month breakdowns, I\u2019ll steer away from that, but just tell you that we\u2019ve seen at the end of the quarter nice pick up.","Michael Rehaut","Now that that\u2019s helpful Keith, I appreciate that color. I guess secondly, I appreciate the transparency on Kichler and obviously there are sometimes growing pains and it seems like you are doing a few things that are impacting the performance this year. I just wanted to get a sense and kind of recognize perhaps you'll have a greater, more detailed review at the Analyst Day, but ahead of that, just trying to get a sense of what landscape lighting represents as a percent of the overall sales, number one?","And number two, in terms of some of the proactive actions that you\u2019re taking from pricing a pricing disciplined standpoint and I assume that's perhaps also you\u2019re reducing lower margin skews or customers perhaps, what that might do to the overall margin profile of the business over the next year or two to the extent that you are able to fully implement that shift?","Keith Allman","So, you know, but when you look at the mix of Kichler\u2019s business, Decorative Interior Fixtures is an important large chunk of it. But landscape lighting is also a big portion of the business and important to us and one that we do very well. When you go out and do channel checks and talk to the market, Kichler Landscape Lighting specifically is very strong with regards to the product and the service and durability et cetera. So it\u2019s an important part of the business and we do well with it and when you have some tough weather that can affect it.","In terms of what we\u2019re doing and how we\u2019re driving this business, it\u2019s pretty consistent, how we\u2019ve driven our other businesses with regards to the Masco operating system where we focus on quality of earnings and getting businesses better and aligned from a process and execution perspective before we focus on getting them bigger. So that gets better before we get bigger is a common mantra that we drive and that involves applying 80-20 disciplines to our product assortment and to our customers et cetera.","So I think that coupled with as John mentioned, we\u2019re exceeding our expectations as it relates to some of the cost out and productivity and synergies that we\u2019re driving. So this is more of a topline issue than a cash flow or bottom line or return issue. So we would expect as we drive both cost improvements on the procurement and on the logistics and some of those basics as well as sharpening our pencil on programs that we\u2019d expect ultimately that we\u2019d continue to drive marginal improvement in the business.","Michael Rehaut","Great, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Wood with Nomura Instinet. Michael, your line is open.","Michael Wood","Hi, good morning. First, just wanted to ask about, with the Decorative sales being pointed to a low end of the range, does that have an impact on where within the profit guidance of 17%-18% range we\u2019d fall?","John Sznewajs","No Mike, it doesn\u2019t really have an impact on that.","Michael Wood","Okay, and then I wanted to ask about the inventory rebalancing that was unanticipated, can you quantify that at all in Paint and Plumbing and is the March-April strength being helped by a restocking or has that not occurred?","John Sznewajs","So, Mike, in terms of the destocking, we won't go into details of quantifying on those measures on either segment. In terms of, are we seeing changes, going prospectively as you might imagine, going into the spring selling season things are starting to pick up. Keith alluded to the fact that we saw things get better in the tail end of the quarter. And so, we may see a little bit of that coming back here as we start off Q2, and we\u2019re still working our way through all that.","Keith Allman","I would tell you Mike, that our sell through to the consumer if you will, the POS is stronger than our sell into our customers.","John Sznewajs","Yes, and I would also point out Mike, I think an element of our destocking particularly in Plumbing is due to our exceptional service levels with our customers and I think that they are able to perhaps hold a little a bit less inventory, so this might be a little bit of a one-time item in terms of that because of the strength of our service capability.","Michael Wood","Got it, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Susan Maklari with Credit Suisse. Susan, your line is open.","Susan Maklari","Thank you. My first question is just around the raw material side of things, can you give us some color on what you\u2019ve seen in terms of inflation and any thoughts on how that may trend as we look to the remainder the year?","Keith Allman","Susan, some of our commodities have moderated year-over-year, but are up sequentially if you will. So we kind of take it - walk through a couple of the commodities a bit once, copper and zinc and Plumbing, that started to moderate I would say in the back half of 2018 and are down call it 10% to 20% year-over-year in Q1, but zinc in particular has bounced back, so probably a modest net benefit for the full year on those commodities. In terms of TIO2 and resin, they\u2019re both still up year-over-year. TiO2 seems to have stabilized.","However, we're still seeing pressure on resins and obviously oil prices are very volatile, so we're continuing to keep an eye on that, so not really a benefit for the year. In cabinets, plywood distribution and logistics they remain elevated, but I would say they\u2019ve moderated a bit. So while some inputs have moderated, others remain elevated and increasing on a year-over-year basis. So we're really not anticipating much of a net benefit or tailwind from deflation in 2019.","Susan Maklari","Okay, and then within the Plumbing segment you noted that there was some impact from a negative mixed shift and that\u2019s actually an area of the business where we\u2019ve been seeing more of a positive mix come through over the last few quarters. Can you just talk to that shift and I guess how have you seen things as we\u2019ve exited the quarter with the demand improving?","Keith Allman","Yes, I think the large driver for sure over the mixed shift was the inventory rebalancing at one of our wholesale customers. So when that happens and we have an influx, if you will, of wholesale orders, excuse me, when the wholesale orders reduce, then that as a mix makes the retail orders a greater percentage and wholesale tends to be a better mix for us. So that\u2019s a real driver for us, so we see that improving as we go forward.","Susan Maklari","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Dahl with RBC Capital Markets. Mike, your line is open.","Michael Dahl","Hi, thanks for taking my questions. Keith and John, just a follow up on Decorative, if I look at the kind of implied sales progression to get to the lower end of the range for the full-year particularly given Kichler is a bit weak it implies that the core Paint business ramps up to, back up to more mid-single digit growth potentially a bit better. So I just wanted to ask kind of, is that the level of rebound that you've seen already occur into April or is there more wood to chop in terms of getting that acceleration and anything specific in terms of programs we should be thinking about there?","Keith Allman","I think, I\u2019d say it\u2019s a little bit of a combination, but you\u2019ve got the numbers down, you\u2019re right on how we're thinking about it.","Michael Dahl","Okay, I guess as my followup, in terms of the split between pro-and DIY it seems obviously DIY may be more impacted by the inventory issue, but just any color you can give us on expected relative growth rates for pro and DIY implied by your full year guidance?","Keith Allman","Well, I think, you know we\u2019re expecting the DIY market to be flattish, maybe even just slightly down in 2019 and that\u2019s the majority of our sales. There is a little bit of, as we talked about softer market conditions that we\u2019re experiencing, that will have an impact on the full-year. The inventory rebalancing certainly is a piece of that. We continue to be bullish on our DIY - excuse me, on our pro business. We're continuing to invest in that. And we talked about the accelerated investments that we have in this quarter and the fact that we're not going to really anniversary our incremental investments in '18 until the third quarter. So we continue to think that that growth will be\u2026","John Sznewajs","Yes, the pro, side, yes it should be kind of high single digits is kind of the way we're viewing it here in 2019 Mike, and yes and kind of low single digits for the DIY side of the business.","Michael Dahl","Great, that's helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Stephen East with Wells Fargo. Stephen, your line is open.","Truman Patterson","Hi, good morning guys, this is actually Truman Patterson on for Stephen. I just wanted to touch on the architectural paint side of the business. A couple of your competitors produced up first quarter revenues which might imply a little bit of at least near term share loss at Behr. I guess do you guys think of this as actually happening and if not, could you guys just elaborate a little bit on it?","Keith Allman","I think you have to pull out the pull forward when you do that. I think we're hanging right in there to holding our share to maybe gain a little bit.","John Sznewajs","And the inventory balancing that was affecting the paint business as well in the first quarter is Truman, if you can take a look at those two factors, we don't think we're looking, we're losing any share.","Truman Patterson","Okay. Thanks guys. And then\u2026","John Sznewajs","And then, I would tell you Truman, sell-through is probably better than selling in the quarter.","Truman Patterson","Okay, and no skew offs or anything within the retailer?","John Sznewajs","No.","Truman Patterson","Okay. Also on the Decorative Architectural side, margins declined and missed your guidance by a little bit. Was this more driven by paint decrementals from the weak volumes or from Kichler and the tariff impact on the margins?","John Sznewajs","I'd say it had to do more with the volumes, lower volumes on the paint side of the business, and as well as, this is our first quarter of Kichler, the full quarter of Kichler and it's a seasonally weaker quarter for them, so that was a pretty significant impact on lower margins here in Q1 as well.","Keith Allman","Also we had incremental investment for the pro, so that's a factor. So, I think if you look at, I won't specifically quantify, but I think the volume was the main driver simply - certainly a full quarter of Kichler and the fact that this is a lower quarter for Kichler, and then incremental investments, D&A was up a little bit with the full-year acquisition, amortization. But, I think those first three are the main drivers.","Truman Patterson","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Keith Hughes with SunTrust. Keith, your line is open.","Keith Hughes","Thank you. I guess two questions, one on the inventory rebalancing, do you feel like here in April that that's completed for both Plumbing and Paint?","Keith Allman","I think so, yes.","Keith Hughes","Okay and then second question within Paint, is the DIY market for you as affected, actually is the pro-market for you is affected by weather as we see on some of the other competitors as sort of the pro?","Keith Allman","I think it's, you know, I don't want to talk about our competitors, but I think it's pretty similar. Our pro-volume tends to be skewed a little bit more towards exterior and so that would be affected by the weather.","Keith Hughes","Okay, thank you.","John Sznewajs","I'd say it is about the same.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Zener with KeyBanc. Ken, your line is open.","Kenneth Zener","Good morning, gentlemen.","Keith Allman","Good morning.","John Sznewajs","Good morning.","Kenneth Zener","John, could you talk about the earnings weighting in the first half of the year versus the second half, just to give us kind of a sense of how much momentum we could expect compared to prior years?","John Sznewajs","Sure, Ken. I mean as we said on our fourth quarter call, we thought the first quarter is going be a little bit softer, partially due to the sales pull forward that we called out on the earnings call and partially due to that - we knew the first quarter of Kichler is a seasonally weaker quarter. So, we kind of had expected that going into the beginning of the year.","Keith mentioned a couple of things that were unanticipated. That said, as we see the progression for the next three quarters, I'd say, it's going to be just a steady progression from here. I think the second quarter we had you will recall, we had some good strength in a couple of our businesses, partially due to the fact that we launched the Menards program really in earnest in Q2 of last year. So, we saw some good growth in that business.","So, I think it would be a steady ramp from here with arguably the second half being better than the first half of the year is the way we're seeing things play out here. If you can take a look at the comps that we have against 2018, I think they are just probably a good indicator of how you should see the balance of the year play out. So, that's kind of the way we're thinking about it now Ken.","Kenneth Zener","Thank you. And if you could comment on the, I know it's small, but the U.K. window business? Thank you very much.","John Sznewajs","Sure. As you might expect, the U.K. window business apparently is relatively small and no surprise that there is and there's pockets of weakness and softness over in the U.K. in advance of Brexit. But we are seeing there is that new home construction over there, which we play a little bit in was up very low single digits. But the remodeling market was down fairly significantly, call it mid single digits in Q1, and so that really impacted our business, there pretty significantly.","No surprise, but as Keith mentioned, the progress we're making on evaluating this business is continuing and we look forward to talking to everyone and making everyone aware once our decision is complete.","Kenneth Zener","Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Phil Ng with Jefferies. Phil, your line is open.","Philip Ng","Hey guys, post your strategic decision on windows and cabinets, certainly you'll be a more focused company. What type of impact do you anticipate it would have with negotiations with your customers and suppliers, given your reduced scales and any potential synergies, we should be thinking of?","Keith Allman","Our strength or our important to our customers is really driven by what we bring with brand service and innovation primarily across that core part of our business in Paint and Plumbing. So we don't anticipate any significant change in our customer relationships across our Paint, Plumbing, hardware businesses, should we choose to go a divestiture out with these businesses. I think there our relationship as I said is driven by the things we do well, and it's something that we earn. It's not, we don't anticipate any degradation of that based on a potential sale.","Philip Ng","Okay. That's really helpful color. And then on Plumbing, it was a little weaker, you obviously had some noise with pull forward but with new constructions still pretty soft too start of the year from a starts perspective and potentially impacting your rough plumbing business, will that be a potentially bigger drag in 2Q or you've seen enough in terms of orders and trends where you feel pretty good that orders, I mean volumes in that plumbing business will kind of bounce back in that mid single digit range? Thanks.","Keith Allman","Yes, we don't anticipate it being a bigger drag going forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Schrier with Citi. Scott, your line is open.","Scott Schrier","Hi, good morning. I wanted to ask if there is any updates to how you're thinking about [indiscernible] and I know you were kind of reevaluating whether or not you're going to look into supply chain changes or anything. So, I know it's kind of a moving target, but any color you can give us on that front would be helpful?","Keith Allman","I think probably the most relevant update is how we're thinking about it in terms of the probability of the 25%. So we, as I mentioned, we came into the year with our base plan, assuming that the 25% was going to go into effect and our assessment now is that it won't. We believe that the 10% will stick, but it's variable. In terms of update of what we've been able to accomplish it is a combination, in some cases of moving product out of China, excuse me, into a different supply chain, in other cases, it's working with our Chinese suppliers and value engineering and cost reduction and some cost sharing.","And what we haven't been able to recover we've been effective in going out and getting price. So I think, the update is, we don't believe that 25%. We don't, think that 25% is going to happen and we do think that 10% is going to stick. We believe that it is extremely variable and we need to be fleet of foot with regards to supply chain cost out and pricing and with the other part of the update would be that, we've been pretty successful from my assessment in doing those strengths, those three things up to this point.","Scott Schrier","Thanks for that. For my followup, I wanted to ask a little bit about the strategic review. If that does go to divestment road and you're talking about well, buyback seems to be the priority for capital allocation or internal investment, but if you were to look in the external opportunities, you talked about your pipeline, how attractive are these opportunities, are seller expectations are multiples elevated, it doesn't make sense when we're arguably later in the cycle. So, just wanted to see how things are looking from the M&A perspective?","Keith Allman","Yes, I think when we think about these strategic alternatives, I think it is good to reset the key drivers of why we're doing this. And I've been in the seat here as CEO for five years and when we came in with the new team, we really, we committed to doing three things, one was driving the full potential of our business through the installation of a common operating system.","Two was to drive leverage across our businesses, of course in supply chain and procurement, but more importantly, from my perspective and processes and people. And then thirdly, to improve our portfolio to make it more R&R focused, less cyclical, higher margin, more dependable, because we felt that was good for the shareholders and would add value.","And we began in earnest right away when I came on board to do that with the spin-off of our services business and that has been very successful for the shareholders. If you look at their market cap now and our total, it's that was good for the shareholders.","We also said with regards to the portfolio that we felt the best avenue for creating shareholder value was to fix our cabinet windows businesses and we've done that. So, this is a natural progression of what we've set out as our strategy to continually improve our portfolio to drive shareholder value as it relates to reduced cyclicality and more repeatability and higher margin.","So, while it's, I know your question was directly related at use of proceeds. I think more fundamentally this strategic and alternative assessment is really focused on creating shareholder value and continuing with the track record that we have of doing that. Now with regards to the attractiveness in our pipeline, we really haven't seen too much of a significant change in valuation and expectations on the surface and that doesn't slow us down.","We continued to cultivate, we continue to work for opportunities and we have a very robust pipeline and some exciting opportunities. But we're going to be patient and we're going to ensure that the targets we're looking at are strategically right for us and that we believe fully that we can earn the return that we expect to earn when we make an investment.","It doesn't feel to me that valuations have as of yet really loosened up. It's the sellers, it's a bit of a slow start in the quarter and they are not particularly interested in selling off of a bad quarter. They want to sell off the momentum. So, it's a volatile period, if you put yourself in the seat of a seller and we really haven't seen that much change in terms of expected valuations.","John Sznewajs","And Scott, maybe just one other piece of information because we get this question quite a bit, much more tactical than Keith's answer is the tax basis of these businesses. And just for everyone's benefit, the tax base of this group, the three businesses collectively is about $300 million. So, I think that helps frame things for people as they think about, if we go to the sale route, the expected net proceeds from those businesses.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Lovallo with Bank of America. John, your line is open.","Unidentified Analyst","Hey guys, it's actually Pete Gabon [ph] for John. Thanks for taking the questions. John, maybe you can just elaborate a little bit on the double-digit growth in Cabinets, new construction that you guys saw in the quarter? I mean, is that mostly just loaded on Menards side or what kind of drove that given the flattish new construction environment in 1Q?","John Sznewajs","Yes, so I think it doesn't necessarily relate to the Menards business because that's not an R&R. It has to do with the fact that you may recall over the course of really 2015 to 2017, we pulled back on our - a lot of our new construction business, because it was less than profitable. So as we saw some growth here in the first quarter, it's really off of a relatively easy comp compared to the first quarter of 2018.","Unidentified Analyst","Got it, okay. And maybe just one more on the strategic review and if you're willing to comment at all. I mean, kind of what level of inbound interest have you guys received since kind of putting these two businesses out there as potential divestiture candidates, anything, you're willing to comment on there?","Keith Allman","Very good. These are attractive businesses that have leading brands in their categories, good strong cash flow. We've done a good job with putting in good teams of leaders in these businesses and we've improved them tremendously, but there's still improvements to go. So these are good businesses, real solid market share, brands, innovation pipelines, et cetera. So we are seeing very healthy interest.","Unidentified Analyst","Got it. Great, thank you, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Adam Baumgarten with Macquarie. Adam, your line is open.","Adam Baumgarten","Hey, thanks guys. Just quickly on Plumbing, you guys mentioned wholesale de-stocking, can you talk about the trends you saw in U.S. retail?","Keith Allman","In terms of de-stocking?","Adam Baumgarten","No, in Plumbing what kind of sales trends you saw in U.S. retail?","Keith Allman","Yes. Our retail business was okay kind of January and February where we were a little soft, but again, similar to the trends we saw in the overall market, we saw some pickup as we went into March and the first part of April. So, it's not inconsistent with what we saw across our broader portfolio of businesses.","Adam Baumgarten","Got it. And then just on cabinets, I mean you haven't changed the guide there even with the kind of strong start to the first quarter. I know that kind of ex-Menards explained, you're kind of implying slightly down volumes. And I think part of that at least last quarter was handicapping for some of the tariffs that were potentially going to come through. Is it safe to assume given your more benign look on tariffs that the kind of underlying ex-Menards, cabinets growth outlook is a little bit better?","John Sznewajs","Yes. I'd say, It might be just slightly better, Adam. I wouldn't say it's materially better than what we were thinking about at the beginning of the year.","Adam Baumgarten","Got it, thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Justin Speer with Zelman & Associates. Justin, your line is open.","Justin Speer","Thank you, guys. I appreciate it. I wanted to take the question back to Kichler and thinking about I just, if you could take us back down memory lane on what - if you could remind us what you were thinking about the opportunity with that business when you bought it versus maybe the reality of what it is today, now that you're expressing this, I guess more negative tone with the impairment, the weakness in the underlying markets, but I want to understand what the right annualized revenue and margin profile for that business is now going forward now that you have it in your hands for over a year?","Keith Allman","The underlying thesis, when we looked at it and we ultimately ended up acquiring it was that it was a large market with fragmented competition that it demonstrated growth at or slightly above the base R&R market and it demonstrated an ability to get price commensurate with commodities.","So what we saw in this business was an opportunity to apply some of our operating system techniques to take cost out, that if we could go in and apply and work with them as it relates to demand generation through influencer advocacy and that we could learn from them on how to more quickly identify consumer trends.","There's also an opportunity that we saw and we are taking advantage of is it relates to supply chain and new product development processes to shorten that cycle. So, as we get in here and look that those fundamental underlying premises and as we know the business better have not changed.","What's changed and what we didn't anticipate was tariffs and this business is for the most part procured in China and so there is issues associated with the pricing and elasticity that we're working to better understand, but fundamentally, what we've learned about their presence in the market, their presence in the channels and how they're appreciated with the distribution is unchanged. And we're going to continue to drive and we still feel good about.","John Sznewajs","Yes Justin, I want to make certain, we've got greater clarity for everyone on is the sensitivity of that trade name calculation to two small movements in topline and I'll get into some granularity here, but because it is - the trade name is based off of the projected revenue of the business, so when you value assets well during purchase price allocations, you don\u2019t have a lot of room to move particularly on the trade name before you may be in an impaired situation, and so slight movements in topline projections can put you in such a position. So I don't want you to walk away from the conversation that we are particularly troubled by what's taken place Kichler, it's just the very sensitive nature of the calculation that's caused this impairment.","Justin Speer","Oh I guess followup on that, number one, was there any lost market share associated with this because it was my understanding that most of your competitors were also kind of similarly sourced or at least the supply chains were similarly arranged? And then secondly, with tariff potentially the prospect of that coming off does that potentially just flip the scripts back to what you're originally thinking or is there something maybe larger underneath or may just lost share or something that took place or maybe more difficult to get back even with tariffs that this is being removed?","John Sznewajs","Yes, so we don\u2019t \u2013 at this point it is difficult to tell whether we lost share, we don\u2019t think we've lost any share, but we're still, when you are up against a bunch of private competitors always topped in terms of share positions on the short term basis. And so, but at this stage we don\u2019t think we've lost any meaningful share any place. So we \u2013 that does not impact anything. In terms of the tariffs coming off of it, does that change our thinking longer term, yes, it could. We've got to see that come through, but in terms of what we've done, we had to go with kind of the facts and circumstances as we know them today.","Justin Speer","Thank you.","Operator","And gentlemen your final question comes from the line of Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research. Eric, your line is open.","Eric Bosshard","Good morning. Just a followup on Kichler, I understand the disruption over the tariffs and the weather, but in terms of the ultimate destination with this business, the targets that you bought it in terms of your market share and the margin opportunity, do you feel different now than you do did a year ago when you bought the business?","Keith Allman","No, we don\u2019t. We think that this business is going to grow at or slightly above the overall repair and remodel market and we're driving towards continued margin improvement. We're over performing our plan and we're doing better than I expected as it relates to some of the cost outs that we're driving. So as John mentioned with the accounting calculations for trade name it's hypersensitive to revenue. But there wasn't a goodwill write-down that we took here or write-downs associated with the cash flow, so that's more of the issue.","Eric Bosshard","Okay, that's helpful, thank you.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call.

As a reminder, today\u2019s conference call is being recorded for replay purposes. [Operator Instructions]","I will now turn the call over to David Chaika, Vice President, Treasurer, and Investor Relations. You may begin.","David Chaika","Thank you, Amy, and good morning. Welcome to Masco Corporation\u2019s 2017 third quarter conference call. With me today are Keith Allman, President and CEO of Masco; and John Sznewajs, Masco\u2019s Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Our third quarter earnings release and the presentation slides that we will refer to today are available on our website under Investor Relations. Following our remarks, we will open the call for analysts\u2019 questions. Please limit yourself to one question with one follow up. If we can\u2019t take your question now, please call me directly at 313-792-5500.","Our statements today will include our views about our future performance, which constitute forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. We described these risks and uncertainties in our Risk Factors and Other Disclosures in our Form 10-K and our Form 10-Q that we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","Our statements will also include non-GAAP financial measures. Our references to operating profit and earnings per share will be as adjusted, unless otherwise noted. We reconciled these adjusted measurements to GAAP in our earnings release and presentation slides, which are available on our website under Investor Relations.","With that, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Keith Allman.","Keith Allman","Thank you, Dave. And good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. You\u2019ll have to excuse my voice, I am suffering from a classic Midwestern head cold here where OUR temperatures have been between 40 and 80 degrees depending on the day.","Please turn to Slide 4. In the third quarter we continue to invest in our business, while driving profitable growth. Our top line increased 2%, excluding the favorable impact of currency, driven by solid growth in our Plumbing and Decorative Architectural segments.","Excluding the divestiture of Arrow Fastener, our top line grew 4% or 3% in local currency. Our operating margin increased 60 basis points to 15.3% largely driven by the quick turnaround in our North American Window business.","Earnings per share grew 22% to $0.50 per common share, demonstrating once again Masco's ability to convert solid sales growth into even better earnings per share growth through operating leverage, cost improvements and disciplined capital allocation.","As you all know, there were significant natural disasters that impacted North America during the quarter, particularly in Houston, areas throughout the state of Florida and Puerto Rico.","As a result, we were negatively impacted in the quarter as consumer\u2019s, customers and builders alike focused on preparing for and cleaning up after these storms and not on building new homes or re-modeling their existing homes.","Our thoughts go out to all those impacted and we expect that there will be some ongoing challenges in these areas. But rebuilding efforts should be a net positive for our business in 2018.","I'd also like to thank our suppliers, particularly those who support our coatings business for all their efforts to keep us supplied, which in turn enabled us to serve our customers during these difficult events. Despite these challenges, we achieved our 24th consecutive quarter of sales and operating profit growth.","Let me give you some additional insights into the drivers behind each of our segments performance. Beginning with Plumbing. In North America our trade business continued to be strong, as we gain share with our high end showroom products and saw a strong growth in eCommerce sales across both pure-play online retailers and our omni channel partners.","I'm also proud to say that for the third year in a row Delta Faucet Company was awarded the U.S. EPA's WaterSense Sustained Excellence Award, the highest partner recognition for continued outstanding efforts to help advance the WaterSense program and water efficiency. Congratulations to the entire Delta team for its focus on developing innovative kitchen and bath solutions to help conserve water without sacrificing performance.","Internationally, Hansgrohe drove significant growth in its focused markets and saw strength in its primary market of Germany, as well as the rest of Central Europe and China.","In our Decorative Architectural segment, our paint business continues to perform well. Our Pro Paint sales grew at a double-digit pace and we believe we are positioned to outperform the DIY market with our powerful BEHR brand, its outstanding product quality and service ratings and our strong channel partner, the Home Depot. Additionally, we achieved strong sales growth in our Liberty Hardware business from our innovative shower door program and from our eCommerce business.","In our Cabinetry segment, our KraftMaid brand drove double-digit growth across its retail and dealer channels, with its strong brand recognition and our continued focus on our growth initiatives.","Our new KraftMaid product launch consisting of on trend finishes and innovative products that enhance the functionality of consumer\u2019s kitchens and baths will continue this momentum. Offsetting the strong growth was weakness in our UK cabinet operation and softness with our US builder customers some of which was due to the impact of the hurricanes, which delayed deliveries and installation schedules.","In our Windows segment sales grew 9% excluding the divestiture of Arrow Fastener. Profits increased $33 million, driven by the absence of last year's warranty adjustment, as well as Milgard strong brand, pricing power and other operational improvements.","I'm very pleased with this rapid turnaround and as I shared with you previously, I remain confident that we will achieve mid single digit operating margins for the full year in this segment, a substantial improvement over 2016.","We also continued our share repurchase activity in the quarter by buying back 4 million shares and returning approximately $210 million in share buybacks and dividends to our shareholders.","Lastly, on our prior earnings call we updated our 2017 target for earnings per share to be in the range of a $1.93 to $2. Based on our results through the third quarter and the impact of the hurricanes on our business in the second half of the year, and the good start we're seeing in October, we now expect our 2017 earnings per share to be in the range of in $1. 93 to $1.97.","Now, I'd like to turn the call over to John, who will go over our operational and financial performance in more detail. John?","John Sznewajs","Thank you, Keith and good morning, everyone. As Dave mentioned most of my comments will focus on adjusted performance, excluding the impact of rationalization and other one-time items.","Turning the Slide 6, our performance resulted in solid growth in both our top and bottom line. The third quarter of 2017 was our 24th consecutive quarter of year-over-year sales and operating profit growth.","On a reported basis sales increased 3% or 2% in local currency and when accounting for the Arrow divestiture, sales increase 4% or 3% in local currency. Foreign currency translation favorably impacted on third quarter revenues by approximately $15 million, as the euro strengthened against the US dollar.","North American sales increase 2% or 3% x-Arrow due to the demand for our repair and remodeling products across all channels of distribution and across the price continuum, as we continued to experience strong consumer demand for our better and best product offerings, particularly our KraftMaid, Milgard and Delta a higher and showroom product.","As Keith mentioned, our Q3 results were adversely impacted by the devastating hurricanes in Texas, Florida in Puerto Rico. We estimate the revenue impact of these storms for the full year will be approximately $20 million, approximately $15 million in the third quarter split nearly evenly between the Plumbing, Decorative Architectural and Cabinetry segments and a $5 million in the fourth quarter that we expect will largely impact the Cabinetry segment.","International sales increased 4% in local currency, as each of our international Plumbing businesses continue to drive growth. Gross margins expanded approximately 70 basis points compared to the third quarter of last year to 33.6%, largely due to the improvement of our North American Windows business.","Our SG&A as a percent of sales matched prior year at 18.3% as we continue to leverage our volume, while making strategic investments to drive profitable growth. We delivered solid bottom line performance, as operating income increased 8% to $296 million with the operating margins expanding 60 basis points to 15.3%. And our EPS $0.50 in the quarter, an improvement of 22% compared to the third quarter of 2016.","Turning to Slide 7, our Plumbing segment continues to deliver strong results. Segment sales increased 6% and excluding the impact of currency increased 4%. This solid performance was driven by growth in our faucet, shower and spa businesses.","Foreign currency transition favorably impacted this segment sales by approximately $13 million in the quarter. Our North American sales grew 4% in the third quarter, as we experienced strong consumer driven demand from industry leading brands, with wholesale, large retail and dealer customers. Our international Plumbing sales increased 6% in local currency.","Hansgrohe continues to benefit from investments in brand, design and innovation. These investments, along with their focus on growing in key markets is yielding results and they experience strong double-digit growth in both Germany and China.","Operating profit for the segment decreased 2% in the quarter, as the strong drop through on incremental volume was more than offset by approximately $10 million of increased strategic growth investments in other variable expenses.","Turning to Slide 8, the Decorative Architectural product segment grew 3%. This performance was driven by another quarter of strong double-digit growth of our BEHR PRO initiative. We believe this segment will be the quickest to recover from the hurricanes as we are experiencing strong orders for our primers and interior paint in the affected areas.","Liberty Hardware also contributed to topline performance, as it continues to benefit from the expansion and growth in it - of its innovative shower door program and in the eCommerce channel.","As we mentioned in our second quarter call, Liberty continues to win new retail programs. It was awarded an expanded cabinet hardware program. This program was originally planned to set in the third quarter and now will be set in the fourth quarter. We anticipate spending approximately $8 million in reset costs in the fourth quarter on this program.","In the segment operating income in the third quarter decreased $7 million, driven by an unfavorable price-to-commodity relationship as we discussed last quarter. We believe that the third quarter experienced the greatest impact of increased input cost and we expect this relationship to improve as we go into the fourth quarter.","Turning to Slide 9. In the Cabinetry segment sales declined 4%. This is principally due to additional loss builder business in both the United States and in the UK. Our repair remodel business continues to perform well in the quarter. KraftMaid had solid performance in the home center and dealer channels, delivering double-digit growth through increased volume.","Segment profitability declined in the third quarter by $1 million, driven by reduced volume and the incremental cost of approximately $6 million. And we mentioned at our second quarter call, related to the anti-dumping duties and countervailing tariffs on imported Chinese plywood and the new KraftMaid product launches, we have mitigated the impact of these duties through supply chain and other initiatives, do not anticipate them to have a material impact going forward.","Turning to Slide 10. Our Windows segment sales matched the third quarter of 2016, excluding the divestiture of ARROW Fasteners sales grew 9%. This strong performance was driven by growth in Milgard, our leading Western U.S. Window business which grew 12% in the quarter. Milgard's strong growth was due to favorable pricing, increased volume and a favorable mix shift toward our premium window and door products.","Segment profitability in the quarter increased $33 million over the prior year, driven by the lapping of last year\u2019s warranty expense, favorable pricing and cost savings initiatives. We are extremely pleased with the rapid progress that the team has made on Milgard's turnaround and an improved result delivered in 2017.","As a reminder, our fourth quarter sales and operating profit will be impacted by approximately $18 million and $5 million respectively, due to our sale of Arrow Fastener and as we mentioned on last quarter's earnings call, we expect to receive topline growth and mid-single digit margins in the segment the full year despite the sale of Arrow.","And turning to Slide 11, ended the quarter with approximately $1.2 billion of balance sheet liquidity. Working capital as a percent of sales increased 140 basis points versus prior year to 14.3% principally due to higher inventory to support our growth in new program wins. We believe we will have this inventory work down to a more normalized level by the end of the year.","And during the third quarter, we continued our focus on shareholder value creation and repurchasing approximately 4 million shares valued at approximately $178 million.","And with that, I'll turn \u2013 now turn the call back over to Keith.","Keith Allman","Thank you, John. I am pleased with the third quarter results, and with the progress we have made driving our growth initiatives that we outlined in May. We continue to invest in our Plumbing business and enjoy strong global growth as a result.","In our Architectural - Decorative Architectural business we continue to extend our DIY paint leadership and gain share in the PRO market, while leveraging our Liberty Hardware business.","In our Cabinet business, we are pleased with the progress of our KraftMaid dealer initiatives and our new product introductions both of which will drive profitable growth.","And finally, our turnaround with the Windows business has been exceptional. The fundamentals driving our business are strong, demographics, namely the large millennial group are increasingly favorable and should drive household formation and housing for years to come.","Home prices are appreciating, up over 5% year-over-year, boosting consumer\u2019s confidence to invest in their home. Housing turnover, a leading indicator for our business is at a healthy annualized pace of 5.4 million units. And US residential housing stock is aging, a key driver of repair and remodel spending with 70% of homes in US now over 25 years old, an increase of more than 19 million units in the past 10 years.","We remain committed to investing behind our brands for growth, developing innovative products to ensure we maintain our must have position with our customers. Focusing on operational excellence through our continued deployment of the Masco operating system and finally balancing our capital allocation between acquisitions with the right strategic fit and earns share buybacks and dividends.","Our operational execution, coupled with our strong balance sheet and liquidity position provides us with multiple levers to continue to drive shareholder value and outperform the industry.","Nearly three years ago, we committed to doubling earnings per share from $0.88 in 2014 to a $1.80 in 2017. I'm proud of our team and the fact that we will exceed this target. Looking forward, we are committed to achieving our 2019 earnings per share target of $2.50 that we set at our Investor Day in May.","With that, I'll open up the call for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Susan Maklari with Credit Suisse. Susan, your line is open.","Chris Counihan","Hi. This is Chris Counihan on for Susan. I was just hoping you could provide some additional color on some of the margin pressure you're seeing in that Paint and Plumbing's segment. How much of that was input cost driven versus price mix?","John Sznewajs","Yes. So Stephen we did see some commodity inflation, Chris I should say, I'm sorry. We should see some commodity inflation - we did see some comedy inflation in both those segments in the quarter and to do [ph] we share that on our second quarter call.","That said, there were also some incremental expenses that we incurred in our Plumbing segment, you know, some strategic growth initiatives. One of the things that - I think some of the things that are included in that, one, we had a little bit of a shop inefficiency. We had a new distribution center go live in Germany for our Hansgrohe unit and that caused us a little bit of headwind in the quarter. We do expect that that should be short lived and were pretty much through that right now.","At the same time you know, some of the strategic investments that we incurred, some incremental display in advertising cost as we are now nationally resetting our displays in our dealer customers across the United States and we probably - you know, we - what we decided to do was pull forward some of that expense, we were going in a fairly modest clip and given the strength of the plumbing unit it has been seeing we thought we would accelerate some of that spend.","So you'll see some of that hit in the third quarter and you\u2019ll also see some of that hit in the fourth quarter. I'd say probably $5 million of incremental spend related to that display set - those displays being set in the third quarter maybe 5 to 10 in the fourth quarter as well. So as we accelerate some of that spend.","On the paint side you know, we did see some raw material inflation and as I indicated in my prepared remarks, we do think that we were most impacted by the price commodity relationship in the third quarter and going forward that should ease a little bit going into the fourth quarter and beyond.","Chris Counihan","Got it. Thanks. And then my second question is on cabinets, I know you said there would be additional spill over into 4Q, you know it was - it would be isolated to the cabinet segment. I was wondering if you provide some color on you know, why that segment is experiencing that spill over and not the rest?","John Sznewajs","Yeah. So the reason they became its \u2013 the Cabinets segment is experiencing spill over from the hurricane impact is, if you think about the way the projects work, the cabinets are one of the last things to get set when home is really - you know, is been damaged and it gets rebuilt. So they have to go through flooring, electrical plumbing, drywall paint and all that other before people set their cabinets.","And so there is going to be a little bit of headwind in cabinetry going into Q4. But as we go into 2018 we do expect that we should see some tailwinds broadly across all of our product categories, as a result of the rebuilding efforts in Texas and in Florida.","Chris Counihan","Thank you. It\u2019s very helpful.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Michael Wood from Nomura Instinet. Michael, your line is open.","Michael Wood","Hi, good morning. First, just on the paint price cost you know, paint traditionally very disciplined end market, although demand there also tends to be relatively less cyclical because of the maintenance piece.","Do you think there's any change or could there be any change in discipline in that industry just given you know, the ongoing softness that you're seeing in the DIY gallon growth. And if you could provide that that growth would be helpful?","John Sznewajs","Good morning, Mike. It\u2019s John. Yeah, so in terms of what we saw on DIY gallon go to it was down just modestly, as we indicated our Pro business was up double-digits. You know, in terms of your first question around pricing discipline within the industry you know, we don't expect any change in that dynamic going forward. You know I - everyone - I can't speak for everyone else, but just given how we look at our \u2013 and serving our major customer we're very focused on supporting their strategy of both serving the DIY consumer with the best experience, the best quality of paint and the best service in the industry, as well as really growing our share with the Pro. So we see no change in that dynamic whatsoever.","Michael Wood","Okay. Great. And thanks for the color on the plumbing strategic spend. Can you also give us some details on the decorative hardware set up what delayed that from third quarter in the fourth quarter? Thank you.","John Sznewajs","Yes. So we're going to start that program with one of the large retailers and as expect you know, we were largely expect to set that in September and with the storms impacting you know, a big part of the country, they just elected to delay that a couple of weeks, so nothing significant there.","Michael Wood","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Mike Dahl with Barclays. Mike, your line is open.","Mike Dahl","Thanks for taking my questions. John just a follow up on the detail around the plumbing spend in particular on the display resets. Could you just give us a little more detail on how that was originally set to play out over what time period?","And I guess thinking forward into 2018 then should we expect incremental cost to continue or is this kind of pulling in $10 million or so into \u201817 that would have otherwise been in \u201918?","Keith Allman","Mike, we did post some expense, I think it will be a multi-quarter impact. So you know, so we are pulling some expense out of early \u201918 and into \u201817 for both Q3 and Q4. But we will continue to have some of those resets going into 2018 as well. So we do expect the impact can be a little bit more modest in 2018 than it was in the back half of 2017.","John Sznewajs","The reason we're accelerating this investment Mike is because it's working for us, I don't know if you've had a chance to get out to the market and see some of our dealers and our showrooms, but fundamentally these are the best displays that are out there.","We're displaying our showering program more - more strongly. We've gained additional, I think its two to three linear feet in these displays as we lay them out and our customers in the showrooms are seeing good return on those investments.","So that's the reason why we're so bullish on this investment because the initial sets are performing so well.","Mike Dahl","Okay, great. That's helpful. And my second question is going back to the paint side and the commentary around how 3Q should really be the peak of the pressures, I guess just given the given the inflation that you're seeing in some of the raws there. Can you give us more detail on kind of what related to your pricing strategy or areas of cost reduction specifically are giving you the confidence that you know you'll recoup some of these margin headwinds as we get through the next several months?","Keith Allman","Mike, this is Keith. As you know, given the concentration with one customer we don't go into specifics on price. We work in terms of cost avoidance. We work hand in glove with our suppliers, those same suppliers that really help us out during the hurricanes. We have great relationships with them. They help us win and we help them win.","So together it's a good team. So we're constantly looking at value in the can and we're by demonstrated performance have really walked a nice line there and keeping the quality in the can, while trying to be as competitive as we can and giving the consumer what they need.","In terms of price commodity, you know, over time the prices ebb and flow and we tend to get commodities, get price rather and get price commensurate with that flow. There's always some lag, particularly when commodities accelerate really quickly. There'll be more of a pronounced lag.","But over time we tend to remain flush with regards to price commodity and that's what we expect going forward.","Mike Dahl","All right. Thanks, Keith. Good luck in 4Q.","Keith Allman","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Keith Hughes with SunTrust. Keith, your line is open.","Keith Hughes","Thank you. First question back to the Decorative Architectural products, in the fourth quarter \u201916 there is a pretty heavily promotional spend, is about $15 million, will that reoccur in the fourth quarter of \u201917?","Keith Allman","At this point, Keith we're expecting a little bit of promotional activity, but probably will not be as intense as it was in the fourth quarter of 2016.","Keith Hughes","Given that will that allow margins to rise in that segment with \u2013 as you talk about contemplated with the price\/cost pressures?","Keith Allman","Yeah. So you know, I think Keith there are a couple of things to keep in mind there, right. One is that seasonally we slow down into the fourth quarter and obviously you know\u2026","Keith Hughes","Given the\u2026","Keith Allman","I am sorry\u2026","Keith Hughes","I am referring to\u2026","Keith Allman","Got you. So you know, as I think about it you know, we all have a little bit of headwind only because the $8 million spend that we called out for the Liberty reset. So you know make sure you factor that into your calculation.","But you know, in terms of the margins other than that, I think, I'm just trying to think of where we were in the fourth quarter of 2016, margins will be slightly up I think from that point.","Keith Hughes","Thank you.","John Sznewajs","Keith, if it helps in paint, we really haven't changed our outlook from last quarter where we talked about for the full year mid-single digit growth and modest margin erosion.","Keith Hughes","Okay. And just one other quick one within the cabinet weakness you saw in the US builder business, is that fire related or hurricane or are we still in the process of getting out of some builder business that is just really not where you want to be?","Keith Allman","Well, clearly the hurricane was a big piece of it. When you look at our builder direct concentration in branches that where we have them, we have them in Denver, Texas and Florida. So two thirds of our footprint was pretty well devastated. So that was a significant piece of it, but it wasn't all of it.","We're continuing to drive price into that builder channel. We want to have this build and we will have this segment profitable for us and when we do that we don't always win those re-bids when we go back with price and there was a little bit of that.","We had a little bit of builder consolidation that created some headwind for us and we'll create a little bit of headwind going forward for the next couple of quarters. But fundamentally it was a combination of the pricing actions that we've taken a little bit of hit from the builder consolidation and the hurricane.","Keith Hughes","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Lovallo with Bank of America. John, your line is open.","John Lovallo","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. The first question I guess is that your largest partner has initiated an advertising campaigns supporting competitors you know, Pro coatings product. Can you maybe - just give us an update on your thoughts on that and how you see that going forward?","Keith Allman","I'll tell you, John we haven't really lost any shelf space with our Behr products. Our relationship with Depot is very strong and we're joined at the proverbial hip with both DIY and Pro market share initiatives that we have.","It's a great position to be in when we have the best brand in terms of where the best quality is verified by third party folks, the best service verified the same way and the most compelling proposition on the shelf in terms of how we commercialize it. And we have all these great stories that are out there.","So we've had obviously Depot offers many brands process across \u2013 as product categories they want consumers to have the choice and we're confident in our product offering and we expect to continue to win.","John Sznewajs","I'd also say John that you know, you know they are equally advertising our product as well in the marketplace, it\u2019s not just solely. So there's a great partnership on the advertising side with Home Depot on that front as well.","John Lovallo","Okay. Thanks, guys. And then it seems like some of the industry data for cabinet has been a little bit softer than we expected at least. Is there any reason in your view why it's sort of underperforming the overall R&R business?","Keith Allman","Yeah. John, I think there is a couple of things that we can point to, on that front, you're right the data has been a little bit choppy and a little bit soft. You know, what we are seeing, I think are two things. One, we're seeing not that we participate in this part of the category, but the very high end, the custom part of the market we are definitely seeing softness or at least the data suggests that there was softness in the very high end of the market. So I think that's one component of it.","I think the second component of it may just be instillation labor - that while we're seeing good demand across our dealer customers and in the retail channel for our KraftMaid products you know, we are hearing pockets of the country where demand is strong enough where your product is simply delayed because you can\u2019t get the installation labor to install the products.","John Lovallo","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line Nishu Sood with Deutsche Bank. Nishu, your line is open.","Nishu Sood","Thank you. Going back to the hurricane impact, a lot of investors are looking past the you know kind of current weakness and anticipating, you know, the positive tailwind you might get from rebuilding which you mentioned.","Houston seems to be pretty well along you know kind of rebounding, recovering from the immediate impact. On the ground, how is that showing up for you folks. Are there any early indications that you're seeing. You know, what kind of impact you know, the tailwind you might see from the rebuilding efforts there?","Keith Allman","Yeah, you're right. We're seeing the same effect. We do see Houston recovering a little bit faster than the Florida markets at this point. We principally think that\u2019s due to the nature of the weather where it was localized flooding versus kind of widespread in both rain and wind damage in the state of Florida.","So early indications what are we seeing, right, so we are starting to see in particular strong orders for our paint and primer products, which is what we would expect following the storm and we've seen that after other natural disasters as people look to repaint their home, they need to prime it with our Kilz primers.","So you know, that's a - you know that's the first sign and so this is going just as expected as we've experienced following other hurricane activity. Following that should be orders for faucets and cabinets should be the last to be impacted. And as I mentioned earlier that really we don't think will be felt until 2018.","Nishu Sood","Got it. Got it. Okay. Yeah, I guess that's reflected in how you laid out the expected sales breakdown for 4Q as well. Second question, I wanted to go back to the price commodity in paint.","You know, obviously you're not talking specifically price responses, but thinking about the inflection in the price commodity, you know with the disruption to the petro chem sector you know input costs, the max kind of input cost impact for Pro Paint is probably going to be in 4Q.","So how should we think about that? I mean, I would have expected that you know, that would have delayed the inflection in price commodities. But it sounds like you're saying even in spite of any potential hurricane related increase in input cost you're still going to be able to see the inflection in 4Q. How do I reconcile that?","Keith Allman","Yeah. I mean, I think quite simply you know we do think that the hurricane impact and there are some very, very minor disruption with transportation and things and like that we will flow to that impact very quickly.","Nishu Sood","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line as Dennis McGill with Zelman & Associates. Dennis, your line is open.","Dennis McGill","Hi, good morning. Thanks, guys. Keith, I guess just big picture on the organic growth side, I think it was 3% in the quarter, would have been 4%, I guess aside from the hurricane impact, that's kind of where the revenue growth is been in the last year and a half or so, how you think about that trend into the fourth quarter, especially what you talked about with October off to a good start, can you start to see that reaccelerate. And any thoughts on the ability to out punch that 3% to 4% range as you get into the early part of next year?","Keith Allman","I think in terms of the full year Dennis maybe it makes sense to go kind of - line by line by our commodities you know, and paying for the segments rather than in paint as we've talked about mid-single digit growth for the full year. We're still - we're still expecting to see that.","In cab's which was hit harder by the hurricanes, as we described and will probably continue to get a little bit of top line hit there in the fourth quarter. We're looking at our top line maybe to be flat to down slightly in cabinets for the full year.","In terms of plumbing, again mid-single digit growth for the full year. We're having strong growth. Our capacity is [Technical Difficulty] seasonal fourth quarter typically slow down for us and we're anticipating that. So for Windows we'd see mid-single digit growth is our expectation and we're confident in that.","In terms of 2018, I'd really - you know, we\u2019re seeing this as an extension of \u201817. We haven't - we still believe in the fundamentals. We're seeing good POS at the cash register for our products, particularly in paint. We're seeing good semi-custom cabinets sales and as I said the resets in our dealer and showrooms and in plumbing is very productive for us.","So we're right on our Investor Day plan for 2019 and we would expect 2018 to be a continuation of the good growth that we've seen.","John Sznewajs","And Dennis, maybe just one point of clarification, specifically in the third quarter, the way we probably look at it as if you take the hurricanes out and the impact of ARROW, we're closer to 5% top line growth.","Keith Allman","Yeah.","John Sznewajs","So just you know, just the way we see it.","Dennis McGill","Okay\u2026","John Sznewajs","Not a huge inflection.","Dennis McGill","I understand. And then John just on the earnings guidance, the implied guidance in the fourth quarter, relatively wide range, but hopefully you can maybe just detail what are the puts and takes that would get you to the higher end of that range versus the lower end or the more sensitive items?","John Sznewajs","Yeah, I mean, I think there's really two things Dennis, that we see, principally one is, is just simply volume and how the fourth quarter shapes up there. I mean, that's the key driver, other than that it would be how we decide to control our expenses or put forward some expenses into the fourth quarter if we choose to do so out of 2018.","Dennis McGill","Thank you, guys. Good luck.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line o Stephen Kim with Evercore ISI. Stephen, your line is open.","Trey Morrish","Hey, guys. It\u2019s actually Trey on for Steve. Thanks for taking our questions. First, could you talk a little bit about how you expect your market share in terms of - at Home Depot Behr Pro. Do you expect that to eventually mirror that to what you have in terms of the DIY product at Home Depot?","Keith Allman","The way we think about our Pro initiative is really to go after about half of the Pro market here in the United States which is a significant market. It's those painters that are involved with resi repaint with maintenance and repair, apartment maintenance those sorts of things. The folks that are already in the Home Depot that's really where our value proposition ring. So we continue with the kind of double-digit growth that we've seen and to attack that specific segment.","Trey Morrish","Got you. And then could you turn back to cabinets. Is there any additional abandonment that happened 3Q from builder business you just walked away from excluding that consolidation that happened? Also was there any incremental promotional activity going on cabinet?","Keith Allman","The promotional activity in cabman's was pretty consistent and we haven't really seen much of a change from where it's been the last couple of quarters. In terms of the builder business there was a concentration on a couple of those builders that were affected with consolidation. A little bit from the price increases that we put into the market and then of course the hurricanes.","Trey Morrish","All right. Thanks. Appreciate it guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Rehaut with JPMorgan. Michael, your line is open.","Neal BasuMullick","Hey, this is Neal BasuMullick for Mike. I guess for someone to ask a bit on the turnaround in Windows. How much do you see as your efforts are sort of ahead of schedule you know, the ERP rollout and Milgard share gains recently?"," I guess you know where are you in the turnaround given the solid performance and you know are there any bottlenecks you pointed out labor or otherwise that you're seeing kind of coming up?","Keith Allman","I would tell you and I did mention it on a prior call that I expected this turnaround to be relatively quick. And the reason for that is because our value proposition is really clear to us and it's clear to our customers in terms of lead times, delivery and fill rates. And we had a line of sight with regards to the improvements that we had planned to get those lead times down into industry leading levels and we've done that and the demand bounced back quite quickly.","By and large this is a business that our dealers bid on a sheet by sheet basis, meaning they get a job and they bid it and then they win or lose and oftentimes the delivery as you might expect, the delivery time is a key driver doing that.","So we expected it to be a relatively quick turnaround, but having said that, I would tell you it's been faster than I expected. So I'm pleased with that. Neal what was your follow up question?","Neal BasuMullick","On\u2026","Keith Allman","On capacity. I apologize and capacity, you know, and then we've talked about the labor market in the northwest and in California being tight. It continues to be tight. I will tell you however that the operational improvements that we've made have really helped out in this regard.","We've talked about what was it just 12% growth in the Milgard - Milgard in the quarter and we have close to record lead times and fill rates during that significant period of growth. I like where we're at in capacity, but as always it's always something we have to work on both in terms of getting folks in the door and then also turnover in those less than 90 days. But the permits we've made go a long way to helping with that.","Neal BasuMullick","Okay. Great, Keith. That\u2019s all from me.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Megan McGrath with MKM Partners. Megan, your line is open.","Megan McGrath","Thanks. Good morning. Maybe a couple of more bigger picture questions or higher level questions. In terms of cabinets, it looks like you know X the hurricanes sales down around 2%. You know, it's your seventh quarter of declining sales year-over-year.","And I understand that you know, being very focused on price and profitability. You know given what you saw in the quarter regarding that and your negotiations like when would you expect this segment to start seeing some flattening out at least in the revenue base as we go forward?","John Sznewajs","You know, we've talked about our long-term view on cabinets to be in that 5% to 7% growth range and the 13% to 15% margin. Certainly we're going to start to get and move in that direction in 2018.","We're focused on the margin improvements particularly in the builder segment and then in the repair and remodeling our new product introductions on both KraftMaid and Merillat are performing well. So we expect to continue to march towards that 5% to 7% growth and 13% to 15% margin that we called out on our Investor Day.","Megan McGrath","Okay. And then in paint, you know, you gave your sort of estimate for gallon growth in the quarter which is down a little bit and at the beginning you talked about you know, the positives we're seeing in terms of repairing model and you know house prices and things like that.","Just generally speaking you know, we've seen kind of lackluster gallon growth for the industry you know for quite some time now. What do you think is driving that given the positives we're seeing in terms of the macro fundamentals?","Keith Allman","Well, I think there is a number of things and there's a lot of people who have talked about this. The demographics I think plays a piece in it where millennials tend to be more of a do it for me rather than do it yourself.","There has been a significant up few years in terms of renters as a percent of household formations versus owners and renters tend to paint less and then the products are getting better when code coverage, you know, a lot a lot more of our colors which requires fewer gallons if you go way back to paint primer and one that's a piece of it.","I will tell you that our belief is that as these millennials start to get into forming families that I think that discretionary money has to make a big difference you know, if you're going to look at the cost to have someone paint your house versus you painting yourself on a weekend, I think that's going to start the scales as we see more formations from the millennials.","So fundamentally when we look at the numbers that we look at to peg the market for DIY paint, we think it's going to start to come back.","John Sznewajs","Megan, and as you look at you know our sales count on a combined basis DIY and Pro. I\u2019ll tell you we were up low single digits in the quarter on a gallon basis. So overall feel pretty good about how we\u2019re performing.","Megan McGrath","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Alex Rygiel with FBR Capital Markets. Alex, your line is open.","Alex Rygiel","Thank you and good morning.","Keith Allman","Morning, Alex.","Alex Rygiel","As it relates to some of the guys - as it relates to some of the guidance they've put out at the Investor Day. That killed some Liberty lines, I think you're looking for $50 million to $80 million revenue opportunity over time, and then the Pro business $152 million to $180 million. Where do you stand generally on those targets tracking ahead, tracking behind and any other comments?","John Sznewajs","You know, Alex, acknowledging that we're only kind of a quarter and a half into a 3 year guidance on those. You know, I think we're definitely on track and clearly one of the things that will help \u2013 that kills every piece was that the expanded camera hardware program that we're setting now. That's definitely a big component to helping us achieve if not exceed \u2013 get to the higher end of the range there.","And then on the Pro side you know, we continue to do - we're very pleased with somewhere we're outperforming on the Pro and you know, I think we're right on track to achieve the Pro growth that we forecasted.","Alex Rygiel","And secondly on the Windows turnaround, are there any actions left to take?","Keith Allman","Well you know, we're only a couple - you know a quarter or so into it. So you know, we're continuing to work. We've gotten a lot of the productivity improvements behind us and we've certainly improved in our on-time complete in our fill rates.","We've got an ERP system that we're continuing to roll out the last couple plants that we put that in have performed very well and we're prepared for that. So there's always more work particularly in continuous improvement to the drive - to keep working.","Alex Rygiel","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Phillip Ng with Jefferies. Phillip, your line is open.","Phillip Ng","Hey, guys. You\u2019ve provided some color on price price\/cost better in paint in the fourth quarter with John am I have missed it. Can you give some color how we should think about price cost in plumbing and fourth quarter and going into 2018?","Keith Allman","Yeah, again, Phil, as we look at it we expect that that relationship should slowly improve over time. You know, as we talked about in the second quarter call we may have got a little price ahead of commodity cost and that's why you saw the expanded margins in Q2 and so we're feeling a little bit more of that in Q3. But as we go into Q - into Q4 into 2018, we will have to look at putting a further price into the marketplace.","Phillip Ng","Okay. That's helpful. And in margins for your Windows business that was pretty impressive. I know historically 2Q and 3Q was your highest margin in quarters and you see some decline in one 1Q and 4Q. Is that a good way to think about building out your margin profile for 2018 which should see a nice step up from that mid-single digit target that you've guided for this year? Thanks.","John Sznewajs","Yeah, I think that's a good way to look at it Phil. You're right on that. You nailed the seasonality perfectly. That's exactly how the business develops over the course of the year. And given the strength that we're seeing as long as the volumes continue to hold out and the strong orders that we\u2019re seeing continue to - you know we would expect that kind of development in 2018.","Phillip Ng","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Adam Baumgarten with Macquarie. Adam, your line is open.","Adam Baumgarten","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Can you just clarify on the plumbing input costs in terms of the metals we've seen copper and zinc up kind of dramatically, what's the lag in terms of when those go up and then when you see them in your results?","John Sznewajs","Yeah, it\u2019s John. You're right, there is generally a lag that we see in our P&L. generally it\u2019s about two quarters roughly speaking because of the length of our Asian supply lines. And so if you track copper and zinc it not a direct one for one, but its pretty close. You can see how that will play out over the course of time.","Adam Baumgarten","Okay, great. And then just lastly any update on acquisitions sort of where you're targeting it, if there's anything in the pipeline that's kind of close?","Keith Allman","Obviously we can't get into specifics, we'll let you know when we do a deal. But in terms of our focus on it in the pipeline status really there hasn't been a change from the last update I gave last quarter and that is that we're continuing to work. We're moving attractive targets both in and out of the pipeline for various reasons we've got good volume. We've got what I believe to be a good spread in terms of value across. If you look at the distribution, the type of companies we're looking at, we're looking globally and we're looking here in North America.","So good activity and we're continuing to stay focused. But at the same time patient. We need to find targets with the fit and the right returns before we act out them and we're continuing to work it.","Adam Baumgarten","Great. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bob Wetenhall with RBC Capital Markets. Bob, your line is open.","Bob Wetenhall","Hey, good morning. Nice quarter, given a hurricane. I wanted to ask you, your Windows business is crushing. I never knew that could be such a profitable business. What's the ceiling on this? Two to three years out where can you drive margins to given the turnaround still underway?","Keith Allman","You know, as you know Bob we talked about 10% to 13% margins on the Investor Day. So that would imply you know, the top at 13%, but you know we're going to keep driving out there. We've got a great leadership team in place, a great brand. Good delivery, good fill rates and fundamentally a strong underlying market. So that 13% is probably not the limit.","Bob Wetenhall","Got it. And when you - I just wanted to think about, you've got a $2 billion of cash on the balance sheet. It sounds like you're being very disciplined around your approach to M&A opportunities. Is barring any large scale or M&A that consumes cash, if we just expect you know, more buybacks and more raise the dividend activity from a capital allocation standpoint?","John Sznewajs","Bob, its John. I think that's the way to think about it right, the way we prioritize our capital allocation as you know, always first and foremost invest in the business you know, to continue the growth of our existing businesses and you know CapEx as you've been watching runs pretty late too 2.5% of sales. And then after that it is rebalancing the M&A activity that keeps us talked about versus share repurchase activity and we were out in the marketplace pretty aggressively in the third quarter of buying back 4 million shares and then you're right you know we have raised the dividend four times over the course of the last four years and while we cannot commit the company we'll continue to look at that type of activity going into 2018.","Bob Wetenhall","Got it. And just the clean up question you know, I was just trying to understand some of your commentary around plumbing in the margin compression in your obviously investing in some strategic growth initiatives. What's kind of a dollar spend in 4Q and when do you finish investing in that business. When do you get back to you know, the dollar spend you put in where does that come out and should we expect it to go into 4Q and to the 2018? Thanks and good luck.","John Sznewajs","Thanks, Bob. I know - we do expect to do on the fourth quarter. We do expect the spend somewhere to be in that $5 million to $10 million range in Q4 and will there be similar activity in 2018 in the plumbing segment, yes there will. We\u2019ll give you a better clarity and guidance on that in our February call when we have our plans all set for 2018. So you kind of spend in 2018 for those - for those displaced.","Bob Wetenhall","Cool. Good luck.","John Sznewajs","Thanks.","Operator","Your last question comes from the line of Truman Patterson with Wells Fargo. Truman, your line is open.","Truman Patterson","Hey, guys. I wanted to dig a little bit deeper into you know, the cab mix - cabinet segment and you know, some of the declining revenues there. Could you guys just give us an update on your capacity utilization levels you know, previously you've stated you can still hit about 1.5 million starts.","And you know, as we're looking into 2018, you know and in the fourth quarter just how do you really think about kind of the trade-off between your capacity utilization level and maybe some of the decremental operating margins that you see from that?","Keith Allman","We think our capacity is in a great place. We have plenty of headroom to get up to that 1.5 million start level and commence - commensurate our growth. We really look at capacity as a cost issue more than anything and when you look at the type of capacity that we have with regards to say operating on two shifts instead of three shifts, that's not a whole lot of extra cost for us.","So in terms of the decremental if you will margin that excess capacity would present. It's really not a big deal for us because we're talking about extending hours of operation across an existing asset that we need to meet our demand for our current demands.","Our capacity is in good shape. That's right where we want it and we're excited about pivoting to growth and getting our KraftMaid, new product introductions working and getting our Merillat and quality brands humming and fundamentally as we talked about at the Investor Day this is a good business for us and we look forward to getting it back up to those performance levels.","Truman Patterson","Okay. Okay, so also you know you guys are looking as you move into 2018 you know you're looking to move towards that 13% to 15% operating margin. Is it safe to assume that you know the promotional environment going forward is going to be you know, fairly steady or maybe even decline a little bit.","And then also those you know product launch costs that you know, were tiny anniversaries as we enter \u201818 will you know, are those going to repeat or are we going to see further headwinds from those?","Keith Allman","You know, again, we don't set the promotional schedule. That's set by our customers and some of those we support others, they go it alone if you will. In terms of my expectations, I would say that I wouldn't expect a whole lot of change in terms of the promotional environment it's been fairly consistent. I have no reason to believe that it won't be something of that ilk going forward. I think it's going to be a pretty step.","Do you have a follow on question Truman?","Truman Patterson","No. that was it. Thanks.","Keith Allman","I\u2019d like to thank everyone for their interest in Masco Corporation. And this concludes today's call.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s conference call.

Welcome to the Masco Corporation's second quarter 2014 earnings conference call. My name is Sean and I will be your conference operator for today's call. As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded for replay purposes. (Operator Instructions).","I will now turn the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Ms. Irene Tasi. Irene, you may begin your call.","Irene Tasi","Thank you, Sean, and good morning to everyone. Welcome to Masco Corporation's second quarter 2014 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Keith Allman, President and CEO of Masco and John Sznewajs, Masco's Vice President, Treasurer and Chief Financial Officer.","Our second quarter earnings release and the presentation slides that we will refer to during the call are available on the Investor Relations portion on our website. Following our prepared remarks, the call will be open for analyst questions. As a reminder, we would appreciate it if you could limit yourself to one question with one follow-up.

These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. We have described these risks and uncertainties in our risk factors and other disclosures in our Form 10-K and Form 10-Q that we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","Today's presentation also includes non-GAAP financial measures. Any references to operating profit, earnings per share or cash flow on today's call will be as adjusted, unless otherwise noted, with a reconciliation of these adjusted measurements to GAAP in our quarterly press release and presentation slides which can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website, masco.com.","With that I will now turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Keith Allman.","Keith Allman","Thank you, Irene, and good morning, everyone, and thanks to all of you for joining us today for Masco's second quarter 2014 earnings call.","Please flip to with slide number four. As I reflect upon the results of the past six months, I am pleased with our team's execution. Despite tougher end-markets, our revenue has increased 5% and our profit margin has improved by 100 basis points, year-to-date. The 31% incremental margin we have experienced in the first half of the year is a testament to the effectiveness of our strategies, our team's execution and our portfolio's strong operating leverage.","In the second quarter of 2014, we continued to grow our business and enhance our profitability. We increased sales 5% and with solid execution expanded our operating margins by 140 basis points to 11%. This performance was primarily driven by our plumbing, decorative architectural and installation segments. As a result of this performance, we have achieved 39% growth and EPS to $0.32 per common share for the quarter. Repair and remodel, which is 70% of our business, continues to be strong for us as our new products and program wins drove sales in the quarter.","Our actions to drive improved mix and increased share are paying off. We work diligently on new product development, improving relationships with key influencers in our markets and pricing. The result of this are particularly evident in plumbing and windows, where we experienced favorable mix, primarily in the trade and showroom channels, as we see consumers move up the price continuum in these categories. We anticipate the demand for repair and remodel will grow at a steady rate.","Despite the lower than expected growth in new home construction starts, our installation business delivered solid growth. This was driven by our continued focus on driving share and diversifying our business mix in the commercial and retrofit. We expect this segment to grow with or slightly outpace like new home construction starts in 2014.","While we were pleased with our overall sales growth and operating profit margin expansion, we are disappointed with the challenges we faced in the cabinet segment. We experienced lead time delays and incurred additional expense as a result of problems related to an ERP implementation at one of our component plants. This impact was limited to the Merillat Classic product line, which represents approximately 20% of our overall sales in the segment.","I had personally reached out to our customers and I am aware of how this has impacted their business, as well as ours. This level of performance is not acceptable. We are focused on getting it fixed. We are improving and we will be back to normalized levels by the end of Q3.","We had originally expected this business to turn a modest profit this year. Given the timing of the improvement actions we are implementing, we now expect the cabinet segment will be at a modest loss for 2014. While this is not a major shift at our outlook, it certainly is not a preferred direction. Nevertheless, we continue to believe that the underlying fundamentals of this business are strong, especially when considering its incremental margins of 35% and the line of sight we have to growth in 2015.","Despite the near-term challenges in cabinetry, I am extremely proud of our organization's overall performance in the quarter. Our plumbing segment, which represents approximately 40% of our company revenue and over 50% of our profit, continues to outperform. Let me give you a few examples.","Delta's luxury brand Brizo is up over 35% this quarter and that's on top of a compounded annual growth rate of 25% over the past four years. Delta continues to hold the number one share of shelf at big-box retailers and Hansgrohe had their best quarter in their 111 years history. Our spa business Watkins, which is the largest manufacturer of spas in North America had a tremendous quarter and has exceeded our expectations.","This momentum leads us to believe that, in the near term, the plumbing segment will continue to deliver mid-teens margins. On a longer-term basis, this segment will normalize to low-teen margins based on our growth plans to further expand internationally and growing adjacent product categories.","In decorative, Behr's commitment to innovation continues to pay off. Behr Marquee Interior has been extremely well received in the marketplace. Demand for Behr Deckover continues to grow and our relationship with our channel partner is strong and we are jointly focused on growing the business.","In other specialty, Milgard the leading window brand in the Western United States, continues to take share and are seeing strong growth with their Montecito and Tuscany product lines.","Our installation services team continues to impress me with their incremental margins of 37% this quarter, and their ability to target and successfully execute growth plans in the retrofit and commercial channels which now compromise approximately 20% of the segment sales.","Before turn the call over to John, let me leave you with three takeaways. Number one, we have executed many important initiatives at cabinets to make the business more competitive. Some of these resulted in cost and service variances that were not planned. This will be behind us in Q3 and the business will be well positioned for 2015.","Number two, we have good momentum, as evidenced by our overall company performance in the second quarter, and this trend is continuing in July, as we see sales for the month of low to mid-single digits and that's on top of a challenging comp from last year. We are positioned for continued growth in the second half given our industry-leading brands, our robust innovation pipeline and operating leverage.","And finally number three, we remain committed to realizing the full potential of our core businesses, to leveraging opportunities across our portfolio and to actively managing the portfolio to drive long-term shareholder value.","With that, please move to slide six, where John Sznewajs, our CFO will take you through our financial operating review.","John Sznewajs","Thank you, Keith and good morning, everyone. As Irene mentioned, most my comments will focus on adjusted performance, excluding the impact of rationalization and other one-time charges. So as Keith mentioned, consistent execution resulted in another quarter of sales and profit growth. Sales increased 5% as we recorded sales growth in four our five segments.","Sales in North America up 4% in the quarter. As the U.S. economy slowly improves, we continue to experience growing demand for our repair remodel and new home construction products. As a reminder, repair remodel activity represents approximately 70% of our sales. International sales increased 2% in local currency in the quarter, driven by core market growth of our international plumbing business in our U.K. businesses.","Our focus on cost control continues to pay off as SG&A dollars were flat compared to the second quarter of last year. We delivered strong bottomline performance as operating income increased 21% in the quarter to $249 million with operating margins expanding 130 basis points to 11%. This represent our best quarterly operating margin since the third quarter of 2007, when sales were $3 billion and reflects the benefits of our cost reductions over the last several years. Our strong operating leverage resulted in the 39% incremental margin in the quarter. our EPS was $0.32 per share, an improvement of $0.09 or 39% compared to the second quarter of last year.","As you turn to slide seven, we see the components of our operating income improvement in the second quarter. The $18 million increase in volume and mix was principally driven by increased volume in our decorative architectural, plumbing, installation and other specialty segments, largely due to increased repair remodel activity and continued recovery in new home construction. This strength was partially offset by negative volume mix in our cabinet segment.","Net price commodity improved approximately $27 million, largely driven by our cabinets, plumbing, installation and other specialty segments. This improvement was partially offset by an unfavorable relationship in the decorative architectural segment.","We captured $43 million of profit improvements gross in the quarter. These improvements were more than offset by growth initiative spend, program support and inefficiencies in our cabinet operation. For 2014, we still expect to generate $150 million profit improvements gross, similar to what we have delivered on average for each of the last five years, largely coming from continuous improvement in supply chain work.","We are reducing our estimate of the annual net benefit from $15 million to $20 million to approximately $10 million due to the incremental cost we incurred in our cabinet business in the first half of this year.","Turn to slide eight. You can see we delivered another quarter of solid performance in our plumbing segment, as sales increased 6% driven by growth in our trade business, our new product introductions such as Hansgrohe's Select which offers pushbutton control of shower functions and Watkins' Highlife spas, which raises the bar on the luxury spa experience and international projects as Hansgrohe continues to win five-star projects around the globe.","Solid sales momentum continued in North America, particularly in the trade channel. This reflects increased activity resulting from our continued investment in the showroom, commercial and multifamily segments of this channel. Our European businesses experienced modest gains with sales increasing low single-digit percent in local currency, primarily led by Hansgrohe as the core central European markets continue to recover provide a favorable sales mix.","Operating profit increased 26% or $29 million, driven by incremental volume, a richer mix of products due to increased trade sales, productivity improvements and, to a lesser extent, a favorable price commodity relationship, particularly in Europe.","Turn to slide nine. We see consumer demand for our new product introductions such as Behr Deckover and our newly launched Behr Marquee Interior Paint and a solid performance in our expanding Pro business drove a 5% sales increase in this segment. As a result, we realized mid-single-digit gain on growth in the quarter. Liberty Hardware had another strong quarter achieving solid top and bottom line growth through continued share gains.","Sales in the quarter were favorably impacted by $6 million of loading costs due to program wins in both Behr and Liberty. Marquee Interior, our most advanced interior paint was introduced Q1 in all 180 Canadian Home Depot stores. It will be in most U.S. Home Depot stores by September. This premium paint product has contributed positive growth to the DIY channel since its introduction. We are confident in its continued success as it offers consumers a premium product that delivers consistent one coat coverage and superior stain resistance.","Operating margins expanded slightly, benefiting from additional volume and the retiming of the $5 million of anticipated advertising and program reset costs from Q2 to the second half of 2014. We are now estimating incremental advertising costs and program reset cost to be approximately $5 million in Q3 and $2 million in the fourth quarter. These were partially offset by an unfavorable price commodity relationship.","Turning to slide 10. Our North American cabinet business experienced a difficult second quarter as sales declined 5%. Sales were down for three reasons. The first, lower than anticipated sales to builders, second lead time issues as a result of the ERP implementation and third, our disciplined pricing and promotional strategies which led to volume declines and share loss at retail. These were partially offset by improved sales in our dealer channel.","Our bottomline in the quarter was impacted by the lower absorption on the reduced volume, inefficiencies in cost related to the ERP implementation and a less favorable product mix. This was partially offset by pricing and promotion actions. We estimated that total charges related to the plant closure, ERP implementation and the associated inefficiencies of these initiatives in this segment will aggregate approximately $25 million in 2014, $10 million each in Q1 and Q2 and $5 million in Q3. As Keith mentioned earlier, this activity will be completed in the third quarter and we will be well positioned for growth going into 2015.","Turning to installation. The segment sales growth of 8% was driven by strong results in our distribution into our residential and commercial new construction channels. While multifamily activity remains strong, we are beginning to see more work from custom builders which positively impacts our revenue. Operating profit improved $10 million or 125% compared to the second quarter of last year as a result of increased volume and a favorable price commodity relationship that was partially offset by wage inflation and other expenses.","Turning to slide 12. You can see our other specialty products segment sales increased 11%, driven by our North American window business as we experienced continued share expansion in the Western U.S. and a favorable mix shift toward our premium window and door product lines and selling price. Our European business also positively contributed to segment's top and bottom line due to the continued success of our small composite door acquisition in the first quarter of last year and improvement in the U.K. new home construction market.","The segment's operating profit rose 7% as profit from the increased sales in both North America and international was impacted by growth investments, including the ramp up of new employees to support our continued growth in the Western U.S. and ERP investment.","And finally turning to the balance sheet on slide 13. We continue to have strong performance in working capital. Working capital as a percent of sales came in at 12.9%, a 20 basis points improvement from the second quarter of last year. I want to thank the supply chain, operations and finance teams for driving this great outcome.","We entered the quarter with about $1.4 billion of cash of balance sheet liquidity and our credit metrics continue to improve. We also anticipate that our balance sheet will continue to strengthen in the second half of this year as we expect to reverse the valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets and in either Q3 or Q4 of this year.","So with that, I will turn the call back over to Keith.","Please move to slide 16 for a few comments before we go to Q&A like to talk a little bit of all, I am that approach six months and sell I remain convinced that Masco has tremendous opportunity given our strong brands, our market-leading positions are some operating leverage our capabilities, I developed a plan","Keith Allman","Thanks, John. Please move to slide 15 for a few comments before we go to Q&A. I would like to talk to you a little bit about what matters as we six months in the saddle. I remain convinced that Masco has tremendous opportunity given our strong brands, our market-leading positions, our solid operating leverage and our capable teams. I developed a plan when I got the job and I have executed against that plan to spin up in to the role. I now have my leadership structure in place and we are continuing to work on our operating model and the strategy process.","This strategy process includes outlining a plan to realize the full potential of our existing businesses, reviewing the role of each of our businesses within the portfolio and refining our capital allocation strategy. Our focus is on building shareholder value in the mid to the long-term. I anticipate this strategic review will be completed by the end of September and we will keep the investment community apprised of any major shifts.","In conclusion, as I mentioned a few moments ago, we anticipate continued growth in the second half as we continue to grow share of our market-leading brands, drive operational leverage and turn our cabinet business.","With that, the lines will be open for questions. Sean?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions). Your first question comes from the line of Keith Hughes from SunTrust. Your line is open.","Keith Hughes - SunTrust","Thank you. Just a general question on pace of business in the quarter. You obviously have some nice share wins here in a couple of the divisions, but how would you characterize the repair remodel business and then going to the second half of the year, what are you hearing from your home builder customers in terms of their starts and activity they will be seeing as we end 2014?","Keith Allman","In terms of R&R, I would characterize, it is steady growth but we are seeing some choppiness. The R&A market as we are looking at it is really a little bit different when you look at smaller ticket versus big ticket. On the small ticket side, we are seeing good activity in our plumbing business, good traffic in that aisle, we are seeing good activity in paint.","In the bigger ticket items, we are seen a little bit of a drag when we look at our cabinet business. We think that's driven by the fact that there is a little bit of an affluent versus less affluent play in there in the big-ticket. What I mean by that is if you look at our spa business which is more of an affluent purchase, more of an affluent buy, that's doing quite well. But when you look at cabinets, we are seeing a little bit of a drag. I think that's in part because that's hooked in with typically other purchases that go with a kitchen remodel, for example, where there would be flooring, there would be appliances. That sort of thing. So I think it's a big-ticket, little smaller ticket story. On the big ticket side, a little bit of drag that we are seeing in our cabinets.","In terms of the second half on the newco side, the customers that I am talking to are a little bit tentative but we are seeing and believe that we will have new construction starts coming in a range of $1 million, slightly above $1 million, right in there with (inaudible).","Keith Hughes - SunTrust","Just one quick follow-up within the paint business. The margin, the cost structure you discussed in the second quarter, do you expect that to continue through the rest of the year, where you get price relief?","Keith Allman","Keith, we really didn't experience any cost pressures in the second quarter. What we did say is that we retimed some advertising that we expected to spend in the second quarter to the back of the year and that will be, so we anticipated $5 million that did not materialize this year so that was a positive impact to the margins in the second quarter and will have a little bit of a drag in the second quarter, again about $5 million in the third quarter and about $2 million or so in the fourth quarter.","Keith Hughes - SunTrust","My mistake.","Keith Allman","We see this business as a high-teens business.","Keith Hughes - SunTrust","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Stephen Kim from Barclays. Your line is open.","Stephen Kim - Barclays","Thanks very much, guys. Great, well good results. Question I had about your longer-term plumbing commentary about mid-teens margins near-term to longer-term, more like lower teen margins. I am curious as to how much of that will be driven, in your view, by Hansgrohe versus the other brands? If you have any visibility? Will that primarily be driven by Hansgrohe? And if you can give us some sense for how you think about what the incremental margin will be for these new initiatives, if you sort of just try to separate out what you are planning and how you are evaluating future adjacency opportunities from an incremental margin perspective, that will be great.","Keith Allman","We are seeing the improved margins really spread across the segment. Certainly, Hansgrohe is a factor in there as we have seen core European business grow at a quicker rate than the remaining chunk of the business. So that gives us some mix favorability. We also have a very robust cost out program called Plus 21 that we drive and have driven for years over at Hansgrohe. So they are contributing stateside here with Delta.","Our trade volume is very solid for us. We have had a concerted effort, our peer-to-peer is really where we have focused our new product introduction on that showroom and working with our relationship with the influencers and designers in those showrooms. And that's, we have got good momentum and productivity. And we also have a very solid cost out program that I talked about last quarter down at Delta.","On the spa side, we talked about the volume that we are experiencing our spa business which is also in the plumbing segment and of course with that comes some nice overhead leverage. So really, the improvements, I would say is spread across the whole segment. It is going well.","In terms of the incremental margins on expansion, as we drive globalization in our plumbing segment and we tweak our assortments to be more geographically centered, just because of the nature of that business, it tends to be a lower margin. When you look here in North America, at the entire plumbing market and where we are growing with regards to adjacent products to expand into the bathroom, those tend to be lower margins as well. Typically, our highly decorative chromed products, if you will, tend to be higher margin.","So I think when you look at both the international expansion and the assortment requirements to drive that, and you look at our category expansion here in North America, both of those initiatives tend to be lower than the faucet and shower margins, which tend to be the highest in the category.","Stephen Kim - Barclays","Great. I guess what I am trying to figure out is, obviously you are not going to have a lower margin in plumbing longer-term if you are not going to have an attended [ph] increase in the topline and I am just trying to figure out if there is some sort of rule of thumb that we can be thinking about in terms of how much your topline might grow for any given decrement in the margins? I assume you look at the opportunities on a return on investment basis. So I think you can give us some parameters around how we should be thinking about that kind of give-and-take between topline and margin? That's really what I was hoping for.","John Sznewajs","Yes, Stephen, I don't think we are prepared to discuss that just yet. These are relatively new initiatives. They are just getting out of the ground. So, clearly as Keith mentioned, particularly the adjacent products here in North America will have a lower margin. We will give you a better guidance on that as those things mature.","Stephen Kim - Barclays","Okay, that's fine. The second question relates to your comment about July. Obviously, July had a pretty tough comp. You were up low double digits, I believe, last year in July and you indicated, I think you are going to be up, correct me if I am wrong, did you say low single digits in July? I guess I was curious are you seeing any kind of acceleration in the business here in 3Q?","Keith Allman","We were up mid-teens last year, just to clarify that.","Stephen Kim - Barclays","Okay.","John Sznewajs","In the month of July.","Keith Allman","July, right. In terms of the overall demand, as I said, we are seeing steady growth in R&R. And I talked little bit detail about how that is choppy when you look at big ticket versus smaller ticket and that affluent buyer and some of the dynamics around that. New construction, while certainly it's below what we anticipated, at the beginning of the year, it is still up and we are targeting somewhere slightly north of $1 million starts.","Stephen Kim - Barclays","Okay, great. Thank you very much, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Garik Shmois from Longbow Research. Your line is open.","Garik Shmois - Longbow Research","Hi. Thank you. I just wondered if you could talk a little bit about the operating leverage in the install business in the quarter and maybe break out the benefits that you had called out? I think there were some net pricing benefits, some of that was some of the leverage associated with the commercial business. And just wondering if we can get a better understanding of what drove the incrementals in install in the second quarter and how sustainable the mid-30s level is moving forward?","John Sznewajs","Sure, Garik, it's John. A big part of that operating leverage in the second quarter was really driven by volume and the operational improvements that the team down at Daytona has implemented in the organization down there. So that was probably the biggest chunk of it. A much smaller piece of that would be the pricing that we mentioned. As I also mentioned, we did have some offsets to that as we did experience some wage inflation. We are investing in labor. You probably have heard through your contacts that labor is our target. There is labor tightness around the United States. And we want to make certain that we have labor as we enter the busy third quarter for this business. And so there will be a little bit of cost ahead of sales on the upfront which probably detract from the margin a little bit.","Garik Shmois - Longbow Research","Okay. Thanks for that. And just switching to cabinets for a second. Just wondered if you could provide a little more context around your outlook for the full year of a modest loss, given that we have had about $70 million of loss in the first half of the year, you have another $5 million of the European headwinds in the third quarter. It would, I guess, mean a pretty big snap back in the fourth quarter with respect to profitability to get to this modest loss. Just wondering if you could provide a little bit more color on maybe what the guidance means and how confident you are in that business returning to profitability, maybe as early as the fourth quarter?","Keith Allman","I would peg the loss in the range of $5 million to $10 million. In terms of my confidence in this business, I remain confident for really three fundamental reasons. Number one, over the last 18 months, we have really driven significant improvements in the competitiveness of this business from the supply chain to our product development processes. We have worked a lot on our business model and some of the sub-segments and countertops and builder direct. Our quality has improved and we have driven a substantial standardization across our IT platforms, which is important and it might be critical for our competitiveness going forward.","Unfortunately, those came with some unplanned costs and service variances. We are working very hard to get those fixed. We are improving. It will be behind us in Q3 and we will be positioned going into next year to deliver in this business.","Garik Shmois - Longbow Research","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Eli Hackel from Goldman Sachs. Your like is open.","Eli Hackel - Goldman Sachs","Thanks. Good morning. I just wanted to go back to just demand for a second right now. Just maybe a little bit more detail about, you talked to a people, how do you describe the U.S. consumer right now? You are always talking about big small ticket. Seeing a lot of mixed results across this space. Maybe your business seems a little bit better than average. Do you think the consumer is getting better? And what would it take to drive more buyers on the bigger ticket side? Is the economy strengthening at a pace where that's going to come back in the near-term? Or is that really pushed a little further out?","Keith Allman","Again, I would look at it is as R&R and new construction and break that down in that way. On the R&R side, the affluent buyers is showing up. They are interested in spending, and as I mentioned before, we are seeing that with empirical data, particularly when look at a spot purchase, for example. Certainly, our initiatives are driving share, but we are also seen the consumer show up there. And a little more, in the price conscious consumer, we are seeing a little bit more tentativeness.","On the new construction side, we have unemployment at six, six-and-half year low. Consumer confidence at a six-year high. I think it gets back to credit availability. That's a big driver in getting some real wage growth. I think as that happens, when you look at the position of housing stock in terms of available housing versus the population that needs it, I think that's in a good place. It's really about credit, that first-time buyer starting to move out into new homes.","Eli Hackel - Goldman Sachs","And then just maybe if you could, just quickly following up on that mid to lower end consumer? Just want to make sure, do you think that that lower end consumer is still struggling to some degree? Are you seeing any an improvement in that lower end buyer? Or is it really, so far, mostly being driven by the higher income buyers? On R&R side?","Keith Allman","In the low ticket, we are seeing good traffic. That's a good chunk of our business when you look at repair and remodeling on the plumbing side, particularly with faucets and showerheads, when you look at paint. So we are seeing the traffic. And I think that's the space of the strength of our portfolio where we are mixed across everything from a high-value smaller ticket Behr paint all the way up to a luxury spa and a electric shower systems with Hansgrohe. So I would say that the bigger ticket part of the continuum, we are seen a little bit of drag on that less affluent buyer.","Eli Hackel - Goldman Sachs","Got it, and then just second one. Just wanted to touch on Europe quickly. Clearly, your international result have been pretty strong, somewhat helped by currency. Can you just talk about your outlook for Europe in the back half of the year? Thank you.","John Sznewajs","Yes, Eli, I think Europe continues to look continuously pretty steady. We have seen very good progress each of the last four quarters or so in Europe. And we don't expect any acceleration in demand, but just consistent growth as we have experienced over the last couple of quarters.","Keith Allman","We have a solid infrastructure in place with Hansgrohe across multiple geographies, north of 130 markets. There is certainly political risk. Obviously, we all see what's in the news. There's elections on in Brazil. These is a number of things that are going around the globe. But when you really look at where Hansgrohe is positioned with the brand, the work we are doing on our international assortment, we feel good for steady growth outside the U.S.","Eli Hackel - Goldman Sachs","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of George Staphos from Bank of America. Your line is open.","George Staphos - Bank of America","Thanks, everyone. Good morning. Thanks for all the detail. I guess I had two questions. First of all, within the cabinets business, Keith, what do you think will ultimately reverse the share trend that you are seeing within retail and also the builder channel? Will they, from what you are seeing, normally dissipate or is there other actions you are going to need to take to reverse what has been the declining share there?","And then switching gears in decorative architectural and paints in particular, can you comment at all on the impact you are seeing from perhaps other coating companies now targeting the Pro initiatives as well? Thank you.","Keith Allman","In terms of the actions to drive market share in cabs, we have been working a lot on our fundamentals, as I talked about, in terms of our product development process or standardizing our ERP systems. We had five or six ERP systems across cabinets. Now we are down to two. So we are focused on our KraftMaid line and our Merillat line. So a lot of the work for share gains in terms of the core capabilities as well as the new products that we have introduced already in play and are paying off where we are seeing in our dealer channel in particular.","We are working to have, as I announced, a lead time reduction on our KraftMaid line. We think that's critical to drive share. We have implemented a new finishing system which, I believe, is going to raise the bar in the industry in terms of quality. That's implemented and we are running now, and that's a beautiful product. So that will help drive share.","On the retail side, we remain committed to our approach on promotions in terms of being strategic and utilizing them carefully to drive and get to that sweet spot for both revenue and value to the consumer. But we will continue to tweak that. I think the timing of some of our actions versus the competition has lead us to some share loss. We are working with our designers and our influencers to understand their needs and develop better relationships with them.","So I think there is a number of things that we are working on now. And as we get more specific results, we will share with them but we are moving, and I think that's evidenced in what we have done in the dealer channel, which was our initial focus.","George Staphos - Bank of America","Keith, I know it's hard to predict, but from a timing standpoint, would you expect the share erosion to be done by the fourth quarter or first quarter?","Keith Allman","Yes, I think we are beginning to chip away at that. Now we are gaining share in our dealer channel in terms of retail. As we tweak our promotional strategies and continue to drive the improvements there, we will see that. This is a long purchase cycles. So it is going to take some time. But we are making momentum. We have momentum.","George Staphos - Bank of America","Okay.","Keith Allman","George, you had a question on paint?","George Staphos - Bank of America","Yes.","Keith Allman","With regard to how we are our doing in the Pro? We are focused on the Pro and we are doing that in concert with the Home Depot. This is obviously an important segment. When we look at our intel and the studies that we do and then it's corroborated with outside studies, that Behr paint brand, that Behr brand is strong with the Pro. Obviously strong in R&R, but it is also strong in the Pro.","We also have good Pro traffic at the Home Depot. So it's an important growth initiative for us. We have not lost shelf space at the Home Depot and we are continuing to be successful in this Pro business. It's outgrowing, clearly outgrowing, the base Pro business and we have a got a good value proposition. And we are working to make it better. Now it is not going to be -- the margins are not going to be as high as our base repair and remodeling book of business, but it is good return on assets for us.","We have a good plan to work with. And most importantly, we are in concert with our channel partner. It doesn't surprise me that our competition would see our success and work to countermeasure it.","John Sznewajs","Yes, George, we are investing heavily behind this business. As you may know, we have about now 150 Pro sales reps out in the field, calling on Pro customers to drive this business. So we feel very confident in the growth that we have been experiencing and the fact that have we got a good runway in front of us as well.","George Staphos - Bank of America","Okay. Thank you for the thoughts. Good luck on the quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dennis McGill from Zelman & Associates. Your line is open.","Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates","Good morning.","Keith Allman","Good morning, Dennis.","Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates","Keith, I guess my first question just relates to, on the cabinet issue at Merillat. Would that be in resolve by the end of this quarter? How will that impact the revenue side of the equation? Because I know you expect, you mentioned lead times are extended and backlogs are extended, so if that's fully resolved, does that mean customers are back to normal lead times? And if so, does that mean that you get almost a revenue catch up in the third quarter, as you satisfy these orders that are in backlog?","Keith Allman","I have reached out, Dennis, to many of our customers and I understand the impact that our performance has had on them. We have worked hard to develop the industry-leading lead time and fill rates coming out of our supply chain, and our channel partners come to rely on that. And when we fail to deliver on that process, on that promise, it not good on their business and certainly it is not good on our business. It has affected demand and it is going to take some time as we get our lead times back to normal levels to reestablish our confidence and to get back. So I fully intend that we will get there in terms of the timing. We are committed to get this stabilized in Q3 and then being working on all eight cylinders as we go into next year.","Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates","Okay. I realize that.","John Sznewajs","Related to your question regarding a third quarter catch up in sales as result of working through the backlog. We do expect a little bit of catch up here to hit the third quarter, but nothing really material.","Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates","Okay, and then second question, it looks as though corporate expense was at least lower than what we were modeling. It seems to be favorable relative to last year. How do you think about that run rate going forward? And maybe if you could just give some examples of where some of savings might be coming from there?","John Sznewajs","Dennis, I think the compares is challenging more so than we had some one-time events occur last year. And I think what you are seeing in the second quarter of 2014 is more indicative of a run rate. So you may recall, we had a retirement of a senior executive. A senior executive hit 65 and that caused some stock comp expense last year.","Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Rehaut from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Michael Rehaut - JPMorgan","Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Nice quarter.","Keith Allman","Thanks, Mike.","Michael Rehaut - JPMorgan","First question, just to go back to plumbing for a moment and appreciate the detail there. Talking about mid-teens margins for the near term, if you could give us a sense of what you mean by near-term? If that's the second half of 2014 or would it likely go into 2015? And what's kind of biggest, you mentioned a number of positive influences on the margin, what would you attribute the biggest one or two drivers to the higher levels that you are seeing right now?","Keith Allman","Mike, I would say, the mid-teens through 2015 is something that would be good to model that range. In terms of the key drivers, boy, it's a combination of many things, but I think to break it down, I would say new products and listening to the customer and driving products, in a way that drive favorable mix. Having said that, we have also put a fair amount of attention into more of the opening price point as well. So it's a combination. But I would say new product introduction mix and then our cost out program.","Michael Rehaut - JPMorgan","Great. Also the July number was pretty impressive, as discussed earlier, in terms of against a tougher comp. With the comps easing in the next couple of months of the quarter, if you could just remind us what those were? And would you expect as a result, August and September to accelerate potentially? Or were there is some drivers in July, either, I think perhaps the continuation of some new product load in from in the paint segment or other things that we might continue to see overall kind of this mid-single-digit consolidated topline there for the quarter?","John Sznewajs","Yes, Mike, it's John. In terms of the additional comps in the third quarter, just to remind everyone, the third quarter last year was our most difficult -- our best quarter in 2013, which was up 12%. So we were up mid-teens in July, low double digits in both August and September. So the comps, while they get a little bit easier, it's still pretty challenging. In terms of what we are anticipating going forward, as Keith alluded to earlier, with housing starts in the neighborhood of $1 million or so for the year, we are thinking about where we were at through the first half of the year. That would imply a pretty good clip going into the second half the year, as well as our lower ticket repair remodel products continued to perform well. We were confident that the growth rate that we have experiencing in the first half of the year feels like it should be similar to that going forward. Could be some puts and takes a little bit here and there, but as you know, we really don't give topline guidance. So it's really hard to put a finite number on that.","Michael Rehaut - JPMorgan","No, I appreciate that. And just one last one for clarification. Keith, you were good enough to give us your sense of the loss for cabinets. Just wanted to make sure, clarify the $5 million to $10 million, that's not a loss for the fourth quarter, but a loss for the overall year?","Keith Allman","Correct.","Michael Rehaut - JPMorgan","Okay. Thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Wood from Macquarie. Your line is open.","Adam Baumgarten - Macquarie","Hi, guys, it's Adam in for Mike. Just a couple quick one on paints. You say $6 million load in benefit in 2Q and the rollout should we finished for the Marquee Interior in some time in 3Q. Can you talk about, the expect a load in benefit you expect in that quarter?","Keith Allman","It should be less than the cyclic because that would spread across both Behr as well as Liberty. Liberty won a number of new programs at retail. And so I would say, it is just going to be a couple million dollars in the third quarter because there is really only about two months worth of impact in the third quarter.","Adam Baumgarten - Macquarie","Okay, thanks, and then just if you could talk about the negative price cost in decorative? What was driving that?","Keith Allman","A number of things. We have seen a slight elevation in raw material costs compared with the second quarter of last year, both on TiO2 as well as in engineered resins that we purchase and put into our products.","Adam Baumgarten - Macquarie","Great. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bob Wetenhall from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Bob Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets","Hi. Good morning, and nice quarter. I just wanted to get a little bit specific. You used the language in the press release, \"realizing the full potential of your core businesses by actively managing the portfolio\", and I was hoping you could share with us, how are you defining the core business? And what are your thoughts at this juncture? It sounds like the strategic review will be finished by September. Are you leaning more towards an asset sale or a spend? Any color would be great.","Keith Allman","Good morning, Bob. I apologize for the confusion in the press release. What I was trying to get across there is that, as a management team we are focused on a couple of time horizons. Number one is the mid to longer-term time horizon where we are looking at how we can drive shareholder value with our portfolio of strategy. And we are running at aggressive ramp, an additional ramp of our portfolio strategy process to determine that.","The other time horizon that we need to work on is in the here and now, the short term. And that is to drive our existing businesses that we have on our portfolio to be all it can be. And that's what I mean about full potential.","So it's not that we are, as a management team, strictly looking at the long-term of the portfolio issues, we are also looking at our core businesses that we have today and how we can improve them and drive, particularly in cabinet, turnaround.","With regards to where I am leaning, really I am not leaning. I am letting our process determine what the optimal portfolio is for mid-to long-term shareholder value. We are intently engaged in the process. We have brought on outside counsel to give us an external perspective of how we might unlock value. We are looking at all options that are in front of us and of course we are doing it in concert with the board. So I am not going into this process with a preconceived notion. We are letting the process work. We are open to all options. And it is going well.","Bob Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets","That's really good color. This might be a jump all to, and if John has any commentary as well, you have a lot of cash on the balance sheet. Net leverage is the lowest it's been in a long time at two times. I think you guys are on track to generate $500 million of free cash flow. What do you want to do with the cash? And in concert with review of the portfolio from a strategic alternative standpoint, how relevant is M&A? And what are you thinking about returning cash? Thanks and good luck.","John Sznewajs","Yes, Bob, in terms of capital allocation, in the near term, we have been consistent in saying, that we want to pay down some debt in the near term. And so we do have some of the cash on the balance sheet earmarked for that debt repayment. That said, to your other point, we are looking at some other uses of our cash. And we did raise the dividend in the second quarter. As you may recall, in May. We had about 20% dividend increase that we announced.","At the same time, M&A is something that we would consider for our portfolio. But right now, the add-on, bolt-on acquisitions to some of our existing portfolio businesses as opposed to going out and putting in a new line of business is something that we are not currently in. So don't think of it as a huge stretch of a huge acquisitions at this point. That's not something that we are contemplating at all.","Bob Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets","Great. Thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Nick Coppola from Thompson Research Group. Your line is open.","Nick Coppola - Thompson Research Group","Hi, good morning.","Keith Allman","Good morning","Nick Coppola - Thompson Research Group","I am hoping to drill down a little bit more on what exactly happened in cabinets in the quarter and particularly some more color on the ERP implementation and where the additional expenses that may have been unexpected came from? And as a follow-up to that, do you have any view on how much revenue was missed in Q2 by the longer lead times?","Keith Allman","In terms of the cost variances driven by the ERP implementation, to deliver on our industry-leading lead times and fill rates information is key. You need to have a timely information of demand and you need to have an understanding of where the product is as we execute in a build-to-order kitchen at a time environment with no finished goods and we are talking in the range of millions of SKUs when you look at the configuration possibilities across the entire assortment. So information is key and when you implement an ERP system and we had some issues that we didn't catch in our early testing, and it took a while to uncover those issues and resolve them. And when you have inaccurate and non-timely information flowing into the system that's tight, you tend to have back orders. And those backorders drive you into running off a hot list and it becomes difficult to maintain the fill rates in the standard cost that you drive for. So it was a combination of things. But fundamentally, it was issues relating to information in terms of demand and knowing where we are.","Nick Coppola - Thompson Research Group","Okay. That makes a lot of sense, and then, my last question for you would be about pricing at big-box and I guess my question, what these promotional activities looked like and whether or not there's been any discount in there?","Keith Allman","In terms of pricing at big-box, I think we have, as I mentioned in my remarks, I think we have lost some share when you look at the timing of some of our actions versus our competition. But again, we are committed to our approach, which is to be strategic and creative in how we use our promotions to hit that sweet spot of bringing value to the consumer and being most productive for us. So will continue to tweak it, but we wish that we remain committed to our approach.","Nick Coppola - Thompson Research Group","Okay. Thanks for taking my questions.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Mike Dahl from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Mike Dahl - Credit Suisse","Hi, thanks, and nice job in a tough environment here. Just following up on the last comment there. Should we interpret this as, the comments around promotional activity, that there's still elevated promotions by competitors in the channel? And is there any way, any color around what types of promotions you think are most effective today?","Keith Allman","In terms of these elevated promotion, we have seen it come down substantially from what it was quite frosty in the downturn. The price increase that we put in, we were leaders in that. I think that also contributed to some of the issues we have had in the topline. In terms of the most effective promotion, it really various. There is certainly promotions that are effectively to administered to push to close. There is promotions that involve incentivizing our customer base to move up and to have a more contented product to go into glazed finishes, for example, to go into all plywood construction. Those sorts of things. So that's what think about. We think about how can we bring value to the consumer, how can we move them up, so that's favorable for us in terms of margins, and of course we look at the competitive environment.","Mike Dahl - Credit Suisse","Got it. Thanks, and then second question. Just a quick one on FX. I think you talked about the sales impact there. I am wondering what was the impact on operating profit from FX? Thanks.","John Sznewajs","Hang on, Mike, as we pull that up real quick. It was a relatively small amount. FX overall for the company was just a favorable $2 million.","Mike Dahl - Credit Suisse","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of David Goldberg from UBS. Your line is open.","David Goldberg - UBS","Thanks. Good quarter, and thank you for taking my questions. My first question was on the Behr Marquee roll-out and the success you have been having. And I am wondering if you can talk a little bit about where the customers are coming from? Are these people who would have bought another Behr paint but they are trading up in terms of price point? Are you cannibalizing your own sales? Or are they coming from somewhere else? That's my first question.","Keith Allman","The roll-out has gone very well for us. We started in Canada. And we got the Marquee rolled out in 180 stores up in Canada. And we are also starting to roll-out our new color selection merchandising up there and it's going quite well. We are seeing good growth with it. Both ourselves and Home Depot are pleased with how its going and we are focused on executing that rollout here in the United States.","In terms of where our customers are coming from, difficult to parse that out. Clearly, this is not all, there is incremental volume here for us. This is a substantially different price point and a different product and we like where this is going as evidenced by our success where it has already been rolled out.","David Goldberg - UBS","Great, and then just as a follow-up, you talked about gaining share in the dealer channel in the cabinet business. And I am wondering if you can talk about how you guys benchmark execution and customer satisfaction in that business relative to some of the other competitors? And the reason I ask is, because I would assume as a huge driver of share gains and wins, is making sure the end user is happy and therefore the dealers are happy. So maybe if you could talk about where you guys you think you are in terms of execution in that business? And how you benchmark where you are relative to the competition?","Keith Allman","I think we are doing very well and the results bear that out. We have put a concerted effort into the product assortment to make sure that we have the appropriate products for this market. We have executed initiatives focused on urban markets in big cities, which is very tightly linked to this higher-end showroom consumer. We have looked at how we attack this segment from a sales representation standpoint. We have looked at our incentives associated with our sales reps in this line of business. So, as is usually the case, it's not one silver bullet, but it's been a number of initiatives.","In terms of how we gauge customer satisfaction, at the higher-end in the showroom model, this tends to be an assisted sale, and we value very much the opinion of those showroom folks that are in these dealerships that are helping the consumer. And we put a concerted effort with our programs. Over the course of six weeks nonstop, we bring in showroom associates into our corporate headquarters down in Indianapolis. We talk to them about what new products they need, about how we can do better from customer service to pricing and promotions, all those sorts of things. And we survey those influencers constantly and we ask for their ideas for improvements. So that's principally where we go to gauge customer satisfaction.","David Goldberg - UBS","That's very helpful. Thank you for the color.","Operator","Your last question comes from the line of Philip Ng from Jefferies. Your line is open.","Philip Ng - Jefferies","Hi, good morning, guys. New construction is still a little bit spotty, but you sound generally a little more upbeat on the back half. Will most of the pickup be driven on the cabinet side? I know it's been a nice growth driver this past year.","John Sznewajs","Phil, it is John. As you think about how the back half has been developing, again as I alluded to earlier, we do think if you are of the mindset that we are going to have a million housing start, a fair amount of growth will be driven by our installation business. And then as we talked about earlier, with repair remodel, we are seeing a little bit of a choppiness effect there where the lower ticket items, we are seeing good experience with them, seeing some good strength there, but to a lesser degree, on the bigger ticket. So I think cabinets actually would be less of a driver in the second half of the year than either the lower ticket or the new construction portion of our business.","Philip Ng - Jefferies","Got you, very helpful. And Keith, can you give us a little preview on how you are thinking about your longer-term initiatives? Are you looking more on the growth side, cost take-out or even possibly capital deployment?","Keith Allman","We are looking at shareholder value in the long-term and that's the fundamental lens there. We are evaluating all our options there.","Philip Ng - Jefferies","Okay, all right. Thanks for the color. Good luck in the quarter.","Keith Allman","Thank you.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. I will turn the call back over to the presenters.","Keith Allman","Well, thank you very much. Have a great day. And I appreciate all the questions.

Welcome to Masco Corporation's Fourth Quarter 2013 Conference Call. My name is Janice, and I will be your operator for today's call. As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded for replay purposes. [Operator Instructions]","I would now like to turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Maria Duey. Maria, you may begin.","Maria Duey","Thank you, Janice, and good morning to everyone. Welcome to Masco Corporation's Fourth Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me on our call today are Tim Wadhams, President and CEO of Masco; John Sznewajs, Masco's Vice President, Treasurer and Chief Financial Officer; and Keith Allman, who will become President and CEO of Masco on Friday, February 14.","Our fourth quarter earnings release and the presentation slides that we will refer to during the call are available on the Investor Relations portion on our website. Following our prepared remarks, the call will be open for analyst questions. [Operator Instructions] If we are unable to take your question during the call, please feel free to call me directly at (313) 792-5500.","I'd like to remind you that statements in today's presentation will include our views about Masco's future performance, which constitute forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. We've described these risks and uncertainties in our risk factors and other disclosures in our Form 10-K and our Form 10-Qs that we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","Today's presentation also includes non-GAAP financial measures. Any references to operating profit, earnings per share or cash flow on today's call will be as adjusted, unless otherwise noted, with a reconciliation of these adjusted measurements to GAAP in our quarterly press release and presentation slides in the Investor Relations section of our website at www.masco.com.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Tim Wadhams. Tim?","Timothy Wadhams","Thank you, Maria, and thank all of you for joining us today for Masco's fourth quarter 2013 earnings call. And if you would please move to Slide #4, we're very pleased with our fourth quarter and full year 2013 results. We had a great year. As we have for the last several quarters, Masco's fourth quarter results showed strong sales and profit growth compared to the prior year quarter. And you might remember that in the fourth quarter of 2012, we had a very strong quarter with sales up 11%. Our leadership position in the building products industry and our focused execution against the housing recovery benefited all of our segments this quarter with all 5 contributing to our sales and profit growth.","In North America, we continue to benefit from increased new home construction activity and from improving repair and remodel activity as consumers invest in bigger ticket projects, like windows and cabinets. In addition, our international sales and profits continue to increase as a result of a solid performance by our international plumbing and window businesses in a slowly improving economic environment in the Eurozone. New products and new programs resulting from our emphasis on customer-driven innovation generated a vitality index for 2013 in excess of 30% and helped Behr, Delta and Hansgrohe achieve record annual sales.","We're seeing the benefit of our strict focus on cost containment, as well as our ongoing commitments to total cost productivity as evidenced by our strong incremental margins for both the fourth quarter and the full year 2013. And importantly, our installation and cabinet segments were both profitable in 2013. As previously indicated, returning these segments to profitability has been a top priority for Masco.","The fourth quarter was a solid close to a strong year. For both the fourth quarter and the full year 2013, our sales were up 9% and our operating leverage drove improved operating margins, which were up over 200 basis points. And again, that's for both the fourth quarter and the full year 2013. Those metrics helped drive EPS to more than double on a full year basis and free cash flow to exceed $500 million.","In addition to improving the math related to our financial results, we also accomplished each of the priorities we identified at the beginning of 2013, which are included on Slide #5. We delivered on what we said we were going to do at the beginning of the year. We'll touch on these items as we work our way through the presentation. They represent areas of focus in support of our strategic initiatives, which are included on Slide #6.","As we communicated in the past, our strategy is focused on 4 key elements to drive performance. Our commitment and investment to expand our market leadership positions was illustrated by Behr's PREMIUM PLUS ULTRA recently being recognized as the #1 rated interior paint by an independent third party. We're also excited to announce the launch of our new super premium BEHR MARQUEE interior paint and primer, which is being rolled out in select markets as we speak. In addition, our phased introduction of new products to support our Merillat cabinet brand and our redesign of our Hot Spring Spas have been extremely well received by their respective dealers. Our company-wide emphasis on cost control and sales increase is reflected by our improvement in gross and operating margins. John will discuss that in a couple of minutes, but we're really pleased with that outcome.","Our installation segment is capitalizing on improved market dynamics that drove sales in all channels of their business. By remaining focused on profitability, they continued their trend of improving operating profit. North American cabinetry continues to benefit from positive trends in new home construction and repair\/remodel activity. As I mentioned, consumers are taking on bigger-ticket remodel projects, which is helping our KraftMaid brand, particularly in the dealer channel. The team continues to execute on their strategic plan, positioning the business for future profitable growth.","Combined, these segments, cabinets and installation, improved operating profit by $22 million in the fourth quarter and by $113 million for the full year 2013 compared to 2012. In addition, we remain committed to strengthening our balance sheet and increasing our financial flexibility. John will talk about our progress in 2013 in a couple of minutes. These strategic highlights demonstrate our continued focus on execution, which produced another strong quarter and a great year.","And if you would please move to Slide #7, John Sznewajs, our CFO, will take you through our financial and operational review.","John G. Sznewajs","Thanks, Tim, and good morning, everyone. If you could please flip to Slide 8. Before getting into the numbers, I've been at Tim's side for the last 7 years, and I want to thank him, acknowledge him for his leadership and wish him a long, productive and healthy retirement. And as Maria mentioned, most of my comments will focus on adjusted performance, excluding the impact of rationalization and one-time charges.","So we exited 2013 with sustained momentum. Sales in the fourth quarter increased 9% as we experienced strong sales growth in all segments. We posted this strong revenue improvement against a challenging Q4 2012 count, which was up nearly 11%. As Tim mentioned, the fourth quarter was our ninth consecutive quarter of year-over-year sales and profit growth. Looking at January, our sales increased mid-single digits percent despite the challenging weather conditions and a difficult comparison to January 2012, which was up low double digits -- I'm sorry, January '13, which was up low double digits.","Overall, sales in North America were up 9% for the quarter. While we experienced the strongest sales growth in the new construction channel, we saw demand improve for our repair\/remodeling products, including big-ticket repair\/remodel products. And as a reminder, repair\/remodel activity represented approximately 70% of our sales in 2013.","International sales increased 7% in local currency in the quarter, clearly outpacing Eurozone growth with particular strength in the U.K. Gross margins expanded approximately 100 basis points compared to Q4 2012 to 27% due to improvement in every segment. And we delivered strong bottom line performance as operating income increased nearly 50% in the quarter to $153 million with operating margins expanding 210 basis points to 7.7%, the strongest fourth quarter we have reported in several years.","Overall, this was a great outcome despite incurring approximately $6 million of higher insurance-related expenses in the quarter, costing us approximately $0.01 per share. And our EPS was $0.15, an improvement of $0.09 or 150% compared to the fourth quarter of 2012.","If you turn to Slide 9, we see the components of our operating income improvement in 2013. The $148 million increase in net volume\/mix was principally driven by the strong volume increases we experienced in each reporting segment. The strength was partially offset by an expected negative mix in our cabinet segment as our sales to builders grew at a more accelerated rate than our cabinet sales to other channels of distribution. Net price\/commodity improved approximately $54 million for the full year or $6 million for the fourth quarter, largely driven by cabinets, plumbing, installation and the other specialty segments. This improvement was partially offset by an unfavorable price\/commodity relationship in the decorative architectural segment. And there was no year-over-year impact of our metals hedge in the quarter.","We captured $38 million of profit improvements gross in the quarter, exceeding our expectations, and these were realized in all of our businesses. These improvements were offset by higher employee-related expenses, particularly incentive compensation at the business unit level and the insurance-related costs I've mentioned previously. We are pleased with our full year profit improvement initiatives gross, totaling approximately $165 million, exceeding our prior estimate for the full year. For 2014, we expect to generate approximately $150 million of profit improvements gross, similar to what we've delivered on average for the last 5 years, largely coming from continuous improvement in supply chain activities.","If you turn to Slide 10, please, you can see in the plumbing segment, we delivered a solid performance as sales increased 8% in the quarter. The strong sales momentum of our North American faucet and toilet business continued as our innovative new product introductions drove consumer demand and led to a low double digit percent sales growth in the quarter. Growth in the trade channel is very strong, up mid-teens percent and reflects our continued investments in the showroom, commercial and multifamily segments of this channel. And as we have previously mentioned, we were up against a difficult comparison in the quarter as Q4 2012 benefited from approximately $12 million of load-ins related to our retail program wins in the second half of last year. We also experienced low double digit growth from several other North American businesses, such as our rough plumbing and our spa business.","Our European sales gains continued with sales increasing mid-single digits in local currency, led by Hansgrohe. Partially offsetting this growth was the exit of the unprofitable trade channel bathing business and lost retail bathing programs. These actions negatively impacted sales by approximately $10 million in the quarter and totaled approximately $50 million in 2013. For 2014, we anticipate sales will be negatively impacted by approximately $10 million for the full year. As we complete the integration of this business into Delta, we are focused on returning this business to profitability. Operating profit increased 35% or $25 million, driven by incremental volume of favorable price\/commodity relationship, particularly in Europe, favorable currency impact and productivity and cost control compared to the fourth quarter of last year.","If you turn to Slide 11, continued consumer demand for new product introductions, such as BEHR MARQUEE and BEHR DECKOVER, drove strong performance in our Pro business and international sales drove a 6% increase in our decorative architectural segment in the quarter. As a result, we realized high single digit gallon growth in the quarter. Liberty Hardware also continues to contribute to the top and bottom lines of this segment as a result of share gains in several new programs in retail. Our continued efforts to drive gallon growth included approximately $6 million of incremental investment in advertising, promotions and international growth which, when coupled with an unfavorable price\/commodity relationship, more than offset Liberty Hardware's strong profit performance in the quarter.","Turning to Slide 12. Our sustained focus on profitable growth in the cabinet segment resulted in a 9% increase in the fourth quarter. We improved our operating results by $13 million in the quarter, and expanded our operating profit margin by 580 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of last year. The environment and market dynamics for cabinetry are improving in both the repair\/remodel and new construction channels. All 3 of our brands are benefiting from these improved industry conditions. As a result, North American cabinet sales, excluding countertops, increased low double digits in the quarter, reflecting continued strength with our builder accounts and strengthening our modeling demand. New product launches in the first half of 2013 have made a positive impact and contributed to strong semi-custom cabinet sales to the dealer channel. The sales for these customers increased mid-teens percent in the quarter.","And we experienced terrific operating leverage in the quarter as we delivered a very strong 62% incremental margin. This improvement was driven by increased volume, cost control, productivity improvements and our continued leadership around disciplined promotions. This was partially offset by a higher raw material cost and negative mix due to increased sales to production builders. On a full year basis, the segment was profitable sooner than we anticipated, as operating profit improved by $57 million, further evidence that our turnaround efforts are effective and we are positioning this business for future profitable growth.","Turning to Slide 13. The segment sales growth of 15% was driven by a 20% increase in residential new construction, and to a lesser degree, by higher sales volumes in our commercial, retrofit and distribution channels. The 20% increase in new residential construction sales compares favorably to the 14% increase in housing starts lagged 90 days. This was the 10th consecutive quarter of year-over-year sales and operating profit improvement in this segment. In addition to solid top line performance, the management's strong execution, focus on cost control and a favorable price\/commodity relationship delivered improved bottom line results with operating profit improving by $9 million and operating margins expanding by 210 basis points in the quarter.","For the full year, operating profit improved by $56 million. This segment exhibited strong operating leverage in 2013, delivering 28% incremental margins despite the impact of rising raw material and labor costs and approximately $5 million of unanticipated insurance costs in the fourth quarter. The strong execution was complemented by the continued implementation of a leaner operating model that is allowing for efficiencies and facilitating growth in new geographies. We added 15 new locations in 2013 and anticipate adding an additional 15 greenfield locations in 2014.","Turning to Slide 14. You see our other specialty products segment sales increased 9%, giving another strong quarter, driven by low teens percent sales volume growth in our North American window business. This growth was due to the continued recovery in the repair\/remodel and new home construction activities as well as share gains. As Europe continues to show signs of improved economic stability, our U.K. window business produced positive volume increases resulting from the continued success of our small composite door acquisition in the first quarter of 2013. The segment's operating profits growth in the quarter was due to increased volume in windows and a favorable price\/commodity relationship, partially offset by ERP and higher employee-related expenses.","Turning to Slide 15. You see the entire team's hard work to strengthen the balance sheet is paying off. We retired $200 million of debt in 2013 and $600 million of debt since the beginning of 2012. Working capital as a percent of sales is at a record low, 10.6%. I want to thank the team for their continued focus on this metric. Our earnings power is evident as free cash flow exceeds $0.5 billion in 2013. And we ended the year with more than $1.5 billion of balance sheet liquidity. So we find ourselves well positioned to grow with the recovery.","I will now turn the call over to Keith for the outlook. Back to Tim, I'm sorry.","Timothy Wadhams","Back to Tim before Keith. Thanks, John. And if you would please move to Slide #16. As John mentioned and as I think all of you know, this is my last earnings call. And I want to thank all of you for your support and interest in Masco over the years. And I wish all of you continued success. I believe that Masco is in a great position to drive additional shareholder value as the recovery in housing continues. I'm very proud of our performance in 2013, and I want to thank our employees across the enterprise for their commitment and dedication. Keith has an outstanding team to lead, and I'm very excited about Masco's future.","And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Masco's new President and CEO, effective this Friday, Keith Allman.","Keith J. Allman","Thank you, Tim. It's been a privilege working for Tim over the years. And I think I can speak for everyone here at Masco when I say we will certainly miss him and we appreciate all that he's done for the company. I'm humbled and excited by the opportunity to be Masco's next CEO. And I look forward to continuing to execute on the strong strategy and foundation that Tim has put in place.","Please move to Slide 17 for a couple of comments before we go on to Q&A. The underlying fundamentals of our business remained strong as evidenced by another quarter of sales growth and margin expansion. We expect that the positive trends in new home construction, repair and remodel, home price appreciation and an increase in big-ticket spending in North America will continue. We anticipate new home construction and repair and remodel to improve in Europe over the coming year as well. I should note that despite a fairly flat European market in 2013, we fared pretty well with international sales up 4% for the year in local currency. Having said that, we recognize that there are macroeconomic factors that will challenge us going forward, including the pace of the global economic recovery. Despite these factors, we are positioned to continue growing profitably and creating value for our shareholders.","Please move to Slide 18. Over the next year, we will continue to focus on execution, maintaining the positive momentum that started for us in the fourth quarter of 2012. We are well positioned to grow our key brands and we'll accelerate our emphasis on maintaining a customer-focused innovation pipeline, improving our enterprise leverage, further penetrating international markets and focusing on continuous improvement across our enterprise. Cost containment remains a priority with a particular focus on SG&A cost.","Also in 2014, we plan on positioning the company to reduce debt by $300 million to $500 million by 2016. As a reminder, we have $1.5 billion in debt maturities between 2015 and 2016. Improving our credit metrics will remain a top priority for us. I look forward to sharing more with you in the coming months as we deploy our strategies to deliver value to the shareholders.","With that, the lines will be open for questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question is from Stephen East of ISI Group.","Stephen F. East - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Tim, congratulations. If we look at the current trends, you talked about some about the current trends with the new construction and the remodel\/repair. I guess, we could dig in a little bit more on the remodel\/repair. Are you seeing -- how much of it is volume versus starting to see some mix shift up? And are you seeing any change in that combination over the last couple of quarters and maybe even what you're seeing year-to-date so far?","John G. Sznewajs","Yes. Stephen, it's John. I think we are starting to see some improvement in volumes in repair\/remodel activity. I guess, the evidence I would point to is, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, sales to our dealer channel in cabinetry, which is largely a repair\/remodel-oriented channel, were up mid-teens percent in the quarter. So I think that's strong evidence. And if you look across our other big-ticket item that we see is windows. We saw nice repair\/remodel activity there in the fourth quarter as well. So that complemented with our plumbing business, which was up 8%. And that's largely repair\/remodel-oriented products as well. All leads us to believe that volumes are continuing to pick up.","Stephen F. East - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Yes. Are you seeing -- within those pretty big numbers, how much of that would you attribute mix shift versus pure volume?","John G. Sznewajs","In terms of mix, we're not seeing a whole lot of mix at this point. If anything, mix in the cabinet segment was a little bit negative just because, as I mentioned, sales to production builders grew at a more accelerated rate than sales on the repair\/remodel channels. We are starting to see a little bit higher average selling prices in some of our cabinetry products, which is indicative of consumers willing to trade up a little bit within the segment.","Stephen F. East - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, fair enough. And then on the incremental margins, your plumbing and cabinets were strong. So I'm interested in your expectations for sustaining those moving forward. And then the install, paint and other specialty were a bit lower than what we thought, and I guess, your -- what was going on there and your expectations for those?","John G. Sznewajs","Yes, you're right. Stephen, you're right. Incremental margins were strong in a couple of segments, both plumbing and cabinets. Cabinets -- just to refresh everyone's memory, we generally drop about 30% to 35% incremental margins across the company. Our manufacturing segment tend to be a little bit higher, closer to the 30%, 35% range. Our installation segment tends to be a little bit lower, closer to the 25% range. And so yes, indeed, we saw about a 62% incremental margin in cabinetry in the quarter. Some of that was driven by volume increases. And we saw a -- but also some of it has to do with the fact that we've seen some reduced promotional activity on the marketplace, and that helped supplement what we normally see in terms of drop down. On the plumbing side, again just good volume leverage across the board. On installation, you did reference something a little bit lighter in that segment. That, you may have heard, was impacted by $5 million of insurance-related expenses in the quarter which, if you factor that out, they would have there kind of a normal 28%, 30% incremental margin there. Our paint business, as I mentioned, was impacted by about $6 million of investments that we had related to advertising, promotions, international growth. But beyond that, I think we are in generally pretty good shape in that segment. So I feel pretty good about our incremental margins. Overall for the year, we were up 33%, incremental margins. So I think the company is performing as we expected.","Operator","Your next question is from Eric Bosshard of Cleveland Research.","Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company","Two things. One, can you talk a little bit more about January indicator was up mid-single digit? Can you, I guess, give a little bit more color on where December was and how that has translated into January and how we should be thinking about what you've indicated for January?","John G. Sznewajs","Yes. So Eric, December was up high single digits. We previously indicated that October, November were up high single digits and so December has continued that trend. As it relates to January, a couple things. We saw a little bit better business in Europe. They're not experiencing the harsh winter that we're experiencing here so that was some strength. And then the other area, just generally speaking, where we saw some strength is in those segments that serve the warmer climates in the United States. Obviously, the Midwest, the East Coast, Northeast, little bit more impacted by the more difficult weather conditions.","Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company","When you sift through the information there and you think about where things go for '14, can you isolate enough in January to see that it's weather or is there more going on that's influencing the slower results of January?","John G. Sznewajs","I think it's hard to say. Again, remember, Eric, we're up against a pretty tough comp. We were up low double digits in January of 2013. So feels like -- we were pretty happy with the results in January, just given what's going on in the environment today. Remember, January is our -- probably seasonally, our slowest quarter of the year.","Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company","Okay, that's helpful. And then secondly, in the paint business, you've obviously made some investments here for the last couple of quarters. Curious in terms of how much longer the investments continue, when we should see a return to profitability improvement or better incremental margins. And then a little bit of color on the payback you're expecting from the investments that you're making, what that should look like.","John G. Sznewajs","Yes. Eric, a couple of questions embedded in there. But in terms of the investment going forward for 2014, yes, we do expect to continue to invest in international growth in our Pro business. So I would expect some incremental investment, and we'll call those out as we make those investments every quarter. In terms of one of the things that we're focused on, we've always said that yes, gallon growth is a priority here that we're focused on, particularly with our channel partner. And so as a result, we're willing to make these investments because they'll lead to high -- they might not lead to improved operating margin, but they definitely lead to a higher ROA. And we're trying to grow absolute operating profit dollars in addition to that. So I think that's our goal for this segment. And so I think we are accomplishing that. So we might take a little bit lower margin to drive some of these other activities. And I would still expect those to always be a high teens margin business, though, Eric.","Operator","Your next question is from Mike Wood of Macquarie.","Mike Wood - Macquarie Research","Just touch on decorative, you mentioned that paint gallon growth was high single digits, builder hardware was up high teens, yet sales were up 6%. Can you talk to sort of what the puts and takes were in there?","John G. Sznewajs","Yes, so you hit on a couple of the highlights. The other thing that's impacted us from the quarter is that we did have a negative price\/commodity relationship in the quarter.","Mike Wood - Macquarie Research","Okay. And then just on the incremental spending, we went from $10 million in 3Q to $6 million in 4Q. What should we expect going forward?","John G. Sznewajs","As I referenced just in the last question, we do expect to continue to invest for the full year 2014 in some of these additional areas, such as advertising, promotions and international Pro growth, things like that. For the full year 2013, we were about $16 million, $17 million in spend. My guess is we'll be something less than that in 2014 but somewhere in the neighborhood of about $10 million or so.","Operator","The next question's from Garik Shmois of Longbow Research.","Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC","Raw material inflation in installation in the quarter, I was wondering if you can quantify that for us and talk about your confidence and your ability to pass that through.","John G. Sznewajs","I'm sorry, Garik. I missed the first part of your question.","Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC","Yes, sorry. The raw material inflation in installation you called out, I'm just wondering if you could quantify that for us and talk about your confidence in passing that through in 2014.","John G. Sznewajs","Yes, sure. A number of our installation manufacturers from time-to-time have passed through price increases, and we didn't take -- there was another price increase announced that was effective in the fourth quarter of last year. We did -- as you can see by the performance of the segment, they've had posted some pretty good operating results and incremental margins. And as a result, we are working hard on passing pricing through when it's required. At the same time, though, we don't just try to pass price through, we also always work on working with our suppliers, looking on productivity improvements in the segment to try to offset some of those price inflation as well.","Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. And then just switching to cabinets, a competitor of yours has announced plans to add capacity over the next several years. Just wondering if you could speak to, I guess, first off, your utilization rates in that business and your plans, if any, to have to add capacity over the next, call it, 2 years.","Keith J. Allman","Garik, this is Keith. I'll take that one. Our capacity position in cabinets is in great shape, and we expect our current footprint to be able to support 1.5 million in starts, so we're in -- and the commensurate repair\/remodeling uptick. So we're in good shape there. And that goes across all channels. In the builder direct channel, for example, I was just out in Las Vegas at the builder show. And clearly, the #1 concern from the big builders was, \"Are we going to be able to supply on time in great quality?\" And we most certainly will be able to do that. And when you look across the competitive landscape, we've seen some of our biggest competitors actually pull out of the direct-to-builder channel. Out West, we've seen another big competitor stop bidding out there. And we're not approaching that. The team -- in that way. The team has done a great job of getting us ready for this uptick, and we're prepared.","Operator","Your next question is from Adam Rudiger of Wells Fargo Securities.","Adam Rudiger - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","With cabinets, can you talk a little bit more? You talked about it being a less promotional environment. I think you said high teens to the dealer channel and the big builders grew even faster than that. So that would to me suggest a little bit better margins, say, relative to the first quarter when revenues were somewhat flat. So can you just talk about maybe what I'm missing there?","John G. Sznewajs","Yes. I think, Adam, one of the things that you have to focus on is the fact that we kind of led the pullback on promotional activity in the fourth quarter of last year. And so some of the benefits that we enjoyed last year anniversary-ed in the fourth quarter of this year.","Adam Rudiger - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then just to make sure, I'm going to try and get a clear picture of margins. The insurance charge, where was that in the consolidated income statement? And then just to be clear, that was also in installation segment?","John G. Sznewajs","So on a consolidated basis, it flows just generally through the P&L. And then we pushed those costs back down to our segment levels. It's in SG&A in the overall consolidated P&L, and then we pushed it down to several segments. One, the biggest one, obviously, was our installation segment, which we mentioned. And then we also had a little bit of expense in our decorative architectural segment as well.","Operator","Your next question is from Stephen Kim of Barclays.","Stephen S. Kim - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Earlier in your remarks, you had mentioned about $150 million improvement in profit in 2014 from '13. I assume that was just the net volume\/mix, which would sort of compare to $148 million in 2013 versus '12. I just wanted to...","John G. Sznewajs","No. Stephen, it's a little bit different than that. Every year, we talk about our profit improvement on a gross basis. And so in 2013, we realized about $165 million of profit improvements gross, and that netted down to the smaller number about $19 million or so. So in trying to foreshadow that same profit improvement on a gross basis would be for this year, I indicated that it would be approximately $150 million, about the same amount that we've averaged over the last 5 years.","Stephen S. Kim - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Got it. Okay. So that was related to your productivity? I just want to make sure.","John G. Sznewajs","Exactly. You got it.","Stephen S. Kim - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Got it. Okay, got it, got it. Okay, that's great. That's very helpful. And then secondly, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about what you're seeing in terms of cabinets. You mentioned, I think, the dealer up high teens. And you also said your windows were strong. I'm sorry, I didn't mean cabinets, I meant R&R, big-ticket R&R. You pointed to cabinets in the dealer channel being up strongly. You said cabinets x countertop, up 10% and dealer up high teens. I'm curious as to whether or not those numbers are influenced by share gains or something like that. If that sort of high teens type number is, in your view, representative of the move towards big ticket or if there is something else that sort of influencing that number that we should be considering as we think about the market overall.","John G. Sznewajs","Yes, Stephen, it's not just one factor that impacts us. So there's a number of things baked into it. So some of it is, to your point, could be things like higher volume. It could be things like some higher selling prices. We did -- we are realizing some higher average selling prices out there. We have picked up -- we do think we're doing well in terms of some of the new product launches that we came out with, the innovation that KraftMaid came out with in the first half of 2013 seems like it's really resonating in the dealer channel. And so it seems like it's driving more dealer traffic. So there's a number of factors that go into it, it's not just simply one factor that drives the top line growth there.","Stephen S. Kim - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, great. And so if you had to take a stab at what you think sort of big-ticket R&R has done over year-on-year, would you estimate that it would be somewhat higher or lower than that high teens figure?","John G. Sznewajs","I would say that we saw growth each quarter during the year. So it was strongest in the fourth quarter, weakest in the first quarter of last year.","Operator","The next question is from David Goldberg of UBS.","David Goldberg - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I wanted to talk about in the installation business, the comments around the increased take per unit and upgrades. Can you talk a little bit what's happening? Is it the kind of grade of insulation people put in, the amount of insulation? Or are we talking about more ancillary, kind of add-on kind of services people are taking? Could you kind of just give us a rundown of what's driving that commentary?","John G. Sznewajs","Yes. I think there's a couple of things that are driving that comment, David. One, we're seeing increased square footage of homes right now. So that helps drive increased take per unit. We're also seeing, as I mentioned earlier, consumers upgrade some of their products. So they may be adding a second or third fireplace in their home. So it's not necessarily, to your point, always insulation that's driving that trade-up in the installation segment.","David Goldberg - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","But it's not necessarily code changes or anything that are driving higher requirements for...","John G. Sznewajs","Good point. There are some code changes that are taking place that are driving it. Particularly on the Eastern Seaboard, we're seeing some code changes going to affect that are driving some higher insulation usage in homes.","David Goldberg - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Great. And then just as a follow-up question, I understand the desire to pay down debt in the coming year. And obviously, great job deleveraging the balance sheet this year. When you start thinking about returning more cash to shareholders, as you look out, especially since you know obviously the business is headed in the right direction in terms of the cash flow generation, we're probably early in the cycle here. When do we start thinking about maybe other uses of your cash flow generation outside of paying down debt?","John G. Sznewajs","Yes, David, good point. As we think about capital allocation, we think about a couple of things. One, first and foremost, is to always invest in the business. And as you've observed, we're not a particularly capital-intense business. CapEx generally run about 2% of sales. And so we'll continue to make those investments in the business. After that, as you assessed, we'll probably pay down some debt here in the near term. But following those first 2 priorities, I think the next thing was that we'll be focused on are both small acquisitions, tuck-ins like we done at our U.K. window business earlier in 2013. But I think we also have to balance that with some shareholder-friendly activities, probably leaning more towards the dividend first rather than share repurchases. But we'll keep you informed as we refine our thinking around that.","Operator","Your next question is from Keith Hughes of Masco (sic)[SunTrust Robinson Humphrey].","Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Questions on Milgard. The numbers you've been putting up in window just appear a lot bigger than what we're seeing in the overall industry. Can you speak to what's going on there, why the numbers have been so good?","John G. Sznewajs","Yes. I think we've done a lot in the share gains in the Western U.S., Keith. One of the things that took place that we observed during the downturn is that we saw a fair number of competitors fall out of the marketplace in the Western U.S. in 2009, '10 and '11. As a result, if things are starting to pick up out there, the Milgard team has just done a fantastic job of understanding the market, delivering really good, relevant innovation to the marketplace. As a result, taking a lot of share out there. They also have expanded nicely into some new geographies, particularly Western Canada, as well as Texas. And they've come up with a couple of new products that we're pretty positive about. The Essence window, it is a fiberglass window, a higher-end window than their vinyl offering. And we think it has got a lot of opportunity out there.","Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Is that a business, when we talk about bolt-ons to an earlier question, is that one that you would look to bolt on to?","John G. Sznewajs","To the extent that it extends our geography in the right direction, Keith, yes, we probably wouldn't go all the way across the country to the East Coast and look at a transaction. But something that was complementary to our existing footprint, that might make some sense for us.","Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","And final question, we've seen some wobble in the home builder orders in the second half of the year. Can you talk about what kind of your","[Audio Gap]","for the installed service business in regard to that?","John G. Sznewajs","With the softness -- I'm sorry, in terms of just housing starts taking a bit of a pause in the back half there?","Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Yes. How long will that impact, how much, anything you're willing to give us on that?","John G. Sznewajs","Yes, well, we're still seeing the lag in our business, the 90-day lag and depending on the market, it's still a little bit elongated over the course of the back half of last year. There's also an impact that we have to take into account, there's increased multifamily activity in the year. And in particular, that's going to impact us in the first quarter because as I look at the starts composition in the fourth quarter, I think we've got about 37% of all starts are multifamily in the fourth quarter, which will really impact us in the first part of the year. So that will have a little bit of an impact. But what we're hearing, as Keith mentioned earlier in his discussions in Vegas with the builders, it sounds like they're optimistic about the spring selling season. So we'll see how that plays out.","Operator","The next question is from Sam Darkatsh of Raymond James.","Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","And Tim, I wanted to also say best wishes on your next chapter. And Keith, congratulations on the new role and the new responsibilities. Most of my questions have been asked and answered, just a couple of housekeeping questions. The insurance costs, John, are they ongoing? What specifically happened in the fourth quarter? Was it just some sort of a reversal of an allowance? Or will there be some ongoing impacts of these unplanned costs?","John G. Sznewajs","So it was a discrete onetime event that took place, Sam. And they were large enough that we thought that it merited calling them out.","Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay, got you. And then I guess, my final question. Help me understand why the importance on a gallon focus as opposed to, I guess, total sales dollars because it seems as though maybe paint pricing was off or at least price versus commodity was a negative impact. So why does gallon growth lead necessarily to higher ROA? Why wouldn't you want to maintain price as well?","John G. Sznewajs","Well, we absolutely want to do everything we can to grow this business, Sam. But as we think about incremental growth from where we're at, we've got a very good solid core business in our retail paint business. And as we expand internationally, as we expand into the Pro, those will -- there'll be more competitive environments that we're anticipating in and we'll need to have sharper margins. And so as a result, we want to continue the growth, but that just drives lower margins. But the return on assets, as I mentioned, is high because, really, no incremental investment other than working capital, we need to put into the business to grow that.","Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","So the inference being that paid margins right now are pretty much going to be here or perhaps pressured going forward, but the returns on capital will be enhanced?","John G. Sznewajs","That's right. I would say, as I commented earlier, I think we can still maintain our high teens margins in this paint business, but our return on capital should improve over time.","Operator","The next question is from Michael Rehaut of JPMorgan.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Tim, best of luck. Great working with you. Just going back to the paint question before. Can you give us a sense, John, of what a Pro and international sales represent as a total portion of your revenues there? And how should we think about that percent growing over time?","John G. Sznewajs","Mike, right now, we've been investing in those programs for the last year, 18 months or so. And those businesses are -- we have not broken out the specific dollar value of each of those programs to this point. But I'll tell you, it's small but growing. We're crafting our strategies to penetrate both of those markets, and you've seen some initial success. And so we look forward to continuing to share with you the progress that we're making on those. But at this point, we're not going to break that out.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And in terms of the margins, appreciate the kind of bifurcation or discussion around margins versus returns. But from a margin perspective, that high teens, you've done 18% now for a couple of years. Given that you expect to continue to do the investment, maybe a little bit of a negative margin mix shift within the business over time, that 18%, 19%, so that's kind of reasonable going forward for this business?","John G. Sznewajs","Yes, I think so. Mike, what we try to do in this segment is really drive innovation and drive customer value innovation. And that's evidenced, Tim mentioned that we were recognized recently by a third party as the #1 interior paint. I should tell you, we're also been recognized by that same party as the #1 exterior paint and the #1 exterior stain. So we've got kind of a trifecta going right now in terms of quality and value in that. And so really good outcome for us. And that's really what we're focused on in this segment in terms of driving value for our customers.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And just one last one on the plumbing side, you did a nice -- had a nice year this year in terms of top line growth, incremental margins. You're back at around that 13% level, which is kind of, over the last several years, really the high watermark with the exception of about 10, 15 years ago. I think we've talked about a more normalized margin, this low double digit range, 12%, 13%. Is that still the case going forward? And if that's the case, how would you reconcile that with the incremental margins? Are there just other costs to running the business as in promotions or other types of spend that would kind of, again, keep the longer-term run rate, margin run rate for this business around the 12%, 13% level?","Keith J. Allman","Michael, this is Keith. I think that, that range of 12% to 13% is a good way to think about this segment. We do have some upside on the incremental as that drops down in the typical 30% range. But we also have ongoing investments that we're going to continue to make to grow the core faucet business. And when you look at the category expansion opportunities that we have, like we have executed already in toilets, those products tend to have lower margins than the base faucet and fixture market. Having said that, again, similar to our strategy in paint, the ROA is good in that product and it's an outstanding program for us and the customers. But I think that's a good range to think about the segment with perhaps some upside.","Operator","The next question is from Nishu Sood of Deutsche Bank.","Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So my first question is on the CapEx guidance. Now Keith, you addressed in your commentary about the cabinets business, that capacity is good for 1.5 million housing starts. I think you might have extended those comments from the other divisions, too. So it was -- there's a noticeable uptick in your kind of CapEx guidance, back up to the $200 million range for 2014. So I just wanted to dig into that. If capacity is all set, what is driving the increase in expected CapEx for '14?","John G. Sznewajs","Yes. Nishu, I'll take that question. A couple of things that, I think, are driving that. So I'll tell you that, one, we had the ERP implementation at our Milgard unit that we talked about, which will have a fair amount of capital associated with that. We typically have higher capital in our plumbing segment. And Hansgrohe is launching some new products, so there will be some higher CapEx associated with that. We also have some -- a little bit of a higher incremental CapEx in our cabinet segment related more to finishing up a little bit of some IT implementation that they're working on, a little bit of finishing equipment. The other thing I'd keep in mind, Nishu, is on this call this time last year, we told you we have $165 million of capital. We came in at $126 million. So if anything, I think probably $200 million is a little bit on the high side. Offsetting that might be -- we're taking a look at displays on the marketplace, and there might need to be some money spent to refresh some of the displays on both the paint and on the cabinet side of things.","Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Got it. Okay, that's helpful. In the installation business, you mentioned, I think it was 15 new branches that you added in '13, you expect in '14 as well, all greenfield sites. Now historically, acquisitions has been the main way of adding branches in this business. So I was just wondering if you could discuss that. Is there some shift in strategy-wise or is there some shift in what you're seeing in terms of the market, making greenfield more attractive than acquisitions? If you could maybe just give us some more color on that.","John G. Sznewajs","Sure. I think it's the way the team is looking -- the new team down at MCS is looking at the way they're growing their business. And so they've done a very thoughtful way of making certain that they've got costs in line with sales as they grow. So there's greenfield locations start out as unmanned stocking centers. And as a certain market grows to the appropriate volume, then they'll start to man those centers. And so they're very closely monitoring their profitability and making certain that they have their costs in line with expenses. So I think that they have just a little bit different view on the marketplace.","Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Does that mean that they've really deemphasized acquisitions then? Or is this just current conditions, that's what it merits and maybe that will change going forward?","John G. Sznewajs","Over time, could they look at an acquisition here or there? I don't think it's a huge part of their strategy going forward. But if there's something, in particular, that it's a long distance away, where they could not establish one of these strategic stocking centers that gets them into a new geographic location, they may look at an acquisition there. But it's not what's driving their strategy at this point.","Operator","Your next question is from Bob Wetenhall of RBC Capital Markets.","Robert C. Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Thinking about pretty strong end-market demand, so I'm assuming somewhere around $700 million of top line growth in '14. And I was curious, what gives you confidence that you can keep spending on general corporate expenses flat, given that pace of sales growth? And for Keith, how important do you view cost control on your list of 2014 priorities?","John G. Sznewajs","Yes. I'll take the question on general corp expense, Bob. So the $130 million of general corporate expense that we roughly experienced this year is about $134 million, I believe, versus $130 million that we have given you some guidance. A number of things. Obviously, we're focused on very tight cost control here at the corporate office. We did do go through an org alignment process in the fall of 2012, and we're starting to realize some of the benefits of those savings. And so that's really what gives us the comfort, Bob, that we can hang on to some of the cost takeouts that we've done over the course of time. But I'll turn it over to Keith for his view on cost containment broadening.","Keith J. Allman","Yes. Bob, I would say that our #1 priority going forward is to deliver on the macroeconomic rebound here in North America and to drive our businesses to their full potential and to leverage our brands. So embedded in that certainly is a strong dose of cost control, both from a conversion cost standpoint in our factories, as well as in SG&A. That's an area that I have experience in and have done at the various businesses I've been involved with. So I would put that as a premium priority for myself and our team. In addition, we're focusing on leveraging across our businesses. There certainly is a revenue component and a cost component to that. We view areas like logistics and our material buy as prime for continuing to drive cost out in that area. So it's tough to say what's 1 and 1A when you have 4 #1s. But certainly, cost control is a priority for us.","Robert C. Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","That's helpful. And I just wanted to get your view kind of on a 3-year basis. You had 600 basis points of improvement in cabinets in 2013. You had over 400 basis points of improvement, installation, in that business. So that's a lot of improvement in a year. Do you think it's realistic for us to expect that both cabinets and installation can get back to double digit operating margins within the next 3 years?","John G. Sznewajs","Yes, Bob. In terms of getting back to double digit operating margins for both those segments, I think there's the possibility. It all depends on how the end markets develop, both in the new construction side, as well the repair\/remodel side. As we've talk about incremental margins, generally dropped about 30%, 35% of the cabinet business, a little bit less than 30% on the installation business. So if you grow from the kind of the 920,000 starts in '13 to 1.5 million starts, the long-term average, and you think about the incremental revenue associated with that growth and associated lift in repair\/remodel activity, particularly for the cabinet segment, and then you consider the operating margin drop down or the incremental margin drop down that we get on those businesses, you can paint a pretty clear picture of getting to clearly, if not high single digit, low double digit operating margins in each segment.","Keith J. Allman","Bob, on the cabinet side, we're confident in being able to drive that business to low double digits. We have the best brands out there in the marketplace. As we talked about a little bit earlier, we have the capacity to take the growth as it comes. And we've structured that business to have a balance across all channels of direct-to-builder, repair and remodeling and dealer. And we're making improvements on all of those areas, and those are things that the competition can't necessarily say. So we're confident about the cabinet business, understanding fully that we've got a ways to go.","Operator","Your next question is from Dennis McGill of Zelman & Associates.","Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, LLC","I guess, the first question. With respect to weather, aside from it impacting ability for customers to get out and shop, are there any impacts on the operational side of the business that you'd flag or that we should be aware of?","Keith J. Allman","We've had some very slight interruptions in some of our factories. We've had to take a few half days off here and there, but nothing material.","John G. Sznewajs","Yes. And on the installation side, we had a couple of branches down in the southeast last week during the ice storm.","Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, LLC","Okay. So assuming the quarter plays out weather-wise in a more normal fashion from here, absorption pace or anything like that shouldn't be impacted?","John G. Sznewajs","That's right.","Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, LLC","Okay. And then secondly for maybe Keith, it seems like you guys might have reentered the RTA business on the cabinet side. Just wanted to maybe understand the thought process there and how you're thinking about that relative to your exit previously.","Keith J. Allman","Yes. As we listen to our customers, it's important for us to have the right assortment for their needs. And we are looking at some product offerings that could address some of those needs for -- particularly for multifamily. So there are some new product launches that we're contemplating, but we're not looking at significantly getting into the RTA business.","Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, LLC","Is it structured differently from a cost standpoint than it was previously?","Keith J. Allman","Most certainly, this would be more of an import model with a combination of different features that address specific segments, like multifamily, as I mentioned.","Timothy Wadhams","Yes. I want to thank everybody again for being with us today, and appreciate your questions, and have a good rest of the day. Take care.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today's conference.

As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded for replay purposes.","I will now turn the call over to David Chaika, Vice President, Treasurer and Investor Relations. You may begin.","David Chaika - Masco Corp.","Thank you and good morning. Welcome to Masco Corporation's 2018 third quarter conference call. With me today are Keith Allman, President and CEO of Masco; and John Sznewajs, Masco's Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Our third quarter earnings release and the presentation slides we will refer to today are available on our website under Investor Relations. Following our remarks, we will open the call for analyst questions. Please limit yourself to one question with one follow-up. If we can't take your question now, please call me directly at 313-792-5500.","Our statements today will include our views about our future performance, which constitute forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risk and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. We describe these risk and uncertainties in our risk factors and other disclosures in our Form 10-K and our Form 10-Q that we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Our statements will also include non-GAAP financial measures. Our references to operating profit and earnings per share will be as adjusted, unless otherwise noted. We reconcile these adjusted measurements to GAAP in our earnings release and the presentation slides, which are available on our website under Investor Relations.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to Keith.","Keith J. Allman - Masco Corp.","Thank you, Dave. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Please turn to slide 4. In the third quarter, our top line increased 9% excluding the impact of currency, driven by strong growth in our North American Plumbing operations, our Cabinet business and our acquisition of Kichler Lighting earlier this year. Excluding the impact of currency, acquisitions and divestitures, sales grew 4%. Operating profit grew $10 million and we achieved 15.2% operating margin in the quarter due to higher volume, price and disciplined cost control. Our EPS increased 25% to $0.65 per share.","Turning to our segment performance, our Plumbing segment grew 4% or 5% in local currency, driven by outstanding North American Plumbing growth of 9%. Delta had a record sales quarter with strong growth across all channels and price points. Our upper price point Brizo products, our entry-level Peerless products, bathing fixtures and toilets, all experienced strong growth. Additionally, Watkins continued its strong performance due to model refreshes in its dealer channel and an expanded product offering in the retail channel. While North American Plumbing was strong this quarter, international Plumbing declined 1% in local currency, primarily due to softness in Central Europe. This was partially offset by continued strength in China.","In our Decorative Architectural segment, sales grew 20%. Excluding our acquisition of Kichler Lighting, sales grew 1%, with high single-digit growth in pro paint and strong performance in decorative hardware, largely offset by a decline in DIY paint. While the DIY paint market was softer than expected, we believe our competitive advantage of having the highest quality, best value paint sold exclusively at The Home Depot positions us well.","Moving on to Cabinetry, our Cabinet segment delivered robust 11% growth excluding the divestiture of Moores. This growth was led by our repair and remodel business in both the retail and dealer channels. The roll-out and initial months of the Menards program have gone well, and we are on plan to achieve an $80 million annual sales run rate during the fourth quarter. While we are pleased with our top line performance in Cabinetry, we experienced slightly unfavorable mix as we ramped up the Menards business and experienced an increase in logistics costs, both of which will likely continue into the fourth quarter.","Turning to Windows, sales were down 3% mostly due to the difficult 12% comp in our U.S. business and softness in the UK market. Moving to capital allocation, we continued our share repurchase activity in the quarter by repurchasing 2.3 million shares for approximately $89 million, bringing our year-to-date share repurchase total to $354 million. Based on current market conditions and our liquidity, we now plan to allocate up to $300 million to share repurchases in the fourth quarter, bringing our expected 2018 share repurchase total to approximately $650 million.","This share repurchase activity is in addition to the $550 million allocated to the Kichler acquisition and the $114 million allocated to debt reduction, demonstrating our strong free cash flow generation and balanced capital allocation strategy. Lastly, we are updating our anticipated earnings per share for 2018 to be in the range of $2.39 to $2.44. This is largely due to the lower than expected volumes in our DIY coatings and international Plumbing businesses and modestly lower margin expectations for Cabinetry.","Now, I'd like to turn the call over to John, who will go over our operational and financial performance in detail, including the potential impact from tariffs. John?","John G. Sznewajs - Masco Corp.","Thank you, Keith, and good morning, everyone. As Dave mentioned, most of my comments will focus on adjusted performance excluding the impact of rationalization charges, inventory step-up related to purchase accounting for the Kichler acquisition and other one-time items. Also, as a reminder, any prior period comparisons have been adjusted to reflect the adoption of the new revenue recognition and pension accounting rules.","Turning to slide 6, we delivered solid top line and earnings per share growth in the third quarter. On a reported basis, sales increased 8% or 9% in local currency. Excluding acquisitions and divestiture, sales increased 3% or 4% in local currency. Foreign currency translation negatively impacted our third quarter revenue by approximately $12 million. In local currency, North American sales increased 12% in the quarter or 5% excluding acquisitions.","We believe the outlook for our repair and remodel demand remains healthy, and we continue to experience solid demand for many of our industry-leading repair and remodeling products. As a reminder, repair\/remodel activity represents approximately 84% of our total sales. In local currencies, international sales decreased 6% in the quarter. Excluding the divestiture of Moores, international sales decreased 2%, driven by market softness in our international operations, particularly in the UK and Central Europe, partially offset by continued strong growth in China.","Gross margins were 32.7%, down 110 basis points, largely due to the acquisition of Kichler. Our SG&A as a percent of sales improved 40 basis points to 17.5%, as we continue to leverage our SG&A, while making strategic investments to drive profitable growth. Our operating profit increased 3% to $320 million with operating margins of 15.2%. As we discussed on last quarter's call, operating margins were impacted in the third quarter by ERP costs and continued inefficiencies in our Windows business. We also experienced strong growth from lower price point products in North American Plumbing and Cabinets, which resulted in unfavorable mix.","Our EPS was $0.65, a 25% improvement compared to the third quarter of 2017. As Keith mentioned, we are updating our estimated annual EPS range to $2.39 to $2.44. Principal items that affect this change are softness in the DIY paint and international Plumbing markets that Keith described, as well as continued cost pressures in logistics and distribution, primarily in Cabinetry.","Turning to slide 7, our Plumbing segment sales increased 4%. Excluding the impact of currency and acquisitions, sales increased 5%. This performance was driven by solid growth in our North American faucet, shower and spa businesses. Foreign currency translation unfavorably impacted this segment's sales by approximately $9 million in the quarter. Our North American sales grew 9% in local currency, as we experienced strong demand for our industry-leading brands across our wholesale, retail, dealer and e-commerce channels.","As Keith mentioned, Delta delivered a record sales quarter. Additionally, our spa business continued to outperform the competition, as Watkins Wellness leveraged its strong dealer network, innovative new products and industry-leading brands to drive growth.","Our international Plumbing sales decreased 1% in local currency, as European markets were softer than expected. This was partially offset by strong growth in China. As a reminder, our international sales were up against a tough comp as we experienced strong double-digit growth in Germany and China in the third quarter of 2017.","Turning to segment profitability, operating margins were impacted by a lag in price\/cost and the implementation of Delta's new ERP system. The lag in price\/cost is principally due to lower volumes in Europe resulting in less price realization than anticipated. Mix also impacted margins largely due to our lower price point Peerless faucet program win at retail and increased sales of bathing products and toilets at retail. For the full-year, given the recent softness in our international Plumbing markets, we expect operating margins for this segment to be down slightly as compared to 2017.","Turning to slide 8, the Decorative Architectural Products segment grew 20%. Excluding the acquisition of Kichler, sales grew 1%. Foreign currency translation unfavorably impacted this segment's sales by approximately $3 million in the quarter. This sales performance was driven by a high single-digit growth in Behr's pro paint business, continued growth in retail and e-commerce channels at Liberty, our builders' hardware business. This growth was partially offset by a low single-digit decline in Behr's DIY paint business.","We continue to be pleased with the progress we are making with the integration of Kichler, and its annualized sales for 2018 are expected to be approximately $430 million. Compared to the third quarter of 2017, operating income increased 6%, while operating margins declined to 17.7%, largely due to the lower margin profile of Kichler, including the higher depreciation and amortization expense that resulted from the acquisition. For the full-year, we expect margins in this segment to be in the upper end of our 16.5% to 18.5% range. As a reminder, this segment faces a difficult comparison in the fourth quarter, as segment sales grew 12% in the fourth quarter of 2017.","Turning to slide 9, in our Cabinetry segment, sales increased 11% in the quarter excluding the impact of the Moores divestiture. This strong performance was driven by our industry-leading brands, as we experienced double-digit growth in our repair and remodel business through increased volume and favorable price. Our existing home center and dealer business experienced solid growth in the quarter. In addition, our program at Menards continues to gain traction and we are pleased with this program's initial performance.","Segment profitability increased in the quarter by $3 million, principally due to increased volume, partially offset by increased logistics cost and product mix. For the full-year, we continue to expect 5% to 7% sales growth excluding the Moores divestiture. However, we now expect operating margins for the full-year to decline approximately 150 basis points due to logistics cost pressures and mix that we experienced in Q3 and we expect to continue into the fourth quarter.","Turning to slide 10, our Windows segment sales decreased 3%. In the third quarter, we continued to experience market softness in the UK. In North America, Milgard's favorable pricing and a continued mix shift toward our premium window and door products was offset by lower volume, as sales matched prior year despite facing a difficult 12% sales comp from the third quarter of last year.","Segment profitability decreased primarily due to approximately $5 million of incremental costs, as we continued to address inefficiencies related to warranty and service in the U.S., as we discussed on the second quarter call. For the full-year, we continue to expect this segment's sales growth to be 3% to 5% excluding currency and divestitures, with operating margins down approximately 100 basis points compared to 2017.","Turning to slide 11, we ended the quarter with approximately $600 million of balance sheet liquidity, as well as full availability on our $750 million revolving credit facility. Working capital as a percent of sales increased 100 basis points versus prior year to 15.5%, largely due to the impact of the Kichler acquisition. For the full-year, we expect working capital as a percent of sales to be approximately 15%. Further, we are pleased with the overall strength of our balance sheet, as our net debt to EBITDA now stands at 1.8 times.","During the third quarter, we continued our focus on shareholder value creation by repurchasing 2.3 million shares valued at approximately $89 million, bringing our year-to-date total to $354 million. With our strong free cash flow and balanced approach to capital allocation, we expect to deploy approximately $300 million in share buybacks in the fourth quarter of 2018. This will bring our total expected capital deployment in 2018 to acquisitions, share repurchases, dividends and debt reduction to more than $1.4 billion.","Before turning the call back over to Keith, I want to help frame for you the potential financial impact of the tariffs as we head into 2019. Please turn to slide 12. As you can see on this slide, we import approximately $600 million of components and finished goods that fall under the tariffs. Please keep in mind this is a rounded approximation subject to numerous variables such as volume, currency and mix. To put this in perspective, if the 301 tariffs rise to 25% as planned on January 1, this would amount to approximately $150 million of inflation or roughly 2.7% of our annual cost of goods sold.","This is less than the amount of raw material and other inflation that we effectively dealt with in 2018. We believe this amount of additional cost is manageable through a combination of price increases, supplier negotiations, supply chain repositioning and other internal productivity measures. We have initiated actions and plans on each of these elements already here in 2018, but recognize there may be a lag between tariff implementation and mitigation in 2019.","We expect little impact of these tariffs in the fourth quarter of 2018 due to the timing of the tariff implementation and our inventory positions on the products affected. You can see that our Plumbing segment is the most impacted by the tariffs. As the plumbing industry leader, we have a broad product assortment much more than faucets and showers and have significant manufacturing facilities in Indiana, Tennessee, California, North Carolina and Texas. Many competitors such as private label source nearly 100% of their products from China. So, we would have a competitive advantage against these competitors.","With that, I'll now turn the call back over to Keith.","Keith J. Allman - Masco Corp.","Thank you, John. 2018 has been a dynamic year and we expect to grow our earnings per share approximately 25% in spite of raw material and logistics inflation and tariff challenges. We're executing to address these cost challenges and remain focused on leveraging our industry-leading brands, innovation pipelines and channel expertise, and we are driving top and bottom line growth.","We believe that the fundamentals of the repair and remodel market are supportive of solid long-term growth. Demographics should drive household formations for housing for years to come, as the large millennial generation has started forming households. Home price appreciation, which has a strong correlation with repair and remodel spending, remains strong at nearly 6% year-over-year. The average age of the housing stock continues to increase, as 65% of the U.S. housing stock is now over 30 years old, and older homes have more repair and remodel spending per home than newer homes.","GDP growth rate is at a four-year high. Unemployment is at a 50-year low and consumer confidence remains at a 15-year high. We continue to see strong growth in many of our product categories and believe that a strong economy has the greatest correlation with sales of our repair and remodel products. We will continue to execute our strategies against these favorable market fundamentals and will deploy our strong cash flow in a disciplined and balanced approach between acquisitions with the right fit and return, share repurchases and dividends to create value for our shareholders.","With that, we'll now open the call for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Stephen Kim of Evercore ISI.","Stephen Kim - Evercore ISI","Thanks very much, guys, and thanks for all the information. It was very helpful. The outlook seems reasonable. I guess I just wanted to ask a question to start off about the U.S. business generally. You talked about the fact \u2013 the factors that would drive continued strength in R&R, and certainly, the economy is what matters most.","However, one of the things that's recently been impacting our whole space is the rising rates, and an aspect of that has been some concerns that you would see a slowdown in mobility, effectively that folks who have a low mortgage rate on their home \u2013 on their mortgage product are choosing not to move because they don't want to give that low rate up.","And I was curious if you could talk a little bit about how you see this issue affecting your company, the demand for R&R generally in your company specifically over the next few years. Do you think this is much ado about nothing? Do you think that there are reasons to believe that people who stay will spend more on remodeling than when they look to move or other dynamics like that, if you could just talk about the issue?","Keith J. Allman - Masco Corp.","Stephen, we think that our R&R concentration, which as we've talked is about 85% of our revenue, puts us in a place where we can take advantage of these trends. Without a doubt, the rising rates and the increase in home price appreciation is putting a bit of a pinch on affordability. However, when you look at the dynamic of what happens when people choose to stay in their home, be it because of overall affordability, the need to move to another house at a higher mortgage rate, et cetera, oftentimes what they see \u2013 and it's somewhat of a countercyclical trend between R&R and new construction \u2013 is that when they stay in their home, they'll now pull the trigger on a major remodel.","So, much like home price appreciation, where home price appreciation can tend to dampen a little bit on \u2013 the movement on a new construction, home price appreciation is very tightly correlated, one of the best correlations that we see, to R&R spend. So, as home prices increase, people feel better about pulling the ticket on an R&R project. As people tend to stay in their house longer, they feel better about an R&R spend. So, overall, when we look at the repair and remodeling market, we think it's strong because fundamentally it's consumer-driven and the consumer's strong.","Stephen Kim - Evercore ISI","Got it. And with respect to that as kind of a follow-up, I was curious as to how you felt like some of the different segments that you operate in might be \u2013 might experience this dynamic differently. Would it be more beneficial to Cabinets, let's say, relative to Decorative Architecture? And sort of wrapped up around that, in Dec Arch, you talked about paint being softer this quarter. I was curious as to how much weather may have impacted the sales this quarter. Was it \u2013 did you see primarily a slowdown in outdoor paint, because I know it's been unbelievably wet here in the Northeast at least? It probably would have been very difficult to do a lot of outdoor painting jobs.","Keith J. Allman - Masco Corp.","In terms of the segment impact as it relates to people staying in their homes longer, really we don't see a material change segment to segment. Really, it's a question of big ticket versus small ticket. And when you are committed to staying in your home longer, that generally bodes well for pulling the trigger on a bigger ticket item. But when we look at the data and we look at our expectations, there's really not a material difference as it relates to segment impact. We think the DIY market is strong. We're strong in DIY across all segments, and therefore, it's pretty consistent.","With regard to weather, we didn't call it out specifically, tend not to do that. But yeah, when we look at August\/September and we look at the heat map, if you will, around the country, the West was okay. But boy, the East Coast was really wet and it was very hot as well. So, yeah, that probably had a little bit of an impact.","Stephen Kim - Evercore ISI","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Doug Clark of Goldman Sachs.","Doug Clark - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hey, thanks for taking my question and good morning. My first question is on tariffs, and thanks for all the detail that you've provided there. I'm curious in terms of how long you would expect the time lag to be between kind of the imposition of a 25% tariff to the extent that it takes place and how quickly you could kind of right-size that in terms of the pricing and cost and\/or the other actions that you mentioned.","John G. Sznewajs - Masco Corp.","Hey, Doug. Good morning. It's John. With regard to the tariffs, we think that there might be a quarter or two lag in getting full realization of our pricing actions. So, we think we can do it fairly promptly. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we have already begun some of those conversations here in the fourth quarter. So, we feel pretty good about how those conversations have begun. There might be a little bit of a lag between, like I said, implementation and realization.","Doug Clark - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay, thanks. And then, I know you mentioned or talked a little bit about Plumbing and kind of your manufacturing footprint in the U.S. I'm curious on the lighting side, so with Kichler in particular, which I assume is a majority of the Dec Arch exposure there. Any differences in terms of ability to get pricing or just kind of the globalized supply chain?","Keith J. Allman - Masco Corp.","You're right, Doug. The majority of the tariff impact in Dec Arch is Kichler. We design and manage assortments and source from the Far East like basically the entire industry. So, from a competitive standpoint, we think we're right in there with everybody else. So, that really should not affect our ability to get price.","John G. Sznewajs - Masco Corp.","And Doug, I would just add to Keith's comment. In Dec Arch, we also have Liberty Hardware, which is a builders' hardware business, largely a source and sell. And that industry is structured similarly to the lighting industry. So, there's a lot of import there and same dynamics that Keith mentioned with lighting will apply here.","Doug Clark - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","All right, great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Nishu Sood of Deutsche Bank.","Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you. On the tariffs, you folks have shown a good ability to pass on price in terms of a rising input cost this year. 25% is a pretty large number. As you look across where the tariffs are going to raise prices ultimately, areas where it's unavoidable, how do you think \u2013 where are you concerned that it might slow demand?","Keith J. Allman - Masco Corp.","Well, I think that's the million dollar question and that remains to be seen. This is a unique situation that we're in to say the least, in that the majority of our elasticity data and data analytics is around a stable market. And what we're seeing here, Nishu, is the entire \u2013 in many cases, the entire competitive space, like in lighting or hardware like we just talked about, is going to go up.","Some of the issues or some of the correlation would be around overall ticket size and the overall impact as it relates to, say, a light or something more significant. So, it remains to be seen. We're going to watch the price elasticity and adjust accordingly. But now, our focus is on managing our supply chain, working with our suppliers to drive productivity, making supply chain moves, and we're focusing on margin and getting price.","Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Got it, got it. Okay. And then, my follow-up question was on Plumbing. A lot of the metals complex prices have begun to come down. There was some lag this quarter in price versus cost, I think, you mentioned, John, because of lower volumes in Europe. When should we expect the benefits of the lower metals prices to come through in Plumbing?","John G. Sznewajs - Masco Corp.","Yeah. Nishu, if you think how the base metals flow through and impact our Plumbing segment, it's generally about on a two-quarter lag that we feel it through the P&L on our financial statements. And so, given the pricing trends in both copper and zinc, which are the two that primarily impact our cost of sales, I would guess that we would start to feel the impact of the lower prices here late in the fourth quarter and the beginning of the first quarter of 2019.","Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Lovallo of Bank of America.","John Lovallo - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions as well. First question is you guys are clearly still pretty bullish on the R&R cycle in the U.S, which is encouraging. What do you think is going on in DIY? Is this \u2013 in DIY paint specifically. Is this just the shift more towards do-it-for-me or is there something more structural going on here?","Keith J. Allman - Masco Corp.","Well, I think paint's always \u2013 DIY paint is inherently a bit choppy quarter-to-quarter and it's difficult to call with precision exactly (00:29:33) where the market is, particularly on a quarter-to-quarter basis. There's some dynamics there. Certainly, the overall quality of the paint is improving. We've had a paint and primer-in-one that has had an effect over the past years. There's been an increase of renters versus buyers if you look at over the past several years, and renters tend to paint a little bit less. But fundamentally, we think as millennials are moving into the household formations, and when you look at the average age of that cohort and the inevitable arrival of children and that move towards household formations, we think that bodes well for the underlying demand as it relates to DIY.","John Lovallo - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, that's helpful. And then, maybe just touching on the international businesses, recognizing that there was a tough comp, I think you guys did call out a little bit of softening in the market. Is there anything that you could attribute that to and what are you guys thinking about going forward there?","John G. Sznewajs - Masco Corp.","I think in the UK, John, part of that has to do with the fact that I think we see just the economy pulling back a little bit as they are starting to contend with the Brexit issues and the unknowns that go along with that. And in Central Europe, I think it was just a bit of a pause. We've seen very good strength in our European businesses and in China over the course of the last multiple quarters. And because of the tough comp, we don't attribute any significant softening to the overall market. It's \u2013 we just think it might have been a bit of a pause.","John Lovallo - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from Michael Wood of Nomura Instinet.","Mason Marion - Nomura Instinet","Hi, this is Mason Marion on for Mike. What are the trends in the pro gallon growth in paint? Are you seeing more of a competitive response than you were previously and will you need to discount more in the future?","Keith J. Allman - Masco Corp.","We continue to do very well in that segment. We think we've got a very good value proposition to the targeted painters that we're going after, who are shopping at The Home Depot, and that's a big \u2013 call it a $4 billion market. And it's a better solution to not have to make a better or an additional trip to get your paint. And we have the best quality, and our service is improving and the service is very good, and we've got these outstanding points of sale in The Home Depot. So, we like our performance in paint. We're going to continue to drive that.","In terms of competition, yeah, it's tough competition, there's no question about it. We're up against some very, very good competitors that I respect very much, and we're competing. But as I said, when you have the quality of the paint, the quality of the brand, the quality of the service and a great partner like we do, we like our chances of continuing to gain share.","Mason Marion - Nomura Instinet","All right, great. Thank you. And then, on the impressive growth in the Cabinet segment, was the strength broad-based or were there particular segments that were stronger than others?","John G. Sznewajs - Masco Corp.","I would say that this has to do with \u2013 our semi-custom business was actually quite strong, both on our \u2013 the two big-box retailers that we had traditionally served along with the new program at Menards. But then also our dealer channel saw very strong growth in the semi-custom offering. So, it was \u2013 that KraftMaid brand does really well, it resonates great with designers, and so they're great advocates for us as consumers walk into whether it's a big-box store or whether it's a local dealer. We feel really good about how KraftMaid has performed here in the third quarter of the year.","Mason Marion - Nomura Instinet","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Susan Maklari of Credit Suisse.","Susan Maklari - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Thank you. Good morning. My first question is just around the tariffs as well. Are you seeing any pull-forward of demand or any sort of shifts in terms of some of your overseas suppliers that could cause some disruptions, especially as maybe we look to the first half of next year?","Keith J. Allman - Masco Corp.","Not really, Susan, I mean, not in a material way.","Susan Maklari - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. And then, on the tariffs as well, you mentioned that obviously price is sort of the first step in dealing with the situation. But as we look out, you also did mention some changes to your supply chain. How should we think about that as part of the strategy? What would you need to see in order to pursue that and maybe how would it sort of come together across the different segments?","Keith J. Allman - Masco Corp.","It certainly is a component. We're looking at supplier negotiations, we're looking at productivity improvements in our own shops, and certainly, we're looking at repositioning the supply chain. It could involve moving some of our assembly here. I'll remind you that we have a significant footprint in the United States across all of our segments, particularly in Plumbing and in Cabinets. So, moving all or parts of the process onshore, working with our suppliers to set up manufacturing in other locations is another option, and we've initiated these options already and it's going well.","We have experience in doing this. You may recall back sometime in our Plumbing business, where we had the no-lead legislation that came at us like a freight train in terms of AB1953, and we had to go from leaded brass to non-leaded brass, and that represented about a 30% increase. So, in terms of how to drive price, how to effectively move supply chains, and importantly, how to manage it. This is very manageable, but we're paying attention to it. We have a tariff task force that we've set up. John, myself and all of our group presidents meet every week. The team is responding very well. We're taking it seriously, but we're going to work through it and we have experience to do it and we're pulling a number of levers to get it done.","Susan Maklari - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Matthew Bouley of Barclays.","Matthew Bouley - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. Thank you for taking my questions. So, you've called out mix pressures in, I guess, both Cabinetry and Plumbing. So, Keith, I'd just love to hear your thoughts on kind of whether this customer trade-down effect is something that you're really anticipating through the cycle here. And accordingly, how should we think about the profitability of your products at different price points and assuming that that lower price point seems to be the area where there is greater demand at this point? Thank you.","Keith J. Allman - Masco Corp.","Matthew, I'd start by saying that it's really \u2013 we're not seeing a customer trade-down. What we're seeing is good wins in that lower margin product. So, through good assortment win work and good commercial sales force, we went out, we won a nice program in Peerless. That's the opening price point, which does have a little bit less margin. We're seeing growth in our bathing products, which is due to a reset that we had in the big-box aisle. So, happy about that. And our toilet program, which again is a tweak to the assortment, where we're seeing good growth.","So, when you think about our global Plumbing platform, we have a continuum of margin from \u2013 on the lower side, say, our bathing and our toilet products and then up through accessories and then up into the high margin faucets and shower systems. So, we're seeing good growth based on our target assortment and sales initiatives, but we're also seeing good growth up at the high-end. Our spas in our Plumbing business, high-end, very discretionary, high-end tickets are selling very well, as we talked about with Watkins Wellness. Our Axor product line, which is the high-end product line for Hansgrohe, is doing well. Our Brizo product line, which we talked about in the prepared remarks, is continuing to do well. So, we're seeing bimodal growth. It's not a shift.","So, we like that. In terms of Cabinetry, as planned, the stock cabinetry at Menards will sell faster during the initial resets, because it requires significantly less training. But as we train in the associates and as we get this business rolling, that will improve. So, I'm not troubled by the mix shift. I think that's a sign of good sales work and good assortment work.","Matthew Bouley - Barclays Capital, Inc.","All right, that's helpful color. Thank you. Second question, just on Plumbing specifically, the guidance for the full-year for \u2013 I guess you termed it a slight decline year-over-year in operating margins \u2013 would still suggest a rather large step-up in the fourth quarter sequentially, which is unusual for that segment seasonally. So, is there any finer point you can give us on how to think about the Plumbing margins specifically as we look to the fourth quarter? Thank you.","John G. Sznewajs - Masco Corp.","Yeah. Matthew, just to refresh everyone's memory, in the fourth quarter of last year, we had some significant spend as it relates to some of the displays that we were putting in at Delta, which was in the amount of roughly $8 million. And so, we don't think we'll be incurring \u2013 we won't be incurring that spend in the fourth quarter of that year. So, that should contribute to a pretty significant margin improvement sequentially from Q3 to Q4.","Matthew Bouley - Barclays Capital, Inc.","All right. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from Michael Rehaut of JPMorgan.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks. Good morning, everyone. First question \u2013 and I apologize if I missed this earlier. In terms of the guidance reduction, I believe you kind of cited two key drivers \u2013 two or three key drivers being a little bit softer DIY, a little bit weaker international, as well as the higher commodity and logistics cost. I was hoping if you could kind of give by degree of magnitude what each of those drivers represented as part of the \u2013 in terms of the degree of magnitude of influence on the guidance reduction.","John G. Sznewajs - Masco Corp.","Yeah. Sure, Mike. It's John. In terms of \u2013 the way we look at it, if you think about the various components that we mentioned, if you think about the softness in the DIY paint and international Plumbing markets, that kind of aggregated probably 80%. The balance 20% was related to some of the continued cost pressures in logistics and distribution.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great, great. And then, just more broadly, as you think about kind of the sales trends during the quarter, obviously, a lot of your peers have kind of cited some softening that occurred during the quarter, maybe particularly, I guess, in August and even more so in September. Just wanted to get your thoughts, by segment, if that's something you witnessed across the board, were there any segments that you kind of saw that more prominently than others. Obviously, paint might come to mind there. But anything in terms of how it trended during the quarter, and by segment, if any product lines or channels for that matter witnessed more of that type of deceleration than others?","Keith J. Allman - Masco Corp.","Broadly speaking, there wasn't a significant difference as we look across the segments with maybe the exception of paint in August\/September timeframe, when it was quite wet and there was some heat. We \u2013 obviously, when the hurricanes are coming through, we're not going to be selling a whole lot of product. But I didn't see a particular \u2013 we didn't see a particular channel-specific hit or a segment-specific hit.","John G. Sznewajs - Masco Corp.","And Mike, as you consider, through the quarter, we had pretty good consistency through the quarter as well. There wasn't either peaks or valleys within the quarter either.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Can I just squeeze one more in? As you're looking at the full-year for 2018, I was curious if you could give us a sense overall what you think you've been able to achieve from a pricing standpoint versus other offsets that you've put into place to combat the raw material inflation.","John G. Sznewajs - Masco Corp.","Yeah. Mike, so as we think about how things developed through the course of the year, obviously, we've seen fairly significant inflation in the input costs in a variety of our products, including copper and zinc, which we touched on, on a previous question. But we've also seen some of that same inflation impact our Plumbing \u2013 or our paint business, I should say, as both TiO2 and engineered resins have increased fairly significantly through the course of the year. We're seeing TiO2 continue to be up, but not perhaps at the same rate that it was up earlier in the year.","And if you're thinking about our Cabinet Products, we did experience some inflation on some of the hardwoods that go into our Cabinet Products earlier in the year, and that's continuing a little bit here. And then, here toward the middle part of the year, we saw a little bit of increase in distribution and logistics costs. So, all that inflation has hit us. As we look into \u2013 across the year, we absorbed a little bit of that inflation in the first half. As we look at the second half though, we still think we're going to be price\/cost neutral for the second half the year. So, we feel like we've gotten on top of this and we're in a really good position as we enter 2019.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Mike Dahl of RBC Capital Markets.","Michael Dahl - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. My first question goes back to the comments early on about the Menards business and how you're experiencing some logistical challenges around that. And so, I was curious if you could provide a little more detail about what exactly those challenges are. You say they're persisting through year-end. Just give us a sense of is it just that training aspect you mentioned or how should we think about kind of the magnitude of the challenges and your ability to fix it over the next couple of quarters?","Keith J. Allman - Masco Corp.","Mike, I apologize if we communicated a link between Menards and logistics. That wasn't the intention. They're separate. So, it's a Cabinet logistics cost and transportation cost escalation, not tied to Menards. And that's driven by what we've talked about before on prior calls with regards to the base fuel escalation, as well as driver availability. We have less impact on our dedicated routes. And so, it's less of a hit when we look at the big chunk of our businesses like paint, where we have more steady routes, and certainly with some bigger customers in Plumbing, where we have more steady routes. In Cabinets, where it's milk runs, it's less than truckload. It's oftentimes job site delivery. That tends to receive a little bit more pressure. So, it's broad-based Cabinet logistics pressures, not tied to Menards. The Menards program's going well.","Michael Dahl - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Thanks, Keith. And yes, you're right, I may have misunderstood that, but that's helpful color. The second question, going back to the tariffs discussion and again back to Plumbing, one of the options highlighted was working with manufacturer partners to shift production to other low cost countries. I was just \u2013 could you provide a little more detail on kind of where that is on your list of priorities, and if that's the strategy going forward, how long does it take to effectively make that switch?","Keith J. Allman - Masco Corp.","It's probably down in number three priority as I sit here today, just roughly speaking. Our focus is on price and is on working with our suppliers in terms of negotiation and coming up with more competitive pricing. But certainly moving the (00:46:13) supply chain is an option. I talked about in-sourcing, say, assembly into the United States. And then, specifically to your question as it relates to suppliers, many of our suppliers already have capacity set up in other \u2013 let's call it Southeast Asia, Vietnam, there's a couple other places, we have a large supply chain. And so, it's a matter of standing up capacity in those existing facilities and doing some different things there. So, that's the nature of it. I hope that color helps a little bit.","Michael Dahl - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Yes, it does. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Stephen East of Wells Fargo.","Stephen East - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you and good morning. If you look first at the paint, just looking at the promo environment, you've got a retailer that's sort of changed strategy, et cetera. Are you seeing any change in the promo environment, whether on the DIY or on the pro level? And then, just could you give us an update on the hub stores effort?","John G. Sznewajs - Masco Corp.","Sure, Stephen. Good morning. In terms of paint promotions, it's been extremely consistent over the last multiple years, as we promote in conjunction with our channel partner, The Home Depot, very consistently four times a year. So, we're on the Spring Black Friday, we're Memorial Day, we're 4th of July and we're Labor Day. And that promotional cadence has not changed \u2013 I can't tell you \u2013 Keith, boy, it's got to be six to eight years...","Keith J. Allman - Masco Corp.","Yeah.","John G. Sznewajs - Masco Corp.","We've been on that run, and it doesn't look like we're going to change at all going forward. In terms of the promotional environment on the pro side, again, that's been very consistent. There's not a lot of promotional activity for the pro either. The one thing I would point out though is we do fund a pro reward rebate. So, the higher volume that a pro painter achieves within The Home Depot, the bigger discount that they can get on their paint offering \u2013 or their paint consumption. So, that's been \u2013 but that has been extremely consistent as well over the years that we've been working on the pro paint program with The Home Depot. So, not a lot of change in the promotional environment on the paint side.","Stephen East - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay, got you. And then, sort of a combo question. First, could you talk a little bit about the demand that you're seeing in R&R versus new construction and what you expect moving forward? And then, John, could you give us what your investment spend was in 3Q and what you think it'll be in 4Q?","John G. Sznewajs - Masco Corp.","Sure.","Keith J. Allman - Masco Corp.","In terms of the demand in R&R, new construction, as I've talked about the last call and then in the prepared remarks here, it continues to be strong for us. We're seeing that in terms of ticket, we're seeing that in terms of demand across the continuum of price, meaning entry-level and high-end, continue to see good traffic. So, feel real good about it.","I think we saw a little bit of softening on the new construction side. That's 15% of our business. As we look forward to next year, we're thinking that \u2013 and we're not the only ones that are thinking this, whether it's John Burns or Harvard Center for Joint Studies, we're thinking that continued strong, call it, mid single-digit R&R growth is in the cards for us in 2019. And with our brands and our innovation pipeline and our channel work, I think we're positioned to take advantage of it.","John G. Sznewajs - Masco Corp.","And then, Stephen, on your investment spend question and hopefully \u2013 I'm not certain I've got the right question, but let me answer this, and if it's not, let me know. So, on the investment side, we had about $5 million in ERP spend at Delta in the third quarter and a little bit of investment in the hub stores, as we've increased the number of folks that are employed by us that participate in that.","Going into Q4, obviously, we talked a little bit about \u2013 earlier about the decline in investment spend, because we had $8 million in the Plumbing segment. We'll probably have a little bit of \u2013 a very minor amount of ERP spend at Delta in Q4 and a little bit of continued hub store investment in Q4 as well, because we started hiring people in the first part of this year. So, that will just be the anniversarying of that. So, it'll be up slightly year-over-year, but that's about it. Is that the question you were asking?","Stephen East - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","That is, yeah. That's what I was looking for, what you had going forward. So, thanks.","John G. Sznewajs - Masco Corp.","Okay. Yeah.","Operator","Your next question comes from Justin Speer of Zelman Associates.","Justin Andrew Speer - Zelman & Associates","Hi, good morning. On the cost side, with cost continuing to move higher, you have tariffs-inspired inflation coming, sizable amount of inflation you have to deal with, just particularly thinking about the Plumbing business, thinking about the margin integrity of your overall business, but particularly your Plumbing Products business. If we look back to 2014, we saw commodities collapse after that and really it's not probably coincidental that your margins really moved up post that event. Now the market seems to be concerned that we're going to retrace back to those levels at least. Maybe help us understand your view on the margin integrity and view of your \u2013 your world view and how you're responding to tariffs and cost inflation and mix down effect.","Keith J. Allman - Masco Corp.","Yeah. As I said earlier, Justin, I think it remains to be seen of how the consumer is going to react to this inflation, call it, a tax on the consumer, if you will. In terms of our margin, in the short-term here, we're lapping some significant growth investment that we had in Q4. So, we're expecting our Plumbing margins to be down slightly from where they were last year. We really haven't changed our outlook on that much. Certainly, innovation and new parts \u2013 or new products come into our pipeline. That helps us continue to drive margin integrity. But long-term for this business, we feel good about our margins, and more specifically for 2019, we'll give more detailed outlook at our next call as we normally do.","Justin Andrew Speer - Zelman & Associates","You indicated that what you're about to deal with, the incremental inflation, I'm guessing that's a net effect of tariffs and raw materials maybe rolling over on brass costs and things like that. But the net impact of what you're about to see across your businesses will be less than what you've already had to digest in 2018. Can you maybe help us understand what you've digested in 2018 and what you're thinking about 2019 as you snap the line today?","Keith J. Allman - Masco Corp.","Yeah. If you think about the tariffs at somewhere around, what would that be, 2.7% of our cost of goods sold, and you think about in that range of 3% of inflation that we've had to deal with, then you look at some of the favorable tailwinds that we could potentially experience when we look at Plumbing and some of the \u2013 potentially the easing of the copper and zinc cost, and then you look at still continued pressure in resins in particular \u2013 TiO2 appears to have kind of stabilized a little bit. So, when you look at those net-net, it's right around that 3% range.","Justin Andrew Speer - Zelman & Associates","So, we shouldn't be surprised to see at least stable to maybe even improved operating margins next year based on what you're saying and what you have kind of expressed in terms of pricing and things, but the big question is mix. And I guess from my standpoint, A, is that right? And B, on the mix side, what \u2013 if you looked at good, better, best, can you define or think through, particularly in Plumbing, how mix, on the low versus high-end, how much differential margin there is? I don't know if you can say that publicly but help us understand (00:54:08).","Keith J. Allman - Masco Corp.","Yeah. We haven't really walked through with specificity the margin and the different points of the assortment as it relates to price. But generally speaking, we do tend to earn lower margin on the lower priced goods. That's still good business. It's a good return on our invested capital in those businesses, but it does tend to be a little bit lower margin, as you know. In terms of 2019, we think it's potentially shaping up okay. We've got some relief in some commodities. We're certainly focused on getting price here and the tariffs. But in terms of the detail of how we're going to look at 2019, we'll talk more about that in the next call.","Justin Andrew Speer - Zelman & Associates","Thank you, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from Keith Hughes of SunTrust.","Keith Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thanks. Back to the tariffs, how much of the dollars that you've outlined in the slides, give us a feel how much of that is finished goods that you're importing or how much is it components?","Keith J. Allman - Masco Corp.","We don't have that level of detail broke down, Keith.","Keith Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. Well, let me ask it another way. In terms of the ways to mitigate this, whether it's pricing, changing your supply chain to another foreign source, changing it domestically, is either one of those easier to deal with that versus the other? And again, source components versus finished goods.","Keith J. Allman - Masco Corp.","Well, I think it's something that, as I talked about, we're not taking lightly by any means and we're organized to execute it. And there's different challenges there. There's always challenge with price for the obvious reasons. And we need to be very careful when we move our supplies around. We're doing it in a way where we're trying to leverage our existing suppliers as much as possible, and we're also doing negotiations with those suppliers. So, I don't know that any one is particularly easier per se. It's just different.","And as I mentioned, we've got experience in this. Certainly, we know how to get price and that's something that we've been able to keep in terms of price commodity flush over the long-haul through the cycles. We've demonstrated where we've had these episodes of very quick change in our cost structure, i.e., going to no-lead brass, that we've been able to do that. And it was the same thing, it involved changing suppliers, changing materials, getting price, the combination of these things. So, it's a mixed bag and different in terms of difficulty.","Keith Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. Just final question on this, I assume, as you start this process, you're assuming that 25% is going to come January 1. Is that the stance you've taken to begin... (00:56:59)?","Keith J. Allman - Masco Corp.","Correct, correct. That's our assumption and that's what our plans are based on.","Keith Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Phil Ng of Jefferies.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC","Hey, guys. How are you guys prioritizing capital deployment going forward, just given your outlook on R&R still remains pretty favorable, as it relates to M&A and buybacks, given where the valuation of your stock is at this point?","John G. Sznewajs - Masco Corp.","Yeah. Phil, as always, the biggest priority for us is investing back in the business. So, CapEx and investing in the growth of the business is paramount for us, and so that's number one on our priority list. After that, you're right, it comes down to M&A and share repurchases. And as we signaled on our prepared remarks, we're thinking about $300 million of share repurchases in the fourth quarter of this year. So, that has inched up the capital deployment priority list a little bit here and just given the pullback in the share price. That said, I would tell you we continue to be very active on the M&A side. Our team is out there looking at transactions on a very regular basis, and so we're continuing to devote time and energy to that as well. So, it's kind of a balance, and at this point in the fourth quarter, share repo is going to be a little bit higher than M&A, but we're not \u2013 we're not downgrading M&A in terms of a priority by any means.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC","Got it. That's helpful. One of your competitors called out increased promotional activity in Cabinets. Just curious what have you seen in the marketplace? And any color on how to think about your ability to get pricing, given some of these logistic, transportation costs you called out? Is that an opportunity early next year? Thanks.","John G. Sznewajs - Masco Corp.","Yeah. So, Phil, we have not seen a lot of increase in promotional activity in Cabinetry. It's been pretty consistent for the last several quarters now. And are we able to get price based off of the logistics? Yes, absolutely, we're working on that here in the fourth quarter to put price into the marketplace to offset that inflation. So, we feel confident that we can do so.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC","Okay, thanks a lot.","Operator","And your final question comes from the line of Alex Rygiel of B. Riley FBR.","Alex Rygiel - B. Riley FBR, Inc.","Thank you. And I apologize for coming back to the tariffs. But we've been talking a lot about sort of the cost risk and pricing and moving manufacturing around. Could you touch upon the opportunity that you see of gaining market share out there from competitors that are in a much deeper hole as it relates to tariffs than you are across all your products?","Keith J. Allman - Masco Corp.","Sure. It varies by segment. But if you take Cabinets, for example, Chinese \u2013 direct Chinese import, which is 100% import, has been building strength competitively. So, I think that is helpful to us. When you look at, let's call it private label or house brands, which are 100% imported on the Plumbing side, we can have some advantage there as we can have the opportunity to utilize North American manufacturing. So, I think when you look at those two opportunities there, that's probably the ones I'd call out.","Alex Rygiel - B. Riley FBR, Inc.","Very helpful. Thank you.","David Chaika - Masco Corp.","I'd like to thank all of you for joining us on the call this morning and for your continued interest in Masco.

My name is Christie, and I will be your operator for today's call.","As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded for replay purposes. [Operator Instructions]","I will now turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Maria Duey. Maria, you may begin.","Maria Duey","Thank you, Christie, and good morning to everyone. Welcome to Masco Corporation's Third Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me on our call today are Tim Wadhams, President and CEO of Masco; and John Sznewajs, who is the Vice President, Treasurer and Chief Financial Officer.","Our third quarter earnings release and the presentation slides that we will refer to during the call are available on the Investor Relations portion on our website.","Following our prepared remarks, the call will be open for analyst questions. [Operator Instructions] If we are unable to take your question during the call, please feel free to call me directly at (313) 792-5500.","If you would refer to Slide 2, I'd like to remind you that today's presentation includes our views about Masco's future performance, which constitute forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statement. We've described these risks and uncertainties in our risk factors in our Form 10-K that we've filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","Today's presentation also includes non-GAAP financial measures. We have provided a reconciliation of these measurements on our website at www.masco.com.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Tim Wadhams. Tim?","Timothy Wadhams","Thank you, Maria. Hey, and thank you for joining us. And for those of you who are dealing with some of the implications from the storm on the East Coast, we certainly wish you well, your families well. And obviously, that's a difficult situation.","If you would please flip to Slide #4. From a top line perspective, third quarter sales were flat with the third quarter of 2011. And although economic growth in North America continues to be slow, our sales in North America were up 4%. We benefited from new home construction activity, the introduction of new products as well as pricing actions. Also from a repair\/remodel standpoint, we saw some modest improvement as our sales to key retail customers were up low-single digits. Big ticket remodel continues to be relatively slow.","The 4% sales increase in North America was offset by challenging economic conditions in Europe. And for the first time in several quarters, in fact it's hard to remember, we were down in local currencies in terms of our international operations. We also had a negative impact from foreign currency translation.","Even with flat sales, we did see some improvement in operating profit. On an adjusted basis, our operating profit was up 11%. We also saw some nice margin expansion. And we benefited in the quarter from improved price\/commodity relationships, as well as profit improvements. John will talk to you about those items in some detail as we get into the presentation, including a nice lift in adjusted earnings per share.","If you flip to Slide #5, please. Earlier this year, we communicated to you the strategic initiatives that we're focused on to drive performance. Those include expanding our market leadership positions, continuing to focus on supply chain and lean from a cost standpoint, improving our Cabinet and Installation segments and reducing -- and continuing to improve our balance sheet. As you flip to Slide #6, we'll take a look at how we are doing against some of those strategic initiatives.","As it relates to expanding our market leadership position. Over the last few quarters, as you know, we've had some expenditures for growth initiatives. That includes international expansion and it include some program costs, and we've seen in the third quarter some positive implications related to those expenses.","Delta has launched a new Delta-branded toilet at The Home Depot, which we're very excited about, along with The Home Depot. We also have a nice program win in terms of Behr paint. Behr will be placed in all of The Home Depot Mexico stores by the second quarter of 2013. And we've won, at big box, several programs for builders' hardware-related businesses. So we're really pleased about those opportunities going forward.","In terms of our cost structure, John will talk about the progress we're making from a profit improvement standpoint. We feel pleased. We're ahead of targets that we set initially this year. Also in the third quarter, we announced some additional headcount reduction and plant closures. And if we look at our headcount quarter-to-quarter, third quarter to third quarter this year, we're down about 1,000 employees. And so we feel we're making -- continuing to make progress, continuing to take actions to address cost structure.","As it relates to our balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $1.2 billion of cash. And we did have a debt repayment in the third quarter, but we talked about -- that was really July, but we talked about that at the end of the second quarter.","If you flip to Slide #7, we'll take a look at our cabinet- and installation-related businesses. We made modest improvement as it relates to Cabinets in the third quarter in terms of loss reduction. We did have a fairly positive outcome in North America. Our sales were up modestly in North America. We had about $4 million or $5 million of profit improvement in North America. Unfortunately, most of that was offset by significant declines in terms of top line and a couple other issues as it relates to our international operations.","Our new leadership team took a couple of actions in the third quarter that were announced. One is a headcount reduction that will take place over the next couple of weeks -- or has taken place, excuse me. And we also announced a plant closure in the Cabinet segment in North America. Those 2 actions will cost us approximately $20 million, with cash at about $5 million to $6 million. And we expect to save about $20 million on an annual basis going forward.","In terms of our Installation business, we just missed breakeven in the third quarter. Obviously, we've made a lot of progress in that segment this year. We've reduced losses by about $40 million compared to last year and are certainly very pleased with that. We expect to make money in the fourth quarter of this year. And if we get to the Blue Chip consensus of 900,000 starts next year, some folks think we can do a little better than that, we certainly expect to be profitable in 2013. So we're really pleased with the progress that we're making in this -- in both these segments.","And with that, if you flip to Slide #8, and I'm going to turn the presentation over to John, who's going to talk about our operating results and our segment performance.","John G. Sznewajs","Thanks, Tim, and good morning, everyone. If you could please flip to Slide 9, please.","As Tim mentioned, revenue in the third quarter was flat compared to the third quarter of last year. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation of about $46 million, sales were up 2%. And the real story behind our third quarter numbers is evidenced in most of our segments: There is significant difference in performance between our North American businesses, which are in the aggregate strengthening, and our international operations, which are a little bit more challenging.","Overall, sales in North America were up 4% in the quarter as we saw increased revenues in our businesses selling into the new home construction market, including our Installation business which was up 9%. We also had increased sales in North American plumbing products and we realized selling price increases. As Tim mentioned, sales to key retailers were up low-single digits in the quarter.","International sales were down 12% in U.S. dollars in the quarter, a decline of 3% in local currencies. The adjusted gross margins expanded nicely to -- by about -- by 110 basis points compared to the third quarter of last year to 26.5% due to improvement in our plumbing and decorative architectural businesses.","We are also pleased with our bottom line performance as adjusted operating income increased 11% in the quarter to $142 million, with an adjusted operating margin of 7.2%, the strongest quarterly company-wide margin we have reported in several years. And our adjusted EPS was $0.13 per share, an improvement of $0.04 per share from the quarter a year ago.","If you could please flip to Slide 10, you can see the components of our operating income improvement in the quarter. We see net price\/commodity improved $31 million in the quarter, largely driven by our Plumbing and Decorative Architectural segment. This $31 million reflects favorable year-over-year impact of our commodity hedge which was approximately $12 million positive in the quarter, with the balance of the improvement roughly split between our Plumbing segment, particularly our European plumbing businesses, and our Decorative Architectural segment.","The $16 million reduction in net volume\/mix was principally driven by the negative mix impact of approximately $16 million in our Plumbing segment which, as we have mentioned in the past, largely relates to Hansgrohe as they continue to penetrate new international markets. This was partially offset by increased volume in our Installation segment.","We captured $52 million of profit improvements gross in the quarter, in line with our expectations, and these were realized across all of our businesses. These improvements were offset by higher employee-related costs and expenses across all businesses, including benefits and compensation, specifically equity-based compensation given the increase in our share price, as well as incremental promotional and program costs related to new product introductions as we continued to invest to grow our company. We are pleased with our year-to-date profit improvement initiatives totaling $140 million and believe we are on track to achieve the $175 million for the full year, as we discussed in our second quarter earnings call.","If you could please flip to Slide 11. You can see that, in our Plumbing segment, sales declined 4% in the quarter principally due to foreign currency translation. Excluding the impact of $37 million of foreign currency translation, sales increased 1% in the quarter.","European sales in the segment were down 11% but flat in local currency for the quarter despite a challenging economic environment. North American plumbing sales were up 1%. One thing I should probably mention is that we are up against a very tough comp and sales, as reported in the Plumbing segment in the third quarter of '11, increased 12% due to both strong North American and international sales last year. This said, we continue to experience very solid North American growth. And several of our most important faucet brands -- Delta, Peerless and Brizo -- saw sales in the quarter increase high-single digits in both the retail and wholesale channels as they continue to gain share due to new product introductions.","Tim mentioned we are very excited about the launch of a Delta-branded toilet program in the quarter. While this program is in its early stages, we are very pleased with the initial response to these terrific new products.","This said, we lost some business in both our shower-surround and tub and along with our plumbing connections units, which aggregated approximately $15 million in the quarter. We would expect to incur an additional approximately $50 million in lost sales in each of the next 4 quarters.","From an operating profit perspective, the favorable price\/commodity relationship in the segment offset the negative impact of mix. Margins in the segment were challenged by 2 items in the quarter as we experienced incremental costs for the new programs of $5 million, including the toilet program I just mentioned, and the negative impact of foreign currency of $5 million. Removing the impact of these 2 items would improve adjusted operating margins to approximately 12.4%.","Now turning to Slide 12. You can see revenue in our Decorative Architectural segment grew $26 million or 6% in the quarter, driven by strong sales of Behr's Premium Plus Ultra products, our Paint & Primer in One products, along with selling price increases. The new formulations Behr introduced earlier this year are performing well, exceeding expectations. As a result, we believe we have likely gained some share in retail in the quarter.","Operating margin improvement was due to the benefit of improved results from our builders' hardware business, which had a tough 2011 and has seen good results here in 2012, and a favorable price\/commodity relationship in the quarter partially offset by incremental investment.","The price\/commodity relationship in the segment was approximately $10 million favorable for the third quarter. On a year-to-date basis, we have realized a favorable $5 million of price\/commodity relationship in this segment. Even with the recent pullback in the price of certain commodities, prices of these commodities remain in very elevated levels, though slightly off their Q2 peak and are, at today's levels, still higher than they were in the third quarter 2011. Despite the favorable price\/commodity relationship in Q3, given the steep run-up in TiO2 and other input costs over the past several years, we have not recovered the inflation we have experienced in 2010 and 2011.","If you turn to slide 13. You can see the environment for cabinetry remains challenging as our segment sales declined 5% in the quarter. Excluding the $8 million negative impact of foreign currency translation, Cabinet sales were down 2% in the quarter.","Our European sales decreased 12% in local currencies and 21% in U.S. dollars. Cabinet sales in North America, however, were up 2% in the quarter. We experienced solid sales growth with our countertop initiatives. Our home center sales of cabinets increased 4% and our direct-to-builder sales were up low-double digits percent. This growth was partly offset by declines in the dealer channel.","We continue to experience a sluggish demand for big ticket repair\/remodel products, especially cabinets. The promotional environment in retail continued in the third quarter at the same levels we have experienced year-to-date, and we anticipate that our full year and second half 2012 promotional spend will be at levels very consistent with what we experienced last year.","We improved our operating loss in the quarter by $1 million, and $20 million year-to-date. We realized $11 million of profit improvements gross in the quarter driven principally by our North American unit through our current year initiatives as well as the benefits we have realized from prior year restructuring activities. These benefits were offset by other inflation and negative price\/commodity and the loss of leverage as a result of declining volumes in our European businesses.","As Tim mentioned earlier, the new team at our North American Cabinet business continues its turnaround effort, resulting in the announced plant closure and headcount reductions, which should generate $20 million of improved operating results in 2013.","If you turn to Slide 14, you see our Installation segment. And we are very pleased with the continued improvement in both the top and bottom line performance of this segment. We essentially broke even in the segment in the quarter, something we have not done since 2008, when housing starts exceeded 900,000 units.","Segment sales grew 9% and were fueled by higher sales volumes across all lines of business: residential new construction, retrofit and commercial. Sales were negatively impacted from the previously announced closure of branch locations and the mix shift to multi-family starts, which on a combined basis reduced sales in the quarter by approximately 3%.","Well, we continue to focus on increasing our Installation sales across all lines of business and we are well positioned to grow with the big builders, particularly D.R. Horton, Pulte, Lennar and KB. Installation contracting sales increased nearly 20% in the quarter.","In addition to solid top line performance, management's strong execution delivered significantly improved bottom line results, adjusted operating profit improving by $12 million and adjusted operating margins expanding by more than 400 basis points. This segment exhibited very strong operating leverage in the quarter, delivering nearly 50% incremental margins resulting from increased fixed cost leverage as well as the benefits from our prior profit improvement activities, which are driving improved operational efficiencies.","If you turn to Slide 15, you can see that our Other Specialty Products segment sales declined by 3% in the quarter. Excluding the exit of certain U.S. window markets late last year, segment sales would have been up 1%. Our North American window sales increased 9% in the third quarter due to increased sales in both the new home construction and replacement window markets, as well as new product introductions. We are particularly pleased that our new -- that our replacement window sales increased, reflecting share gains driven by new products despite what we believe is a replacement window market in the Western U.S. that declined mid-single digits in the quarter.","We did experience some top line declines in our fastening tool business in the quarter, which we attribute to the soft replacement roofing market and some new inventory balancing in retail. We believe we have experienced no loss of share, though, in this business. And the segment adjusted operating margins improved by $2 million or 160 basis points, benefiting primarily from rationalization activities in our U.S. window business in the third and fourth quarters of 2011.","With that, I'll turn the call back to Tim.","Timothy Wadhams","Thank you, John.","And if you would please flip to Slide #17. These are the priorities that are consistent with the strategic initiatives that we're pursuing, and we've talked about almost all of these as we worked our way through the presentation. Obviously, we continue to feel as though we're moving forward in each of these areas. And if you would flip to Slide #18, please, a couple of comments before we go to Q&A.","We feel we continue to make good progress in the third quarter of 2012. If we step back a little bit and take a look at year-to-date, our sales are up 2% overall. And if we excluded the impact of foreign currency translation, we'd be up approximately 4%, and in North America, we're up 5%, again in a pretty tough environment. If we think about margins and EPS on an adjusted basis, we're up 120 basis points to 6.5% and up $0.17 in terms of EPS from $0.11 last year, adjusted to $0.28 this year.","We've made a lot of progress in areas that have contributed to that. We talked about price commodities. Although we're still behind the curve, we have done a nice job this year of making progress there. As we focus on profit improvement, John talked about the $175 million that we think we can reach this year. That's up from our original projection of about $140 million to $150 million. When we look at the cab and install-related business, we're improved about $60 million versus last year and -- in aggregate -- in those 2 segments. And our working capital management continues to be a bright spot across the enterprise.","We're pleased with all those outcomes and certainly want to take a second and thank our employees worldwide for their continued focus, dedication and commitment.","While economic growth in North America and the unsettled economic conditions in Europe continue to be headwinds, we're relatively pleased that housing dynamics continue to improve in North America. On the new home side, demographics, affordability, slowing foreclosures, high -- home price increases and low inventory levels are forming a very solid foundation for a multiyear sustainable recovery in new home construction.","The recovering repair-and-remodel activity has been more moderate and certainly uneven in general and relatively slow for big ticket remodeling. We anticipate that consumers will remain cautious until job growth, continued home price appreciation and access to credit improves their confidence. Once that happens, we should see solid momentum in repair\/remodel activity.","It looks like October top line for us will be up high-single digits to low-double digits on a preliminary basis. And we will push hard to close the year on a strong note by continuing to focus on the things that we can control to drive our strategic initiatives. Again, those initiatives include expanding our market leadership positions, continuing to focus on total cost and productivity, improving our Cabinet and Installation segments and continuing to enhance liquidity in our balance sheet.","And with that, John and I will take any questions that you might have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Peter Lisnic with Robert W. Baird.","Peter Lisnic - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","First question. The -- if we look at the third quarter operating compares that you gave us, the productivity net $1 million hit, can you give us a feel for where that number could shake out for the year and any preliminary sort of targeting that you could be looking at for 2013 on that front?","Timothy Wadhams","We haven't done anything relative to '13 at this point, Pete, and would certainly put in perspective the fact that, over the last 3, 4 years, we've averaged probably about $140 million to $150 million in terms of gross profit improvements. Obviously, this year, we look to only be a little bit above that at about $175 million. And I don't know that I have the full year number in terms of the net number there. My guess is that, that net number -- John, I don't know if you have any detail on that, but we have seen a fair amount of cost inflation, some impact from growth initiative spend. And I have to roll that out, Pete, but I don't know exactly what the full year impact would be. I think, on a year-to-date basis, we're probably a little bit north but not much -- it's probably -- most of it's been offset.","John G. Sznewajs","Yes, yes, yes. I guess we'd be in that $20 million to $25 million range on a full year net basis.","Timothy Wadhams","Positive?","John G. Sznewajs","Positive.","Peter Lisnic - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay, all right. Perfect. And then as a follow-up question, with some of these new business wins and opportunities, Delta toilet, et cetera, can you give us a sense as to the -- what the opportunity from a revenue perspective there might be? It sounds like October's already benefiting, but just as we look forward, how significant are some of those opportunities, from a revenue perspective?","Timothy Wadhams","Yes, I would say the 3 that we talked about, Pete. If you took the Behr paint initiative, the toilet initiative as well as the builders' hardware, if you put all those together, we're talking somewhere north in aggregate of $100 million roughly on an annual basis, yes.","John G. Sznewajs","And Pete, just a little bit of color to Tim's: It's only benefited in October's by a little bit of a loading with some of these programs as well.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Keith Hughes with SunTrust.","Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Cabinets, you had highlighted the employee reductions year-over-year and the plant closure. But the new management team, what other types of initiatives do they have in terms of product and price points and things of that nature coming down the pipe?","Timothy Wadhams","Yes, the -- in terms of Cabinets, Keith, there's been a lot of activity there. As we mentioned earlier, we made some pretty significant managerial changes effective July, if you will, so we've got about 3, 3.5 months in terms of feet on the ground there, if you will. And as we've indicated in the past, they're looking at all aspects of the business really trying to step back, do a fact-based assessment and have made a lot of progress in that regard. They've done a lot of customer visits. And as we look at it from a priority standpoint, the first area of focus for them has been really in a couple of places. That would include the cost side. And we talked a little bit about that in terms of the headcount reduction. There's some other opportunities that have been identified and are being looked at, at this point in time. The other area is on the countertop side. Basically, the plant closure relates to our countertop fabrication business in New Jersey. And essentially, we're changing that model to basically subcontract with local subcontractors, if you will, that can fabricate countertops much similar to our builder precision model, which really kind of gets us a little closer to the customer. As we mentioned, those actions cost us about $20 million and will put us in a position where we save about $20 million going forward. In addition to that, there's been a lot of activity just in terms of reaching out to customers, a -- lots of discussion in terms of across the channels. And I think that the folks at -- the way I get the feeling is that we've done a good job of enhancing the dialogue there. Obviously, we're looking at all aspects of the business. We do have some product launches that will be taking place over the next 2 or 3 quarters and we'll talk about those after they happen, as supposed to ahead of time, just in terms of the implications, but those relate to both the KraftMaid and Merillat brands. So I think there's a lot of good activity going on at this point in time. And we certainly are in the early stages of this process, but we'd certainly have more to report as it develops going forward.","Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Second question. Your comment on October being up high-single, low-double digits, does that include Europe and are there any segments that really stand out in those results?","Timothy Wadhams","Yes, that does include Europe. In fact, in both North America and in Europe, we're up high-single digit to low-double digits in both geographies, if you will. And just to put that in perspective, last year, we had a pretty significant launch in the latter part of the third quarter in North America. We also had a price increase in Europe that -- with our Hansgrohe operation, that I think became effective in October. So we had a little bit of a pull-forward last year so October's probably a little bit easier comp for us, quite frankly. But having said that, as we looked across the numbers -- and again, Keith, I would want to emphasize that these are preliminary numbers in terms of the data that we're sharing with you. But as we look across the detail, I would say that the strength is pretty broad. Obviously, in the Installation segment probably a little higher than the high-single digit, low-double digit just in terms of reflecting new home construction-related activity but pretty widely dispersed across the business units.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bob Wetenhall with RBC.","Robert C. Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I just want to see, we're in New York, and the storm damage, the extent's been severe. Do you think this will have any impact on third quarter results? And any delay in shipments, or is it business as usual?","Timothy Wadhams","Well, I would guess that -- as we think about any activity on the East Coast, that there probably will be some negative impact just in terms of going forward. That's a little bit difficult to assess at this point in time. We do have our Masco Bath operation and Arrow Fastener located in the New Jersey area and those would be, I think, the only 2 operations, John, that come to mind?","John G. Sznewajs","We have numerous installation branches.","Timothy Wadhams","Yes, a lot of installation branches out that way. And then obviously, a lot of our customer activity in the Northeast is -- tends to be pretty robust. So my sense is that there'll probably be some negative implications but obviously very, very difficult to quantify what that might be.","Robert C. Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Understood, that's helpful. As we go into 4Q, do you expect the positive price\/commodity relationship to sustain itself, or accelerate? And in a similar fashion, what are your expectations for the $16 million hit on volume and mix? Do you think that's going to start to improve as well?","John G. Sznewajs","Yes, Bob, it's John. Let's take this part maybe in reverse order. The volume mix issue will probably still be a little bit of a headwind for a little while yet. That's, as we mentioned in the past, is emanating from Hansgrohe -- or principally from Hansgrohe over the last several years as they continue to grow the business internationally, as they mature and shift -- or balance their business out from a shower company alone to both a shower and a faucet business. So there's a number of things that contribute to the negative mix that they're experiencing out there. But that said, they were trying to address it. They are focusing on some products that will be at cost and price points that will be more attractive. And so nothing to really talk about yet, but it's something that they're very much aware of and are focused on improving. In terms of the commodities going forward, tough to say. It's been kind of a choppy commodity environment over the last couple of quarters. As we look across the commodity inputs that we buy, copper has been fairly steady in a narrow -- relatively narrow trading band despite peaked -- picked up a little bit in the third quarter, has come down just recently. Hardwoods are starting to get to us a little bit in cabinetry and chipboard pricing in Europe has been a little bit elevated at this point. As I mentioned, TiO2 is also -- come off its peak, though. What we are hearing from the producers is that, that could go up here in the -- either the fourth quarter or early part of 2013. So no certainly as to where that's going to land at the moment. So at this point, we might expect a little bit of a price\/commodity favorability in the fourth quarter, but really just it's tough to assess as to where we're going to end up on a full-quarter basis at this point.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Stephen East with ISI Group.","Stephen F. East - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","If -- just follow on what you were talking about in October, Tim. Does that exclude foreign currency impacts? I know, in July, you started off a little bit better, but it looked like foreign currency then clipped you. So I just wanted to make sure I was clear on that.","Timothy Wadhams","Yes, I think the numbers that we had, had foreign currency in it, Steve. So in terms of the International operations, would have been up high-single, low-double, with currency in, and that would have been negative impact.","John G. Sznewajs","Yes. There would be a negative impact of foreign currency, Stephen. So x currency, those numbers would be just up a little bit more but not much because currency right now, at least compared to the fourth quarter of '11, is about the same levels.","Stephen F. East - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. Sure. I -- and then the other question I have surrounds Installation and Cabinets and restructuring charges, what you think we have going forward. Cabinet losses are still fairly high. Your Installation, you're almost at breakeven, it probably -- a little bit less than what you thought was happening. Is that anything other than just the timing of acceleration of the market? Or is there something going -- else going on, on the Installation side? Then on the Cabinets, I assume, with the new management team, you've got restructuring charges coming in the future.","Timothy Wadhams","Yes, I wouldn't want to necessarily predict anything relative to cabs -- Cabinets at this point, Stephen. But as I mentioned earlier, I -- the team has identified some additional potential opportunities for cost reduction that may or may not require charges going forward. But as you could tell from the action that took place this year, we certainly feel like we'll get a very good payback. As I mentioned, I think the $20 million, about $5 million, $6 million of that is cash, and we expect to get $20 million back in 2013, but again there could be some additional activity there and we will communicate that as it transpires. As it relates to the install business, John did mention that we were up 20% in the installation of insulation, and that's probably the closest metric that we have to new home starts on an absolute and\/or on a lagged basis. And that might -- that's a little bit short of the 26% to 27% I think that new home construction is up. And if you look at it on a lag, I think that's the approximate number. My sense is that there are a couple of things going on there. One is that we have eliminated a lot of branches over time, and as John mentioned -- talked a little bit about the impact of the branches that we closed late last year, early this year. As we look at it today, our guys are taking a very hard look at our footprint and taking a hard look at where the housing activity is and our ability to serve those markets. We did add, over the course of the third quarter, late second quarter, I think, 4 satellite distribution-related operations. And the possibility of adding a few more locations is certainly there as we look at where the activity is. So in terms of that business, we may be a little bit short on the top line. But again, I would remind folks that we've got significant mix in terms of multi-family this year, obviously, and that certainly has some implications. But our guys -- in our opinion, we're not missing anything from a share perspective. I think we're in a pretty good spot and obviously continuing to focus on the bottom line. And as we look ahead, obviously, as I mentioned, we expect to make money in the fourth quarter and certainly feel like next year will be a year of profitability for the segment. And it's certainly been a while. John's got a couple of additional observations that we'll share with you.","John G. Sznewajs","Yes, Stephen, just as we think about share. Because we're highly focused on that number as well, our top line growth number. We did a couple of things. We went out and took a look at our consumption of fiberglass in terms of pounds. We're actually up in terms of pounds so we feel pretty good that -- that's one point that indicates that we're not losing any share. Another thing is just polling the fiberglass manufacturers. They feel that we are -- our consumption is up compared to a lot of other players in the industry, so again another point that leads us to believe that share, if nothing else, is not going backwards. If anything, we're picking up a little bit of share. And then as we look in our business and our position with the big builders, it looks like we're up there as well. This is with the publics, something we can more easily track. So feeling really good about our share position across the board there. I guess one thing, to circle back on the restructuring charges that you mentioned in the first part of your question, we did incur $48 million year-to-date. We have guided to be about $65 million for the full year, so a lot of that activity, the difference between the year-to-date, is actually that we initiated in the third quarter that will carry over into the fourth quarter. So we do have some further charges that we will be taking as a result of some stuff that we launched here just recently.","Timothy Wadhams","Yes, $20 million, Steve, related to the Cabinet business, about $9 million of that, I think, hit in the third quarter and the balance will probably hit in the fourth quarter.","Stephen F. East - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. Tim, very quickly on that: Is that all U.S., or is that -- some of it with the European ops?","Timothy Wadhams","There is a plant closure in Europe, a Spanish plumbing plant, that would have been impacting the third quarter number as well.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David MacGregor with Longbow Research.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Tim, I want to ask you about the Cabinet business and the brand line in particular. And once upon a time, one of the challenges that you talked about was that you didn't really have strong representation and opening price points since you had the KraftMaid brand, and then there really wasn't much beyond that. You responded to that by bringing over the Merillat and the Quality brands in order to establish a good, better, best lineup. You still seem to be struggling in the builder channel, and notwithstanding the fact you've got a new management team in here and they've got a lot of -- or in the dealer channel, excuse me, notwithstanding you've got a lot of plans here from the new management team, I'm just wondering if you're really kind of fighting an uphill battle here by trying to get Quality and Merillat into the dealer channel and if your brand strategy at this point is kind of where it needs to be in terms of penetrating that channel.","Timothy Wadhams","Well, I -- Dave, both Merillat and Quality have always had presence in the dealer channel, as has KraftMaid. And I think that, just about any brand for any competitor, if you will, almost all brands tend to go through the dealer channel. There may be a couple that are specific to home centers and that type of thing, but we have always had a presence there. The real effort has been to expand that presence. That's been our desire. And as we mentioned in our second quarter earnings call, some of the -- a couple of the reasons for the leadership change included some of the challenges that we've had implementing both the countertop and the dealer strategy going forward. So we continue to feel like there's an opportunity there, the -- a significant growth opportunity. I would remind us that the dealer channel, we think, represents about 60% of overall Cabinet sales. And although that's been an area where we have historically been somewhat underrepresented, our sense is that we are clearly the #2 player when we look at the combination of KraftMaid, Merillat and our Quality brand. So I think we continue to believe that there is certainly opportunity for us at the different functionality and price points for those 3 brands. And it is certainly an area that our new leadership team is very focused on in terms of future opportunity.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Is this something where you just have to spend more on brand support in 2013? I realize you're not talking about '13 in a lot of detail at this point. But in '13, we should be thinking about increased maybe ad spend in support of those brands?","Timothy Wadhams","I don't know that I would necessarily say that it's a promotional-type situation. The leadership team is looking at all aspects of the business in terms of quality, service, the experience with our brands. And so I wouldn't necessarily say that we would expect to see a lot of additional promotion. There would be -- and we have, where we've won new dealer representation, obviously, there's a display expense that traditionally goes with that. But I wouldn't say that -- as we think about the future going forward in the dealer segment, that we would be looking at an inordinate amount of expense relative to opportunity. And I think anything we do there would certainly be done with the expectation that we get a very solid payback.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","And then just finally. I guess there's been a lot of talk about promotional activity in the home center channel on Cabinets. So I'm just wondering if you could talk about the dealer channel and the level of promotional activity you're seeing there and the extent to which that may be resolving.","Timothy Wadhams","Well, in the dealer channel, there is probably much less promotion than we've seen in terms of big box. I mean, obviously, there are incentives that folks like to use in terms of growth incentives, which would be different tiered rebates and allowances and things of that nature. But generally speaking, I don't think that the dealer segment shows any of the acceleration or increase, if you will, in terms of promotional activity that we see at the big box side.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sam Darkatsh with Raymond James.","Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","I hope and trust everyone in the organization is safe and well after the storm activity the last couple of days.","Timothy Wadhams","Well, we haven't really heard, Sam, anything from the East Coast, but we appreciate your thought.","Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","A couple of quick questions, if I might. Most of my questions have been asked and answered. You mentioned that, in October, there was some benefit to -- from the load-in from the new products and also an easy comparison. Just for some perspective, how much -- the comparisons in November and December, how much more onerous do they get versus October?","Timothy Wadhams","Well, I would tell you, Sam, that last year's fourth quarter for us was pretty tough and so I don't anticipate that November, December comps are going to be overly challenging. Now having said that, I think monthly sales activity, when you're coming out of a pretty steep recession, like we are, can be fairly uneven, a little bit on the lumpy side. And -- I'm sorry?","John G. Sznewajs","The storm.","Timothy Wadhams","And you've got the storm issue too that is certainly going to be a bit of a wild card at this point in time. So we'll have to see how that shakes out, but I don't remember November, December being extraordinarily in that regard, as we look at them.","Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Two more quick questions, if I might. First off, regarding cash and cash flow, how much of that -- the $1.2 billion, on the balance sheet now, and prospectively, your cash flow is coming -- is offshore. John?","John G. Sznewajs","Yes, about $500 million or so of our cash, Sam, is offshore at this point. So I would say, fairly easily accessible for us.","Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","And then prospectively, your cash flow, would it be proportionate to your overall international sales in terms of what will be coming from offshore?","John G. Sznewajs","Yes, I think that's a fair way to look at it, Sam, just given the mix of businesses and everything that we've got internationally versus domestically. I think, yes, that's a good rule of thumb to use.","Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","And last question. There's $12 million, the copper hedge, I believe, you identified, the benefit to the third quarter. How should we look at that in Q4 and then going into 2013 as it starts to roll off and anniversary?","John G. Sznewajs","Well, this won't really necessarily roll off and anniversary because we continue to hedge our commodities in the marketplace. That will -- we will continue to highlight for the investment community the change on a quarterly basis. To the extent that -- I'm trying to think of where copper prices finished the end of the year versus where they are today. And that would give you your best sense of how the hedge will impact the fourth quarter. And I'm sorry, I just don't have those numbers handy off the top of my head, so -- although we can circle back with you on that one.","Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","So the hedge, then, would be essentially -- your costs for copper would be similar to what it was in Q3 and then we can just factor in whatever the year-on-year change would be.","John G. Sznewajs","That would be a way to think about it, yes.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Adam Rudiger with Wells Fargo Securities.","Adam Rudiger - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Look at just the Cabinet segment. And you -- and Tim, you just mentioned that last year, in the fourth quarter, was somewhat easy comparison. This quarter in Cabinets was only the second, I think, lowest-revenue quarter we've seen. And it really just suggests there's limited improvement. I was just curious more if you could talk bigger picture about what you think of the cabinet cycle, where we are and just what our expectation should be at all for next year.","Timothy Wadhams","Well, yes, I'll take a shot at that, Adam. I think that, as I think about North America, my sense is that we ought to see a continued top line improvement. We were up a little bit in this segment in the third quarter in North America, I think John mentioned 2%, and had pretty strong performance as it relates to big box and direct-to-builder. Europe obviously was a bit of a challenge in the third quarter. We were down 12% in local currencies and, I think John mentioned, 21% when we factor in translation. And I would expect that we should see -- continued positive comps going forward in Cabinets would be my sense, given the new home construction activity. And our sense is that, obviously, the election's going to be relatively important. There's a fair amount of uncertainty out there at this point in time. And bigger ticket remodel activity in North America will pick up at some point. We saw a little bit of improvement, obviously, from a big box perspective. But I think the real issue going forward is probably going to be the outcome of our European-related businesses. And as we have indicated in the past, those businesses are both in -- one's in the United Kingdom, the other one's in Denmark. And we have seen very, very significant drops in terms of volume from the start of the downturn to today, and obviously, that continued into the third quarter. So I would say that'll continue to be a bit of a headwind for us in that particular segment.","Adam Rudiger - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And then just -- I mean, I'm thinking about some of the new product initiatives. You mentioned, I guess, toilets and paint in Mexico, recognizing those would likely be modest revenue contributors near term. But assuming those businesses grew and started to impact the mix meaningfully, if they could, what would be the margin impact from those new businesses on those segments?","John G. Sznewajs","Those -- and those would be slightly margin dilutive because, for instance, our toilet program is a source-and-sell program. So the contribution margin on a source-and-sell program is generally lower than what it would be if we manufactured the products ourselves directly, so that would probably have an impact. And just given, I think, down in Mexico, that would be a little bit margin dilutive as well just given the nature of the product that we're manufacturing for that market is slightly different than what we've got here in the United States. I think that's -- it'd be just a little bit lower than what we experience today here in North America.","Timothy Wadhams","Yes, I would say, though, Adam, that, as we look at those programs, they tend to have a very, very high return on assets, return on investment. The payback on those is generally less than a year. And even though there is a little bit of margin dilution, we're excited about those kinds of opportunities and certainly look at those as a value creation opportunity, no question.","Operator","Okay, your next question comes from the line of Ken Zener with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","I wonder -- I do appreciate your guys' increased disclosure, at least from my angle. I think it is appreciated. I've 2 questions. One is going to be about insulation and the second about paint. In fiberglass, you mentioned you were up in pounds, is that -- does that mean you're kind of up in pounds similar to starts, meaning the mix and\/or the price is part of the factor that's leading to your revenue on -- being under the growth of starts?","John G. Sznewajs","Yes, Ken, I would say there's a little bit of a favorable mix in that -- in our insulation purchases at this point -- and in our insulation Installation business at this point. Things -- with some of the businesses that we're launching not only with the builders, within our retrofit business and our commercial business, certainly a better mix there overall.","Timothy Wadhams","Yes, I think -- I don't know, Ken, if your mix question is really on the install side, the fact that we've got more multi-family. Is that where you were going?","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Well, you said -- I thought it was a very good comment, that you said the pounds was up. So that could be -- there's different ways to think about that, obviously, in fiberglass. It could be an R-19 or a higher R-square. So I just kind of want to understand why the sale starts are up more than your growth that you highlighted and if you could kind of explain that on the volume, the price, which obviously some people were looking for.","Timothy Wadhams","I think -- I guess, Ken, if what we're focusing on is the 20% lift in the installation of insulation versus the start number of 27%, 28%, I think that, as I mentioned, I think there's probably 2 factors there. One is a multi-family mix, which tends to be a little bit lower and is an area that obviously we've been able to win some opportunities in. I think the other issue for us is really the fact that, as we contracted our footprint, we're taking a hard look at areas where homebuilding is starting to pick up to make sure that we've got representation. And as we mentioned, there are a couple of areas where we added satellite distribution centers, I think maybe 4 of those. And I think the guys are looking at another dozen or so locations that may be situations where we can expand our representation, given the opportunity. So I think it's a little bit of those 2 items that might help explain that delta a little bit. I think John's comment about the poundage was really -- as we think about share and really focus on share, we wanted to reach out to some of our suppliers to kind of get a feel. And I think what we were generally trying to communicate there is the fact that, as we look at where a product is going, again through our suppliers' eyes, that's -- that puts us in a position where we don't feel like we've lost any significant share. And I think that was really what we were trying to get across in that comment.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","No, I do appreciate that. The paint segment was up a nice 6% versus kind of a more flattish industry. Could you kind of -- if you were to slice that into a pie, is it pretty much 1\/3, like, paint price, 1\/3 paint volume and 1\/3 hardware gains?","John G. Sznewajs","Clearly, the hardware gains were a factor in the segment. Splitting that out: Price was probably a little bit higher on the proportion scale than volume of paint though our, like I mentioned, our Ultra products sold through really well during the course of the quarter. We had really significant top line improvement there. And then our Liberty Hardware programs, as Tim mentioned, the new products that we launched, new programs we won, had an impact. So on -- I think your assessment is right. I mean, we had a couple or 3 things impacting the favorable top line: price, Ultra products and our Liberty Hardware unit.","Timothy Wadhams","Yes, I think the Ultra, Ken, certainly would have improved our mix from a top line perspective. That tends to retail at a higher price, as you're probably aware. And I think that if -- I wasn't sure if you were trying to get at a share comment or not, but as we look at some of the industry information, our share performance in the third quarter, along with Home Depot's share performance, again based on information that is available, looked to be very good in the quarter.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","And the hardware, was that more on a product launch in terms of putting it into the shelf, as opposed to POS?","John G. Sznewajs","Some of it is -- a little bit of both. We had some programs that we had earlier in the year or late last year that are kind of waterfalling, as well as some of the load-in associated with some of the new wins that we've had recently.","Timothy Wadhams","Okay, Ken, thank you. And again, thank all of you for joining us today.","Operator","That does conclude our conference call. You may now disconnect."],"13829":["Masco Corp.

Allman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Irene, and good morning, everyone.","Turning to slide four, we carried last year's momentum into 2016 and we're off to a strong start this year. We experienced solid demand for our brands across the price continuum, including big ticket items such as spas, windows and cabinets, as well as smaller ticket items in our paint and plumbing categories. Our portfolios inherent operating leverage and our focus on cost control were key factors to our success.","Looking specifically at the quarter, our topline increased by 5% when you exclude the impact of currency, which cost us $19 million in the quarter. Notably, our operating margin increased 350 basis points to 13.8%, reflecting our portfolio's strong operating leverage. This represents our best first quarter performance in 12 years. Importantly, our EPS grew 78% to $0.32 per common share. These results reflect our ability to capitalize on improving end market dynamics and our ability to generate solid consumer demand for our industry-leading brands.","I'd like to provide you with some additional insight into the drivers behind each of our segment's performance. Let's begin with Plumbing. Our portfolio of Plumbing businesses continued its strong performance and grew sales in North America by 5% when you exclude the impact of Canadian currency, and grew internationally by 3% in local currency. Each of our Plumbing businesses contributed to this growth, including Hansgrohe, who yet again set a company record for quarterly sales and operating profit. The Delta and Brizo brands continue to resonate with the consumer and drive sales in both the retail and wholesale channels.","Our premier wellness business, Watkins, demonstrated the success of their brand, dealer network and bolt-on acquisition strategy by growing their top and bottom lines through the successful integration of Endless Pools.","Our Decorative Architectural segment delivered an outstanding quarter as the investments we have made to support the growth of this segment continue to take hold. BEHR drove sales with its award winning core DIY products such as BEHR MARQUEE, its differentiated consumer experience in the aisle with a new color center and its launch of new products such as Granite Grip floor coatings. Our Pro paint sales continued to outpace the market growth as a result of our mutual efforts with The Home Depot to capture share in this channel. We remain committed to investing behind this important growth initiative.","Turning to Cabinets, the team delivered yet another strong quarter, maintaining their leadership position at retail and gaining share in the dealer channel with both Merillat and KraftMaid brands. To further position this business for profitable growth, the team has continued to optimize their sales mix by exiting low margin direct-to-builder business in the Carolinas and exiting the kitchen countertop product category. Given these actions and cabinetry's positive trajectory, we expect this segment to achieve operating profit margins between 8% and 9% in 2016. Our Windows and Other Specialty Products segment had another great quarter. Milgard, the leading window brand in the Western United States, grew their top line by 9% as they consistently executed against a dynamic economic environment.","Augmenting our solid operational performance across all segments was our execution against key capital allocation initiatives. We strengthened our balance sheet by paying down $400 million in debt and refinancing two of our debt maturities. These actions will result in approximately $45 million of annual interest expense savings going forward. We also continued our share repurchase activity in the quarter, buying back approximately 3.2 million shares. To date, we have repurchased over 25 million shares against our 50 million share repurchase authorization, returning over $600 million to shareholders and thus delivering on our commitment to drive shareholder value.","Now, I'd like to turn the call over to John who will go over our operational and financial performance in detail. John?","John G. Sznewajs - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & VP","Thank you, Keith, and good morning, everyone.","Please turn to slide six. As Irene mentioned, most of my comments will focus on adjusted performance, excluding the impact of rationalization and other one-time charges. We continued our positive momentum coming out of 2015 with a solid start to 2016. The first quarter of 2016 was our 18th consecutive quarter of year-over-year sales and operating profit growth. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, sales increased 5%. Foreign currency translation negatively impacted our sales in the first quarter by approximately $19 million as the U.S. dollar strengthened against the euro, the British pound and the Canadian dollar.","North American sales were up 5% in the quarter. We're experiencing strong demand for our repair and remodeling products in all channels of distribution and across the price continuum, as we see consumers trading up to our better and best product offerings. As a reminder, repair model activity accounts for approximately 83% of our total sales.","International sales increased 2% in local currency in the quarter, driven by the continued strength in our international plumbing and window businesses. Gross margins expanded approximately 320 basis points compared to the first quarter of last year to 33.1%. Our SG&A as a percent of sales improved as well, delivering a 20-basis-point improvement over the prior year, driven by focused cost control throughout the organization. We delivered very strong bottom line performance as operating income increased 39% to $237 million with operating margins expanding 350 basis points to 13.8%, our highest first quarter margin since 2004. And our EPS was $0.32, an improvement of $0.14 or 78% compared to the first quarter of 2015.","Turning to slide seven, our Plumbing segment sales increased 4% in the quarter excluding the impact of currency, driven by growth in our faucets, showers, spas and rough plumbing products. Foreign currency translation negatively impacted this segment's sales by approximately $16 million in the quarter. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation related to the Canadian dollar, our North American sales grew 5%, driven by strong demand for our innovative Delta and Brizo brands in the wholesale channel. This performance was achieved despite, as we foreshadowed on our Q4 call, approximately $15 million of sales being pulled forward into Q4 of 2015 from Q1 of 2016 as several wholesale customers strived to hit higher rebate tiers in the final quarter of last year.","North American Plumbing sales increased 8% if you exclude the impact of foreign currency and the sales pull forward. Our international Plumbing sales increased 3% in local currency. Hansgrohe continues to outperform as it delivered its highest quarterly sales and operating profit in the company's history. This achievement is a testament to Hansgrohe's successful investment in brand, design and innovation. Operating profit for the segment increased 17% in the quarter driven by incremental volume, productivity improvements in North America and a favorable price commodity relationship in Europe. Our first quarter operating profit also benefited by approximately $5 million due to the timing of sales and marketing expenses at Delta.","Turning to slide eight, in the Decorative Architectural segment, first quarter sales grew 9% fuelled by strong demand for both BEHR's core DIY products including BEHR MARQUEE, KILZ primers and our new floor coatings products at The Home Depot as well as our BEHR Pro paint initiative. Favorable weather supplemented the strong demand for our industry leading products as evidenced by our strong exterior paint and stain sales in the quarter.","Liberty Hardware had another solid quarter due to continued share gains from successful new product introductions and program wins in the retail channel. Operating income increased 27% in the first quarter principally due to the operating leverage and the strong volumes at BEHR. While we've had a great start to 2016 with our Decorative Architectural segment, I want to remind you that this segment is facing a difficult comp in Q2 as the second quarter of 2015 was an all-time record sales quarter for BEHR.","Turning to slide nine, our Cabinetry segment sales declined 5% in the quarter due to the deliberate exit of certain lower margin business with builder channel in the United States at select low margin accounts in our UK cabinet business. This decline was partially offset by high single digit growth in the dealer channel, both our Merillat offerings and our dealer exclusive KraftMaid Vantage program continued to perform and drive increased volume and favorable mix.","As Keith mentioned earlier, we took additional actions in the first quarter to position this segment for profitable growth, including exiting the Carolinas builder direct business and our retail kitchen countertop product lines. These actions, when coupled with the previously announced pullback in our builder direct business, will negatively impact this segment's top line by about $60 million for the full year while improving its profitability.","On a quarterly basis, the revenue impact will be approximately $15 million for each of the second quarter, third quarter and fourth quarter. Segment profitability in the first quarter improved $27 million over 2015. Our strong Q1 margin was driven by cost savings initiatives and continued growth of our higher price-point semi-custom KraftMaid offering. This segment's profitability in the quarter was also favorably impacted by approximately $4 million due to the timing of certain operational and marketing related expenses. As a result of the actions I mentioned earlier, and the recent performance of this business, we anticipate operating margins for this segment should be between 8% and 9% in 2016.","Turning to slide 10, our Windows segment sales increased 9%, driven by low double digit sales growth in Milgard, our leading Western U.S. window business. Milgard is seeing strong demand in the Western U.S. resulting in increased volume and the continued benefit of a favorable shift toward our premium window and door product lines. Excluding the $2 million negative impact of a stronger U.S. dollar, our European window sales increased 9% as this segment continues to benefit from share gains, the acquisition of Evolution Manufacturing and growth in Phoenix Door product line. This segment's operating profit declined in the quarter due to increased ERP expenses at Milgard of approximately $5 million and incremental labor costs in preparation for the spring selling season of approximately $3 million.","And turning to slide 11, during the quarter, we took further action to further strengthen our balance sheet. In March, we issued $400 million of 3.5% five-year notes and $500 million of 4.375% ten-year notes. Earlier this month, we used the proceeds from these debt issuances together with cash on hand to repay and early retire all of our $1 billion notes due in October 2016 and $300 million which were due in March of 2017. To complete the retirement of these two debt maturities, we will incur approximately $40 million in a one-time interest payment in the second quarter of 2016. Including this one-time payment, we anticipate interest expense for the second quarter to be approximately $88 million. The result of these transactions will be an annual interest expense reduction of nearly $45 million.","Starting with our third quarter of 2016, our quarterly interest expense will be approximately $44 million. With these debt transactions, we have delivered on our long-term commitment to strengthen our balance sheet. Due to our strong cash flow and this recent debt retirement, we have greatly enhanced our financial flexibility as our net debt to EBITDA now stands at approximately 1.8 times on a pro forma basis. From a working capital perspective, we delivered another strong quarter of performance with working capital as a percent of sales improving 50 basis points versus the prior year to 13.3%. Finally, as Keith mentioned, during the quarter, we repurchased 3.2 million shares valued at approximately $86 million.","With that, I will now turn the call back over to Keith.","Keith J. Allman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, John.","I'm pleased with our team's consistent execution. Our results reflect the strength of our powerful brands and our focus on operational excellence. We have strong positions in good industries, and our portfolio is aligned to improving macro trends. Existing home prices continue to appreciate, which is a driver for larger ticket items such as cabinets and windows. Housing turnover continues to accelerate, which is a leading indicator of repair and remodel spend and affordability remains well above historic averages. As a result of these trends, the consumer continues to gain confidence to reinvest in the home, and we are well positioned to benefit from that.","The strategies that we laid out last year are working. And going forward, we remain committed to: one, investing behind our brands for growth; two, developing innovative products to ensure that we maintain our must-have position with our customers; three, focusing on operational excellence through our continued deployment of the Masco Operating System; and, finally, balancing our capital allocation between acquisitions with the right strategic fit and return, share buybacks and dividends. Our operational execution coupled with our strengthened balance sheet and strong liquidity position provides us with multiple levers to continue to drive shareholder value.","With that, I'd like to open up the call for questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Samuel Eisner with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Samuel H. Eisner - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yeah, good morning everyone.","Keith J. Allman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning, Sam.","Samuel H. Eisner - Goldman Sachs & Co.","So, on the Cabinets business, your guidance is for 8% to 9%. It seems as though expense timing already gets you toward that high end of that range based on your guidance. And so I'm just curious, can you walk through what the puts and takes are for the remainder of the year perhaps touching on some of the already announced cost savings as well as underlying incrementals for the Cabinets business going forward?","Keith J. Allman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sam, as we mentioned, there was a deferral of marketing spend of about $4 million. So, that's certainly benefited us in this quarter and then we will have that expense in the following quarter. We are focused on growing this business. We're making a pivot here, and we're investing behind that growth. So, we will be seeing further investments as we drive growth. And you can expect to model this business going forward in that 30% to 35% level of contribution margin dropdown in incrementals.","Samuel H. Eisner - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. And then just a follow-up on paint. You've seen some of your other competitors talk about traction with TiO2 price increases in the market. Can you comment a bit about what you're seeing in the market and also the implications that it might have on your 2017 goals? Thanks.","Keith J. Allman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, we're pretty confident that the material costs have bottomed, and we are experiencing significant cost pressure from our major suppliers on TiO2 and resins as well. I think when you look at where we're driving growth in particular with this business and the Pro channel as we have talked before, we are doing a nice job there of driving that growth. And it is lower margin for us while a great return. So, we're going to continue to invest behind that. So, there is some margin pressure that we're seeing both in terms of the commodities as well as our mix as we drive that growth.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Rehaut with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks. Good morning, everyone, and nice quarter. First question I had was just kind of taking a step back and looking at the progress here and thinking about the 2017 goals that you've laid out. It would appear that with all the progress and certainly the positive margin momentum that you're on your way, I just wanted to get a sense of \u2013 I think last quarter you reiterated your outlook for your ability to hit that goal. I wanted to know if that was still the case and just kind of talk through any of the puts and takes on that goal as we sit here today relative to when you issued it about a year ago. Thanks. And also then I have a follow up. Sorry.","Keith J. Allman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure. We're positive on the underlying fundamentals driving the business. When you look at our expectation at R&R growth rate of about 5%, there may be some upside to that, but I think it's a little too early to call. I'd like to see a little more time before we move off of that expectation in terms of the R&R growth. We are seeing good new construction growth. Our estimate is 10% compared to 2015, and we're seeing that. And we're seeing a shift in that market mix in new construction to be more single family laden versus commercial, and that helps us. We have higher content per unit in that and better mix in that.","So the fundamentals are strong. R&R is 80% of our businesses. Home prices are appreciating as we talked about. Demographics are improving. Affordability is still very favorable. And our capacity is in shape as we talked about in the past. We're ready for this uplift. So, we feel good. We're positive about the outlook. We're positive about 2017. And we're committed to \u2013 and we're on track for the 2017 EPS target of $1.80 per share. We're not moving off of that.","John G. Sznewajs - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & VP","Hey, Mike, it's John. Just maybe a couple supplemental comments to Keith. If you look at the various components of how we built that walk from 2015 to 2017, I think we're probably coming a little bit softer in the top-line than we initially forecasted, but I think what's coming through a little bit stronger than we had initially anticipated are some of the cost-outs. And obviously you're seeing that reflected in the performance of the Cabinet business. There's couple other areas of small opportunity, obviously the debt refinancing that we put in probably adds a couple pennies to that $1.80 that we outlined last year as we refinanced sooner and at a lower rate than we had assumed in the forecast we provided last year. So maybe a little bit of upside to that $1.80. Not a ton at this time however. I think we're reaffirming that $1.80 right now, and we're pleased with how we're getting here.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Nice. That's helpful. Thanks, John. I guess just secondly, you mentioned the timing of expenses both in Cabinets and Delta, and the Plumbing business. I think you said that you expect the Cabinet \u2013 that timing of expenses to impact 2Q. Is that the same for Delta and is there any other type of timing issues that we should anticipate for the second quarter?","John G. Sznewajs - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & VP","Yes, no other timing issues, Mike. I would tell you that the $4 million, while not a huge number, will probably be spread across a couple of quarters. There's just some products that will be coming to market and those are really launch costs related to those new products. And so depending on when those come to market, we'll incur those. The Delta $5 million, yes, I think will largely be deferred into the second quarter of the year. But beyond those two, nothing else of a timing issue.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thanks.","John G. Sznewajs - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & VP","Yes.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Kim with Barclays. Your Iine is open.","Stephen S. Kim - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yes, thanks very much, guys. Good strong quarter. I wanted to ask a little bit if I could just follow up on those timing charges. I think you itemized I think $9 million or whatever, $5 million in Delta and another $4 million in Cabinets. I was curious if we sort of back that out, the impact on the overall margin, gross margin, doesn't seem like it would be that significant, only about 50 basis points or so, which still leaves your gross margin this first quarter at a very high level. Historically it seems that the first quarter gross margin is generally the lowest of the year, and so I was curious as to whether or not you felt that was also likely to be the case this year, or if there was something else that was likely to drive that gross margin down later in the year.","John G. Sznewajs - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & VP","Well, I think, Stephen, as you take a look at several things that impact our gross margin, I think the one that probably most dramatically impacted the favorable gross margin in the first quarter of this year was the commodity environment that we find ourselves in. As you probably realized, most of the commodities bottomed in January of this year as the year got off to a pretty choppy start with the overall stock market and economic environment. And since that time, we've seen a pretty consistent rise in both base metals, some of the hardwood, and as Keith reference add couple minutes ago, we're seeing it also in TiO2 that goes into our paint business.","So, I think, with raw materials slowly inflating, they're not dramatically inflating but starting to inflate, I think, that will add some pressure on our gross margin going forward. That said, to your point, the first quarter is seasonally typically our slowest quarter of the year, and as we enjoy the seasonal volumes that come with the second and third quarters, I think, there's potential to have stronger gross margins as the year continues to unfold.","Keith J. Allman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I would add to that, Stephen, that while we are seeing some upward pressure on the raws, our mix is holding quite well, and that's also a driver of some of that favorable gross margin. When you look at our Windows business, which is obviously a big ticket, our wellness business and spas, I think that's a good indicator of the stability of our mix. So, there's a couple things going in opposite direction there. We think we're going to hold our mix. We don't anticipate that slipping, but we are experiencing pressure in raw materials.","Stephen S. Kim - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Well, that sounds like it's, all things combined, going to be a pretty positive. You'll still wind up on the positive side of the ledger. I guess my next question relates to your comment about the Cabinet incremental investments and your guidance for 8% to 9% this year in margins, which seems a little low relative to what you did in the first quarter. I was curious if you could talk a little bit more about what you meant by pivoting to growth and if you could talk about, is that something that has changed in your view or just sort of the next step in your strategy for Cabinets and if your thinking has evolved at all about whether or not the segment is core in your opinion or not?","Keith J. Allman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","As we've talked about for some time now, our focus and the team's focus in Cabinets is to improve our profitability and the quality of the earnings and get that business in shape to compete. We've worked hard on our processes underlying how we work, we've worked hard on our product assortment, and we certainly have made significant improvements in our leadership team there. And as is often the case, I think, in situations like this, to get in shape that sometimes means you need to get better before you get bigger. And we've done, I think, a pretty good job of doing that. So the change in focus on growth is really more of a next step and an evolution of our thinking based on how we've gotten ourselves fit and ready for the ring and ready to get in there and compete for growth. And that's how I'd characterize it, more as a next step as we've earned the right to grow.","Stephen S. Kim - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay, great. Well, thanks very much, guys. Looking forward to it","Keith J. Allman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Stephen.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dennis McGill with Zelman & Associates. Your line is open.","Dennis Patrick McGill - Zelman Partners LLC","Hi. Good morning. Thank you. I guess, Keith, just carrying on that last comment you made there, just to clarify, the $60 million that you detailed, John, on the walkaway business in Cabinets, does that include the actions that you took in the third quarter or is that just related to the actions from this quarter?","John G. Sznewajs - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & VP","That includes, Dennis, the actions we took last year. So, as we laid out on the fourth quarter call, we thought we'd have about $20 million of incremental lost business. So think about it as an incremental $40 million to that $20 million, so a total of $60 million.","Dennis Patrick McGill - Zelman Partners LLC","Okay. And then I guess in conjunction with going on offence, if you back that out then in this quarter, it still looks like the organic growth in the segment was low-single digits, probably trailing the overall market by a fair amount. So do you look at these actions that you've taken so far as being the last of the culling of the revenue? And from this point forward, once we lap that, you'd envision to be trending at least back towards market growth? That's the offensive component, or could there be more pruning as you continue to fix up the business?","John G. Sznewajs - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & VP","Dennis, I think this is really the final pruning of the sales portfolio within this business. We are doing a similar exercise at our UK Cabinet business as well, so there might be a little bit of headwind with that later in the year. That said, I just want to remind you that our dealer sales were up high-single digits in the quarter and our retail business was up low-single digits in the quarter. So we did have pretty good growth in both aspects of our non-direct-to-builder business in the first quarter of the year.","Dennis Patrick McGill - Zelman Partners LLC","Okay, great. And then on the paint side, can you maybe just detail \u2013 split out the volumes that you're seeing both on the DIY side and any variance you might be seeing between point-of-sale and inventory management there and then on the Pro side?","John G. Sznewajs - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & VP","Obviously, Dennis, the first quarter is a little bit of an unusual one just given the ramp-up towards the end of the quarter to go into the spring selling season. And so we did see very good sell-through as well as sell-in into the quarter. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, very strong exterior paint and exterior stain sales in the quarter driven by the favorable weather that we saw in the first quarter. And we also saw, as Keith mentioned, some \u2013 we launched some new products in the quarter; very good sell-through in that product category as well. So as we go into sort of the second quarter, inventory levels are right where we want them to be, very consistent with where we saw them at this point last year as we go into the spring selling season.","Dennis Patrick McGill - Zelman Partners LLC","Okay, great. Thanks. Good luck, guys.","Keith J. Allman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bob Wetenhall with RBC. Your line is open.","Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey, good morning, and fantastic quarter, Keith and John. You guys have made some tremendous headway in a relatively short amount of time.","Keith J. Allman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Wanted to ask you on the paint business, you had a lot of \u2013 it seems like there's a bunch of things going on top line, like, you had some pull-forward into 4Q, yet you still had really good growth up 9%, and it sounds like the exterior business is strong. How should we think about organic volume growth during the quarter? And how do we think about top line moving forward given the fact you have a really tough comp?","Keith J. Allman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes, that's an important point you brought up, Bob, in terms of the comps that we're facing. Q2 of last year was a record quarter for us, up 6% last year. So that's a tough comp for us to lap. In the quarter that just completed, it's hard for us to estimate with extreme accuracy the effect of weather, but clearly that quarter that we just finished was one of the lightest winters we've seen nationally in a long time. So there was probably a couple points of benefit there. As we try to figure out what that is, we look at the exterior sales and they were extremely high when you look at the quarter over quarter comps. So there's a component of that. But we expect to continue to take share, particularly in our core business, as well as we've done consistently in our Pro business. And having said that, we do face a tough comp coming up.","John G. Sznewajs - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & VP","Yes, and Bob, I would remind you, though, I don't think there's a ton of pull-forward into the first quarter of the year. If you recall, the fourth quarter was a relatively flat quarter for us last year and that had to do with some timing issues due to the preceding year 2014. So I think overall, the fourth quarter from an organic basis was a pretty solid quarter.","Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. And then just taking off that, if you're hitting a tough comp volume-wise year-over-year, so you're not going to get a lot of incremental volume growth on a gallon basis and you cited some mix headwinds and some cost pressures on TiO2. How should we think about your operating margin moving forward?","John G. Sznewajs - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & VP","I think from here operating margins, because of what Keith cited, as a result of some of the pressures we're facing on the commodity input side, that I think you'll see that our margins come under some pressure over the course of the next several quarters as we deal with those cost pressures. That said, hopefully as we get into the spring selling season, our MARQUEE volume has been very strong, which is a nice favorable mix for us. And if we see a better paint selling season than we saw in 2015, that kind of volume could help us negate some of those. But generally speaking, I would think about margin pressure in the near term and the longer term in this segment.","Keith J. Allman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think, Bob, more in line with what John said in terms of the pressure that we're seeing combated somewhat by the MARQUEE mix benefit that we have that we are seeing more gradual pressure than we are any kind of cliff or falloff of the margin.","Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC","That's helpful. John, you've taken net leverage down to 1.8 times, and I think in your prepared remarks on capital allocation, you guys mentioned acquisitions. I was hoping either yourself or Keith could just touch on what the pipeline looks like, the size of a deal you would do, and your appetite versus buybacks and reinvesting in the business. Thanks and good luck.","Keith J. Allman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I'd characterize, as we have consistently, our capital allocation strategy, Bob, is balanced. We have good generation of cash flow. And we expect M&A to play a part of our value creation as we go forward. We're focused and continue to be focused on bolt-on acquisitions with our pipeline targeted towards plumbing and paint, although we would look at others if it helped drive organic strategies.","In terms of how we toggle back between buybacks and acquisitions, we have the flexibility if we saw a good deal and if that deal was bigger, we could certainly do it. But I'd tell you that we're being conservative in how we evaluate them. They need to be on strategy for our portfolio and they need to be strong returns. And we certainly evaluate those returns against what we think we can get with our own buyback. So I'd say that we haven't changed our focus to acquisition. We're working hard in developing the pipelines and contacting potential acquisitions and we're working the process. But we remain committed to balance, flexibility and our focus is on bolt-ons.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Susan Maklari with UBS. Your line is open.","Susan M. Maklari - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you. Good morning","Keith J. Allman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning.","John G. Sznewajs - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & VP","Good morning, Susan.","Susan M. Maklari - UBS Securities LLC","One thing that you've mentioned over this call is that you're definitely seeing an improved mix where you're getting consumers that are trading up to some of your better, best kind of options there. Can you just talk about those trends that you're seeing and maybe how is that contributing to the margins that we should be thinking about, especially in Cabinets?","Keith J. Allman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I'll talk about some of the trends, and then, John, you can touch on some of the impacts on margin. Susan, it's broad-based. We're seeing consistent move-up in some of our lower-price per unit products. If you look at faucets, we're seeing a move up in the showroom to more expensive, more featured products, both in terms of finish as well as functionality, be it our touch technology or magnetized docking or our in2ition showers, all those higher margin, higher contented products. At that price point, we're seeing a move up as we talked about with BEHR MARQUEE. So in the lower price point range, we're seeing a mix up.","In the bigger ticket items, we're also seeing it. Our KraftMaid Vantage program is doing very well and it's helping the consumer move up in terms of wood species, the finish level, content in terms of drawer guides, et cetera. So I would characterize it clearly as broad based across the continuum. From a channel perspective, we're also seeing it. We have favorable mix in retail. Clearly in our Plumbing wholesales, we're seeing the favorable mix. We've talked about our dealer network in wellness, and we've got a couple new spas that are out. And people are willing to pay for that value. So I would characterize the mix move-up across really all of our segments and across all of our channels and price points.","John G. Sznewajs - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & VP","Yes. So, Susan, to further supplement Keith's comments, as you think about this trend, it's been going on for a number of quarters now, and as you've seen the margin progression that we've experienced from the end of 2014 through 2015 to now into the first quarter of 2016, I think a lot of what you have seen is really two-fold: one is the commodity benefit that we've been enjoying; at the same time, the mix benefit. And it's reflecting itself clearly in our Cabinet business. That's probably the one where it's most evident as you've seen the progression we've made in the Cabinet business over the course of the last four quarters as we launched Vantage about this time last year. So you can see the impact that business has had on the Cabinet business, and you can also see it in our Plumbing segment. We've had pretty consistent margins from 2014 to 2015, and now in the first part of 2016, we're seeing continued margin expansion, and I think that's really attributable primarily to the mix shift and some of the volumes that we're enjoying as a result of that favorable mix.","Susan M. Maklari - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And then in terms of Milgard, you've noted that you're gaining some share there. How sustainable do you think that is and who do you think you're actually taking that business from?","John G. Sznewajs - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & VP","Milgard's got a fantastic position in the Western U.S., Susan, as I think you're very well aware. And as we grow that business in the Western U.S., I think we're taking share from a number of competitors. Clearly, it's a highly fragmented business, and we're taking share from some of the smaller competitors, but at the same time, just given our growth, I feel like we're probably taking share from some of our more mainline competitors as well. The Milgard team has done a great job of refocusing the business away from the production builders and really more toward remodelers and the custom builders, and so we've really enjoyed very nice growth with both of those customer segments in the last year to year and a half.","Susan M. Maklari - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America. Your line is open.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, everyone. Good morning. Thanks for all the details and congratulations on the progress so far. Two questions for you: First, for you, John, we always talked about the SG&A leverage that the company has been exerting over the last number of years, and once again you had SG&A as a percentage of sales down. Does there come a point where you have to start investing in corporate and SG&A in general to keep up with the revenue growth? And a related point, how much did FX serve to trim in dollar terms the SG&A level that you had in the first quarter?","Second question in Decorative Arch and in particular in paint, you mentioned that you have to invest in the business. You have some initiatives to invest within in the second quarter. Is there any way to size what level of investment you're considering there or what the focal points are for that in 2Q and 3Q? Thank you.","John G. Sznewajs - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & VP","Yes, George, you're right. We're really proud of how the entire team has responded to our SG&A initiatives. And we have done a nice job of controlling costs as we've grown the business. What I'm most proud of particularly in the first quarter is the fact that we did a nice job of holding SG&A as a percent of sales or having it decline despite the fact that we're investing in some of the programs that impact SG&A. For instance, I think we are now up to about 150 Pro sales reps in the BEHR organization to call on the Pro-oriented contractors. So incremental costs, yet the fact that we were able to bring the SG&A as a percent down really I think it gives a sense of how the organization is responding to our desire to hold costs constant as best we can.","As we grow the business, will we have to invest some in SG&A? Yes, I think we will. But I really think the mantra that both myself and particularly Keith are trying to get across to the organization is that, this is the way that we can really help create shareholder value is if we can grow the business and holding our costs down, good things happen to the bottom line and to profits. And so the entire team has responded particularly well to that.","In terms of your question on FX, we didn't have much, if any at all, FX benefit on the SG&A line this first quarter. So we feel really good about how that performed here in Q1.","Keith J. Allman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","In terms of paint investment, George, we completed our rollout of the color centers in 2015, so that's done. And we like what we're seeing from that. The in-store customer consumer experience is getting very favorable feedback on that. But that investment is done. In terms of the promotional environment, we're seeing a bit of a tick up in the promotional levels as our competitors support recent launches. We certainly had good success in our promotions that we did last year in July 4th and in Labor Day. And I think that you can think about our investment in advertising going forward this year to be similar to what we had last year.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you, Keith. Good luck in the quarter.","Keith J. Allman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","John G. Sznewajs - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & VP","Thanks, George.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Dahl with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Michael G. Dahl - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hi. Thanks for taking my questions, and nice job in the quarter. I wanted to go back to Cabinets and maybe kind of frame the margin discussion around some of the long-term objectives. And you had outlined 7% to 10% I think last quarter, you stressed that that wasn't necessarily a ceiling, and clearly the 8% to 9% today, and people previously pointing out that that may even sound conservative. It doesn't take that many years of 30% to 35% dropdown to get back to a mid-teens margin in this business. So how are you thinking about just the next couple of years and the opportunity, especially with some of the improved mix and what's realistic as far as the path for that business?","Keith J. Allman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think working this business over the next couple years to mid-teens is realistic, and we're driving in that direction. And importantly as I mentioned earlier, I really like the team there. And they're doing a great job, and the nature of the improvements that we're seeing are broad based. It's SG&A. Certainly it's manufacturing, conversion costs. We're working a lot on our wood yields and our finishing yields. We've invested into better quality system and our quality costs are coming down. And we're doing it \u2013 Joe and the team there are doing it with a process orientation.","So, as I look at how we're doing it as far as what's been done, I'm confident that it's sustainable. And now as we start to work harder on our growth initiatives and we're seeing the results of that \u2013 KraftMaid is the number one brand in repair and remodeling, and Merillat is the number one brand in new construction. As we get ourselves back and get that momentum back, I think it's sustainable. So I do believe that those margin targets that we talked about in a couple of years are doable.","Michael G. Dahl - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","That's great. Thanks. And as a follow up, just those growth investments, can you elaborate a little bit more on now that you \u2013 so you've earned the right to compete for growth. I mean, you've clearly been focused on pruning some parts of the portfolio in Cabinets. But what are some of the specific areas that you are looking to invest more heavily in, in terms of growth initiatives?","Keith J. Allman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","A couple of key ones are product assortment initiatives. So going after and understanding the trends that are out there and launching new products to address those trends, both in terms of form and function, look and aesthetics, as well as price points. So, going after the broad spectrum in terms of taste as well as price. And then with that, as you salt (48:27) these launches into the channel, you have some launch expenses; certainly there's a component of advertising that's in there, but primarily it's more on the launch side.","Outside of assortment, looking at the channel, as we grow, we have significant headroom, we believe, in share of wallet of our existing dealer base. And to help to drive that and to motivate that, there's some expense that you incur in terms of incentives. And we also believe that there's spots, as we look at our national coverage, where we can either get more dealers or get higher quality dealers. And to start up new dealers that takes some money. So primarily, the investments are around product assortment enhancements and channel enhancements.","Michael G. Dahl - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Josh Chan with Baird. Your line is open.","Josh K. Chan - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Hi. Good morning and congrats on a great quarter. We talked a little bit about weather in the Decorative business, but I was just wondering about what are your thoughts on how much weather might have helped in Q1 and maybe what trends you're seeing in April and that trajectory there?","John G. Sznewajs - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & VP","Yeah, Josh, it's John. Beyond paint, it's really tough to get an assessment of how much weather benefited us in the first quarter in our other segments. As you would expect, most of our Plumbing business is focused on the remodeling channel and repair, and so when your faucet breaks, you repair it on a timely basis as opposed to weather. We may have had a little bit of benefit on the new construction side as I think the builders were able to button up a few more homes in Q1 than they normally would, but beyond that it's really tough to get a true assessment just given the nature of the products that we have.","Josh K. Chan - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Any color on whether the trajectory has continued into April?","John G. Sznewajs - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & VP","On the \u2013 I'm sorry, the weather or...","Josh K. Chan - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","The demand trajectory.","John G. Sznewajs - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & VP","The demand trajectory? I'd say demand has been pretty consistent.","Keith J. Allman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, we have \u2013 there's no \u2013 I think, Josh, you're talking about weather here. I think we're out of it here in April \u2013 pretty clean.","Josh K. Chan - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Great. And then my other question is, you talked briefly about raw material inflation through the rest of the year. How would you kind of characterize pricing ability and the ability to offset that over time?","John G. Sznewajs - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & VP","It depends on the product category, but generally speaking, if you're thinking about the long-term trend, we are able to get price over the long-term. Probably the place where it's most critical in the near term is in our Window business. As I think you may be aware, there was some glass plants that went down in the Western U.S., and so glass was on allocation in the Western U.S. And so we have been passing through price here in the first quarter with our Milgard business in the Western U.S. In the other product categories, it's kind of on a case-by-case basis. So we did get pricing in Europe in Q1 as well and our Plumbing business.","Josh K. Chan - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Great. Thank you for your time.","John G. Sznewajs - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & VP","Yep.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Wood with Macquarie Capital. Your line is open.","Mike Wood - Macquarie Securities","Hi. Good morning. A follow up to the trade-up (51:45) question you answered earlier. Can you compare the product mix you're selling now compared to where you were when housing was more normal historically? Thus, I'm asking, are you still cyclically depressed in terms of product mix?","John G. Sznewajs - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & VP","So you're asking, Mike, just so I'm clear, you're asking maybe compared to 10 years, 11 years ago and what we're seeing today versus what we're seeing then?","Mike Wood - Macquarie Securities","Yeah, basically how much more room is there in terms of product mix to get to a more normalized mix within portfolios like Plumbing and Cabinets?","Keith J. Allman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think we're pretty close to normal right here.","John G. Sznewajs - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & VP","Yeah.","Keith J. Allman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Clearly when we went through the crash, there was a reduction in content per unit, cabinets per house, bathrooms per house, houses got smaller, et cetera. And there was a mix down. I think we've come back from that, and I would say that we're at about normal levels.","Mike Wood - Macquarie Securities","Got it.","Keith J. Allman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","It's tough to put a very finite metric on that, but, yeah, it feels like we're back to the normal levels.","Mike Wood - Macquarie Securities","Okay. What are you doing now, like what stage are you in the Pro paint initiatives? Anything that you're working on right now to keep growing that?","Keith J. Allman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I would say we're in the early stages of it because we see a lot of headroom. In terms of what are we doing to continue to grow that, in a nutshell we're leveraging one of the best partners in the space in The Home Depot, and one of the best supply chains in the space, which is BEHR's supply chain, and one of the best products. So we're continuing to do that on all fronts. We're putting in more resources in terms of focused Pros in the stores; we're putting in focused hub stores and high-speed tinting capabilities in our distribution centers so that we can deliver large quantities to the job site when required; we're working on the experience of the Pro in the store together with Home Depot. So we're continuing to move a ton of levers to drive this demand and it's working.","John G. Sznewajs - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & VP","Remember, Mike, our ultimate goal with Home Depot, whether it's on the DIY side or the Pro side, it's grow paint gallons. And that's their objective, that's our objective and we're aligning very closely with them to meet that goal.","Mike Wood - Macquarie Securities","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Keith Hughes with SunTrust. Your line is open.","Keith Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thank you. Just one final question about the pivot to growth in Cabinets. Do you think your success will come more from the big box channel, the dealers? What area are you really focusing on first looking for growth?","Keith J. Allman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Dealers is our focus, Keith. That being said, we have the leading share position in both retailers, and we're not resting on that. We're continuing to try to add more value so we're the best choice for more consumers through that channel and the best choice for those customers. So we're working on it. But as you know, the dealer segment is fragmented. It tends to be higher mix, and it tends to be a better channel for us. We think we have and we know how to grow in that channel. Now that we've got our assortment and our performance and the quality of the earnings back, so our focus is on the dealer, Keith, but of course we're not sleeping on big box.","Keith Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","So looking at the dealers, you referred in another answer on assortments. Do you not need to improve the assortment particularly towards the upper end of the range? I mean, you got out of countertops which is a little bit different business, but is there going to be investment that's going to need to come there in order to hit that market harder?","Keith J. Allman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","A big part of our upper end assortment with KraftMaid Vantage has been addressed and we've had that in the market for a good year now. And \u2013 or a little better. That helped us in a number of ways. Number one, it gave the ability to differentiate our dealers, the ability to differentiate from other channels because of the offering was directed towards them and was an exclusive offering to them where you can get, while not infinite, practically infinite heights and widths and depths. So it's a good point of sale for the dealers. And then we also bundled with that a pricing scheme that made it easier to sell and upgrade. So that's really what's been driving the benefit for us is that combination of exclusivity and ability to more easily get a consumer to step up in terms of price to go for that higher content.","So I think that being said, we're not going to stop being on trend on some of the higher end finishes and continue to work in that area. So I think we're okay with KraftMaid and the upper end. We are working on the lower end, and we're working to continue to improve our Merillat assortment. The Merillat dealers are back and growing with us now, which I'm really happy about. The performance issues that we had are behind us, and then the long memories are starting to get behind us as well. So I don't know so much that it's targeted on the upper end as it is more broadly across the whole spectrum.","Keith Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our final question comes from the line of Phil Ng from Jefferies. Your line is open.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC","Hey, guys. With two of your competitors in paint merging, what type of impact do you see in your business? I'm not expecting much, but I'm just curious to get your thoughts on that front. And would you be interested in any of the assets if there were any that were divested?","Keith J. Allman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, I'll meet your expectation, Phil, and not give you much. This deal hasn't gone through yet. It's very early in the transaction. So we're pleased with our paint brand. We think we're a tough competitor, and not a lot of comment on that. But I will tell you that as we have said before, our M&A pipeline is focused on bolt-ons where we can add value to organic strategy and bring synergies. And that specifically is focused, while we look at other segments, we're focused on paint and Plumbing. So should there be something available here, we could very possibly be interested.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC","Got you.","John G. Sznewajs - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & VP","I would add to Keith's comments and say, hey, look, we think we've got a very good recipe for success within our paint organization. While we pay attention to the industry broadly, we're very focused on executing on our strategy of growing our paint business with our channel partner The Home Depot. And so while we're not blind to competition, we're focusing harder on our DIY products but we're also focusing very hard on our paint initiative because we think we've got great opportunities to continue to grow our paint franchise for the years to come.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC","Okay. That's helpful. And you mentioned Home Depot a big partner of yours. I believe they acquired Interline Brands last year which is a big Pro channel guy. Is that an opportunity down the road having more \u2013 a larger avenue to sell your business on the Pro channel side and would you be open into targeting a new channel outside of Pro as well as DIY down the road? Thanks.","Keith J. Allman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think Interline is a great opportunity for BEHR. When you look at our supply chain and our product assortment in the Pro, we think that we're tailor-made to add value to that. And we're working with The Home Depot to figure out how to do that, and I think that would be a great leverage for our product assortment and our supply chain.

Welcome to Masco Corporation's 2015 fourth quarter and full year earnings conference call. Joining me today are Keith Allman, President and CEO of Masco; and John Sznewajs, Masco's Vice President, Treasurer and Chief Financial Officer.","Our fourth quarter and full year earnings release and the presentation slides that we will refer to during the call are available on the Investor Relations portion of our website.

Allman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Irene. And good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us today. Please turn to slide four.","2015 was a transformative year for Masco. This time last year, we outlined the three elements of our strategy for value creation: number one, realizing the full potential of our core businesses; number two, leveraging opportunity across those businesses; and number three, actively managing our portfolio. Our focused execution enabled us to achieve the objectives we set out for ourselves in each of these areas. In 2015, we delivered solid full year results, we created a stronger foundation for future profitable growth, and we generated greater shareholder value.","On June 30th, we successfully spun off our Installation segment, transforming Masco into a global, branded, building products company; where our distinct advantages, brand and innovation, are key success factors. These distinct advantages, as well as our operating discipline we've deployed in our businesses, drove both top and bottom line growth.","Our revenues for the year grew 6%, excluding the impact of currency, notably, despite a weakening global economy, our international revenues increased 4% in local currency. Our operating margin grew 190 basis points to 13%, our highest operating margin since 2006, demonstrating our strong operating leverage and operational execution. All four of our segments contributed to this top and bottom line growth by continuing to capitalize on their leadership positions in the building products industry.","Let me provide you with some key highlights. Most impressive was the turnaround story of our cabinet business. By driving share gains at retail and dealer channels with KraftMaid, realizing significant benefits from cost savings initiatives and improving pricing dynamics in the builder channel, we drove a remarkable 810 basis point improvement in operating margin, surpassing everyone's expectations. We're proud of this accomplishment and excited about the future outlook of this business.","Our Plumbing segment had another outstanding year. By leveraging the strength of their brands and innovative products, Delta; Hansgrohe; and Watkins, our spa business; each broke sales and profit records in 2015. Illustrating their leadership \u2013 industry leadership, Hansgrohe was recognized with numerous international design awards and Delta Faucet received the 2015 WaterSense Sustained Excellence Award, the highest recognition from the Environmental Protection Agency for their exemplary effort to support water efficiency.","In our Decorative Architectural segment, BEHR drove gallon growth with their innovative new product, BEHR MARQUEE, their expansion into the PRO segment and their award-winning customer satisfaction levels. We remain committed to investing behind our growth initiatives, including launching four new PRO paint SuperCenters in 2015, which further improve our fulfillment and service capabilities to the professional paint contractor.","BEHR's leadership position in the architectural paint industry was reaffirmed with its number one ranking in the J.D. Power's 2015 Paint Satisfaction Study in the interior paint category. From a quality perspective, BEHR distinguished itself by simultaneously being awarded a number one ranking in interior paint, exterior paint and exterior stains by a leading consumer testing organization.","In our Other Specialty Products segment, Milgard Windows, the leading window brand in the Western United States, successfully capitalized on new home construction growth and growing repair remodel demand for higher-end offerings. Capping off Masco's strong operational performance this year was our ability to generate nearly $0.5 billion in cash. Consistent with our balanced capital allocation strategy, we returned over $575 million to shareholders through stock repurchases and dividends in 2015.","I want to thank all of our employees for their hard work, dedication and great performance in 2015. I will now turn the call over to John, who will go over our operational and financial performance in detail.","John G. Sznewajs - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & VP","Thanks, Keith, and good morning, everyone. As Irene mentioned, most of my comments will focus on adjusted performance, excluding the impact of rationalization and other onetime charges. Our 2015 performance was characterized by strong sales growth, driven by customer-focused innovation and solid operating margin expansion, resulting from cost control and productivity improvement.","The fourth quarter was our 17th consecutive quarter of year-over-year sales and profit growth. We finished the year strong, with both our fourth quarter and full year sales increasing 6%, excluding the impact of foreign currency translation. All of our segments contributed to our strong sales growth in 2015.","Foreign currency translation negatively impacted our sales in the fourth quarter by approximately $45 million and the full year by approximately $250 million, as the U.S. dollar strengthened against most major currencies, including the euro, pound and Canadian dollar.","North American sales increased 6%, excluding the impact of currency for both the fourth quarter and the full year due to strong demand for our repair and remodeling and new home construction products across all channels of distribution. As a reminder, repair and remodel activity represents approximately 83% of our total sales.","International sales increased 4% in local currency in the quarter and were up 5% in local currency for the full year. And our International Plumbing and Window businesses continue to perform above expectations.","Demonstrating our ability to leverage SG&A as we drive growth, our SG&A as a percent of sales improved 50 basis points in the fourth quarter to 18.5% and improved 20 basis points for the full year to 18.6% of sales. And we delivered solid bottom line performance as operating income increased 31% in the quarter to $219 million, with operating margins expanding 280 basis points to 12.8%. For the full year, operating income increased 19% to $927 million, with operating margin expanding 190 basis points to 13%.","The effect of currency negatively impacted operating income by approximately $6 million in the fourth quarter and approximately $42 million for the full year. For the fourth quarter, our EPS increased 61% to $0.29 and for the full year increased 35% to $1.19.","Please turn to slide seven. Our Plumbing segment continued its momentum on both the top and bottom line in the fourth quarter. Sales increased 10% excluding the impact of currency. This solid performance was driven by strong sales increases of faucets, showers, spas and rough plumbing products.","We're also pleased with our European performance in the quarter as our International Plumbing businesses grew 5% in local currency despite a tepid macroeconomic environment. Operating profit in the quarter increased 19% excluding the impact of currency, driven by incremental volume and a favorable price commodity relationship, particularly in Europe.","Turning to the full year 2015, this segment delivered another terrific performance as demonstrated by our Delta, Hansgrohe and Watkins businesses all experiencing record sales and operating profit. Excluding the $218 million of foreign currency translation, sales increased 8% driven by growth in faucets, showers, spas and new program wins in rough plumbing.","North American sales increased 10% excluding the $31 million impact of foreign currency related to the Canadian dollar as we continue to experience strong sales growth in both the trade and retail channels in 2015.","More specifically, our luxury brand, Brizo, continues to drive consumer demand in trade and showrooms for our innovative new products such as the Artesso kitchen faucet. In addition, Delta gained share in faucets, showers and bathing with new product introductions at retail and trade.","Our European businesses continue to outperform, delivering 5% growth in local currency as Hansgrohe grew its share in its core Central European markets with new faucet and shower offerings. Excluding the $30 million impact of foreign currency translation and the unfavorable impact of our commodity hedge of $14 million, full year operating income increased 9%.","Turning to slide eight, in the Decorative Architectural Product segment fourth quarter sales decreased 4% driven by reduced paint and stain volumes in the DIY channel. This decline was driven in part from a difficult year-over-year comparison. You may recall in the fourth quarter of 2014 the timing of inventory replenishment orders favorably impacted our results as the segment sales increased 7% in the fourth quarter of 2014. Solid gains in the PRO channel partially offset this decline.","If you exclude the period impacted by the timing of replenishment orders, we experienced mid-single digit gallon growth in the quarter.","Full year sales grew 2%, excluding the $11 million impact of currency due to the introduction of BEHR MARQUEE Interior Paint, strong BEHR PRO growth and Liberty Hardware's continued share gains from successful new product introductions and program wins in the retail channel.","Operating income increased 6% in the fourth quarter and for the full year operating income grew 12% over the prior year.","Turning to slide nine, we are very pleased with the execution on the turnaround plan by the Cabinet team in 2015. Segment sales increased 5% in the fourth quarter and 3% for the full year.","We continued our momentum from the third quarter with strong KraftMaid sales in the retail channel. Additionally, our dealer-exclusive KraftMaid Vantage product line, performing very well in the dealer channel, delivered both increased volume and favorable mix. Partially offsetting this growth was the deliberate exit of certain low-margin direct-to-builder business.","Segment profitability in the fourth quarter improved $26 million over the prior year and our operating margin was 7.5%, our best fourth quarter margin in this segment since 2007. For the full year, operating profit improved $82 million to $51 million, which was $10 million more than we anticipated at the end of the third quarter. This was due to continued growth of higher price point semi-custom KraftMaid offering and the benefits associated with operational and other cost savings initiatives.","Turning to slide 10, Milgard capped off 2015 with a great fourth quarter as they continued to drive higher volume and a favorable mix shift toward our premium window and door product lines. Milgard's growth, coupled with gains from the recent acquisition of Evolution Windows in the U.K., resulted in Q4 segment sales increasing 9% excluding the impact of foreign currency translation. This segment's operating profit was flat excluding foreign currency translation, primarily due to increased volume and improved mix, offset by increased ERP spend and other costs.","For the full year, segment sales grew 10% excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, with strong window growth in the U.S. with our dealers and custom builders as consumers upgraded their purchases to higher price point products. This strong volume growth and improved mix resulted in operating profit improvement of 25% excluding the impact of foreign currency.","Now turning to slide 11, the year-end balance sheet was strong with approximately $1.7 billion of liquidity. This will enable us to execute on our balanced capital allocation strategy of investing in our businesses \u2013 to grow in our businesses, pursuing strategic M&A, returning capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, and strengthening our financial flexibility by reducing our outstanding debt.","We continue to produce some of the best working capital results in the industry as working capital as a percent of sales dropped to a record low, 11.1% at year-end. This is a result of great execution in our supply chain initiatives to help us generate nearly $500 million of free cash flow in 2015. At the same time, we delivered on our commitment to return capital to shareholders by repurchasing 17.2 million shares in 2015 and raising our dividend in the fourth quarter.","Now with that, I'll pass the call back over to Keith.","Keith J. Allman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, John. We're proud of our track record of execution and as we enter 2016, we look forward to capitalizing on the momentum that we have built over this past year. Despite a level of global economic ambiguity, we remain encouraged with the opportunities before us. The fundamentals driving our core U.S.-based repair and remodel business, which I'll remind you represents approximately 80% of our sales, are strong.","Interest rates remain at historically low levels, which support home affordability. Demographic trends are increasingly favorable, which drive household formations. Home prices are appreciating, boosting consumers' confidence to invest in their homes. U.S. residential housing stock is aging, with the average age of U.S. home 35 years. And housing turnover, which is a leading indicator for our repair and remodel business, has accelerated.","Our international businesses have demonstrated that they can perform even in periods of economic volatility as demonstrated by international sales growth of 4% in local currency.","We will continue to drive shareholder value by deploying the capital we generate from our strong free cash flows, including investing in organic growth, investing in strategic M&A, continuing opportunistic share buybacks and consistent dividends, and retiring debt. Given our industry-leading positions, robust innovation pipeline and the operational benefits from our Masco Operating System, we remain on track to reach our 2017 EPS target of $1.80 that we set for ourselves back in 2015.","With that, I'll now open the call up for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Mike Wood from Macquarie Securities. Please go ahead.","Mike Wood - Macquarie Securities","Hi. Congratulations on a very strong year and quarter. My first question, I would love your take on just the overall health of the consumer. I'm looking at your results and if I exclude that inventory replenishment on paint, which looks like it had about a 2% impact, it looks like you're growing 8% organically. So, just some color on the consumer and maybe how much of that is share gain.","John G. Sznewajs - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & VP","Hey, Mike, it's John. Good morning. Yeah, thanks. So, yeah, feel really good about the year. In terms of the consumer, we're seeing, generally, pretty good things. As we've seen the year develop, as we highlighted in our comment, we've seen very good growth in our Plumbing business as well as our Window business for the last 5 or 6 quarters in terms of Plumbing, and even better than that, probably in the last 12-or-so quarters with our window business. And now that Joe Gross and the team at Masco Cabinetry have really had the chance to execute on a turnaround plan, we're seeing a very good growth with \u2013 particularly, our KraftMaid brand at both retail and the dealer channel. So, we feel really quite strong \u2013 good about where the consumer stands right now, if \u2013 what we're experiencing in the last several quarters. So, all in all, the consumer seems like they're back and investing in their home.","Keith J. Allman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Mike, I think the home price appreciation is helping with that. That's getting the consumer to now be able to connect the dots in terms of investment into their home. And we're also seeing some nice mix up shift in the consumer, with our Plumbing and Window businesses, in particular, really benefiting from a mix shift upwards. And then our KraftMaid business, lastly, with the mix shift there with our combination of new products and increased dealer sales is also helpful. So, all in all, we feel good about the consumer.","Mike Wood - Macquarie Securities","Thanks. And follow-up, your forecast for the $190 million CapEx in 2016, that's above where you been tracking. Can you give some color on where those investments are?","John G. Sznewajs - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & VP","Yeah, Mike. There's a couple of things there driving that this year. And as you know, typically, when we come on the first year \u2013 first quarter of the year with our CapEx guidance, we will refine that as the year progresses. But the couple of things that are driving a little bit north of our traditional 2% of sales are really a couple of three things. One, ERP investment at Milgard; two, we are in the process of expanding a distribution center for Hansgrohe over in Germany; and three, at Delta Faucet, we're making some CapEx investment in their \u2013 in a building there to \u2013 for their customer experience center. So, those are the three things that really elevated above the difficult 2% of sales.","Mike Wood - Macquarie Securities","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Nishu Sood from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead","Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you. And Keith, I just wanted to follow up on \u2013 you mentioned that you still feel comfortable with the targets that you laid out at the 2015 Investor Day and I appreciate that update. If we look back to what has changed since then, on the revenue side, obviously, the strong dollar foreign exchange, a bit of a headwind, maybe a little but incremental softness through the retail channel, but margin, commodities, obviously, have been pretty strong. So, trying \u2013 in terms of how \u2013 the path to get to that $1.80, has your \u2013 have your views changed? The $8.3 billion in sales, maybe \u2013 that will be a little bit more difficult to get, but obviously stronger margin. What's changed in terms of the path to getting there? If you could give us an update on that, please.","Keith J. Allman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure. At first, I'd say were committed to the $1.80 that's not changed and that's what we're focused on, overall shareholder value creation for the entire portfolio. Certainly, as the year unfolded, and we'd expect changes and puts and takes to happen in the forward two years as well. But when we look at it, really, the underlying volume in paint was a little bit lighter than we expected.","But on the positive side, Cabinets certainly had a more favorable year than we initially thought we had. Plumbing has also \u2013 with record years in both sales and profit from the two big horses in that segment with Delta and Hansgrohe. That was a little bit more favorable than we had thought. So, we're continuously monitoring our progress against the $1.80. There are some puts and takes, but we feel good, and remain committed to that $1.80.","Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thank you. And in terms of share repurchases, John, last year the third quarter was your heaviest share repurchase quarter. That was, of course, during a period when there was also market turmoil. So, you were opportunistic and took advantage of that. With this renewed market turmoil, have you been more active in the share repurchases so far in the first quarter? And so, you guided to a similar dollar figure this year, so would you be willing to increase that based on how the \u2013 if the opportunity presents itself? And are there any seasonal cash flow restrictions that might influence how you conduct those share repurchases as well?","John G. Sznewajs - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & VP","Yeah. Nishu. Yeah, you're right. We were a little bit more active in the third quarter of last year, as a matter of fact, the fourth quarter of last year, we pulled back a little bit., So, we pushed about 1.7 million shares in the fourth quarter of last year. In the first quarter, I think, we would have continued to be optimistic. And you're right, we did guide to approximately the same dollar value of share repurchases in 2016 as we had in 2015.","Here \u2013 in this part of the year, we have done some share repurchases, though we're a little bit constrained in the blackout period as to what we could buy, but we were active in the market as we saw the share price decline a little bit here in the first part of the year. And I would continue to expect us to be opportunistic, as we look at when and how we buy the shares back, but \u2013 and to part of your question about seasonal constraints, just given the $1.7 billion liquidity we have on the balance sheet, there are \u2013 that was the seasonal aspect of our business, really does not impact the pace or the in which we did buy our shares back.","Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of George Staphos from Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Unknown Speaker","Good morning. It's actually Alex Wong (26:04) sitting in for George. Thanks for taking the question, and congratulations on the year. If we just look at margins for a second, plumbing and paint showed really nice margin expansion in the quarter. Are there any one-time items that benefited that, and how should we think about it on a go-forward basis? It sounded, John, that a lot of it was cost control and productivity, but if you can provide a little more granularity there?","John G. Sznewajs - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & VP","Yeah. No, Alex (26:32), you're right. Good margins across the board in the \u2013 across all the segments in the fourth quarter, except for the Other Specialty, and I'll talk about that in a minute. As you look across each of the segments, Cabinetry, obviously, a little bit of volume growth, better mix as well as productivity improvements, because of the ERP implementation last year really drove us to a great 7.5% operating margin in the fourth quarter.","And our Plumbing business, really, it's more productivity improvement there, and some of the mix shift that we saw, as Delta saw some favorable mix. We did experience a little bit of negative mix in \u2013 at Hansgrohe during the quarter. And it's our at BrassCraft unit as well, our rough plumbing business. And I would also highlight the fact that in Plumbing, we saw some very good volume. We do estimate that we probably saw $15 million to$ 20 million of pull forward from Q1 into Q4 as a couple of our customers strive to hit higher rebate years in the quarter.","And then in Decorative Architectural products, yeah, that probably did \u2013 the team at BEHR and at Liberty did a great job as \u2013 both productivity improvement, as they continue to work on the Kaizen engine that we're trying to establish in our businesses, and also some nice volume increases, particularly, at Liberty.","Unknown Speaker","Thanks for that. And just as a follow up, appreciate the color on the mid-single-digit gallon growth in paints when adjusting for the inventory replenishment timing. But would it be possible to provide some granularity around PRO in terms of the growth rate maybe in the quarter or 2015, just to help us frame what the growth rate was like for that? And what's your outlook for 2016 on PRO?","Keith J. Allman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","PRO is going very well for us, and we would continue to expect in 2016 a similar trajectory than \u2013 as we saw in 2015, which is high double-digit growth rate in that segment. We're really, really happy with that, and that comes as a combination of investment both in terms of product as well as customer experience. And we're very tightly linked with our channel partner. And I think that shows the power of having that outstanding channel partner and working together specifically on this initiative.","So, the PRO is going very well for us, and we continue that \u2013 to expect that to continue. We highlighted a little bit on the call about the investment that we're making in PRO SuperCenters, which is basically \u2013 it gives us the capability to do high-speed tenting and jobsite deliveries to large PRO customers. And we're seeing a very powerful impact with that.","Unknown Speaker","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dennis McGill from Zelman & Associates. Please go ahead.","Dennis Patrick McGill - Zelman Partners LLC","Hi. Good morning, Keith, and John. My first question is for Keith. You mentioned the global ambiguity that's out there, and this is probably the biggest question on all of our minds, at least, but I guess the bigger debate is whether that is also in the minds of the consumer. So can you maybe just elaborate a bit more on what you've seen so far this year? And just big picture, how you think about the health of the consumer today? Any luck to the housing positives, which we would concur with \u2013 by at what point is that backward-looking, and do you start to worry about the filter-through effect at all?","Keith J. Allman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I'm not really \u2013 that's not one of the things that keep me up in terms of the \u2013 at night in terms of the health of the consumer. We're seeing really strong traffic in our showrooms, in particular. And as I mentioned, Dennis, in Plumbing, for example, the mix trade up in the success of our showroom brands and our Brizo brand and our Hansgrohe brand, which all tends to be at the higher end of the continuum with regards to price, is very solid. So that combination of traffic and the willingness to spend and we \u2013 we're continuing to see that, gives me confidence in the health of the consumer. As well as the overall macroeconomic indicators that we look at around jobs and home price appreciation, and some of those other things that we talked about.","In terms of the international ambiguity and some of the risk there, we have a very strong business in Hansgrohe. We sell to some 135 countries, and I think with their 2015 4% growth demonstration of their capabilities, that tells me that we figured out how to maneuver through this ambiguity.","So, all in all, clearly, there's some international issues that we're faced with. Hansgrohe is well-positioned to address them in terms of how that affects the customer in our core repair and remodeling business, which is 80% of our demand drivers. I feel good about it.","John G. Sznewajs - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & VP","Yeah, Dennis, let me just add there a little bit. As we exited 2014 and interest rates started to pick up, we saw a little bit of a pullback in refinancing activity in consumers. Now that the tenured treasury's dropped and mortgage interest rates are now at three-year or four-year lows, we expect increasing levels of refinancing activity, which generally has been a leading indicator for repair and remodel activity, which again drives north of 80% of our volume.","Dennis Patrick McGill - Zelman Partners LLC","Got it. And so, if you stay here today and you sort of set aside the pressure in the shares and the stock market overall, doesn't sound like you'd feel any differently or less confident about any of your businesses than you would have, let's say, two months or three months ago?","Keith J. Allman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","No, that's a true statement. When we think about 2016, we really view 2016 versus 2015 very similar to how we saw 2015 versus 2014, so a continuation of that trend with R&R right at about 5%. We think we'll see new construction come in right at about 10% growth slower down in the growth \u2013 slowing down of the growth rate in multi-family and a little bit of an acceleration of the growth rate in the single family.","And as we talked about \u2013 on the R&R side, with home price appreciation, good housing turnover and demographics that, that millennial group is aging. The average age from 25 to 29 is when they're clearly going to start having children, and that bodes well for new household formations, which at 1.7 million is a strong number. We feel good about the year going forward.","Dennis Patrick McGill - Zelman Partners LLC","We agree with you. Thank you, guys. Good luck.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Stephen East from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Stephen F. East - Evercore ISI","Thank you. Congratulations, Keith and John. Quick question on Cabinets. Keith, if you wouldn't mind delving in a bit more about how the quarter shaped up and what drove the beat from the dealer perspective and the retail perspective? And then your performance \u2013 I mean, you're already into \u2013 with this quarter, you're already at 7.5% op margin. You're long term target was 7% to 10%, so is it time to reset the bar for that? How are you all looking at that? And if it is time to reset the bar, what do you think is achievable by the time we get into the end of 2017?","Keith J. Allman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think I'll talk in generalities at first here a little bit, and maybe get into a little specifics about what we're thinking about in terms of carryover, particularly, on the cost side. But in terms of generalities, the KraftMaid business, particularly, in the dealer market has got some very nice traction. We're growing nicely in the dealers, the value of the Vantage product offering that were launched is significant, and that there- that volume is a mix help for us. So, we're seeing some favorable mix in Cabinets. Clearly, we've done a good job of cost takeouts. We had, as you recall, some significant issues around an ERP implementation in 2014. We've put that behind us, and the team is really locked and loaded in on a pipeline of further cost reductions, so we're continuing to drive it.","But admittedly, the year-over-year cost takeouts will not be as strong as they were when we look at 2016 versus 2015, as they were 2015 versus 2014. The better you get, the harder it is to get better. We took a lot of that cost issues out of the ERP systems, but we're going to continue to work on it. So, going forward, more specifically, you can think about approximately a $15 million carryover of cost improvements that we would have in that business, and then if you layer in the kind of growth rates that we talked about with R&R at about 5%, new construction at about 10% and the mix of our business in those two demand drivers. Think about around a 30% to 35% drop down in that incremental volume and I think that gets you right into where we're thinking about that segment for 2016.","Stephen F. East - Evercore ISI","Okay. That's great. And how you look at long term, maybe more generally on that 7% to 10% type of range?","Keith J. Allman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, That's certainly not the ceiling for us, and we're going to continue to drive that higher. We're focused \u2013 we're continuing to focus on cost outs, because, obviously, we never believe we're all the way there. We're going to continue to drive that continuous improvement, culture and mindset, but it's really about growth, and we're driving growth and profitable growth with good mix in that dealer channel, specifically.","Stephen F. East - Evercore ISI","Okay.","John G. Sznewajs - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & VP","Yeah, some of the new construction momentum that we talked about is at the 10%. In general, some of that will be abated as we continue to prune and focus on builder direct business, where we can really bring a value add and where we can get paid for. So that growth will be a little bit muted on the cap side.","Stephen F. East - Evercore ISI","Right. I got you. And then second question, just quickly, I didn't hear anything on the paint side about raw material benefits, what you're seeing there. And then as you look at cash usage, you laid it out pretty good for next year, how do you think about that longer-term, John, and where does the allocation go, call it, over the next, two years to three years?","John G. Sznewajs - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & VP","Sure, Stephen. So in terms of price commodities, we did have a little bit of a benefit there into 2015. We probably experienced the low to mid-single-digit deflation in the year 2015. That said, as you probably have heard there have been a number of suppliers that have recently announced price increases later in 2016. So, it's not really clear whether those will stick or not, but those are hanging out there over our head right now.","In terms of the second part of your question on capital allocation, you're right. We feel pretty good about where we're going to go here in 2016. Longer term and beyond that, obviously, we're looking at opportunistic acquisitions. And you can never really predict the timing of those, but with Amit onboard, and clearly trying to fill up the acquisition funnel. We've got a fair amount of activity generated towards that, but at the same time, looking at our share repurchases and making sure that we're doing the right thing for our shareholders by returning capital to them. And then, obviously, we'll take down some debt later this year with that maturity in October. We feel like we've got a good path forward, how we're going to allocate our capital. And it's all really going to be dependent upon the timing of some of these acquisitions that we're looking at.","Stephen F. East - Evercore ISI","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Eric Bosshard from Cleveland Research. Please go ahead.","Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning. In the Cabinet business, it was helpful to see your guidance on how the profit growth might perform from here. In terms of the market share growth, you talked about the progress you're making with KraftMaid and the progress with the market share in total. Can you just talk about or frame your expectations of how the Cabinet business might grow relative to the cabinet market in 2016?","Keith J. Allman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","We're really thinking about it, consistent with the market growth. We've had some nice retail growth this past year. We believe we're growing in the \u2013 and taking share in the dealer growth as well. That gets to be a little more difficult to peg the market size and the dealer market because of the fragmentation, but I would think about our growth rates being fairly consistent with the pace of the overall market.","Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","And the cabinet market, you're assuming grows in line with the R&R new construction market, is that what the assumption is that this point?","Keith J. Allman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, that's right, about 5% on the R&R side and then about 10% on new construction side.","Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","And then secondly, in the paint business, better growth, better underlying growth it sounds like in the fourth quarter and quite favorable raw materials into 2016. Can you talk about the volume and margin expectations in that business from a bigger picture perspective, what we should be thinking about?","Keith J. Allman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","We really haven't changed our outlook on the longer-term margin in this segment of right there at about 18%. That's what we talked about on our Investor Day, and that's where we continue to think about it. We're committed to investing for growth in this, not only in terms of products and customer experience in retail, but of course, to continue to invest in our PRO business. So, I think long-term, thinking about this segment at 18% is a good way to think about it.","Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert Wetenhall from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey. Good morning, everyone. Nice way to think finish the year on a high note. I wanted to ask if 2015 was about getting Cabinets back to profitability and spinning off Installation? Both pretty impressive things to accomplish. What's 2016 going to look like?","Keith J. Allman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Really, we're focused on implementing our Masco operating system and driving growth to outperform our markets across all of our segments. And then, to carefully use our capital to drive shareholder value. We've earmarked in the range of $500 million for acquisitions. Our plan is to be very careful with that and to look for bolt-ons, particularly in our Plumbing and Coatings businesses. We're committed to paying down debt. We're certainly committed to continuing returning cash to shareholders in dividends and our share buybacks. So, I think when I'm thinking about 2016, it's about deploying our Masco Operating System and outgrowing the market and being good stewards of our capital to drive value.","Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Cool. So, it's kind of like more of the same with improved profitability. And maybe, a question for John. How should we be thinking about free cash flow growth in 2016? Like, it's pretty clear that you guys are going to grow in line with the R&R market or slightly better hopefully, and you're raising your CapEx. And I was hoping to \u2013 is free cash flow going to grow this year in light of the bigger CapEx or will EBITDA growth outpace it? Any guidance there would be helpful.","John G. Sznewajs - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & VP","Yeah, Bob, just given the strength of our contribution margins, that run generally around 30% of incremental volume, and some of the improvements we're seeing across our business, I would expect that cash flow or \u2013 operating profit growth would run ahead of the CapEx investment \u2013 the increased CapEx that we're forecasting at this stage of the year.","So, I would overall expect free cash flow growth as we go from 2015 to 2016. The end markets are looking good, we're feeling good about the productivity improvements and the efficiencies in our business, so right now \u2013 feel good about that right now.","Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC","If I can just sneak one more in, what are the competitive dynamics? You guys have been very focused on expanding volume gallon growth in paint. And what are you just seeing from competitive response in the marketplace? You obviously dominate Home Depot with BEHR. What are you seeing out of Lowe's? What are you seeing across other competitors that have retail? How's that shaping up as we head into 2016? Thanks very much.","Keith J. Allman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I'd say probably the most meaningful competitive dynamic in paint was an increase in advertising that we saw in our competition last year as they launched some of their new product lines. We did not have any significant Q4 promotions. We did in July, and then Labor Day we had some very productive promotions for us. But by and large, we stayed to our plan with our channel partner, but we did see some increased promotions in the competition.","Outside of that, it's a tough category, it's a tough market, but I would say the competitive dynamics are fairly stable.","Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Got it. Good luck. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Keith Hughes from SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Keith Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thanks. Kind of building on Bob's question, do you anticipate, particularly with some of the raw material declines, that paint could become more competitive on a price basis as we go through 2016? And this is not specifically big box but looking at the other channels where consumers can buy paint.","John G. Sznewajs - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & VP","Keith, it really, I think, depends on where some of the price increases, the input cost increases, that announced. And I think what we're seeing in the marketplace now, we're seeing good sell-through on our product line, our paint products, in the retail channel. We're seeing very good growth, obviously, in the PRO business coming off of an admittedly low base. So, we feel really good.","Well, is the industry getting more competitive? No. I mean I think we were up against some large, tough competitors, but I think where we're at, with four or five main competitors in the industry, I don't think the competitive dynamic changed all that dramatically.","Keith Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Rehaut from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks. It's Mike Rehaut. Good morning and congrats on the quarter. First question, I guess I wanted to go back to the $1.80 goal on 2017 EPS. And clearly, there's a path there. That path would really require some good acceleration on the top line. And, of course, this year has been negatively impacted by FX. But still, even without that, I think across most of your segments, does require a good, at least, mid-single digit type of growth rate, if not stronger.","So, just wanted to get your sense of segment-by-segment, how you're seeing things progress in terms of executing some of those growth strategies. And obviously at the Analyst Day, you laid out multiple paths, a detailed type of a goal in segment-by-segment. So maybe if it's possible, just to give some highlights in terms of perhaps how some of those opportunities are progressing segment-by-segment. Any additional detail there would be great.","Keith J. Allman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure, Mike. In Paint, I've talked a little bit about it already on the call. The overall market was a little bit softer in DIY than we had planned, but we believe we're outgrowing that market and driving gallon growth. At the Analyst Day, we had our growth rate backend-loaded as we anticipated the ramping up of our PRO initiative to take some time. We're actually doing better in PRO than we thought. So, we anticipate continued ramp-up and feel good about how the last couple of years towards that goal in 2017 are going to roll in Paint.","In terms of Cabinets, we've talked about that as well. That has exceeded our expectations. The team not only did a great job last year of ripping the cost out that we put in to protect the customer due to that ERP issue, but we also are now getting more productive.","And we've put in a new finishing system, so our quality there is what I would consider best-in-class when you look at the quality coming out of that flat finishing line. We have new products that we're launching. The products that we have already launched are taking off. So, Cabinets are a real positive story and we're looking forward to profitably growing that business, particularly in the dealer channel.","In Plumbing, again, a very good story. We're seeing nice mix shift. We also have very strong performance out of Delta with a record year, and that's saying something for a company that's been as successful as Delta has been.","And Hansgrohe also had a record year, another very successful company with an outstanding leadership team in place there. So, we're clearly ahead of where we thought we would be. So, that's on the plus side as we think about moving out and going into 2017.","From a Windows perspective, we're continuing to grow and outpace the market and gain share. We have our Texas plant that's coming up nicely. The new ERP system so far is going very well. We've already implemented several components of that without a hiccup, so we feel good about that. And that's an outstanding value proposition with that \u2013 Milgard value proposition out there, that has driven their share performance.","So from a Plumbing, Cabinets, Paint perspective, while we talked about some puts and takes in terms of some stuff that's running hotter than we thought and stuff that's a little cooler than we thought, on balance we feel good and remain committed to the $1.80.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC","That's a great review, Keith. I appreciate that. Very helpful. And I guess just my second question goes back to maybe pushing you a little bit on Plumbing. You've reiterated an idea around the 18% long-term margin target and you ended 2015 at 20%. Is there anything specific that would, let's say, drive the results back from 20% to 18% in 2016 in terms of some incremental investment or higher advertising?","Because if you recall, I think some of that was what impacted the group in 2014 or into 2015, if I remember right. Or is there negative mix or is the incrementals a little bit worse than we're thinking? I Appreciate the 18% long-term guidance, but is there anything specific that's going to drive a 200 basis point reversal in 2016?","John G. Sznewajs - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & VP","Mike, it's John. A couple things that we talked about earlier. One, there are some price increases hanging out over the industry in terms of some of the input costs. The other thing, as we've talked about in the past, is PRO business that we're growing and growing quite rapidly is a negative mix impact on the overall segment. But that does not come at the same margin that our core DIY business comes at. And so, that would be a little bit of it.","And the third thing that you mentioned it in kind of your remarks is we continue to invest to grow this business. This is something that we want to do. Our goal in conjunction with our channel partners at Home Depot is to drive gallon growth, and that's what we're committed to with them, that's what we're focused on with them, and that's where we're putting our investments in this segment. And so, we're looking forward to having future good years but it's all about the top line movement on this segment.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Right. I Appreciate it. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Dahl from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Michael G. Dahl - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hi. Thanks. Keith, I wanted to go back to a response you had to, I think, Steve East's earlier question around Cabinets and $15 million carryover from the cost improvements, plus just the general leverage in the business. And so, if I wanted to push on that a little, because our understanding was a lot of the progress this year was somewhat organic in terms of mix improvement and some leverage and then some of the initiatives that may have been underway prior to the Analyst Day when Joe had outlined the $50 million in cost take-outs.","So, I guess, understand wanting to play it a little slow since it's still early on in the turnaround, but if the team's work isn't done, shouldn't you see more improvement in 2016 than just the carryover effect from the 2015 initiatives?","Keith J. Allman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","We're continuing to drive cost take-outs and revenue gains in this business. If you look at 2015 and the pace of the cost-outs that we did, that was the thing that really was a positive versus our expectations \u2013 was the speed that that team was able to take these costs out. So when you look at where they came out, a lion's share of these cost-outs came out early in the year as we were making these improvements.","So, the $15 million, certainly we're going to drive to try to get everything we can in terms of the cost take-outs. But we're also investing in this business and balancing it with growth investments around new products, around some pricing and some advertising and programs that we're running. So, I think thinking about the $15 million carryover plus the 30% to 35% dropdown in incremental volume, and think about that volume increment pretty consistent with the market, I think that's a good place to be.","Michael G. Dahl - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Got it, okay. And then, John, I think you made a comment on the Plumbing, that there was $15 million to $20 million pull-forward in sales in the fourth quarter. So just curious if you could give us a sense of how to think about that from a profit standpoint as it'll impact the first quarter of this year. Since it was coming against a higher rebate level, should we think about that as maybe less of a hit to the 1Q profits than normal, or just any color you can give there?","John G. Sznewajs - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & VP","Yeah, I'd say, Mike, I'm on about a 25% drop through on those, that pull-forward sales.","Michael G. Dahl - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay, thank you.","John G. Sznewajs - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & VP","Yeah.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Kim from Barclays. Please go ahead.","Stephen S. Kim - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yeah, thanks very much, guys. Congratulations on a good quarter. First question was about your comments on mix shift. I think that I heard you specifically call out the faucets, but I was curious as to whether you could expand a little bit on what you're seeing with respect to mix shift, particularly along a few vectors: one is across segments, was it more broad-based than just the faucets; two, was it primarily driven by new product introduction, is that primarily where you saw it, or were you actually seeing something more sort of organic across all your products whether they were newly introduced or not; and then thirdly, whether it's just a comment that you're seeing shifting to sort of higher end or if across this price spectrum you're seeing people willing to invest a little bit more for something a little better?","John G. Sznewajs - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & VP","Yes, Stephen, it's John. I'll give you a couple of comments on some, then I'll turn over to Keith for some comments as well. In terms of, let's say, the Window business for instance, we have seen a nice mix shift in our Window business for the last probably seven quarters or eight quarters as consumers have moved up the price continuum to either a high-end vinyl or our fiber glass window product at Milgard. And it's been a continued focus of the teams, but the consumers are driving that, and that's why you're seeing nearly double-digit growth in that segment for the last 12 quarters or so. So really, really strong growth, partially impacted by mix.","So then, we launched that Essence product about three years ago, and so that's driving it. And then, I'd say if you look at our Paint segment as well, we launched BEHR MARQUEE Interior Paint this year and we didn't see \u2013 well, let's say, a $45 a gallon or so price point for us at retail, our highest retail price point, we have seen some nice mix shift up. So, that is a new product introduction that is driving some of that mix benefit that we're seeing. And I'll let Keith talk about both Plumbing and Cabinetry.","Keith J. Allman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, Steve, I would say that the mix shift we're seeing is more broad-based. It's certainly not just constrained to one segment. Our spa business for example, that is an extremely discretionary, high-dollar ticket item, and we continue to do very well in that business with a record year. So, that's significant. In our windows business with the Essence product line, we're seeing that shift to that higher-end product very clearly.","On the Plumbing side, some of our most successful product lines are those that we sell in the showrooms, in the high end. We've talked about Brizo, Hansgrohe, and then our showroom-based products in Delta. And if you look at the \u2013 just an anecdotal view, as I was out at the Builders' Show and the Kitchen & Bath Show in Vegas, the most exciting part of the booths where we got the most traffic were in those higher-end items. So, it's broad-based. MARQUEE in paint.","So, I see it as a general trend in terms of driving the upgrades. Clearly, a part of that, we're enjoying due to new product introductions. The KraftMaid Vantage line has got a quite impressive penetration in our dealer segments, and it's very helpful as we present it to new dealers that we sign up. So, between driving share of wallet in our existing dealer base, to helping us have a solid value proposition to new dealers, it's very helpful. So, product plays a fundamental component.","As does channel focus, getting deeper and deeper relationships on our existing dealers, both in the Plumbing segment as well as in Cabinets, it's very helpful. Understanding how our channel makes money in this higher-end and helping drive them in that direction. We're seeing that in our plumbing wholesalers in particular. So, it's broad-based. It certainly is driven by new product introductions, but it also has a fundamental component around channel focus and relationships.","Stephen S. Kim - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Perfect. That's very helpful. Switching gears, I wanted to just ask a general question about the exit from the Cabinet, the builder direct business. My understanding is that this was something that you're still actively servicing the smaller builders in the market but you still represent the majority of the industry. But my understanding was it's sort of the larger builders that you chose to exit from.","I guess my question here is what's changed versus, let's say, 10 years or 15 years ago? Because obviously, you're very effective at serving large customers. So, that's really nothing new from Masco. So, I'm curious as to what do you think has changed in the industry and your relationship with the larger builders such that this is business that really just doesn't make sense for a large producer like Masco? Are these larger builders de-specking their product so that it's just not \u2013 the value proposition isn't there in Cabinets, or have they become noticeably more aggressive negotiators over the years?","Keith J. Allman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","It's more on the take-per-unit issue that's driving this to be a very difficult channel to make money in. So you mentioned 15 years ago, I don't know if it was that long ago, but if you go back to where the average home had, say, 18 boxes in it, they were 42-inch uppers, so big cabinets with solid wood, glazed, a ton of content and quite a significant amount of boxes. And then now, you move forward to where in some of the market, not all, but in some of the market, you're down to in the 13 boxes per unit to 14 boxes per unit, flat panel, low, very de-contented finishing levels, and de-contented hardware, that sort of thing.","So, your take-per-unit is significantly clipped in some of these customers but you still have the cost of that last mile of delivery, you still have to manage the installation and manage the punch out and all the other issues that go with keeping customers happy in this segment.","So, I would say the main driver on it really was the change in the type of product that was being delivered and our ability to make money given the, by and large, fixed cost nature of that last mile install and punch-out.","And it's not just the large builders. It's not strictly large builders. What we're really looking for is builders that value our brand, builders that value our excellent service and then partnering up with them. And what we're finding is that there's good business out there for us to have but there's some business that's not productive for us to have, and that's our approach.","Stephen S. Kim - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your last question comes from the line of Alex Rygiel from FBR. Please go ahead","Alex J. Rygiel - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Thank you. John, nice quarter. Keith, nice quarter. Just one quick clarification. Does the $1.80 view in 2017 include any incremental future share repurchases?","John G. Sznewajs - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & VP","Yeah, so, yes, Alex, good question. So, there's a couple of assumptions underlying the $1.80. One was constant currency kind of as of the date of the Analyst Day in May 2015. And the other was the assumption that we completed the 50 million share authorization that was announced on September 30, 2014 by the end of 2017.","Alex J. Rygiel - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Perfect. Thank you. Nice quarter.","John G. Sznewajs - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & VP","Yup.

Welcome to Masco Corporation's Second Quarter 2013 Conference Call. My name is Regina, and I will be your operator for today's call. As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded for replay purposes. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Maria Duey. Maria, you may begin.","Maria Duey","Thank you, Regina, and good morning to everyone. Welcome to Masco Corporation's Second Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me on our call today are Tim Wadhams, President and CEO of Masco; and John Sznewajs, Masco's Vice President, Treasurer and Chief Financial Officer. Our second quarter earnings release and the presentation slides that we will refer to during the call are available on the Investor Relations portion on our website. Following our prepared remarks, the call will be open for analyst questions. [Operator Instructions] If we are unable to take your question during the call, please feel free to call me directly at (313) 792-5500.","I'd like to remind you that statements in today's presentation will include our views about Masco's future performance, which constitute forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. We have described these risks and uncertainties in our Risk Factors and Other Disclosures in our Form 10-K and our Form 10-Q that we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","Today's presentation also includes non-GAAP financial measures. We have provided a reconciliation of these adjusted measurements to GAAP on our website at www.masco.com.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Tim Wadhams. Tim?","Timothy Wadhams","Thank you, Maria, and thank all of you for joining us today for Masco's second quarter 2013 earnings call. If you please move to Slide #4. We're very pleased with our second quarter 2013 results, certainly one of our strongest quarters since the downturn and a continuation of the momentum, which started for us in the fourth quarter of 2012. We continued our trend of delivering growth in the second quarter, with all 5 of our operating segments increasing top line sales and expanding operating margins. Our leadership position in the building products industry and our focused execution against rising new home construction activity particularly benefited our Cabinet, Installation and window-related businesses.","Notably, our Installation and Cabinetry segments were both profitable in the quarter, reflecting our strong leverage to a housing recovery and our continued commitment to cost containment. As we previously indicated, returning these segments to profitability has been one of our prime -- our top priorities.","Demonstrating the strength of our brands was a strong sales contribution from new product introductions, particularly in our paint and Plumbing businesses. And despite challenging macroeconomic environments in the Eurozone, our international sales increased in the quarter, reflecting strong performance by our international Plumbing and window businesses.","And if you would please turn to Slide #5. As we've communicated in the past, our strategy is focused on 4 key elements to drive performance. We expanded our market leadership by continuing our legacy of introducing new products and programs, which matter to both our customers and the end consumer. Our Decorative Architectural businesses introduced new products at retail, which have exceeded expectation. And we continue to reap the benefits from previously-introduced products and programs with our North American faucet and toilet businesses, which delivered mid-teens growth in the quarter.","Our emphasis on cost control is evident in our continued SG&A improvement. As I mentioned, we continue to see improvement in our Installation and Cabinet segments. Our Installation segment is capitalizing on improved market dynamics and drove increased sales in all channels of their business. By remaining focused on profitability, they continued their trend of improving operating profit. The new management team that's been in place in our North American Cabinet business for the past year has had a positive impact on that business. The segment reached profitability in the quarter and continues to execute on their plan of stabilizing the business and positioning it for future profitable growth.","Combining these 2 segments, our Cabinet and Installation business improved by $26 million of operating profit versus the second quarter of 2012, and we're obviously very pleased with that performance. In addition, we remain committed to strengthening our balance sheet and continue to improve our working capital during the quarter. These execution highlights produced a very strong second quarter, and we're very pleased with the trajectory of our performance.","If you please move to Slide #6. At this time, I'd like to turn the presentation over to John Sznewajs, our Chief Financial Officer. And John will walk us through our segment operating performance.","John G. Sznewajs","Thank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. If you could please flip to Slide 7. As Tim just mentioned, our momentum accelerated coming out of the first quarter, and we delivered a strong second quarter. Sales increased 10%, with North American sales up 11% and international sales up 6% in local currency for the quarter. Currency, I should say, had a minimal impact in the quarter. Volume increases were strongest in our direct-to-builder channel.","We did a great job of leveraging our fixed costs in the quarter, as our adjusted gross margins expanded 200 basis points to 28.9%. We're also pleased with the strength of our bottom line performance, as our commitment to cost control helped to leverage our SG&A and increased our adjusted operating income 57% to $206 million, with adjusted operating margins expanding nearly 300 basis points to 9.6%. We realized strong operating leverage, as we delivered 37% incremental margins in the quarter. And our adjusted EPS more than doubled in the quarter, to $0.23 per share from $0.11 per share 1 year ago.","Turning to Slide 8, we see the components of our operating income improvement in the second quarter. The $43 million increase in net volume\/mix was driven by solid volume increases in our Installation, Plumbing and Decorative Architectural businesses and to a lesser degree, in our Cabinets and Other Specialty segments. This growth was partially offset by negative mix in our Cabinet business, as we experienced solid growth -- sales growth to production builders in our Plumbing segment with our successful new programs and expansion into international markets.","Net price\/commodity improved by approximately $22 million, largely driven by our Cabinets, European Plumbing and U.S. window businesses. This also reflects the year-over-year impact of our metal hedge, which was $1 million favorable in this current quarter. We captured $45 million of profit improvements gross in the quarter, and we believe we are on track to realize our full year profit improvement initiatives gross of approximately $150 million.","Turning to Slide 9, you can see that our Plumbing segment sales increased 9% in the quarter. The strong sales momentum we've been experiencing in our North American faucet and toilet businesses, which include our leading brands, Delta, Peerless and Brizo, continued in the second quarter. Our sales of these products grew mid-teens percent, aided by last year's program wins in the retails channel and strong balanced performance in the trade channel, reflecting our continued investment in the showroom, commercial and multifamily segments of this channel. As a reminder, our revenue in the second half of 2012 benefited from about $25 million of load-ins related to our retail program wins in the third and fourth quarters of last year, so we'll have some difficult comps in the next 2 quarters.","We also experienced mid- to high-single-digit growth from several of our North American businesses, such as rough plumbing and spas. Our European sales rebounded nicely, with sales increasing 6% in local currencies, following a Q1 that was hampered by difficult weather conditions. This increase was led by Hansgrohe, as our other European Plumbing businesses were relatively flat in the quarter. Offsetting this growth were weaker sales from our bathing unit business. As we previously mentioned, we launched a retail shower surround and tub line review and exited a product line. These negatively impacted sales by approximately $13 million in the quarter, and we estimate it will total approximately $50 million for the full year 2013.","Year-over-year operating profit increased $37 million, driven by increased volume, a favorable price\/commodity relationship, particularly in Europe, and favorable productivity and cost control. This was partially offset by negative mix.","Turning to Slide 10, you see that revenue in our Decorative Architectural segment increased 9% in the quarter, driven by strong core DIY paint sales and new product introductions. The 2 products we've launched in Q2 at The Home Depot, BEHR MARQUEE and BEHR DECKOVER, are off to a terrific start. We also experienced growth in both our Pro and Mexico paint initiatives. And as a result, we had mid-single-digit gallon growth in the quarter. Finally, Liberty Hardware contributed to the segment's top line growth, as they rolled out several new programs and promotions at retail in the quarter.","Operating margins expanded slightly, as the benefits from additional volume were partially offset by increased advertising and other costs for the new products and programs and an unfavorable price\/commodity relationship. These costs aggregated approximately $10 million in the quarter.","Turning to Slide 11. You can see our continued focus on profitable growth in the Cabinet segment resulted in the improved bottom line performance, as we posted a profit in the quarter. We also saw improved top line performance, with segment sales increasing 5%. North American Cabinet sales, excluding countertops, increased high single-digit percent in the quarter, reflecting strong direct-to-builder growth. We are profitable in our North American business and improved our operating results in the quarter by $9 million as a result of cost control, productivity improvements, which include the benefits from prior year restructuring activities, and the favorable price\/commodity relationship that reflects lower promotional spending. This favorability was partially offset by negative mix due to increased sales to production builders. The turnaround plan in North America is on track, and we are profitable in this segment sooner than we anticipated as a result of our focus on cost containment, improving demand and restructuring actions taken in late 2012.","As we turn to Slide 12, you see our sales growth of 21% was primarily fueled by higher sales volume in our residential new construction, commercial, retrofit and distribution businesses. Residential new construction Installation sales increased more than 30% in the quarter, and have continued to focus on increasing our Installation sales across all lines of business. We are growing with all builders but particularly, the big builders, including Toll Brothers, D.R. Horton, Lennar, Pulte and KB. And in the second quarter, we signed a national contract with Beazer.","In addition to solid top line performance, management's strong execution delivered significantly improved bottom line results, with adjusted operating profit improving by $17 million and adjusted operating margins expanding 520 basis points. This segment exhibited strong operating leverage in the quarter, delivering 28% incremental margins despite the impact of rising material and labor costs. This business is focused on cost control, coupled with the benefits they are realizing from prior profit improvement actions, have positioned them to grow profitably with the housing recovery.","Turning to Slide 13. Our Other Specialty Products segment increased a strong 13% in the quarter, driven by North American window sales increasing more than 20%. This growth was due to higher sales in both our new home construction and replacement window markets, as well as new product introductions. We are particularly pleased that our replacement window sales increased high-teens percent, reflecting growth driven by new products. And despite difficult economic conditions, our U.K. window business grew low-teens percent due to higher volumes, and was aided by a small composite door acquisition that we made in the first quarter.","Segment adjusted operating profit improved by $8 million, and adjusted operating margins expanded 450 basis points, resulting from incremental volume and improved price\/commodity relationship and lean in-sourcing savings.","Finally, looking at our balance sheet on Slide 14. You can see that we continue to have strong working capital execution, as we improved working cap as a percent of sales to 13.1% from 14.6% 1 year ago. Also here in the third quarter, we'll be retiring our $200 million debt maturity on August 15, its maturity date. And finally, we finished the quarter with just over $1.2 billion of cash on the balance sheet.","Now if you flip to Slide 15, with that I'll turn the call back over to Tim for his comments on our outlook.","Timothy Wadhams","Thank you, John. And if you would please move to Slide #16. Our success in the second quarter reflects our commitment to executing on the priorities we identified at the beginning of the year. Our Installation and Cabinet businesses are steadily delivering results against improving market dynamics. We expect that the previous actions they have taken to improve their business will continue to deliver benefits going forward. Our commitment to innovation, new programs and strategic growth initiatives is producing results, as evidenced by our second quarter performance. And as John mentioned, debt reduction is slated for a couple of weeks from now with cash that we have on hand.","We're encouraged by our second quarter performance and the continued progress against our priorities. And we certainly want to thank our employees worldwide for their ongoing efforts to drive Masco's performance.","And if you would please move to Slide #17 and a couple of comments before we go to the Q&A session. While we're pleased with our first half performance, we recognize that we still face macroeconomic challenges that we'll have to manage. The recovery in the U.S. is less than robust, and the Eurozone continues in recession. While new home construction in North America continues to increase, the composition of starts, at least at this point, continues with more multifamily homes, which has an impact on our mix. And commodities have, for the most part, temporarily eased. However, the potential for unforeseen volatility continues to exist.","Despite these macroeconomic factors, we're committed to delivering strong performance, and we've demonstrated our ability to capitalize on the improving market dynamics we are all experiencing. Our market-leading positions, supported by our strong liquidity, enable us to respond to increased demand in new home construction with greater agility. Our brands and our commitment to innovation represent strengths we can leverage in the repair\/remodel channels to gain share and increase our strategic relationships with our key customers. And fundamental to delivering that strong performance as we realize additional growth opportunities, we are confident that our operating leverage, driven by our scale and our emphasis on cost containment, will deliver meaningful incremental profits.","We're encouraged by our first half 2013 results, and particularly pleased with the strength of our second quarter. We have solid momentum going in the second half of 2013, and we're off to a good start in the third quarter, with July sales up low-double digits.","And with that, I'd like to open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Dan Oppenheim with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Michael Dahl - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","It's actually Mike Dahl on for Dan. First question, actually, on the paint side, I wanted to see if you could drill down into that $10 million that you mentioned as far as the unfavorable headwinds on the margin side. How much of that was commodity? How much of it was the initiatives at Depot? And how should we think about that for the balance of 2013?","John G. Sznewajs","Yes, Mike, it's John. I'd tell you that the majority of that $10 million was program-related costs and that the price\/commodity relationship was just a minor piece of that $10 million. To the second piece of your question about how do we think about that going forward, hopefully, we'll have some additional program costs going forward, because that reflects the fact that we're getting additional business with our home center customers, our other customers. So but if it -- as you know, those things are tough to predict, so it's tough to say how those will play out in the segment going forward. But we'll continue to keep the investment community apprised as we win new programs in -- at retail.","Michael Dahl - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And shifting gears to the install side, the national contract win with Beazer, could you talk about the scope of that? Is it just Installation? Or how many products are you getting in the door there?","John G. Sznewajs","Yes, again, that's an Installation national contract as well. I don't believe we have 100% of their business, but I think it's a vast majority of their business, because they may have some developments or communities where we don't have resources. So -- but yes, again, the team down at MCS has done a fantastic job of dealing with the big builders and winning these national contracts.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bob Wetenhall with RBC Capital Markets.","Robert C. Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Guys, fantastic quarter and a great job on cost control. Had a quick question about Cabinets. New res construction is -- housing starts were up 20% year-over-year, and I think you got pricing in the quarter. So I was wondering -- I thought Cabinets would be a little bit more robust top line, and I was curious if that was due to Europe or some volume growth was offset by somewhere else.","Timothy Wadhams","Yes, Europe hit us a little bit on the negative side on that, Bob. And thanks for your comment in terms of the quarter. But yes, Europe hit us a little bit on the top line, and we had a little bit of a mix issue, as John mentioned, relative to top line. We were up 8% in North America in terms of Cabinets overall, and had a little bit of mix impact. But felt like we had a pretty decent quarter, did a good job on the dealer channel, good job with big builders, obviously.","Robert C. Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Got it. And one follow-up, too. Paint was really good top line, growing 9%. And I was hoping I could get a little bit more color on incremental margins given the good volume, and kind of the trade-off between higher advertising costs versus potentially weaker mix and how you anticipate that playing out. You got great incrementals across the rest of the portfolio. Was wondering if paint starts to deliver equally attractive incrementals in the second part of the year.","Timothy Wadhams","Yes, thanks. Yes. The issue there, Bob, is traditionally, we have -- almost all of our advertising spend takes place in the second quarter, and so when you compare second quarter to first quarter, you've got that delta. And in this particular quarter, as John mentioned, we had some additional costs related to new programs, as well as some incremental advertising costs above last year. As we mentioned before, our primary objective when -- in the paint category is to drive gallons. And as John mentioned, we had a nice lift in terms of a mid-single-digit increase in terms of gallon growth versus last year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dennis McGill with Zelman & Associates.","Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, LLC","First question just had to do with the remodeling side of the business, you noted in the press release, seeing some pickup there. I was wondering if you'd just elaborate on the products that you guys look at internally, whether that's components of Cabinets or components of windows, faucets, et cetera, where you're seeing starting to see some momentum there and just thoughts around the category.","Timothy Wadhams","Yes. Lower price points, Dennis, obviously, with paint and faucets have done well for us over the course of the last couple of years. But what we've seen, and we talked a little bit about that in the first quarter, is a little bit of pickup in terms of windows for replacement or remodel, as well as Cabinets. As we mentioned, dealer sales in Cabinets were relatively strong in the quarter related to last year, so we've seen a little bit more activity there. I think it's still a little bit early to declare victory on the bigger ticket side, but trends seem to be indicating more foot traffic, more interest and certainly a little bit of pickup in terms of execution.","Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, LLC","Okay. And then separately, we've seen a lot of press releases related to Installation branches starting to come back online. Can you just maybe quantify where that number stands today and then just how you guys are thinking about growth in that business through branch as supposed to organic for existing branches over the next couple of years?","John G. Sznewajs","Yes, sure, Dennis. I think our goal for the year is at about 15 branches at MCS by the end of the year. I think to date, we're at about 9 so far, and not all of those are full branches. I should remind you and the rest of the folks on the line that we're taking a very thoughtful look about how we expand the business as it relates to our branches. So in a number of areas, we're adding unmanned strategic stocking centers, where we are -- where we just drop inventory, and our crews can go there and pick up inventory to expand the geographic presence that we can cover. So -- and those, we believe, will ultimately turn into full branches once they've got enough volume in that area where it warrants a full branch. So we're trying to keep our costs in control as we slowly grow that business.","Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, LLC","But does that change the incremental cost of the business at all?","John G. Sznewajs","I think it improves it slightly, but I don't think we're going to materially deviate from that sort of 25% incremental margin that we've been guiding you to over the course of the last year or 2.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Keith Hughes with SunTrust.","Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Question is on Europe. The international sales were, I think, surprisingly good considering the trends there. I know you talked about some individual wins. But what's your view for Europe for the second half of the year? I mean, are we seeing a bottoming there? Or just what's the kind of trend you see going into July?","Timothy Wadhams","Well, I think that what I've seen more recently is it looks like things have stabilized to a certain extent in Europe, at least that's what some of the economists seem to be indicating. We are, as we've said before, Keith, we're positioned in the United Kingdom, which is 1 of the 2 economies that I think are expected to have positive GDP this year, along with Germany. And so our position there has been pretty stable over the course of the last several quarters. We did have a nice lift in that quarter with our window business -- in the second quarter with our window business, which is in the U.K. And then, of course, Hansgrohe, with their international reach, if you will, continues to do a nice job with some of the project works, some of the new markets that they've entered. So that tends to give us a little bit more balance. So I would expect that we'll continue to do well with Hansgrohe going forward. There's no question about that. I don't particularly anticipate a big lift at -- from an economic standpoint, but I think our businesses will continue to perform pretty well. You might remember that we've been up in local currencies in Europe over the last 2 years, as I recall, fairly modest but still up. And I think that as things get better, we would expect to do a little bit better than we've done in terms of the last couple of years.","Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","And a final question on the paint business. You talked about some extra adds in product rollout costs in the second quarter. Does that abate as we go into the third?","John G. Sznewajs","Yes, Keith, that would abate. That was kind of a onetime cost to get those products into the store shelves and in front of the consumers.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Nishu Sood with Deutsche Bank.","Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Wanted to ask the first question. John, you mentioned the nice performance on Installation Services, and that was in spite of labor issues. So I wanted to get a little bit more color on that. And also, in any of your other businesses that are more labor intensive, as you're ramping up in terms of adding staff back for the housing recovery, how those -- whether any issues have cropped up and how that's been managed, how that's been looking?","John G. Sznewajs","Yes. Nishu, we have experienced some labor tightness around -- in various markets throughout the United States, but it's not a uniform tightness. So certain markets like Texas, Northern California, the Denver area, we've experienced some tightness in our labor. But we've hired more than 500 people across the organization since the beginning of the year to support the growth, and that's not just in our Installation business, but that's company-wide. And we've not had a significant issue in terms of finding people. We offer benefits, where many of the competitors that we're up against are smaller competitors and may not have a benefit package they can offer to their employees. So getting people in the door has not been an issue for us at this point.","Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And what about across the other divisions? Has that been an issue, let's say, in the -- in windows or Cabinets or any of your other operations?","John G. Sznewajs","No, at this point, Nishu, it's not been an issue across any of the manufacturing operations. We do actively recruit all the time to ensure that we've got an adequate pipeline of labor, and we feel pretty confident about where we stand today.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","My 2 questions were really around Behr. On the one hand, I was hoping to discuss with a little bit more detail what kind of pickup or benefit you're seeing from the Pro initiatives. And then switching gears to the retail side, if you will, what benefit are you seeing from MARQUEE thus far in the market, and what benefit is it having on your other brands through Home Depot?","Timothy Wadhams","Yes. On the Pro side, George, we continue to show nice increases year-over-year. We haven't quantified that, but we continue to get some nice penetration there. We've done some things to repackage our KILZ brand, done some formulation work there. And that activity seems to be paying off fairly well, and so we're encouraged by that. As it relates to MARQUEE, MARQUEE is doing well. We launched both MARQUEE and a new product that we call DECKOVER, and both of those are doing well in the marketplace. DECKOVER, given the time of year and the nature of that product, has really been a grand slam for us. It's just performed exceedingly well. In fact, we've had a little bit of problem, quite frankly, from a supply perspective in a couple of situations, so we're ramping that up. But both of those products are performing well for us at retail.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just on the Pro initiatives, you say you're doing well. I know you're not quantifying it, but would it be fair to say you're doing better than your own-roll gallonage growth, even though I realize that's kind of an apple-and-oranges comparison?","Timothy Wadhams","A little tough for us to respond to that. We didn't really break it down between Pro and DIY. As we indicated, we were up mid-single digits in terms of gallons. But that would really apply to both retail and Pro. I can't tell you it's 6 and 6, but it certainly would represent increased gallons in both those areas.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Wood with Macquarie Capital.","Mike Wood - Macquarie Research","You had impressive Cabinets margins, but as I do look at the roughly $25 million annualized that you saved from the 2 plant closures and I attribute 1\/4 of that to the quarter, it looks like it leaves about 25% incremental margins in the remaining sales growth. I'm curious if that's what you'd expect going forward if there was a drag on that from the product rollouts, like Merillat next quarter, that you're planning?","Timothy Wadhams","Yes, it's a more mix issue, Mike, in terms of the large increase that we've had on the new builders side -- or new home side, excuse me, particularly with some of the larger builders. So that's more of a mix-related issue in terms of the analysis that you just did.","Mike Wood - Macquarie Research","Great. And also in the press release, you've mentioned you were encouraged by R&R trends. Could you give us an update in terms of what that growth rate looked like? And in the past, you've given an update in terms of post quarter trends, so if you have any comments on July?","Timothy Wadhams","Well, July was pretty much, across the board, came in strong. As we mentioned, low-double digits, and there really isn't anything unusual going segment by segment. I mean, all segments had some strong results there. We talked a little bit earlier about the R&R side of things, and as we indicated in the press release, seen some improving trends there. As I mentioned previously, lower ticket items like faucets and paint have continued to do well. But we are seeing a little bit more activity around windows for replacement or remodel, as well as a little bit more activity from a Cabinet standpoint. I wouldn't necessarily want to predict what the second half would look like there. I mean, our sense is that, that ought to continue. I think some of the fundamentals, when you think about housing turnover, you think about the fact that home price appreciation has continued, which is certainly a plus in that regard, consumer confidence is ticking up a little bit, job growth is there. So it would feel to me like, assuming that, that continues in the second half, we ought to continue to see positive trends in those 2 bigger ticket items for our business.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Zener with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","I'd like to follow up on the windows, where your success continues. Not only I think is the category turning, but you're obviously gaining share. And could you kind of discuss how that plays out given you're more Western focus? You talked about home prices. I mean, is there something really distinct that you are seeing, since your growth rates are so strong and so given your regional exposure, a? And b, is it getting more rational on the extrusion side? Is that actual industry finally getting its capacity in line?","Timothy Wadhams","Yes, I would think from a capacity standpoint, Ken, that things are fairly balanced. You might remember that about 1.5 years ago or so, we took a couple, 3 plants out in the West and certainly, feel like our capacity's in a very good spot at this point in time. And yes, what I would say is that we are a regional business, and when we talk about increases, we're talking about, in terms of share, talking about the regional market that we play in. And Milgard's continued to just do a very good job. It's a great brand. We've had some new product introductions that have helped, a lot of focus on dealer relations and the pipeline in the dealer channel. And obviously, in the West, we've seen some improved repair\/remodel activity. So I think it's more a market dynamic and the fact that we're executing at a very high level and we've got some new product in the channel.","John G. Sznewajs","And Ken, just to add to Tim's comment just to refresh your memory, we do our own extrusions within Milgard. So we don't really take a look at the extrusion industry and what's happening out there. We feel pretty comfortable about our internal capacity.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then if you could -- in Installation, where you did obviously go to positive, can you kind of maybe give us a little more granularity around what's enabling you to go into these markets? Is it that the -- there's a certain volume that you're targeting? And could you perhaps comment on the volume leverage that you're getting as opposed to price in the business, enabling you to lift margins as well?","John G. Sznewajs","Yes. Ken, as we have historically said, maybe to address your last question first. We've typically experienced about 25% incremental margins in this segment on volume, and that's about where we're at right now. We've been very consistent on that over the course of the last several quarters, so the volume has been pretty good. In terms of how we grow this business, we are being very thoughtful about where we see demand increasing, and then placing our R&D strategic stocking centers, that we talked about a little bit about earlier, in those locations where -- that are seeing that growth in demand and going after it with our large builder and then also our more traditional local and regional builders as well. So we cut across all the customers in that segment or that business. So we feel very good about the execution that the team is delivering there.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Right. And I guess to the extent you're running below, if you say 25% on volume and if you're below that, are you insinuating that price was not positive?","John G. Sznewajs","No, if you're asking about the fact that there was some Installation pricing that was put out in the marketplace in the second quarter, I'd tell you that we worked hard to offset that -- those increases by working with our suppliers, focusing on our own internal productivity, but then also, in certain instances, passing through price as required.","Timothy Wadhams","Yes. And Ken, that's been a dynamic for the last couple of years. So we have not had significant price\/commodity impact in that segment over the course of the last couple of years. So I think to John's point, we've been successful managing price increases that have been placed in the market.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sam Darkatsh with Raymond James.","Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Most of my questions have been answered. Specifically, I guess, Cabinets, regarding to the home center level, you mentioned the dealer and the builder demand being real strong. What are you seeing there? And what do you expect over the next 6 to 12 months at that specific vertical?","John G. Sznewajs","Yes, Sam, it's John. We -- I think it's fair to say that we had modest share increases year-over-year in Cabinets at home centers. I'd also tell you that sequentially, as we talked about in our first quarter call, that we had stronger share gains from Q1 into Q2, as some of our competitors rolled off some of the aggressive promotional activity that they were undertaking, and we've been very consistent with our promotional activity. So as we -- as I referenced on the first quarter call, you're going to rebalance after the end of those promotional periods. So feel pretty good about where we're at, as always, continue to focus on that aspect of our business to try to grow it.","Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","And key retailer sales, Tim, did you mentioned that? I didn't hear it if you did.","Timothy Wadhams","No, I did not mention it, Sam. And we have made a decision not to provide that going forward. Basically, that doesn't say a heck of a lot about our business. It does give some readthrough, if you will, to a couple of our customers, and from their perspective, they would appreciate it if we didn't disclose that particular metric. So we've decided not to do it. Obviously, as you look at our segments and think about paint, think about Plumbing, think about the commentary that we do by channel, you can get a pretty good perspective of how we're doing in that particular area of the business. But from our standpoint, that doesn't really lend a whole lot to understanding Masco's performance.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Nick Coppola with Thompson Research.","Nicholas A. Coppola - Thompson Research Group, LLC","So looking at Cabinets, particularly at retail and dealers, are you starting to see customers trading up to some of the higher price points that would be accretive to margins?","John G. Sznewajs","Yes, Nick. We're are starting to see some evidence of that, as people shift up from some of our lower basic rate products to things like all-plywood construction, some of the premium door styles and finishes. We are seeing some of those trends in the marketplace.","Timothy Wadhams","Yes. The other thing, Nick, that I think is kind of important there is that folks who are interested in a higher-end cabinet, our semi-custom, for example, if they're not going to buy it now, they tend to wait. And so we're not seeing people necessarily trade down in that channel. So -- and I think that's another nugget, if you will, in terms of just the way people are starting to think about things. At least, that's what we're feeling in the marketplace.","Nicholas A. Coppola - Thompson Research Group, LLC","Okay, that's helpful. And then across segments, if I heard correctly, sales to big builders has improved even incrementally relative to prior quarters. Thinking about that, what is that a function of? Is it really a function of new contracts, like we talked about with Beazer? Or is it really getting additional penetration with existing customers?","Timothy Wadhams","I think it's a combination of really getting new opportunities with builders, and again, as John had indicated, we've always been strong across the -- with the local or regional guy. But I think what's really happening there is that the bigger builders are taking share, that when you think about the new home activity, a lot of that is being picked up by the larger builders.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Adam Rudiger with Wells Fargo Securities.","Adam Rudiger - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Can you talk about what happened -- what the sales did in June? If I recall, you -- intra-quarter, you had talked about some double-digit and mid-teens growth in April and May, which suggests June might have slowed a little bit. So can you just talk about the puts and takes and maybe last year's comparisons in June?","Timothy Wadhams","Yes, June was up mid-single digit in terms of sales. You're correct. April was up mid-teens. May was up low-double digits. So there was a little bit of a drop, vis-\u00e0-vis those 2 months. But as I mentioned, July came in or it looks like it's going to come in. We don't have the final numbers yet, obviously, but it looks like it's going to come in at least at the low double-digit kind of range. So I'm not sure I'd read too much into that, Adam. I think that given the strength of April, May coming off of a relatively slower first quarter, we talked about that from a weather perspective. So I think there was a little bit of a lift there, weather related. June came in about what we anticipated, quite frankly, in terms of our planning. So there wasn't necessarily anything unusual relative to June. And as I indicated, July has picked up again to at least what appears to be a low double-digit area.","Adam Rudiger - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then on that note, was there -- do you think there -- was there a -- from May with the new programs of the deck paint and the MARQUEE, did that, do you think, add? Or as you quantify the incremental sales at Depot, that might have been kind of onetime in nature as you get those products in the stores?","John G. Sznewajs","No, we did not quantify, Adam. Partly, if you recall Tim's comments a couple of minutes ago about the strength of some of the activity surrounding those new products, we don't think that there was much of a load-in impact in the second quarter just given the strength of the sell-through that we saw on those products.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Rehaut with JPMorgan.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","First on Installation if you could. In the past, in the last cycle, when you were growing both sides of the business, the Installation side and the non-Installation side, as you were ramping up the non-Installation products, there was a negative mix there. Since then, in the downturn, you've shutdown a lot of those non-Installation products. So I was hoping if you could give us a sense of where you are in terms of the dollar mix of the business between Installation, non-Installation and retrofit and the relative profitability of those 3 segments and how you think about that coming out into this upcoming cycle.","John G. Sznewajs","Yes, Mike, you got a couple of questions embedded in there, so let me try to -- make certain that I get to all of them. So I think your first question was around the mix of business Installation versus non-Installation. And right now if you look at our contracting business, it looks like about a 2\/3, 1\/3 kind of mix, 2\/3 being Installation, 1\/3 being the diversified products that we call them, things like fireplaces, gutters, garage doors and after paint. Also, I think you asked about the profitability of Installation versus the diversified products. And I'd tell you, you might expect that -- we've always been a large buyer of installation, so I think those products do have slightly better margins than our diversified products. But I would tell you that our diversified products, the ones that we're still in, are much better than the diversified products that we had several years ago, just given the breadth that we had. And was there a third question embedded in there, Mike, that I may have...","Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","John, just about how you think about growing each of the 2 businesses going forward. If, coming up into this upcoming cycle, are you going to maybe lean more on the Installation side, or would you kind of try and grow that non -- or that diversified products business back to where it was?","John G. Sznewajs","Clearly, Mike, because we've narrowed the scope of the number of diversified products, it won't nearly get to be the size that it was in the last cycle. That said, I think what we're trying to do is better balance the business for the long run, and that includes looking at focusing on the retrofit business, where we do have dedicated salespeople going after that business, and then continue to focus on both Installation and diversified products with all of our customers. So I think there's -- the foot's on the gas across all 3 kind of -- all 3 product categories.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And just one additional question if I could. On the new products, I believe you mentioned right at the beginning of the call that some of them were exceeding your expectations, which is great to hear. I was hoping maybe, is there -- are there any kind of metrics you could share about how you track those new products, perhaps as in terms of a vitality index across all of your sales or contribution to growth and how we should think about that going forward.","Timothy Wadhams","Yes, we don't necessarily break out the contribution or haven't tried to aggregate that, Mike. But basically, you might remember from some of our presentations that our vitality index currently is running above 30%. And in our vitality index, our new products -- manufacturing products, that excludes our Installation business, but basically, those are products that we've introduced within the last 3 years as a percent of our total sales, and that's been above 30%. My guess would be, given the strength of what's taken place this year, we should certainly be, in 2013, above that 30% level going forward. And that really reflects the emphasis we've put on innovation, some of the new programs we've come out with, the toilet programs, some of the faucet programs. And we certainly see that as a very fundamental part of our strategy going forward, and a continued area that we'll certainly be emphasizing.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. Can I squeeze one last one in?","Timothy Wadhams","No, we need to move to the next person. But we'll catch up with you on the phone.","Operator","Our next question comes from Stephen East with ISI Group.","Stephen F. East - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Tim, when you look at your incremental op margins, they've improved awfully nicely in the first half the year, and I actually look for some acceleration in the second half of the year. What -- where do you think your normalized incremental op margin should be? And how long do you think it takes you to get back as you sort of climb down during the re-acceleration period of the cycle?","Timothy Wadhams","I think the way to answer that, Steve, is really talk about our contribution margin. Obviously, the incremental profits have been a little bit higher than 30%, which is basically the contribution margin across the enterprise. We've talked a little bit about that by segment. But I think from a modeling perspective, if you were to use the 30%, that'll get you into the right ballpark. We've had a little bit of benefit, as John mentioned, from price\/commodity relationships that tend to help that. But I think if you use the 30% contribution margin, I think that is a very good proxy for what ought to drop to the bottom line on incremental volume. As we've said a couple of times, when we have a new program, that's a little bit different. Those incremental margins can be a little bit less than that, because you've got additional advertising or merchandising-related costs, which would be true with, for example, with our new toilet program.","Stephen F. East - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And would the remodeling incremental margin be any different than what you would see in your normal course of business?","Timothy Wadhams","I wouldn't necessarily say so, Stephen. Again, when we think about incremental or contribution margin on volume, that's pretty constant. Typically, on the repair\/remodel side, you might have a little bit of additional advertising-related cost or merchandising-related cost. But again, that blended 30% is a pretty good way to look at it.","Stephen F. East - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just one last question, someone asked you about June. The last few quarters you've seemed to -- your trend seems to be strongest in the first month of the quarter and ease back a bit. Should we -- is that how we should think about your business? Or have there just been some unusual things that have transpired as you go through the quarters recently?","Timothy Wadhams","I don't know that I would necessarily read too much into the fact that the first month of the quarter, for the last couple, 3 quarters, has been strong. We're not complaining about that at all. I mean, we certainly have enjoyed some pretty good starts to the quarter. If you go back to January, as well as April and July, there's no question. And again, I think that anytime you're in a recovery, it's going to be a little lumpy at times, and you're going to see order patterns change a little bit, buying patterns by consumers change a little bit. I mean they can move around, and I think that's more indicative of the fact that we're still coming off of a bottom here that's been pretty protracted. The recovery in housing has been pretty strong and pretty solid over the course of the last 1.5 years or so. But when you look at GDP and the overall general economic environment, it's still relatively weak. So I think we're going to probably see some movements like that. But I think that from a trend standpoint, we're not experiencing anything that is concerning to us about the order patterns per month or the monthly results. I mean, we have been able to -- we forecast things, obviously, like everybody else. And generally speaking, our forecasts have been pretty good from a monthly perspective. So I don't know that there's anything necessarily unusual there.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Susan Maklari with UBS.","Susan Maklari - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Quick question for you. You mentioned that you're still making progress in terms of the $150 million goal for profit improvement. And given what we've seen this year and the sort of general expectation for trends going forward, is there any thought of maybe updating that goal? And can you give us maybe any sense of what you would need to see change out there in order to get some kind of a change in -- or an update in that?","John G. Sznewajs","Susan, as we took a look at it and what we've come in with year to date, I think we're comfortable with the goal. As you might recall, we undertook a pretty significant activity in the back half of last year, which impacts, obviously, the first half of the year. So maybe that's some of the progress we've made year to date, the strength of it won't be as great in the back half of this year, and so that's way we're sticking with the $150 million at this point. But we'll update you again at the end of the third quarter.","Timothy Wadhams","Yes, that certainly doesn't suggest, Susan, that we're not always looking for incremental opportunities, whether it's process improvement or other efficiencies. I mean, we continue to drive for that, and certainly, we'll continue to push hard. But to John's point, we'll update you with that as we go along.","Susan Maklari - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then just in terms of the M&A environment, can you give us a quick update there? Are you seeing anything changing or anything that's sort of come up of interest or...","John G. Sznewajs","Well, clearly, compared to the last 4 or 5 years, when there was virtually no M&A activity in our industry, the increase in the number of businesses that seem to be coming to market has increased nicely. And you would expect, being one of the leaders in the building materials industry, we do take a look at a lot of the folks that do come to market, and we are being very selective about how we think about M&A. Just to give you a sense, I mean, you should not anticipate that we would add a sixth or seventh product line at this point. Though we might consider a small tuck-in, like we did for our U.K. window business earlier this year. So those are the types of things that we're looking at, at this point, Susan.","Operator","Our final question will come from the line of David MacGregor with Longbow Research.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","I just wanted to ask you about the Cabinet business. A few years ago, you combined your retail and your builder Cabinet businesses, and part of that was the pursuit of cost reductions, but also trying to develop a good, better, best product lineup that would allow you better penetrate the retail and the dealer channel and win market share. And you, obviously, accomplished a lot in terms of getting your fixed cost down and getting your break-even point down in that segment. But if you could just talk a little bit and update us on the extent to which you feel you've made progress in terms of developing a good or a strong good, better, best product lineup and your strength at opening price points and your ability to win share as a consequence?","Timothy Wadhams","Sure. Yes, I think your focus is right, David. We did put a lot of emphasis on the cost side and have made very good progress there. We also think we've made some improvements in terms of the 3 brands. You might remember that, in February, we launched a new product for the KraftMaid brand. As I think John indicated in the last call, we've got a major, in fact, the largest in the history of Merillat's existence, a new product launch coming up this fall. So we think we've made some good progress there. We are working to do a good job to clarify what all of those brands represent. And to the extent that we think about good, better, best in terms of our quality brand, our Merillat brand and our KraftMaid brand, we think we've got good distinction there and certainly feel like we're starting to see a little bit of a lift in terms of the marketplace and a good response to some of the things that we've done to position those brands. So I think we're in a good spot. Obviously, we think we've got some good upside in that segment, and we've got to continue to demonstrate that going forward.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Well, just a second question on working capital. You've made a lot of progress there. I think you got your working capital or percentage of revenues down about 150 basis points year-over-year. Is this about as good as it gets, given you've got new product rollouts, you've got new listings, you've got cyclical recovery in front of us? Does working capital consume cash going forward?","John G. Sznewajs","David, we have been pleasantly surprised at how the entire team across the enterprise has driven our working capital improvement over the course of time. And so every time I think we've hit a new low, we, next quarter, do another new low. So I feel pretty good about it. Incrementally, I don't think it's going to get significantly better. Do we still have opportunities there? I'd say we do. I think our receivables and payables are probably in about as good a shape as we're going to get them. I think there's still some opportunity to take a look at inventory across the spectrum. So I'm hopeful that there's some opportunity for further working capital improvement, and we're going to go after it without a doubt. But it's been a great team effort so far in getting where we're at.","Timothy Wadhams","Yes, I think, David, we'll continue to push there, but John and the finance team, Dave Brown and our supply chain guys and our business unit folks have done a very, very good job over the course of the last couple of years. I mean, there's no question about it. But we'll keep pushing. We can always do a little bit better. And our folks are committed to make that happen.","And with that, I want to thank everybody for participating today, and we'll turn it back to you, Regina.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference call.

My name is Angela and I will be your operator for today's call. As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded for replay purposes.","I will now turn the call over to David Chaika, Vice President, Treasurer and Investor Relations. You may begin.","David Chaika - Masco Corp.","Thank you, Angela, and good morning. Welcome to Masco Corporation's 2018 second quarter conference call. With me today are Keith Allman, President and CEO of Masco; and John Sznewajs, Masco's Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Second quarter earnings release and the presentation slides that we will refer to today are available on our website under Investor Relations. Following our remarks, we will open the call for analysts' questions. Please limit yourself to one question with one follow-up. If we can't take your question now, please call me directly at 313-792-5500.","Our statements today will include our views about our future performance which constitute forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risk and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. We describe these risk and uncertainties in our risk factors and other disclosures in our Form 10-K and our Form 10-Q that we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Our statements will also include non-GAAP financial measures. Our references to operating profit and earnings per share will be as adjusted unless otherwise noted. We reconcile these adjusted measurements to GAAP in our earnings release and presentation slides which are available on our website under Investor Relations.","With that, I now turn the call over to Keith.","Keith J. Allman - Masco Corp.","Thank you, Dave. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Please turn to slide 4. We continued our sales momentum in the second quarter. Our top line increased 10% excluding the impact of currency, driven by strong growth in the Plumbing, Decorative Architectural, and Cabinetry segments. Our sales grew 6% excluding the impact of currency, acquisitions and divestitures. Our teams executed well against our plans as we continued to make strategic investments into the business, integrate our Kichler acquisition and implement price across all segments resulting in an operating profit increase of $8 million in the quarter and a 16.5% operating margin. Our EPS increased 21% to $0.75 per share.","Before I address our individual segments' performance, let me address the topic of inflation and potential impact of the latest rounds of tariffs, as I know this is top of mind for many of you. As anticipated, we experienced commodity and other inflation across our segments in the second quarter and we continue to work to mitigate the effect of this inflation with disciplined cost control and pricing actions. We implemented price increases across all four segments in the first half of 2018. We believe these pricing actions will offset the commodity and other inflation that we have seen, and we expect our price\/cost relationship to be approximately neutral in the second half 2018. If we need to take further pricing actions, we will.","As we discussed last quarter, we have not been materially impacted by the steel and aluminum tariffs that have been enacted. While many of the products and components that we source from China would be impacted by this latest round of proposed tariffs, we are confident in our ability to mitigate this potential cost increase, if enacted, with our flexible supply chain and price as needed. Additionally, we feel we are on equal or better footing compared to our competition across our product categories considering our significant domestic manufacturing capabilities in Plumbing and Cabinetry.","Now, moving back to this quarter's performance, let me give you some additional insight into the drivers behind each of our segment's performance beginning with Plumbing. Our Plumbing segment continued its consistent top line performance by growing 9% or 6% in local currency. Watkins, Hansgrohe and Delta drove this growth by capitalizing on strong demand across channels and geographies. North American Plumbing grew 6% in local currency. Watkins achieved a record sales quarter due to new product introductions in its dealer channel and strong growth in its retail channel.","Delta had another successful quarter with continued momentum in the showroom, retail and e-commerce channels. I'm very pleased that this performance was achieved while also launching a new ERP system at Delta, our largest North American plumbing operation. The ERP launch on May 1 went well, and I'd like to commend and thank the Delta team for their tremendous efforts to make this system launch a success. International Plumbing grew 5% in local currency, driven by Hansgrohe's strong growth in its home market of Germany and continued strength in China.","In our Decorative Architectural segment, sales grew 22%. Excluding our acquisition of Kichler Lighting, sales grew 6% with mid-single-digit growth in both DIY and pro. In our coatings business, we continued to execute our plan together with our channel partner, The Home Depot, to drive pro paint sales growth by expanding our pro hub store concept and sales force.","The integration of Kichler Lighting is progressing on plan in its first 100-plus days. As a reminder, Kichler is a leading developer of decorative residential and light commercial lighting products, ceiling fans and LED lighting systems across both consumer and professional distribution channels into $6 billion residential lighting market. Decorative lighting has a similar customer base as many of our building products where the purchase decision is based on design, breadth of product offering, quality and reliability of service. We fully expect to leverage our operational capabilities and coordinate our design experience and expertise as we integrate Kichler into Masco to further strengthen our position and profitably grow with our many shared customers.","Moving on to Cabinetry, our Cabinetry segment delivered 13% growth excluding the divestiture of Moores. We drove growth in our repair and remodel business across all channels, led by the ramp up of our Menards business as well as strong growth in our dealer channel. The rollout and initial months of the Menards program have gone extremely well, and we are on plan to achieve an $80 million annual sales run rate during the fourth quarter.","Turning to Windows, excluding the effect of the Arrow divestiture and foreign currency, sales matched last year. We experienced increased costs and inefficiencies in the segment primarily due to the rightsizing of our UK workforce and an adjustment to our warranty reserve largely due to cost inflation. A portion of these costs will likely continue into the third quarter.","Moving to capital allocation, we continued our share repurchase activity in the quarter by repurchasing 3 million shares for $115 million, bringing our year-to-date share repurchase total to $265 million. Based on the strength of our forecasted cash flows and our strong liquidity position, we intend to deploy approximately $200 million toward share repurchases or acquisitions in the second half of 2018.","Our Board of Directors also announced its intention to increase our annual dividend by $0.06 per share or 14% beginning in the fourth quarter, reflecting their confidence in our long-term prospects. This is the fifth consecutive year we have increased our dividend. In addition, we further strengthened our balance sheet in the quarter by retiring $114 million in debt that came due in April.","Lastly, we're updating our anticipating earnings per share for 2018 to be in the range of $2.48 to $2.55. This adjustment is largely due to the increased cost in our Windows segment that I just discussed.","Demand across our product segments and geographies remains robust. I'm very pleased with our performance in the first half of the year and believe we are well positioned to capitalize on this robust demand to drive strong growth and margin expansion in the second half of 2018.","Now, I'd like to turn the call over to John who will go over our operational and financial performance in detail. John?","John G. Sznewajs - Masco Corp.","Thank you, Keith, and good morning, everyone. As Dave mentioned, most of my comments will focus on adjusted performance excluding the impact of rationalization charges, inventory step-up related to purchase accounting for the Kichler acquisition and other one-time items. Also, as a reminder, any reference to prior period comparisons have been adjusted to reflect the adoption of the new revenue recognition and pension accounting standards. Please refer to page 19 in the earnings call presentation for the details we provided last quarter.","Turning to slide 6, we delivered solid double-digit top line and earnings per share growth in the second quarter. On a reported basis, sales increased 11%, or 10% in local currency. Excluding divestitures and acquisitions, sales increased 7%, or 6% in local currency. Foreign currency translation favorably impacted our second quarter revenue by approximately $29 million. In local currency, North American sales increased 12% in the quarter, or 6% excluding acquisitions and divestitures. We continue to experience strong consumer demand for our industry-leading repair and remodeling products across all channels of distribution and across all price points. As a reminder, repair\/remodel activity represents approximately 84% of our total sales.","In local currency, international sales matched the second quarter of 2017. Excluding the divestiture of Moores, international sales increased 4%, driven once again by Hansgrohe. Gross margins were 33.6%. As we look ahead to the second half of the year, we expect solid gross margin expansion year-over-year as the price\/cost relationship improves and the strategic investments diminish.","Our SG&A as a percent of sales improved 100 basis points to 17.1% as we continue to leverage our SG&A while making strategic investments to drive profitable growth. We generated operating profit of $380 million and operating margins of 16.5%. As we discussed on last quarter's call, operating margins were impacted in the second quarter due to strategic growth investments, ERP costs, and a lag in price\/cost. We also experienced incremental cost in our Windows segment. These items aggregated approximately $30 million in the quarter.","Our EPS was $0.75, an improvement of 21% compared to the second quarter of 2017. And as Keith mentioned, we are narrowing our annual EPS estimate range to $2.48 to $2.55 per share. This lowers the midpoint of our EPS range by $0.04. The principal item that affects this change is the incremental cost in our Windows segment that Keith described.","Turning to slide 7, our Plumbing segment experienced another quarter of strong demand and solid growth as sales increased 9%. Excluding the impact of currency and acquisitions, sales increased 5%. This solid performance was driven by growth in our faucet, shower, and spa businesses. Foreign currency translation favorably impacted this segment's sales by approximately $25 million in the quarter. Our North American sales grew 6% in local currency as we experienced strong consumer-driven demand for our industry-leading brands across all channels with growth in wholesale, retail, dealer, and e-commerce customers. As a reminder, the segment experienced approximately $10 million of sales that were pulled forward into Q1 from Q2 due to the implementation of Delta's ERP system.","Additionally, our spa business continued to outperform the competition, as Watkins Wellness leveraged its strong dealer network, innovative new products, and industry-leading brands to drive growth. Our international plumbing sales increased 5% in local currency as Hansgrohe's focus on key markets continued to yield results with strong growth in both Germany and China.","Turning to segment profitability, operating margins were impacted by a lag in price\/cost and strategic growth investments, which include displays. These items aggregate approximately $15 million. Mix also impacted margins largely due to our lower price point Peerless faucet win at retail. As we consider the second half of the year, despite the anticipated $5 million of ERP spend at Delta in the third quarter, we are confident that we will experience margin expansion as our pricing and cost containment actions are realized and our strategic growth investments begin to favorably comp year-over-year. As a reminder, we had $18 million of display and other spending in the second half of 2017. For the full year, we expect operating margins for this segment to be down slightly compared to 2017.","Turning to slide 8, the Decorative Architectural Products segment grew 22%. Excluding the acquisition of Kichler, sales grew 6%. This performance was driven by Behr's pro and DIY businesses each growing mid-single digits. Liberty Hardware also contributed to the top line as it continues to achieve strong growth in both its retail and e-commerce channels. Operating income in the second quarter increased 11%, driven by the Kichler acquisition and increased volume, partially offset by higher depreciation and amortization expense from the Kichler acquisition and an unfavorable price\/cost relationship. As we look to the second half of 2018, we anticipate continued cost pressure on raw materials for paint and we will work to mitigate this inflation as needed. But for the full year, we expect margins in this segment will be in the upper end of our 16.5% to 18.5% range.","Turning to slide 9, in the Cabinetry segment, sales increased 13% in the quarter excluding the impact of the Moores divestiture. This outstanding performance was driven by our industry-leading brands as we experienced double-digit growth in our repair and remodel business and low-single-digit growth in our new home construction business through increased volume and favorable price. The Cardell program at Menards continues to roll out on schedule and we are very pleased with this program's initial performance. Segment profitability increased in the quarter by $2 million, principally due to increased volume and favorable price\/cost, partially offset by mix and ramp-up costs related to the Menards win. For the full year, we expect 5% to 7% sales growth excluding the divestiture of Moores with operating margins at approximately 2017 levels.","Turning to slide 10, excluding the divestiture of Arrow Fastener, our Windows segment sales grew 2% and matched prior year in local currency. Foreign currency translation favorably impacted this segment's sales by approximately $2 million. This performance was driven by single-digit growth at Milgard due to increased volume, favorable pricing, and a positive mix shift toward our premium window and door products. This was offset by a market softness in the UK. As a reminder, this segment faces a tough comp in the third quarter as segment sales grew 9% in the third quarter of 2017.","Segment profitability in the quarter decreased $10 million, driven by actions we took in the UK to further right-size our workforce and inefficiencies in an increased warranty reserve at Milgard. We anticipate approximately $5 million of incremental costs in the third quarter as we address the inefficiencies and launch new products. For the full year, we expect this segment sales growth to be 3% to 5% excluding currency and divestitures, with operating margins down approximately 100 basis points compared to 2017.","And turning to slide 11, we ended the quarter with approximately $400 million of balance sheet liquidity as well as full availability on our $750 million revolving credit facility. Working capital as a percent of sales increased 190 basis points versus prior year to 17.1%, largely due to the impact of the Kichler acquisition. For the full year, we expect working capital as a percent of sales to be approximately 15%.","We also took further action to strengthen our balance sheet by retiring $114 million of debt in April. During the second quarter, we continued our focus on shareholder value creation by repurchasing 3 million shares valued at approximately $115 million, bringing our year-to-date total to $265 million. With our strong free cash flow, we expect to deploy approximately $200 million in the second half of 2018 in either acquisitions or share buybacks on top of the more than $800 million deployed year-to-date. In addition, expressing confidence in our future, our board announced its intention to raise our annual dividend to $0.48 per share, a 14% increase starting with our Q4 2018 dividend.","Lastly, the outlook for the business remains strong. We're seeing solid growth in North America, Europe, and China and we remain confident in our ability to generate more than $800 million in free cash flow in 2018.","And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Keith.","Keith J. Allman - Masco Corp.","Thank you, John. I'm pleased with our performance in the first half of 2018. We moved quickly to address the shifting market environment with effective pricing and cost actions. Our Plumbing and Decorative segments continued to drive growth with new products and programs and channel expansions. Our focused efforts in our Cabinetry business has led to strong growth and margin performance, and we have successfully executed on growth investments and a significant ERP launch at Delta.","Furthermore, the long-term fundamentals of our industry remain strong. Demographics should drive household formation and housing for years to come as the large millennial generation has begun to start forming households. Home price appreciation, which has a strong correlation with repair and remodel spending, remains strong at nearly 7% year-over-year. Existing home turnover remains at a healthy overall level of 5.3 million units. Age of housing stock continues to increase as 65% of the U.S. housing stock is now over 30 years old and older homes have more repair and remodel spending per home than newer homes. And importantly, consumer confidence remains at a 15-year high, as consumers benefit from a healthy economy.","With the actions we have taken and the investments we have made, we are well positioned to capitalize on the favorable industry fundamentals to drive strong growth and margin expansion in the second half of 2018, as we expect to generate over $800 million in free cash flow for the year. We will continue to deploy that cash flow with a disciplined and balanced approach to acquisitions with the right fit and return, share repurchases and dividends to create value for our shareholders.","With that, I'll now open up the call for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question is from the line of Stephen Kim with Evercore ISI.","Stephen Kim - Evercore ISI","Thanks very much, guys. Appreciate the time here. I guess if we could just start with your Plumbing business, I think you broke out $15 million in price\/cost and also I think ERP within there, perhaps I just want to make sure that we got the components clearly. And in terms of what we could expect in 3Q and 4Q, if you're specifically looking for margins to be up year-over-year in both of those quarters in addition to just the back half.","John G. Sznewajs - Masco Corp.","Hey, Stephen. Good morning. It's John. In terms of the components that I called out, yeah, indeed $15 million as the total breaks out \u2013 we did call the ERP spend of about $5 million on our last quarter call, so the balance is roughly our price\/cost lag. In terms of what you can expect for Q3 and Q4, if you recall, we have a fair amount of display investment in the third and fourth quarter of last year. So the second half of last year, we had at aggregate about $18 million in total in this segment. So, yes, to your second question, I would say that we would anticipate margin expansion in both the third quarter and fourth quarter in that segment.","Stephen Kim - Evercore ISI","That's good. Great. And then the second question I had was related to your comment about the M&A \u2013 acquisition and\/or repurchases. Was curious if you could describe what the pipeline is looking like and if there are certain end markets that look particularly promising to you. Could you give us any kind of color as to geographically or in terms of verticals, which areas you're most focused on now given the pipeline?","Keith J. Allman - Masco Corp.","Stephen, our pipeline is healthy and it's diverse. We have opportunities that we're looking at that range from smallish in size and bolt-on, if you will, to existing segments, and we have some larger ones both that would function within the segment as well as looking at some new segments. So we have a broad approach in terms of size. We're also looking both domestically and internationally, and we have the capital in the balance sheet to do these acquisitions, but I'd like to reiterate that we're going to be patient and make sure that we find acquisitions that have the right fit and return that fit with both our strategy and our culture and obviously we're focused on creating shareholder value for the long term. So we're going to remain disciplined and balanced in our approach, and we are going to continue to value our acquisitions with a particular eye on return on invested capital where we can generate appropriate return for the shareholders.","Stephen Kim - Evercore ISI","Would it be fair to say that when you're talking about both bolt-ons as well as maybe ones that are a little bit larger that you'd be willing to go above that $200 million if the right opportunity came along or would you say that that $200 million we should think of as kind of a ceiling?","Keith J. Allman - Masco Corp.","No, I wouldn't think of it as a ceiling given the right opportunity. And again, based on our eye and our patience, it would have to be the right opportunity. But we have, as you know, the quality of a balance sheet to be able to go out over that $200 million level if the right opportunity came.","Stephen Kim - Evercore ISI","Got it. Thanks very much, guys. Appreciate it.","Operator","Your next question is from Susan Maklari with Credit Suisse.","Susan Maklari - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Good morning. I just wanted to talk a little bit about the paint segment. You mentioned some unfavorable price\/cost that's continuing to be a lag in that part of the business. Can you just kind of give us some sense of how those factors are coming together, your ability to get price there, and maybe within that, some of the expenditures related to the expansion of the hub stores?","John G. Sznewajs - Masco Corp.","Yeah, good morning, Susan. In terms of the input cost of paint, yes (26:50). As I think our other public peers have disclosed, there are continuing headwinds in terms of price\/cost affecting both TiO2 and some of the engineered resins that go into paint. And so, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we're actively working to mitigate this through both pricing as well as working with our suppliers and working internally on our own efficiencies to try to mitigate those as best we can.","In terms of our ongoing investment in expanding our pro business, we're absolutely making further investment as we indicated earlier this year. That said, at this point, we're not disclosing the amount as our channel partner and we have decided to just to say a little less about our investment in that area at this point.","Susan Maklari - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. And then certainly in terms of cabinets, you had some really nice performance on the top line and the margin in there. It seems like you're getting some momentum with that dealer investments and some of the other things that you've been doing. I guess can you just give us a little more color on that?","Keith J. Allman - Masco Corp.","Sure, Susan. This started, call it, 12 months to 18 months ago when we really went to work to reconfigure our supply chain and our factories to address the dynamic in the market. So we took our Quality factories, for example, and focused them \u2013 Quality, meaning the Quality brand, and focused them on the assembly of incoming purchase materials for the opening price points. So we have a factory that's reduced its complexity and focused on the lower price point part of the market. We then took the Quality brand and the Merillat brand, and we common-ized the architecture. So again, driving simplification and cost reduction to go after, call it, that middle point of the market, and then we have the very efficient and effective KraftMaid brand and supply chain that focuses more on that middle to higher semi-custom. So, a combination of reconfiguring our supply chain so that we have the right level of complexity and cost across the different bandwidths of the market, and then continuing to drive good sales force execution.","And I think when you look across \u2013 while it's taken some time for us to execute this, when you look at the Menards win that we were able to land, that was really an amplification of our strategy and shows that how we were able to be competitive with regards to low cost opening price point, if you will, stock cabinetry, value semi-custom and semi-custom, so it's starting to pay off and we are going to continue to drive this segment, and obviously with nice dropdowns on the incremental growth, we're upbeat about its potential.","Susan Maklari - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from Michael Rehaut with JPMorgan.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks, good morning, everyone.","Keith J. Allman - Masco Corp.","Good morning.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC","The first question I had was on actually a couple of the segments that Susan asked, maybe just in a different light, First, on paint, with DIY and pro both up mid-single digit, I was more interested in pro for the moment. DIY obviously very solid mid-single-digit growth, but pro, I've been thinking about that more as a little bit of a growth category and you kind of consistently pointed to a low-double-digit or a 10% or better type of growth rate. So with the mid-single-digit growth this quarter, I was just curious if you kind of view that as the beginning of an inflection point where perhaps, given the size that it's achieved over the last few years, we should be thinking more about a mid-single-digit type contribution rather than low-double digit or is this more of a one quarter type of pause because we've also kind of thought about this as still a good area of expansion potential over the next two or three years.","Keith J. Allman - Masco Corp.","We're committed to this to driving double-digit growth for the next couple of years in this pro segment, keeping in mind, of course, that it is over $400 million, so it's a sizeable chunk to drive in terms of double-digit growth, but we've seen that our investments in this pro hub concept and expanding our pro sales force works. We're pleased with the growth. I am sure there's going to be some quarters that are more accelerated than others, but we remain committed to the double-digit growth and we're happy with our DIY growth as well. Together with The Home Depot, I think we're doing an outstanding job of converting shoppers to buyers in the aisle. We're generating good traffic with our brand and our advertising scheme, and of course the quality in the can speaks for itself. So, overall, when we look across coatings both against ourselves and the competition, we think we're doing pretty good.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. That's great. Understandable. Secondly, on the cabinets segment, great growth there and an impressive turnaround, continues to be a great turnaround story over the last couple of years. I was curious in terms of the Menards rollout if that was a contributor to the obviously very strong top line growth this quarter. I know you said that you continued to expect 4Q to recognize that $80 million annualized run rate, but I don't know if there's any \u2013 I mean cabinets is more of an inventory business, not sell-in. I don't know if there is any sell-in in advance of that, but if the Menards rollout contributed to the top line. But even outside of that, if you could just talk about the dealer channel with this double-digit growth there or repair\/remodel and what are the key drivers that allowed the strong results.","Keith J. Allman - Masco Corp.","Yeah, of course, the Menards win, it was a big win for us and, as I mentioned, being able to showcase the work that we've done over the past year, year and a half in terms of cost competitiveness, assortment expansion, and good sales work, so that is definitely a contributor. But as you mentioned, we had strong growth in our dealer channel as well, and then when you look across demand drivers, we had strong growth in both repair and remodeling and new construction. So it's beginning to come together and it's, as you might imagine, no one action that we took. We've built this and executed this turnaround over a series of actions that included obviously cost-outs. We've driven significant assortment enhancements in terms of launches at both KraftMaid and Merillat, and then the reconfiguring of the supply chain that we did, call it, 18 months ago with regards to focused cost reduction around the various price points along the continuum. So all those things have come together and we're excited about the potential in the business.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Any further granularity in terms of maybe over the next couple of quarters, should we be expecting at least like a core mid-single-digit growth and obviously Menards could potentially add to that?","Keith J. Allman - Masco Corp.","We're looking for the full year in that 5% to 7% growth range.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Great, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Nishu Sood with Deutsche Bank.","Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you. So, Keith, appreciate the commentary about the input costs and the tariffs at the beginning. Looking at the guidance reduction, the kind of $0.04 at the midpoint, I imagine a lot of puts and takes going into that that you highlighted or you called out the incremental Decorative Architectural, can you talk about just some of the other puts and takes as well relative to where your expectations were previously? It sounds like in Decorative Architectural the price\/cost trends are going a little better than expected perhaps with the high end of your margin guidance range there. In Plumbing, it sounds like perhaps the opposite. So maybe some of the other kind of major puts and takes that went into kind of reconsidering the guidance for this quarter.","Keith J. Allman - Masco Corp.","Yeah, Nishu, when we compare what we thought about at the beginning of the year versus what we're seeing unfold here, there's two primary drivers. One is foreign exchange and two is the Windows headwinds that we experienced. In terms of the Windows headwinds, that impact was about $10 million in Q2 and that was a combination of a significant reduction in workforce that we did in our business in the UK and some warranty expense that we accrued in our Milgard business here in the United States, and we think there will be about $5 million of impact in those areas in Q3. So when you aggregate that, that comes to about $0.04.","And then in terms of FX, we're experiencing about $70 million in revenue less favorability than we originally thought we would, and that affects operating profit. So, that accrues to about $0.03. So there's $0.07 right there, but that's the principal difference in terms of what we thought at the beginning of the year and the way we're seeing the year unfold.","Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Got it. And then on price\/cost, does that tell us that price\/cost has gone as expected as you kind of anticipated it earlier this year?","John G. Sznewajs - Masco Corp.","Yeah, I'd say it's about as expected. And we always said from the very beginning that it would be a back half kind of a story for this year on price\/cost, and that's how it's playing out, Nishu. So I think both Keith and I mentioned in our prepared remarks we expect to be price\/cost neutral in the second half of the year.","Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Got it. And then on Decorative Architectural, the mid-single-digits growth in DIY kind of tells us that you're still seeing a positive volume growth there. It would seem to be better than the category growth, so obviously a good performance there. You've had that trend in place now for some time. What are the underlying drivers of that? How long can you continue to outperform the DIY category kind of looking ahead?","Keith J. Allman - Masco Corp.","Well, we're certainly expecting that mid-single-digit growth through the year and we're very pleased with the traction we're getting. And it is certainly a partnership with The Home Depot, as I mentioned, to convert traffic in the store to customers. In terms of what's driving that, we have, let's call it, 2,000 points of distribution that's just outstanding and very well managed with The Home Depot. We've got great levels of service. We have a truck going to a distribution center for Home Depot every week and this is the concept of focus in 80\/20 on steroids here where we are completely focused on The Home Depot and their customers. So, that efficiency and that level of focus, be it in service levels, in the quality and of course in the brand \u2013 leading DIY brand and that is a significant generator of foot traffic and sales. So it's a combination of service, product, quality, brand, outstanding distribution, and an understanding of what the consumer wants and how to make that conversion and taking care of them. So it's definitely a partnership with The Home Depot and Behr, and we expect continued growth.","Operator","As a reminder, please limit yourself to asking one question and one follow-up question during the Q&A session. Your next question is from Mike Dahl with RBC Capital Markets.","Michael Dahl - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions.","Keith J. Allman - Masco Corp.","Good morning.","Michael Dahl - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Morning. First question on Decorative, just breaking down the margin performance both in the quarter and then thinking about the guide and some of those comments around price\/cost, it actually \u2013 it looks to me as if ex Kichler, the legacy business was probably roughly flat in the quarter and just given the guide toward the upper end of that 16.5% to 18.5% range would suggest that potentially flat to even up for the full year on the legacy business. Am I thinking about that the right way or is there something in the Kichler margins that has gone better than expected? Just a little more color on just the difference between those two margin components there would be great.","John G. Sznewajs - Masco Corp.","Yeah, Mike, I think you had some good insights there. One, Kichler's annual margins as we disclosed when we bought the company are in that (40:19) a low-double-digit range and lower obviously than we have been experiencing \u2013 the high teens we've been experiencing in that segment. That said, I would say that Kichler is probably doing a little bit better from a margin perspective than we originally had anticipated, but not materially different. So, that helps the margin in the segment just a touch. And with the inflation that we've experienced in paint raw materials and some of the actions we've taken, don't forget that the way that it works for us particularly with paint is we recover price with paint. We recover the commodity cost inflation on that paint. So actually, what that does is tends to contract margins a little bit. So, that has a piece of it. So we do expect kind of modest margin contraction for the full year.","Michael Dahl - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Got it. That's helpful. My second question just around Plumbing, you're in the midst of the ERP. Could you just give us an update? It seems like guidance items didn't really change as far as the cost, top line looked decent. So it doesn't seem to be that disruptive. But just give us an update on kind of the ERP conversion there and whether there have been any puts and takes around that.","Keith J. Allman - Masco Corp.","Yeah, Mike, I would characterize it as being a little bit further along than as you said in the midst of it. We went live in May. We have obviously been through a couple of closes. We have manufacturing turned on. This was a significant order-to-cash type of system launch. So it was a very significant system that we implemented that involved hundreds of people of that organization and a multitude of change management initiatives and training, et cetera, as we not only implemented the ERP system, but it was a new ERP system. It wasn't a new version of an existing system. So it was a significant endeavor and I think, Mike, you're pointing to a good point, that while it was costly and it was a significant investment, it was very well executed and we're happy with that. We certainly have some efficiencies that we need to continue to drive and we have some business intelligence tools we have yet to turn on. But when you look at the magnitude of this and the success of it, it's been a real big plus. And we also had an upgrade \u2013 a significant upgrade to our SAP system at Hansgrohe that we executed in the quarter as well and that went very well. So this is something we put a focus on and doing a better job at, and I am pleased with our performance, particularly at Delta.","Michael Dahl - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. Thanks, Keith.","Operator","Your next question is from John Lovallo with Bank of America.","John Lovallo - Bank of America","Hey, guys. Thank you for getting me in here. First question is, I just want to make sure I understand this, the comment about being \u2013 price being flush with raw mats in the second half. Is that the case in the third quarter as well or is there just more catch-up in the fourth quarter that's kind of leveling it off for the second half?","John G. Sznewajs - Masco Corp.","John, it's roughly similar quarter to quarter. So not a lot of difference between Q3 and Q4.","John Lovallo - Bank of America","Okay, that's helpful. And then I think last quarter you had mentioned that freight and logistics cost had not really increased that much given your use of standard distribution runs. Did you see any uptick in that in the second quarter?","John G. Sznewajs - Masco Corp.","Yeah, John, we actually have seen a little bit of an uptick in that particularly for more customized products like our Windows products as well as our Cabinetry products where we don't have as standard of runs, let's say, as we may have with Behr paints or with Delta faucets going to some of our common customers. So, yeah, indeed, we have seen a little bit of inflation, but we think we're in a position to work to offset some of that either through price or some of our own internal efficiencies.","John Lovallo - Bank of America","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Your next question is from Phil Ng with Jefferies.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC","Hey, guys. Curious to get your thoughts on the commercial integration of Kichler and how that's ramping up as you leverage some of your distribution.","Keith J. Allman - Masco Corp.","It's going very well. We're on plan. It's been over 100 days. We have executed integration along a number of fronts in terms of treasury, risk management, legal. We are working with the team at Kichler to implement the Masco Operating System. We're going in and grabbing efficiencies as quickly as we can, particularly in areas of logistics and freight consolidation in China with our existing China infrastructure and we've got work to do yet. We have common customers that we think are going to be able to be leveraged to add further value. So, in summary, I'd say that we're on plan for sure. We're on plan with our investment thesis. The cultures are meshing very well. We're getting early wins and we are planning for more longer term wins.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC","Got it, and then Keith, you kind of touched upon it in your prepared remarks on the tariffs \u2013 potential tariffs I guess in China. Curious what type of impact you kind of envision in your supply chain and how you're going to manage it respectively, and particularly interested on the Kichler side of things since it's a newer business and you do buy a lot of components from Asia. Thanks.","Keith J. Allman - Masco Corp.","I'll state the obvious, but there's a lot of moving parts here and it remains to be seen where it all shakes out, if at all, and to what degree and how it's enacted and the timing and everything else, but it varies as you might expect across our segments. So, in paint, which is a large segment for us, that would have really no impact. Windows has a little bit of impact with some imported hardware, have some impact in Cabinetry with regards to imported plywood and then Plumbing and our decorative hardware and lighting would have the largest impact.","In terms of how we handle that, we look at a couple things. Number one, what can we do effectively and quickly with regards to the supply chain to mitigate some of these costs. And then number two, we look at our competitive position. And by and large, we believe that we are on equal or better footing when you look at our competition across our product categories considering what we do in terms of domestic manufacturing in Plumbing and Cabinetry, and then in lighting, really that is a industry-wide value chain as it relates to procuring from China. So in that regard, price is obviously something when you look at our channel service and the strength of our brands, that we would initiate it if needed. But I would reiterate there's a lot of moving parts and we're going to watch and see where this all shakes out. But we feel comfortable in both our competitive position and our ability to stay whole as it relates to cost-outs and price.","Operator","Your next question is from Keith Hughes with SunTrust.","Keith Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thank you. Questions \u2013 or a quick question back in Plumbing, specifically U.S. Plumbing. You had kind of called out generally it sounds like all the channels were good in this period. Just diving the details a little bit more, I know in the past, wholesale has been a big win for you, I think the sector as a whole. Did that trend kind of continue in the second quarter with that being the leader of growth?","Keith J. Allman - Masco Corp.","Yes, it did. Very strong in wholesale and it's been strong for quite a while.","John G. Sznewajs - Masco Corp.","Yeah...","Keith Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Why has that been so \u2013 go ahead.","John G. Sznewajs - Masco Corp.","I'd say \u2013 just reminding you that even though we posted pretty good numbers, that was impacted by the ERP, so that $10 million that was pulled out of Q2 into Q1, don't forget that as well.","Keith Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","And does that affect the wholesale numbers or is that a retail? Where does that kind of fall?","John G. Sznewajs - Masco Corp.","I think that was fairly broad based across all of our customers.","Keith Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay, and final question on this. Why has wholesale been so good over these periods you discussed, Keith?","Keith J. Allman - Masco Corp.","I think a lot of it speaks to the work we did on the assortment. So we went in and worked on the opening price point with some targeted launches. We've done a significant amount of work in the showroom aspect of wholesale. So we've had some nice work that we've done on what we call the back end or the counter business and we have also done more on the assisted sale on the front end, and then a lot of our work goes to influencer outreach and marketing programs where you may recall we spent a year or so back some significant capital to build an extension and create a customer experience center, where by design, we bring in our showroom customers to show them the Brizo and the Delta and the product offerings that we have and to work on that customer outreach, and that really creates advocacy. And then you overlay that with our investment that we've made in displays across the showroom continuum where we have not only juiced up the displays in terms of LED lighting and showcasing the product more effectively, we also gained three incremental feet. So it's a combination of all those things around that area of what I would call commercial excellence that is driving the good growth for us.","Keith Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from Stephen East with Wells Fargo.","Stephen East - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you and good morning, guys. Congratulations in a pretty tough environment that we're seeing. Keith, in early May, you talked about being flush with price\/cost by the end of the second quarter and you all still feel that way. Could you talk about a few things? One, could you \u2013 the assumptions that you have for your various major raw materials as you look through the back half of the year, and it sounds like in paint, you might not be flush in the second half, offset it with being better than flush in some of your other businesses. Is that the right way to think about that? And then finally, on the raw materials, sort of the lag time from when you get a cost announcement to when that actually is typically flowing through your income statement?","Keith J. Allman - Masco Corp.","Probably the best way to break your question down, Stephen, is to think in terms of some of our different segments. So if you look at Plumbing, big driver there is copper and zinc. And if you look at, say, June as a point of view from June 2018 to June 2017, you've seen about a 12% increase from about $2.70 up to $3 for copper. Now, while that has dipped down a little bit more of late, that's been a significant cost driver. And then zinc, again over the last year, has gone from about $1.25 to $1.35. So, that's about a 7% increase, and again we've seen that dip a little bit in the last month, but those are still healthy increases. So, that's the driver in the Plumbing segment.","When you look at our coatings business, it's really about resin and TiO2, and we've seen TiO2 go up kind of the same as copper, about 12%, if you look at it from June of 2018 to June of 2017. And then in resins, we've seen it go up to almost $0.85 a pound now. So, that's a significant increase. And what we're seeing is probably going to be a little bit more pressure in resins as we look to the back half. So, that's the primary driver in coatings. And then we use hardwood \u2013 obviously hardwood lumber and plywood, and again that's gone up coincidentally right about in that 12% range. So, pretty broad-based commodities pressure that we've experienced and that's the way we've attacked it with both cost and price, as we mentioned, getting price across all four segments.","Stephen East - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Got you. All right. And then as you look at your lag time, how long from when you get that announcement that it flows through? And then the other question I just had is your capital allocation, you've already bumped it up through 2019 to $1.7 billion. I'm wondering how far into it you are with that and any thoughts or indications whether you bump that any further?","Keith J. Allman - Masco Corp.","In terms of the lead time on the price \u2013 and John, I'll let you take the capital allocation question \u2013 it really varies by segment, and a lot of it depends on the inventory. So you could imagine, I'm sure, with a China supply chain where we may be FOB the ship at the port that we would have a longer time before we could actually get price into our P&L, and in some cases, it's more cyclical as it relates to price books and when the price books come out. And then in more direct business that's off sheet, we could get that right away. So it's a variable \u2013 it varies. It could be one to two quarters depending on the commodity and the supply chain that we're talking about.","John, do you want to touch on capital?","John G. Sznewajs - Masco Corp.","Yeah, sure. Stephen, in terms of capital allocation, you're right. As we outlined at our Investor Day last year, we had a pretty healthy $1.7 billion that we updated after tax reform. And I think one of the things that we've gotten more comfortable with over the course of the last couple of quarters is perhaps operating with lower levels of cash on the balance sheet. And so, could there be more capital than the $1.7 billion that we indicated in May of last year deployed through that three-year window? Yeah, I think there's a possibility that that does exist. How much more? It's tough to say. I mean we'll have to see what plays out for us both in terms of where does the share price go as well as where do acquisition candidates emerge. And so, that's something still out in the future a little bit.","Operator","And our last question comes from Justin Speer with Zelman Associates.","Justin Andrew Speer - Zelman Partners LLC","Good morning. Thank you, guys.","Keith J. Allman - Masco Corp.","Good morning, Justin.","Justin Andrew Speer - Zelman Partners LLC","I'd like to ask a quick question on the Windows business. Just some color on the size of those pieces that you mentioned. What's one-time, what's ongoing, and particularly as you look to 2019 or maybe the intermediate term what the right margin is for this business?","Keith J. Allman - Masco Corp.","We had about a $10 million headwind in this quarter. We think it will be about $5 million next quarter as we work through some of those inefficiencies we talked about over in the UK in particular. In terms of long term, for the year, we're looking at 3% to 5% growth in the top line.","Justin Andrew Speer - Zelman Partners LLC","Well, I'm thinking more like on those pieces that you mentioned, you mentioned a warranty piece, then you mentioned UK workforce. I was just curious how those pieces \u2013 as we think to next year in particular, what repeats and what doesn't, and what the right \u2013 with these restructuring moves, what the right margin structure is for that piece of the business.","John G. Sznewajs - Masco Corp.","Yeah, sure. Justin, so like you might expect, the UK piece is kind of one-time in nature as we work through some of the restructuring activities and that should not be recurring. In terms of the warranty piece, that's one of those things that we evaluate our warranty from time to time, and you have to make adjustments to all your judgment-based accounts whether it's warranty or whether it's accounts receivable or whether it's inventory, whatever, so from time to time into it. The principal reason that drove this quarter's adjustment was some of the inflation that we are experiencing with respect to some of the warranty costs that were coming in. Longer term, I guess to the nature, the heart of your question, in terms of where do we expect margins to be, at this point, it really doesn't change our view that long term and again long term is not next quarter or the first quarter of next year, but long term the margins for this quarter should be in that low-double digit to low-teens, that 10% to 13% range that we called out at our Investor Day in May of last year.","Justin Andrew Speer - Zelman Partners LLC","And then lastly for me just a follow-up question on cabinets. How much benefit from Menards in the quarter and then did you provide a back half organic growth figure for the Plumbing business in your guidance?","John G. Sznewajs - Masco Corp.","No, I don't think we provided a back half. I think all we said is for a full year of 5% to 7% excluding the divestiture of Moores.","Justin Andrew Speer - Zelman Partners LLC","Okay. And then on the cabinets piece, just thinking about the Menards contribution in the quarter, obviously that helped, but we don't know how much. Do you have any context there for us?","John G. Sznewajs - Masco Corp.","We haven't disclosed that to this point. Yeah, we don't intend to disclose it at this time.","Justin Andrew Speer - Zelman Partners LLC","Thank you, guys. Really appreciate it.","Operator","And this does conclude today's conference. You may now disconnect."],"13828":["Masco Corp.

As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded for replay purposes.","I will now turn the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Irene Tasi. Irene, you may begin.","Irene Tasi - Director-Investor Relations","Thank you, Carol, and good morning to everyone. Welcome to Masco Corporation's 2015 third quarter conference call. Joining me today are Keith Allman, President and CEO of Masco; and John Sznewajs, Masco's Vice President, Treasurer and Chief Financial Officer. Our third quarter earnings release and the presentation slides that we will refer to during the call are available on the Investor Relations portion of our website. Following our prepared remarks, the call will be opened for analyst questions.","As a reminder, we would appreciate it if you would limit yourself to one question with one follow-up. If we are unable to take your questions during the call, please feel free to contact me directly at 313-792-5500.","Statements in today's presentation will include our views about Masco's future performance, which constitute forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. We have described these risks and uncertainties in our Risk Factors and other disclosures in our Form 10-K and our Form 10-Q that we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","I'd like to remind you that the results we will review today exclude our Installation Services segment reflecting our spin-off of TopBuild Corp, the business comprising that segment, on June 30.

Allman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Irene, and good morning, everyone.","Turning to slide 4. With three quarters behind us, I'm pleased with our financial and operational performance in 2015. Our brands continue to drive underlying top-line growth, and we are executing well against an improving macro environment.","Our focus on execution resulted in outstanding margin expansion and further positioned our businesses for growth in 2016. Excluding the impact of currency, which cost us $66 million in the quarter, our top line increased 4%. Notably, our operating margin increased 190 basis points to 14%, the best third quarter margin that we have had since 2007. This reflects our continued strong operating leverage as well as our discipline around cost control.","Compared to the third quarter of last year, we achieved 26% growth in earnings per share to $0.34 per common share.","I'd like to now provide you with some additional insight into the drivers behind each of our segment's performance.","Let's begin with Cabinetry. This business once again exceeded our expectations and continues to write an impressive turnaround story. KraftMaid reaffirmed its leadership position and grew in both the retail and dealer channels. KraftMaid led category sales at big box retailers and had top-line growth of 9% at dealers as consumers moved up the price continuum with KraftMaid Vantage. Offsetting this top-line growth was our deliberate exit of low-margin builder business. This is an important element of the turnaround plan and lays a stronger foundation for the business to profitably grow in 2016.","Given Cabinetry's performance against their turnaround plan, we now expect this segment will achieve operating profit of approximately $40 million in 2015. I'm proud of our accomplishments in this business and the important momentum we have established for Cabinetry going into 2016.","Our portfolio of plumbing businesses continued their strong execution and grew sales in North America by 8% when you exclude the impact of Canadian currency, and grew internationally by 4% in local currency. Sales were particularly strong in the trade channel as our high-end Brizo and Hansgrohe product line continue to resonate with consumers seeking to trade up to higher price points.","On the retail side, our industry-leading innovations such as Touch2O Technology and in2ition with H2Okinetic Technology continue to drive foot traffic to our channel partners and further solidify Delta's number one share of shelf position at retail.","In addition to our strong financial results, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency recognized our Delta Faucet Company as a 2015 WaterSense Sustained Excellence Award Winner. This award is the highest partner recognition that the EPA grants and demonstrates Delta's commitment to protecting the environment and to introducing relevant and valuable innovation.","In our Paint business, despite softness in overall architectural coating demand, Behr's MARQUEE and PRO product lines drove low to mid-single-digit gallon growth in the quarter. This growth was masked by a combination of higher promotional spend, as we discussed on last quarter's call, and the impact of currency on Canadian sales.","Together with the Home Depot, we plan to grow our leadership position in the architectural coatings market by leveraging Behr's industry-leading customer satisfaction as ranked by J.D. Powers, as well as our industry-leading quality as ranked by Consumer Reports for both interior and exterior paints as well as exterior stains.","Additionally, in the Decorative Architectural segment, Liberty Hardware was awarded the Home Depot's 2015 Marketing Innovation of the Year Award, recognizing Liberty's leadership in developing effective and creative social media campaigns.","In our Other Specialty Products segment, Milgard Windows, the leading window brand in the Western United States, had another great quarter. Milgard had low-double-digit sales growth as they drove growth across all channels and consistently executed against the dynamic economic environment. The low-double-digit growth of their innovative new products including the Essence window and door line and Moving Glass Wall systems contributed to Milgard's market share gains and improved mix in the quarter.","From a capital allocation perspective, we accelerated our share repurchase activity in the quarter and bought back approximately 7.6 million shares. In the last 12 months, we have repurchased over 20 million shares returning $0.5 billion to shareholders, and thus delivering on our commitment to drive shareholder value.","Now, I would like to turn the call over to John who will go over our operational and financial performance in detail. John?","John G. Sznewajs - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & VP","Thank you, Keith, and good morning, everyone. As Irene mentioned, most of my comments will focus on adjusted performance excluding the impacts of rationalization and other one-time charges. We continued our favorable momentum coming out of the second quarter and drove strong profitability across all segments.","I'm pleased to report the third quarter was our 16th consecutive quarter of year-over-year sales and profit growth.","Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, sales increased 4%. Foreign currency translation negatively impacted our sales in the third quarter by approximately $66 million, principally due to a weaker euro compared to the U.S. dollar.","North American sales were up 3% for the quarter. We experienced growing demand for our repair and remodeling products including our small ticket paint, plumbing, and builders' hardware products as well as our big ticket kitchen and window products. As a reminder, repair \/ remodel activity now represents approximately 82% of our total sales.","International sales increased 4% in local currency in the quarter driven by the continued strength of our International plumbing and window businesses. And our discipline around cost control continues to payoff contributed to our strong bottom line performance as operating income increased 16% in the quarter to $257 million, with operating margins expanding 190 basis points to 14%. The effect of currency negatively impacted operating income by approximately $10 million in the quarter. And our EPS was $0.34, an improvement of $0.07 or 26% compared to the third quarter of last year.","Please turn to slide 7.","The strength of the U.S. dollar once again masked the continued strong performance in our Plumbing segment. Excluding the $57 million impact of foreign currency translation, sales increased 6% driven by growth in faucets, spas, and new program wins in rough plumbing.","Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation related to the Canadian dollar, our North American sales grew 8% as we experienced strong growth in both the trade and retail channels in the quarter. Our Delta Focus product line and our Brizo brand continue to drive consumer demand for our innovative new products in the showrooms. The growth at Watkins, our leading spa business was primarily due to the strength of our Caldera and HotSprings brand, as well as our acquisition of Endless Pools. And new program wins in the rough plumbing aisle and retail drove increased sales at BrassCraft.","Our European businesses continue to outperform, delivering 4% growth in local currency. Hansgrohe was driven by the growth in the trade channel, as well as the strength of its brand, design and innovation. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation and the unfavorable impact of our commodity hedge, operating profit increased 9% in the quarter.","Please turn to slide 8. In the Decorative Architectural segment, the continued growth of Behr Pro and our Behr MARQUEE interior products resulted in low to mid-single digit gallon growth in the third quarter. Sales increased 1% in the quarter due to the timing and amount of incremental promotional expense, and the $3 million impact of Canadian dollar currency translation.","We see opportunities to grow this business by investing behind it in the four key areas. Number one, promotions; number two, program resets where we invest in merchandising to support our new business wins and increase consumer awareness of our products; number three, advertising, which strengthens our brands and drives foot traffic to our channel partners; number four, the Behr Pro business where we partner with the Home Depot to realize our mutual goal of gallon growth.","As we foreshadowed on our last earnings call, this incremental investment impacts this segment's third quarter results by approximately $25 million.","Please turn to slide 9. In the Cabinets segment, we experienced strong retail sales. Additionally, our dealer exclusive KraftMaid Vantage program continues its strong performance in the dealer channel, enjoying both volume and favorable mix. As a result, KraftMaid's dealer sales grew 9% in the quarter. This favorability was more than offset by the deliberate exit of low-margin builder business, as total sales in the segment decreased 5% in the quarter.","Segment profitability in the third quarter improved $26 million over the prior year. This was driven by continued growth of our higher price point semi-custom KraftMaid offering, the reduction of last year's incremental spend on ERP inefficiencies and the benefits associated with other cost savings initiatives.","As Keith mentioned earlier, the cabinet team is focused on driving their turnaround plan in 2015 as they continue to introduce new products at retail and dealers and improve the execution in our Merillat business. We now believe we will deliver operating profit of approximately $40 million in 2015.","Please turn to slide 10. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, our Other Specialty Products segment sales increased 11%, driven by low-double-digit sales growth in our North American window business. This growth was driven by volume increases, the continued benefit of favorable mix shift towards our premium window and door product lines.","Excluding the negative impact of a stronger U.S. dollar, our European window sales increased 9% due to market share gains and the successful acquisition we announced in the second quarter of Evolution Manufacturing, a leading full-service window solutions provider in the UK. This segment's operating profit growth of 15% in the quarter is principally attributable to increased volume.","Turning to slide 11. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.5 billion of balance sheet liquidity. We delivered another strong quarter of working capital performance, as working capital as a percent of sales improved 50 basis points versus the prior year to 13.1%.","We continue to take initiatives to unlock shareholder value. As Keith mentioned earlier, during the third quarter, we repurchased 7.6 million shares, or approximately 2% of our common stock. And we remained well positioned to retire $300 million to $500 million of debt next year.","So, with that, I'll turn the call back over to Keith.","Keith J. Allman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, John. Our strategies is to drive shareholder value are working. Our results year-to-date reflect the strength of our powerful brands and the focus on operational excellence. We continue to invest behind our brands, grow our innovation pipelines, position our businesses for greater growth in 2016.","We expect that repair and remodel demand will continue to grow at a steady pace, while new home construction will accelerate the fourth quarter. We remain confident in our ability to navigate this dynamic macroeconomic environment and execute against the things that we can control: our brands, our innovation and our operational excellence.","With that, I'd like to now open the call up for questions, and back to you, Carol.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. In order to ensure that everyone has a chance to participate, we would like to request that you limit yourself to asking one question and one follow-up question during the Q&A session.","Our first question comes from the line of Dennis McGill from Zelman & Associates. Your line is open.","Dennis P. McGill - Zelman & Associates","Hey. Good morning. Thank you, guys. John, I was just hoping you could maybe talk to the cadence a little bit of the promotional spend within Decorative Architectural as we think about the fourth quarter knowing there's some volatility there throughout the year, and how we should maybe think about that and balancing that against the raw material environment as well?","John G. Sznewajs - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & VP","Sure, Dennis. As we talked about in the second quarter call, you may recall the fact that this year was an unusual year for us because typically, the 4th of July promotion that we run in the Decorative Architectural segment spans both the end of the second quarter and the beginning of the third quarter. And just the way that the timing fell this year, we experienced all that promotional expense in the third quarter this year. So, there's a little bit of a benefit to the second quarter due to the lack of that promotional spend. And now it penalizes the third quarter because of the timing of that.","As we go forward into the fourth quarter, we don't expect a significant incremental promotional expense, largely because we incur promotional expense around four major holidays through the course of the year. One is the spring Black Friday event, the second is Memorial Day, the third is 4th of July, and the fourth is Labor Day. So, that's where we're promoting our products. (18:24) fourth quarter should be relatively muted.","The second part of your question relates to the commodities that we're facing, and clearly, we've seen modest commodity price deflation in the quarter. But that said, we took some of the benefit of that and reinvested in promotions in our Behr Pro business during the quarter. So, we feel really good. While we're seeing some benefits, we're reinvesting back in the business to grow the gallons that both we and our partner, our channel partner Home Depot, desire.","Dennis P. McGill - Zelman & Associates","Okay. That's helpful, John. And then \u2013 and I guess kind of a similar question on the Plumbing side. Taking a hit on the hedge in this quarter would suggest that you've got some benefits coming in the forward quarters. Can you maybe just review how you're thinking about the price versus commodity relationship there?","John G. Sznewajs - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & VP","Yeah. As you know, both copper and zinc have come down pretty significantly during the course of the year. And up until the third quarter, the impact of the hedge on a quarterly basis \u2013 and just to maybe recalibrate everyone, we have to mark to market our hedge positions on a quarterly basis because we do not get a hedge accounting. And so, to your point, as we go forward, because we mark to market, if there's no further movement in the price of copper or zinc, there should be relatively little impact to our financial statements in any future periods.","Dennis P. McGill - Zelman & Associates","Okay. Thank you, guys.","John G. Sznewajs - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & VP","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Keith Hughes from SunTrust. Your line is open.","Keith Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thank you. Just there's been a lot of fears in this sector of slowdown in the other parts of economy affecting the kind of businesses you're in and your peer companies. Can you give us any sort of feel on your overall pace of business through September and October? Have you seen any kind of rate change, positive or negative, to the orders coming in?","Keith J. Allman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","It really has been pretty steady for us. This is Keith. Good morning. Our R&R demand has been chugging along right at about 4% to 5% in terms of the overall market demand, and we're seeing that consistent across the regions of the country. As you'll recall, we have about 82% of our demand driven by repair and remodeling. So, it's nice and steady for us. I think as home prices appreciate and consumer confidence continues to be strong, and you overlay that with deferred investments that we've seen in R&R over the past couple of years, it's shaping up nicely for us.","So, it's been steady. And when you compare that to how our more R&R-driven business have performed with our plumbing business in North America up 8%, Milgard Window up double digits, KraftMaid (21:08) dealer which is heavy R&R up 9%, and even our paint while the market was a little soft in the quarter with low double digit, low to mid-double-digit gallon growth in the quarter.","John G. Sznewajs - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & VP","Low- to mid-single digit.","Keith J. Allman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Excuse me. Sorry about that. We feel good about how \u2013 not only the market to your question but also how we're performing against that market.","Keith Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","And to go back to the Decorative Architectural division; number one, what role does Liberty Hardware play in the numbers there? Positive or negative? And then on the margins, which were just outstanding, given you had promotional spend, if you kind of list off 1, 2, 3, what helped you out on the margin in that division and (21:52).","Keith J. Allman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Go ahead, John.","John G. Sznewajs - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & VP","On the Liberty side, Liberty did have a small impact on the top line, Keith, as we had begun the rollout of a shower door program that we won at one of the major retailers in the third quarter. It's not that completely reset, but they did have an impact on the top line. And so, they did benefit from that.","In terms of the second half of your question, which is what benefited the bottom line, I think there's a couple of things that benefits the bottom line, but a couple of things that detracted from the bottom line. Obviously, the increased volume that we experienced in the quarter was a help. We did have a favorable price commodity relationship in the quarter. But offsetting some of that was some of the investments that we made that we discussed, both on my prepared remarks and in the prior question.","As we move forward, we feel good about the profitability. And we do think that given the DAP segment that long run you should think about this business as about an 18% margin business.","Keith Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from James Armstrong, Vertical Research Partners. Your line is open.","James H. Armstrong - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. My first one is on the Cabinet segment. How much did lower lumber and plywood prices during the quarter help margins? And what are you seeing in the overall pricing environment in Cabinets?","John G. Sznewajs - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & VP","I'll handle the commodity half, I'll let Keith talk about the pricing side. We saw very little impact from lumber or hardwood kind of pretty much offsetting each other in the quarter. We saw a little bit of deflation on one end and a little bit of inflation on the other, but pretty much a muted effect of commodities. So, not much of a tailwind to the bottom line. A lot of that bottom line improvement was purely operationally driven.","Keith J. Allman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I'd think about pricing overall in the market as stable. Some time ago at the end of Q4 of last year, we tweaked our promotional strategy a little bit, and brought it up to what we believe is on par with the market. That's working well for us. We're seeing good growth as we've mentioned, particularly in the retail space. So, overall, I classify the pricing environment in cabs as pretty stable?","James H. Armstrong - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Perfect. And then in the paint segment, could you talk a bit about the PRO customer? And are you continuing to gain share there, or are you seeing a stabilization?","Keith J. Allman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","We're gaining share in the PRO. I feel really good about that. That's an initiative that we've aligned very closely with the Home Depot and have a series of work streams that we're driving that really span the whole continuum of product, of how we're promoting it, the training we're doing, and our approach to how we're penetrating markets. So, it's important to us, and we're definitely outgrowing the market in the PRO and intend to continue to do that.","James H. Armstrong - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Perfect. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from Stephen Kim from Barclays Capital. Your line is open.","Stephen S. Kim - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks very much, guys. I just wanted to ask \u2013 I guess I'll start of by asking a question about the Cabinets business. You talked about exiting the builder business. Can you remind us when you first \u2013 when you start anniversarying that exit? And how much of the profit improvement that we saw in the quarter would you say was related to exiting that business, let's say, if it was generating losses?","Keith J. Allman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Stephen, the exit of the lower-margin builder business was really an initiative that Joe Gross kicked off when we put him in it \u2013 as CEO of the business earlier this year. And so, relatively muted impact \u2013 less of an impact than in Q2 when he really first came on board. More of an impact obviously here in Q3. So, I would say that we're really in the first quarter of experiencing that \u2013 the exit of the lower-margin builder business.","And remind me the second part of that question.","Stephen S. Kim - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Oh, it's just that \u2013 is that a business that you were losing money in? I mean, so as we think about exiting that business, are we seeing improvement in profitability in actual profit dollars from exiting that business?","Keith J. Allman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","It clearly wasn't as profitable as our base business in Cabinetry. So as we exit that business, Stephen, it's most definitely improving our profitability and the performance of the business. And that's really something that, as Joe and I looked at this business, made the call to really get this business better before we get it bigger. And that's working for us, and we're positioning the business now for further growth as we move into 2016.","Stephen S. Kim - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. I guess my second question, shifting gears to the Plumbing business. As we look at the FX impact, it looked like if you just sort of took the profit impact divided by the sales impact, it would imply a margin of about 12%. Last quarter was like 19%. I imagine there's probably some adjustments there which complicate that simple calculation. But if you could help us sort of think through that? Was there anything unusual in that figure? We usually think of Hansgrohe as a very profitable business, for example. So, if you could just help us out there?","John G. Sznewajs - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & VP","Excuse me, perhaps I'm not following. You're comparing Q2's international sales to our international profitability \u2013 to our Q3's international profitability; is that...?","Stephen S. Kim - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Well, I guess what I'm saying is that if we just look at \u2013 you mentioned that the \u2013 I'm just looking here at your slide, the impact from FX was $7 million on the profit line and impacted sales by $57 million. So that's about a 12%. If you just did a ratio, that's a 12% margin point.","John G. Sznewajs - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & VP","Oh, I see what you mean. Yeah, I'm sorry, I misunderstood the question. Yeah, so what happened there, Stephen, you'll recall that we've got some other businesses in the Plumbing segment in Europe that aren't as profitable as Hansgrohe that do detract from that. And some of that doesn't get all completely impacted because there's some in euros, some in pound as well that didn't move. So, that does impact that calculations slightly.","Stephen S. Kim - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Got it. All right. Thanks very much, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from Stephen East from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","Stephen F. East - Evercore ISI","Thank you. Good morning, guys. Keith, generally people have asked you about what's going on in the market. But if you look at each of your businesses one by one, can you talk about what you think the market's growing for each of those, are you picking up share in them? And are you starting to see any mix shift in each of those categories?","Keith J. Allman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure, Stephen. Let's start with Plumbing. We pegged the overall repair and remodeling market, and that's based to be around 4% to 5% growth, we think. And from a new home construction perspective in the back end, we'll see a little bit of an acceleration to finish out the year at about plus 10%. So, if you average in somewhere around 80% R&R for that segment, you get a good feel for where the growth is.","In terms of our performance there, with our North American sales being up currency adjusted 8%, feel good that we're taking share in that space. And particularly, we're doing well in our showroom products and with the results that we're seeing from our new innovations and parts of the product assortment on a higher end. So, we are seeing a definite favorable mix as the consumer moves up.","In terms of Plumbing in overseas, our European business is going well. We continue to have a strong business in the UK, and we're growing that business in excess of the market. Over in China, clearly we're continuing to grow, and our brand is very well positioned and feel good that that's \u2013 it's one of the, if not, the strongest brands over there in China. So, in terms of Plumbing, right about 4% to 5%, and we're outgrowing it.","Milgard Windows, in that space, we've talked about that growth. That tends to be also more R&R driven. So, right \u2013 again, around that steady North American rate of around 4% to 5%. And as we talked about with double-digit growth there, good, dynamic business, and continued to grow and gain share. The dealer business and the R&R business associated with Cabinetry, again, we think it's up in that same, steady 4% to 5% range in R&R. New construction is a little bit faster than that.","In terms of the mix we're seeing, without a doubt, in the repair and remodeling side we're seeing an uplift in the average ticket in consumers going towards more value-added finishes, and accessories, and that sort of thing, which drives up the ticket. But we're also, by virtue of that fact that new construction is growing at a faster clip that will tend to be a little bit of a damper on the mix. But by and large, good mix there.","Paint, as we talked about it, overall, the market, we're seeing as somewhat flat, call it. And so, with our low to mid-single-digit growth rate there, we feel good about outpacing that market. So, overall, feel good about the underlying demand both in terms of repair and remodeling and new construction. And I'm proud of how our businesses have structured their work to outpace that growth.","Stephen F. East - Evercore ISI","Okay. That's great. Thank you. I appreciate it. And then if I can combine two little questions. On Cabinets, your business, your builder business had been, I think, about 45% of your business. Where do you see that going over the next year or two? And then on Paint, one of your competitors said in the quarter they saw the home centers have slower demand, and consequently, the home centers also pulled back on ordering late in the quarter to control inventory. Did you all see any of that?","Keith J. Allman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","In terms of your first question, Stephen, on the builder side of our Cabinet business, I think it's important to delineate between more of the smaller regional builders, and then the bigger, call it, top 10, top 20 builders. That top 10, top 20 builder business is leaner for us, and we're being very selective and careful about how we drive that business with an eye on profitability.","When we look at the bigger chunk of the business, which is more the smaller and the regional business, we think that can be attractive business. The key is having consistent delivery lead times and fill rates. And that's something that we've worked very hard to get back, and now we're working to get the confidence of that customer base back. And we will go after that. So, it's a mixed bag. But certainly, there's business that we want and we're focused on, and we understand the segmentation of it. And there is business that isn't so much attractive to us.","In terms of the home center demand in Paint, as I said, we think that the DIY or that section of the paint market is relatively flat, right in that flat range anyway. And with our growth rate, we're happy with how we're performing. With our Color Center that's in place and the promotions that we're doing and the acknowledgment from various third parties about our customer satisfaction and our quality ranking, we feel pretty good about it.","John G. Sznewajs - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & VP","Stephen, just maybe to supplement some of Keith's comments on \u2013 especially on the Paint side. You may recall in the September and October timeframe last year we had some unusual order patterns developed where we had very low orders in September but very, very strong orders in October of last year. And so, we did not see the inventory pull back in the third quarter \u2013 as you might expect, since we're up against the difficult comp here in the first part of the fourth quarter, we are seeing a little bit of pullback vis-\u00e0-vis our \u2013 compared to last year. So \u2013 but overall, I think as we get through the kind of the six-month window, I think we should be in just \u2013 fine shape.","Stephen S. Kim - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Just some monthly timing issues. Yeah?","Keith J. Allman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Next question, please?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of George Staphos from Bank of America. Your line is open.","George L. Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Everyone, good morning. Thanks for taking my question and all the details on the call. Congratulations on the quarter. Two questions, one on Cabinets, and then one back to Decorative Arch and Paint. In Cabinets, you mentioned that performance was better than expected. Could you talk a little bit about where the sources of the positive variance were in terms of operation it sounded like relative to your budget or forecast, and why you think that should be sustainable going forward?","And back to Paint, certainly your outgrowing the category. You had what would appear to be very good margins. You enumerated four areas where you can sort of drive growth through promotions, resets, advertising, and the PRO line. Do you anticipate having to \u2013 maybe not this quarter but next year, given the margins you have in the business, having to reinvest in any one of those areas disproportionately to keep the growth higher than the market and the margins that you've got longer term? Thank you, guys.","Keith J. Allman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","On Cabinets, as we've talked about in the past, George, turnarounds are never any one-shot deal to get it done and they are seldom linear. There's ups and downs to them, and we've seen that. It's a balance between short and long-term initiatives, and a balance between cost out and revenue-up initiatives. So it really wasn't one particular initiative that we drove that got us to this position. We certainly have worked on our costs and our efficiency and our material yields and scrap rates, and have worked very hard to overcome the misstep, frankly, that we had in 2014 with our ERP. So, that was a significant part of it.","We have invested in innovation. We have what we believe to be the best finishing system in our KraftMaid line that we recently put in in the last year, and we're getting a lot of good response from that. We've increased on the innovation front with some creative assortment work, particularly with KraftMaid Vantage. And we are segmenting our markets, and we're driving hard particularly in the dealer channel, which is a very attractive and lucrative channel for us.","So, it's a mixed bag across the board for us, and that's why we think that this type of performance is sustainable. In fact, we're looking to grow as we move into 2016. Obviously, the seasonality around this business remains, but fundamentally, I like how this business has moved and a year ago, if you would have said, Keith, you could have this business in this position at this time, I'd take it. I think...","George L. Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Keith, would it be fair to say that your outlook for 2016, again, there's nothing that is significant in terms of what will drive the year. So, it's not Vantage or the new Merillat. It's again across all these metrics.","Keith J. Allman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think that's fair. We're going across the different channels, and we're working with both our powerful brands, Merillat and KraftMaid. And I think thinking about this business in the 30% to 35% incremental is the right way to think about it.","George L. Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thank you on that. And in Paints?","Keith J. Allman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","In Paint, in terms of where we anticipate reinvesting it's really broadly across all those revenue drivers that John talked about. We've got our Color Center reinvestment behind us, and that's really strong. We're going to continue to drive with promotions and advertising. We're going to look for ways to partner with the Home Depot to drive growth, particularly in the PRO segment in terms of how we train, how we staff stores, the products that we offer, and our supply chain and how we deliver products.","So, it's an exciting and dynamic time for us in paint, and we're happy with how we've outperformed the market.","George L. Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Nishu Sood from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you. First, I wanted to ask about the exit of the builder product lines in Cabinet. Kind of take a longer view, the spin of TopBuild obviously dramatically reduced your exposure to new construction, and you continue to pursue that strategy with the exit of these product lines in Cabinet. As you look across your portfolio, I mean, clearly, that's been the right move from a profitability perspective. Is that something you would continue to explore and maybe assess other parts of your builder business and other parts of your portfolio, continue to become more focused on just the remodeling market?","Keith J. Allman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I'd clarify a little bit Nishu in that we haven't exited builder lines, meaning lines of our cabinets or lines of our product assortment. What we're doing is paying closer attention to a segmentation of the builders we have, particularly in the builder direct part of our business where we handle the last mile delivery, the installation and the punch out.","And what we're seeing in some cases the take-per-home is being reduced with the type of mix that's evolved in certain markets with certain builders. And that's just not an affordable proposition for us to manage all the value-added that we do on the backside with regards to delivery, and installation punch-out. So, it's not an exit of builder line so much as it is a segmentation of various types of builders in certain regions, and then through pricing and through other mechanisms moving away from that business and directing our energy to more profitable business.","In terms of an overall strategy in our other segments, move away from builders, that's not really the case. We have good value propositions and good supply chains to be able to deliver profitably to most of the segmented builders in our other segments. So, that's not a broad strategy for Masco per se.","Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Got it. No. That's helpful. And then since your \u2013 since this has improved operating margin (41:41) Cabinets, any updated thoughts on the longer-term goal of getting to high-single digits in Cabinets with the exit of the \u2013 I'm sorry, with the reshaping of the builder strategy and the products you're providing, would it change your views on what's possible longer term in this business?","John G. Sznewajs - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & VP","Nishu, it's John. No. We don't think it's changing our view longer term. Obviously, we were pleased that we reported 7.5% margins in the segments. So we feel we're well on our way to that high-single digit margin performance that we're seeking. There's a potential for some upside (42:16). It's too early to call. We've had two good quarters so far in this cabinet in a long period of time and we don't want to get ahead of ourselves as to where we think this business can go just yet. So, we need to continue to execute our plan and turn it around, and then we'll talk in future periods about maybe if there's upside to what we've laid out for you.","Keith J. Allman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","You know, we've got \u2013 we've had good success in the cost outs, or we're starting to get traction on the growth side. We're deep into our planning process now and we're continuing, as we look at these plans, to drive both cost and revenue, and we'll continue to update you as we flesh those plans out more.","Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bob Wetenhall from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey. Good morning. Very nice quarter. I wanted to ask you, last year you guys had a loss of $60 million in the Cabinets, and based on John's guidance, it sounds like you're on track to do $40 million, and a $100 million swing is a big improvement. Just help us think about, in terms of framing, are you through the hard work? Is the ERP system really the big challenge, and now incremental gains are just going to be leveraged to the market recovery, or how do we think about the pace of improvement? Is the low-hanging fruit already clipped and now it's just a market cycle or other things you can do to drive operating income?","Keith J. Allman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think we're through a big chunk of the hard work, Bob. I wouldn't quite characterize it that all the low-hanging fruit is clipped and now we're just a kind of on a market trajectory. But clearly, the better you get, the harder it is to get better, and we're getting better. So, it is going to be tougher to make, and we won't make the kind of dramatic improvements that we've made so far.","But having said that, we think we've got a long way to go. We're not \u2013 we don't have this business to its full potential. That there are significant areas of growth that we can continue to drive both in terms of the retail, as well as the import and dealer business. So, I think you're dead-on, Bob, in that it's \u2013 the big chunks are behind us in terms of the improvement pace, but again, back to that 30%, 35% dropdown margin, and the fact that we have these two powerful brands in KraftMaid and Merillat, I like where we're sitting.","Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Got it. And one for John. It looks like free cash flow is going to be \u2013 free cash flow generation is going to be robust next year. And could you just remind us of what you're thinking in terms of capital allocation priorities? Is it debt repayment? Is it M&A? Is it buybacks or dividend? Thanks, and good luck.","John G. Sznewajs - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & VP","Yeah. Thanks, Bob. As we've talked about before, we have a very (45:20) and balanced approach to our capital allocation. So, first and foremost our capital \u2013 first priority is to reinvest in the business and grow it. I think many of you know that our CapEx \u2013 we're relatively light on the CapEx side compared to some of our competitors. CapEx runs about 2% of sales. So, that's our number one priority.","After that, we really do take a balanced approach, and we balance three or four items. The first is dividends. We do pay a dividend, and we increased our dividend as you may know, for this dividend that we're paying here in the fourth quarter of this year, about a 6% or 7% dividend increase. That's following a 20% dividend increase last year. And then after that, we've talked about our share repurchase program which we said would be, on average, between $400 million to $500 million a year, and we're clearly on pace to do that here in 2015.","We also balanced that with acquisitions. Again, we've been thinking about smaller acquisitions, more bolt-ons, particularly in our Paint and Plumbing area. We've hired an executive, Amit Bhargava, to really pursue that and build our M&A pipeline and so we're aggressively pursuing that. That's clearly part of our strategy.","And then debt repayment is on our radar screen. As many of you may know, we have a $1 billion maturity coming due in October of next year. And we've been talking for several years about taking $300 million to $500 million of that debt down when that maturity comes due. So, a clear and balanced approach. And we'll keep you updated as things change, but we think we've got a good sense of how we're going to spend our cash over the coming year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Rehaut from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","William Wong - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning. It's actually Will Wong on for Mike. How are you?","Keith J. Allman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good. How are you?","William Wong - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good. Regarding Cabinets, just a quick housekeeping question. Can you just remind us again what the sales impact was from the direct-to-builder exit?","John G. Sznewajs - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & VP","Yeah. We didn't parse it out, specifically, but I think if you do the read-through, Will, sales impact was down approximately $10 million from that line of business based on dealer sales being up 9% and half our business being \u2013 the other half of our business being builder-oriented. So, that's a rough number.","William Wong - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Got it. And with regards to raw material costs, can you just talk about what the impact was on the quarter and as well as what you're expecting in 2016, if you're expecting any incremental benefits from lower raw material costs?","John G. Sznewajs - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & VP","Regarding specifically in Cabinetry or...","William Wong - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Just across the different segments, the four different segments.","John G. Sznewajs - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & VP","So, commodities generally have been \u2013 we talked a little bit about Plumbing earlier, copper and zinc have come down a little bit and that's reflected itself in our metals hedged impact. At this point, we are not forecasting any further price deflation in commodities next year. We've had a very little impact in our Cabinet business.","We are seeing a little bit of price inflation in the windows side on glass. And so we may need to work with our suppliers as well as look at our pricing on windows next year. But it's a little bit too early to determine exactly how we're going to play that as glass prices change in the marketplace.","John G. Sznewajs - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & VP","Over the mid to long term, we tend to be flush when it comes to price commodity. That's how I think about 2016.","William Wong - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. And then just lastly with regards to Plumbing. Can you just talk about the relationship between sell-in versus sell through, and what you're seeing in both retail and wholesale in terms of inventory?","Keith J. Allman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","When you look at wholesale, there's really two types of wholesalers that we sell to, though, broadly speaking, there is the wholesalers with distribution centers, and wholesalers that we ship directly to their warehouses. And in both cases, we're seeing pretty consistent POS matching our shipments into their chains. So, I would say that on the Plumbing side in wholesale, it's pretty level, pretty level flow through.","John G. Sznewajs - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & VP","Will, maybe to complement some of Keith's comments. We've got very high service levels in our Plumbing businesses. So that doesn't \u2013 that means our customers aren't required to hold as much inventory as maybe they are with some other of our competitors. So, we feel really good about the service levels that we provide.","William Wong - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Our final question today comes from the line of Megan McGrath from MKM Partners. Your line is open.","Megan McGrath - MKM Partners LLC","Good morning. Just wanted to follow-up a little bit on the Paint business. You talked about the market being flattish overall, although you're gaining some share. Any thoughts \u2013 could you remind us sort of how that trended, first of all, versus last quarter in terms of the market? And any thoughts as to why the flattening out? Was there any weather impact, maybe where you're seeing strength versus weakness would be helpful. Thanks.","Keith J. Allman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","We obviously have our feelers out in both the channels and in the markets, and we do consumer research and have a somewhere of a feel for it. But admittedly, it's tough to tell in terms of the drivers of the relative softness in the space.","In Q2, while we didn't see a significant impact to the weather, that was certainly noise that out there in the market, without a doubt. It was a wet summer and that affects the demand. So, I think that could play into it. But overall, when you look at how people have the opportunity to defer paint, it's not that big of a purchase item, we feel good about the underlying demand in 2016.","Megan McGrath - MKM Partners LLC","Okay. Great. And a quick one on Milgard. You talked, I think, if I remember correctly at your Analyst Day about expanding that business geographically. Could you give us an update there?","Keith J. Allman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","We are. We talked about that in Texas. We have a new factory that we're bringing up out there. In fact, I'm on a plane here in a few hours to go out there and visit Milgard and talk about how they're doing. They're doing very well. We talked about their growth rates. We're a new player into Texas. We've been shifting into that from outside of the market. We're new in terms of our factory being on site there. So, there's plenty of headroom for us in terms of share gain and incremental growth for us starting at the small base that we have. Texas is a big market, and we're looking forward to a success there.","Megan McGrath - MKM Partners LLC","Thanks. And if I could throw one really quick modeling question in there. It sounds like in terms of the Cabinet exit, you're not expecting to \u2013 is it fair to say you're not expecting to accelerate that exit from the builders? So, if we sort of use that number, John, that you gave us around $10 million for looking for the next couple of quarters, would that be fair?","John G. Sznewajs - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & VP","Yeah. Megan, I think that's the way to think about it.","Megan McGrath - MKM Partners LLC","Okay.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I\u2019ll begin with some brief comments on our fourth quarter before I turn to our full year results and conclude with the thoughts on 2019.","Turning to Slide 4. In the fourth quarter, our top line increased 11%, excluding the impact of currency, driven by strong growth in our North American Plumbing operations, the benefit of our Kichler acquisition, and strong growth in paint. Excluding the impact of currency, acquisitions and divestitures, sales grew 5%. Operating profit grew $58 million or 23%, due to increase of volume, continued cost control and improved price realization. As a result, operating margins for the quarter expanded 150 basis points to 15.4%. Our earnings per share increased 56% due to improved operating earnings, a lower tax rate and lower share count. We repurchased 9.6 million shares for $300 million in the quarter, a significant increase in our repurchase activity compared to prior quarters. We were pleased with our fourth quarter performance.","Turning to Slide 5, for the full year of 2018, we overcame significant inflation and delivered strong sales, operating profit and EPS growth for the full year. This growth was driven by solid consumer demand, healthy end markets and our continued focus on executing our growth and capital allocation strategies to deliver shareholder value.","Sales for 2018 increased 9%. Excluding the impact of currency acquisitions and divestitures, sales grew 5%. This growth was driven by record sales years for five of our business units, Behr Paint, Delta Faucet, Hansgrohe, Watkins Wellness and Liberty Hardware.","Operating profit grew 6% despite significant inflationary headwinds demonstrating our ability to manage our costs and successfully implement price to offset raw material and other inflation. Earnings per share increased 29% in 2018 due to a lower tax rate of 25%, increased operating earnings, lower share account and lower interest expense.","Turning to our segments. Plumbing continued its strong performance in 2018. Delta gained share with its Brizo brand and showrooms, its opening price point Peerless brand at retail, and we saw strength across all channels of distribution, including wholesale, retail and e-commerce. Notably, Delta achieved a record year and successfully implemented a companywide ERP system. Hansgrohe's success was driven by growth in China and Germany offsetting softer conditions and certain other countries. Watkins, our leading spa business, had an outstanding year with strong performance in its core dealer network and retail channel, and healthy sales of these aquatic fitness systems.","In our Decorative Architectural Products segment, the acquisition of Kichler Lighting early in the year significantly increased sales. We've integrated Kichler into our Masco Enterprise. And we'll continue to drive value in 2019 by leveraging Kichler's product portfolio with existing and new customers realizing further operational improvements and optimizing its brand and go-to-market capabilities.","Our propane initiative grew high single-digits for the full year, and we continue to invest in this large opportunity along with our partner, The Home Depot. Propane now represents about 25% of our coatings revenue, and we expect to continue to drive high single-digit growth in the propane market in 2019.","In the DIY market, we are well positioned with the leading brand, the highest quality products and a great team of people and expect to continue to outgrow the DIY market in 2019.","Turning to Cabinetry, we've returned to top line growth in 2018 with strong 7% growth, excluding the divestiture of Moores. Our repair and remodel cabinet business grew double-digits in 2018, aided significantly by our new program win with Menards. This growth, together with our business shift over the past several years, has resulted in 70% of our sales in this segment now driven by the repair and remodel market, up from approximately 60% two years ago.","In our Windows business, sales grew 1% for the full year, excluding currency and our divestiture of Arrow Fastener. We achieved mid-single digit growth in our U.S. business, while our UK business was challenged with lower demand. We took action in the UK to restructure and right size our operations during the year to match the current level of demand.","From overall Masco perspective, our strong growth generated over $800 million of free cash flow for a more than 100% free cash flow conversion rate. Strong cash flow is a hallmark of Masco, enabling us to drive shareholder value through reinvesting in the business, selectively pursuing acquisitions with the right fit and return and returning cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. We deployed nearly $1.5 billion of capital during the year consistent with our balanced capital allocation strategy. We returned $654 million to shareholders through share repurchases, redeployed $549 million for the acquisition of Kichler Lighting and we increased our dividend for the fifth consecutive year all while reducing debt by $106 million. With this debt reduction and continued earnings growth, we finished 2018 with a very strong balance sheet. Our net debt to EBITDA at year-end was approximately 1.7 times. Before turning to 2019, I'd like to thank our more than 26,000 employees will here in North America as well as across the globe for all of their efforts to help make 2018, another successful year for Masco.","Now turning to 2019. I'd like to share with you our view of the markets for the year. Consistent with many industry forecasters, we expect to repair and remodel market to grow in the mid single-digit range in 2019 though slower than the rate of growth in 2018. For new construction, we are assuming a low single-digit growth rate due mainly to labor constraints and affordability concerns, understanding that recent declines in mortgage rates could help alleviate some of the affordability pressure. And for our international markets, principally Europe, we're expecting a low single-digit growth environment.","With regards to tariffs, our assumption is that the list three tariffs will increase to 25% on March 1st. We've previously shared with you that the impact of these tariffs on Masco is less than the raw material and other inflation we effectively dealt with in 2018. As a reminder, the 25% tariffs represent approximately $150 million of annual inflation or approximately 2.7% of cost of goods sold. However, it remains to be same what the impact these subsequent price increases will have on consumer demand. Based on these assumptions, we expect sales growth in the range of 3% to 5%, excluding currency, margins to be similar to 2018 as we've offset tariffs with supply chain initiatives, other internal productivity measures and price and earnings per share to be in the range of $2.60 to $2.80.","With our strong balance sheet, we will continue our balanced capital allocation strategy, and intend to deploy approximately $600 million towards share repurchases in 2019.","Now, I'll turn the call over to John to go over our fourth quarter and full year results in more detail. John?","John Sznewajs","Thank you, Keith, and good morning, everyone. As Dave mentioned, most of my comments will focus on adjusted performance, excluding the impact of rationalization charges, inventory step-up related to purchase accounting for the Kichler acquisition and other one-time items.","Turning the Slide 7, we've finished the year strong. Fourth quarter sales increased 10% or 11% in local currency. Excluding acquisitions and divestitures, sales increased 4% or 5% local currency. Currency translation unfavorably impacted sales in the quarter by approximately $19 million. Local currency in North American sales increased 14% in the quarter or 6%, excluding acquisitions and divestitures. Local currency international sales matched prior year in the quarter and increased 2%, excluding our divestiture of Moores in the fourth quarter of 2017.","SG&A as a present of sales decreased to 190 basis points to 16.9% in the fourth quarter to leverage on volume, lower promotional spend and cost containment. We delivered solid bottom-line performance as operating income increased 23% in the quarter and margins expanded 150 basis points to 15.4%.","For the fourth quarter, our EPS increased 56% to $0.64. I would like to note this performance was calculated based on a normalized tax rate of 25% versus a previously guided 26% tax rate. This change in our tax rate was driven by the issuance of recent IRS regulatory guidance regarding certain provisions of the new tax code. Due to this change, we have provided restated adjusted EPS numbers each quarter of 2018 in the appendix on Slide 23.","Fourth quarter EPS was favorably impacted more than expected by approximately $0.05 consisting of approximately $0.03 benefit from the pull-forward of sales in the Plumbing and Decorative segments, $0.01 due to the lower normalized tax rate of 25% and $0.01 due to the gain in asset sale in the Decorative segment.","Turning to the full year 2018, sales increased 9%. Excluding the acquisitions and divestitures, full year sales increased 5%. Currency translation favorably impacted the full year results by $47 million. To local currency, North American sales increased 11% for the full year or 6%, excluding acquisitions in the Arrow divestiture. Our North American teams executed well, driving solid revenue growth is our strong brands, innovative products and broad product assortment continue to resonate with designers and consumers.","In local currency, international sales declined 2% for the full year or increased 1%, excluding the Moores divestiture. While we experienced some international market softness in 2018, mainly in the UK, our international Hansgrohe plumbing business continued to drive growth.","Our SG&A, as a percent of sales, decreased 90 basis points to 17.7% for the full year, as we continue to leverage our volume and control our costs. Full year operating income increased $67 million or 6% as operating margins up 15.1%.","Lastly, our EPS increased 29% to $2.50 for the full year. Compared to our prior 2018 EPS guidance, the $2.50 in EPS includes the aggregate $0.04 EPS benefit of the sales pull-forward and again the sale of the building in Q4 and a $0.03 full year EPS benefit from a normalized tax rate of 25%, down from our previously guided 26% tax rate. Our adjusted EPS calculation will continue to assume a 25% normalize tax rate for 2019.","Turning to Slide 8, our Plumbing segment had a strong finish to the year as sales in the quarter increased 6%, excluding the impact of currency. This was driven by strong growth in our faucet, shower and spa businesses. The fourth quarter benefited from approximately $10 million of pull-forward sales from Q1 of 2019 while currency negatively impacted sales by approximately $16 million in the quarter.","North American sales increased 8% in local currency as we experienced strong demand from our wholesale, retail, dealer and e-commerce customers. Additionally our spa business continued to outperform by achieving a record fourth quarter with these innovative new products and industry leading brands.","Our international sales in the fourth quarter grew 3% in local currency, rebounding from the stocks third quarter. Hansgrohe's focus on key markets drove this performance as they experienced strong growth in Germany and China. Operating profit in the quarter increased 11%, due to incremental volume, lower spending and a neutral price cost relationship.","Turning to the full year 2018, sales increased 6% in local currency. This strong growth was driven by a record years at Delta, Hansgrohe and Watkins. North American sales grew 8% in local currency as we experienced strong growth across all channels and price points during the year. Our international plumbing sales increased 2% in local currency as Hansgrohe's performance continued to benefit from their investments in brand, design and innovation. Full year operating profit grew 3% due to volume growth, partially offset by the price costs lag we experienced in the first three quarters of the year, mix and other expenses such as ERP spending. For 2019, we expect the plumbing segment sales growth to be in the 3% to 5% range, excluding currency with margins similar to 2018 as we implement price to offset the impact of the proposed tariffs. Also given year-end currency exchange rates, we expect 2019 revenue will be unfavorably impacted by approximately $65 million, principally in the first and second quarters. This unfavorable currency exchange results and negative EPS impact of approximately $0.01 per quarter in each of Q1 and Q2, 2019. In addition, depreciation and amortization in this segment will approximate $20 million per quarter due to increased capital investments in 2018. We also anticipate additional $5 million of expense in Q1 as we will be exhibiting at ISH, a large biennial European plumbing trade show.","Turning to Slide 9, the Decorative Architectural Products segment grew 30% in the fourth quarter. Excluding the acquisition of Kichler, sales grew 8%, as we experienced strong double-digit growth in our core DIY products, and high single-digit growth in Pro. Behr's strong DIY performance was aided by approximately $20 million of sales pulled forward from Q1, 2019, due to increased year-end customer purchases to achieve incentives. Operating income increased 42% in the quarter aided by the Kichler acquisition, increased volume and improvement in the price cost relationship, cost control in a $4 million gain on the sale of a building.","Full year sales grew 20%. Excluding the acquisition of Kichler sales grew 5%. The solid performance was driven by our Behr Pro initiative as we achieve high-single-digit growth and continued to grow share with the Pro. While this Pro growth is slightly lower than our previously guided double-digit growth expectations, we are pleased with this performance considering the slowdown in the overall coatings market. Together with the Home Depot, we will continue to invest in and capitalize on the significant growth opportunity. ","The solid sales growth in 2018 was also attributable to Liberty Hardware's continued share gains from successful new product introductions and program wins in the retail channel. Full year operating income increased 13%, principally due to the acquisition of Kichler and improving in the price-cost relationship and lower spending. For Q1, 2019, we expect segment's operating margins to be down approximately 200 basis points. This margin erosion in Q1 is driven by the $20 million of sales pull-forward into Q4, 2018, both sequential and year-over-year commodity inflation, additional investment in our propane initiative, the full quarter impact of Kichler and increase in depreciation and amortization to approximately $12 million per quarter. For the full year 2019, we expect sales growth in this segment to be in the 4% to 6% range, including the benefit of approximately two months from the Kichler acquisition and operating margins to be between 17% and 18%.","Turning to Slide 10, in the Cabinetry segment, excluding the Moores divestiture, sales increased 4% in the fourth quarter and 7% to the full year. This solid performance was driven by our industry leading brands as we experienced double-digit growth in our repair and remodel business in 2018. The Cardell program at Menards is performing well, and we are pleased with its first year performance. In addition, our new home construction business matched 2017. Segment profitability declined $1 million in the quarter and declined $8 million for the full year. The fourth quarter performance was driven by increased logistics costs and mix as we discussed in our third quarter call. Full year profitability was also impacted by logistics costs and mix in addition to the ramp-up costs related to the Menards win. 2019, we expect flat to low single-digit sales growth due to lower demand in the cabinet market and expect segment margins will similar to 2018.","Turning to Slide 11. In our Windows segment, sales decreased 1% in the fourth quarter and declined 2% for the full year. Excluding the sale of Arrow Fastener in the second quarter of 2017 and FX, sales increased 1% for the full year. This performance was driven by Milgard, a leading Western U.S. window business, which grew low-single digits in the quarter, and mid single-digits for the full year. Milgard's growth received a favorable pricing and a positive mix shift toward our premium window and door products. This growth was partially offset by our UK window operation, which continues to experience market softness. Segment profitability in the fourth quarter increased to $4 million, but decreased $16 million for the full year, fourth quarter profit due to favorable price costs and mix. Full year performance was primarily driven by restructuring actions taken in the UK and the increase in Milgard's warranty-related costs and inefficiencies in both the North American and UK operations. In the first quarter of 2019, we will be implementing the ERP system in Milgard's largest California facility. As a result, we expect a modest operating loss due to lower volumes in the incremental ERP costs in the first quarter. For full year, we expect low single-digit sales growth for this segment, excluding currency with modest margin improvement.","Turning to Slide 12, our year-end balance sheet was strong with approximately $600 million of the balance sheet liquidity as well as full availability of our $750 million revolving credit facility. Working capital, as a percent of sales, finished the year at 14%. While slightly higher due to the acquisition of Kichler, this performance continues to be some of the best results in the industry. During 2018, we repurchased 18.6 million shares for approximately $654 million and we increased our quarterly dividend by 14% to $0.12 per share. We took further action in 2018 to strengthen our balance sheet by reducing debt by $106 million. In addition, we now hold an investment grade credit rating as Standard & Poor's, Fitch and Moody's.","Going into 2019, our disciplined capital allocation strategy is unchanged. We continue to prioritize investments in our businesses to drive organic growth. We'll balance acquisitions with the right strategic fit and returns with share repurchases, and we will maintain an appropriate dividend. We expect to deploy another $600 million for share repurchases in 2019 subject to market conditions. We are assuming a 290 million average share count for 2019. We generated $830 million of free cash flow in 2018, and expect to sustain better than 100% free cash flow conversion rate in 2019.","Lastly, as Keith mentioned earlier, our 2019 EPS estimate is $2.60 to $2.80 per share. I provided a lot of detail on our 2019 expected performance for each segment during my prepared remarks. Please see slides 27 and 28 in the appendix of our earnings deck for a list of these assumptions.","With that, I'll turn the call back over to Keith.","Keith Allman","Thank you, John. Looking at 2019, while we believe that growth may moderate in 2019, the fundamentals of our business and our core repair and remodel markets are healthy. Consumer confidence and wages are growing. This increases our consumers' willingness to invest in their home. Home prices continue to appreciate. This is highly correlated with repair and remodel spending. The age of the housing stock is increasing with 50 million owned homes greater than 30-years-old. This drives increased remodeling spending. And household formations have steadily increased throughout 2018, driven by the millennial demographic. This trend is projected to continue fueling housing demand for the next decade. With our continued focus on executing our strategy, including investing in our leading brands, innovation leadership and operational excellence coupled with our strong balance sheet and liquidity position, we will continue to create shareholder value.","With that, we\u2019ll now open up the line for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Ken Zener with Keybanc. Your line is open.","Ken Zener","The 8% growth we saw in North America Plumbing, I was wondering if you could maybe expand on that a little bit. And I'm just thinking of your Analyst Day in the past, where you looked at faucets and shower-heads, non-decorative and other wellness. I just want to see how much dispersion there was between those different end markets. If you can do that for the quarter and for the year just so we can get a sense of how those different initiatives are working.","Keith Allman","When you look at our North American Plumbing market growth of 8%, we're very pleased with that. And we believe that that growth is higher than the overall market. So we think we're taking a share there. So we feel good about that. When you think about our international plumbing business, that's an extremely diverse set of demand spread over 135 countries, and it's difficult to really nail down the market growth with that kind of aggregation. But when you look at how Hansgrohe is performing, particularly in Central Europe, we're happy with that. So when you look over -- look across the Plumbing group's overall performance and where that growth was driven, there was some good geographic dispersion, which were pleased with. And then when you look further as it relates to price point, we had some very good growth in the opening price point, driven the way we wanted driven meaning we launched new products to specifically address that price point of the peerless brand, for example, we're seeing very good sales in our Beijing, toward that categories, which tend to be more opening or entry price point. But we also saw a strong growth in our high-end brands of Axor and Brizo for Delta and Hansgrohe respectively. And we saw very good growth as we talked in our prepared remarks in our spa business and our hot tub business. So we're seeing strong dispersed growth across both geographies, price points and across our full continuum of the portfolio. So we feel good about the growth and feel good about 2019 in that segment.","Ken Zener","And then I was just looking at the DIY paint seems to grow. I mean, I -- we grew low-double-digits. Was that including the pull-forward? Because I mean, I think there was some other commentary from some other producers about it being kind of challenging. And it seems like you didn't have the issue if you can spend on that? Thank you very much.","John Sznewajs","Yes, Ken. It's John. I -- first of all, the low-double-digit growth rate does reflect or include the $20 million of sales that were pulled forward out of the first quarter into the fourth quarter. So that does help aid growth rate a little bit. That's said, we do think that the overall coatings market in 2018 just grow a little bit. And so we do feel like we've probably picked up a little bit of share gain on the DIY side, not a ton. If you look at our overall growth rate for the full year, it was definitely low single-digit, so a little bit of tailwind there in the fourth quarter, but for the full year low single-digit growth. ","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Michael Rehaut with JP Morgan. Your line is open.","Q \u2013 Michael Rehaut","The first question I had was, looking out to 2019, your sales growth outlook of 3% to 5%, obviously, by segment you continued to execute a lot of market share gaining initiatives such as propane, your expansion in Plumbing et cetera. I was curious -- it looked though that like the 3% to 5% was more of in line with your market growth assumptions, so if that is indeed correct, I was just curious about how you think about share gain opportunity in 2019, and if that's reflected at all in your outlook.","Keith Allman","Yes, Mike, one of the things that did impact our guidance for the full year on the top line the 3% to 5% is the fact that we did have some of that pull-forward sales that impacted the fourth quarter. So that $30 million, we would have typically anticipated, hitting into 2019 pull-forward than 2018. But if you consider the markets that we are in both the R&R market, which is growing kind of mid single-digit 4% to 6% range and kind of low single-digits for both new Construction and International, and if you consider the fact that, in particular our Decorative Architectural segment, we've got growing low single-digits. If you put that all together, there is some share gain baked in there. So we do think we're growing ahead of markets, but overall the markets are slowing a little bit for 2019. So I hope that captures the essence of your question.","John Sznewajs","Mike, we're seeing some good share gain opportunities to continue on our propane segment, for sure. We have a real solid momentum in Plumbing, and we -- and expect that to continue. And our offering, as it relates to an aisle service product and brand et cetera, we feel good about that in the DIY space, while that market is a little softer. We believe it'll be a little softer going in 2019. So there is share gain baked into our thinking.","Q \u2013 Michael Rehaut ","I guess, secondly, you mentioned that the list three 25% tariffs are baked into your outlook for the year, your EPS guidance. Just wanted to clarify that it still represents $150 million of incremental headwinds, and more broadly if you could just remind us of the overall outlook for incremental raw material and tariff inflation in 2019, and how you expect to offset that between if it\u2019s possible to break it down between price productivity and whatever other offsets you have?","John Sznewajs","That $150 million impact, Mike, is the right number. And we've talked about that before. Of course, there\u2019s a significant amount of moving parts and potential variability there. Does -- do the 10% -- does that say? How much of the 25 goes in if everything, when it goes in? So I think it's best to think about that as a very dynamic situation. And as more certainty is revealed over time, we'll be sure to share that with you and reflect that in our updates. In terms of ROCE, without a doubt, tariffs is the biggest uncertainty for 2019. We are assuming in our forecast that does -- the tariffs do jump up to 25% in March. When we look at other significant commodities like copper and zinc, for example, in Plumbing, that has started to moderate in the back half of 2018. And we think that's the level we're at and we're assuming that the level we are at in copper and zinc will continue into '19, so there might be a modest benefit there as we move on through the year. In coatings, while TiO2 has moderated a bit, we are continuing to see significant pricing pressures in resins. And in cabinets, plywood distribution and logistics, they remained elevated. But we think those are moderating. We think those will hold where they are currently. In terms of how we're addressing it, certainly, we're making significant moves and decisions and doing a lot of work on our supply chain. For example, we've reallocated, if you would, and moved over $30 million of plywood purchases in our cabinet business to address countervailing duties and tariffs and the like. That's just one example. We're looking at value engineering and costs out. We're looking at productivity. We're certainly looking at other opportunities to move to other low cost countries and then price. And I think, we've demonstrated the ability to execute on all of those.","Operator","Your next question comes from Michael Wood from Nomura Instinet. Your line is open.","Michael Wood","First question, I just wanted to ask for some more color on the DIY gallon growth, do you have any point of sale trend that you could share with us in the fourth quarter? It looks like, as you mentioned, you outperformed the market. And if you could provide some more color in terms of what's driving some of that relative strength.","Keith Allman","So Mike, in terms of -- we really can't get into POS. That's not ours. We can't give you too much a read-through. That said the down growth was kind of flat for low single-digits in the fourth quarter. So that's where we stand there. We feel good about that overall. And we -- and that's a combination of both Pro and DIY. So we continue to grow the Pro side. The DIY has been a little bit sluggish. But that's been the case all of 2018. So that's not necessarily new news.","John Sznewajs","So, I think, in terms of what's driving that DIY growth in the aisle is a number of things. There's no one silver bullet. There is certainly -- a big driver of it is our strong partnership with the Home Depot, and the work we're doing in the aisle to convert foot traffic to cash paying sales to the consumer. The brand of Behr is extremely strong in the DIY space and well known. Our service levels both in the store and in terms of delivery are extremely strong. So that combination of brand and service and a continued steady innovation pipeline is all part of our success in DIY.","Michael Wood","And then some other building product companies that have reported have seen some destocking in fourth quarter -- notably Europe and U.S. retail, did you see that in any of your segments?","Keith Allman","There's always fluctuation with inventories at our customers. We did see a little bit of destocking in Plumbing wholesale, where we've had tremendous success. And that did slow down in that channel a little bit in the Q4. So that was a little bit of destocking there. But then, we also had significant pull-ahead volume, which would, obviously, equate to restocking. We talked about that $30 million impact over and across Paint and Plumbing. So really we did not see what I would characterize as any material destocking in our channels.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Schrier with Citi. Your line is open.","Scott Schrier","I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit about if there was any impact on margins this quarter that might have come from pushing price to offset tarrifs, and then we have the tariff delays. So if there's any lag there, that caused a little bit of margin hell in there. And then, understanding that\u2019s pretty uncertain, if tariffs don\u2019t materialize or things turn out to be better than we hoped for, can you speak to the elasticity of pricing that you might have for some of those price increases that you're putting through?","John Sznewajs","Sure, Scott. As it relates to the impact in the quarter due to pricing related tariffs on margin specifically to your question, when you recall that what we're trying to do and what we're pursuing with price when we pursue price to offset the tariff impact is just to recover the dollar amount of the tariff. So there's not an incremental margin on as a result of the tariff pricing that we're putting into place, if anything, because we're only recovering the dollar value of the tariff is actually a slight potential for margin to decline because of that. So, really no margin benefit there. I forget the second part of the question.","Keith Allman","In terms of elasticity, Scott, its \u2013 that\u2019s really difficult to nail down when you look at the environment that we're in. Typically, the elastic studies that we do and information we have is based on in a constant environment of a particular product line goes up or down. With this kind of broad-based inflation in our -- across our markets, it's difficult to really take that down specifically, but we are expecting that there would be some pull back in terms of demand in the categories that are affected.","Scott Schrier","Got It. And then in the last couple of quarters, I believe, that you've mentioned that you are seeing strong trends in terms of your ticket size is, I'm curious, if you anticipate that continuing or consistent with your comments about some moderation in '19. You would expect to see some even ticket sizes moderate in an environment where you have some uncertainty. And if so, is that built into your guidance?","Keith Allman","Mix is a good story for us Scott. We're seeing good high-end growth in our higher price bigger ticket items. I talked a little bit about it in terms of some very high-end shower systems at Hansgrohe. We continued to do well. Our spa business had a record year this year. So the high-end is very strong and it continues to be strong for us when we expect that continuing into '19. We're also increasing our revenue and our growth rate in the opening price point or in the low-end. And that's by design where we've launched specific products and talked about Peerless, we've talked about bathing and some of our toilets and vitreous China products. So we're also seeing growth there. I think that's a good story when you have that kind of bimodal dispersion into growth. The market is strong and new entries and new homeowners are forming households, driving some of that opening price point. And we have products to cover that. And then there's the move up phenomenon and we have products on the high end. Now while our lower-end products tend to be a little bit lower margin over time, we've done work to close that gap. There are lower margin. And when you factored all in how we're looking at '19, we're really not anticipating mix being a material impact.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Justin Speer with Zelman & Associates. Your line is open.","Justin Speer","I had a couple questions. One, just the broader corporate level SG&A, the management in the quarter was excellent. And I just want to understand which of that is temporal in nature? And how to think about SG&A as a percentage of revenues on a go-forward basis embedded in your guidance?","Keith Allman","A portion of that favorability in SG&A this year is what we talked about terms of the gain a sale on the DAP segment, so that was about $4 million. And we did lap some investments in Q4 of 2017 tied to some pretty significant resets and program wins at -- in decorative hardware with Liberty in the shower program. So there was a bit of an easy comp, if you would. We also had good cost control throughout the year and we did push certain investments into '19 to mitigate inflationary pressures, for example. In '19 we expect total SG&A for the Company to be up slightly from '18 as a percent of sales, as we pick up some of those investments that were pushed out to '19. We're going to continue to invest strategically for growth, such as marketing spend in Plumbing and additional headcounts in Deco to support the pro initiative.","Justin Speer","Okay. And then the next question is a two-part question, particularly as it pertains to the Plumbing business, you're looking for flat margins there included a 25% tariff. First question is do you already have the price in hand for that 25% tariff? And the second question is how do margins for that business flex around a more sanguine R&R market backdrop? Was that low-single or flat as opposed to your 5% view? And how do they look under a 10% or no tariffs scenario?","Keith Allman","In terms of do we have price in hand for the 25? No, we do not. We obviously had significant conversations and pricing actions for the 10%. We feel we're with a combination of the price and cost-outs that we've driven there. We're in good shape on the 10%. But more conversations would be required for sure. Should we see this go to 25% -- Justin, could you repeat that second part of your question for us?","John Sznewajs","On the -- on margin flex in the low growth environment versus a-no tariff scenario. So Justin, as I think about that assuming that commodities are constant. So let's put that in and there is a really, I mean, commodity impact. I would say that we should see some modest margin expansion just given our leverage on incremental volume, right. And so that should help us out. And to the extent that the tariffs don't go into effect and that has a good impact or a favorable impact on consumer demand, we would typically see incremental margins off of volume in this segment kind of in that high 20% to 30% range. So we should see some, again, some modest margin expansion in that scenario as well.","Justin Speer","But in a flat world, assuming a 25% tariff does go into depression that would potentially risk your guidance as you're looking for modest growth there?","John Sznewajs","It had a little bit of an impact on it only because -- we have 25% tariffs. We are going to be, again, the same answer I gave a couple minutes ago. We'll only be getting the dollar impact of that recovery on all these tariffs. So that -- if anything there, could present a little bit of a headwind to margins in that scenario, Justin.","Justin Speer","Thank you.","Keith Allman","I think I may have heard you say something along the lines of the 25% tariff risking our guidance. Just to be clear, we have incorporated into our guidance the expectation of 25% on March 1st.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Nishu Sood with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Q \u2013 Nishu Sood","I wanted to ask first about the assumed moderation in demand that you're baking into your '19 forecast. So on the housing side, we clearly have some indicators that housing has slowed down, and I imagine you would expect that begin to impact some of your businesses in the next quarter or two. On the R&R side, the assumed slowdown -- is that something you've seen already in 4Q? Or are you just assuming that it happens given the slowdown on the new side?","Keith Allman","We did see a little bit of a slowdown in Q4. I think in our coatings business, we saw it a little bit. I talked a little bit about our Plumbing business in the trade and wholesale. So there\u2019s a little bit of slowness there.","John Sznewajs","And I'd also say that we saw a little bit of slowdown in our cabinets and to a degree, Windows business. We grew low single-digits for the fourth quarter, and Windows, we are in mid single-digits for the full year there.","Q \u2013 Nishu Sood","And in terms -- just shifting gears to cabinets and other specialty, in terms of the kind of margin turnaround there kind of getting us back to a double-digit -- low single-digit revenue growth there seems pretty good given their greater exposure to new construction. On the margin side though we're expecting flat for the year, we have less -- I would imagine that tariffs impact based on your tables there, and less commodities as well. So, why only flat -- when can we expect further improvement in the margins on those two businesses?","Keith Allman","When you look at cabinets, we had a full year margin north of 9%. And when you compare that to the competition, we think we're doing pretty good there. We've got certainly some good dropdown that can come from that. We also experienced some inflation in plywood that we've dealt with. There's still little bit more of that that could be a drag on margins. In terms of our Windows business, we've got ERP spend that we're going to continue to make into the quarter, which our experience shows us will have an impact on both the top line as well as the actual expense of that ERP system. So when you combine those things together, that's what's really led to our guidance as it relates to margin.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Kim, Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","Stephen Kim","I wanted to follow-up on the cabinet conversation a little bit. Menards, I think, you had indicated that it was going to be running at a run rate of about $80 million or so by on an annualized basis by the end of this year or the end of last year. I'm guessing that maybe you recognized about half of that in 2018. And if that were to be the case, that would suggest that Menards alone would add about 400 basis points to your sales next year. But you've guided zero to three. And so I'm kind of wondering if you could talk about what you're seeing in the market environment that underlies that guidance or was there any -- is there anything that you're seeing in terms of the sales environment that is depressing things that is worth calling out be regionally or price point wise or anything like that?","John Sznewajs","So, Stephen, with respect to the Menards business -- while we won't break-out the specific customer sales -- if I do a little bit better than that $40 million run rate that you suggests. So the impact for 2019 is great as you've laid out there. That says as we go into 2019, and we consider a little bit of the deceleration and so on 2018, and in the impact of the tariffs and the pricing feeling a big ticket item like Cabinetry, we do expect to see a little bit more of a market slowdown in Cabinetry going into 2019. And so that definitely weighs on our forecast for 2019. That's said, even though that we did see some of this deceleration, we do expect just some modest growth in this because we've seen nice growth on the R&R side of our business. And we've gone back to flat sales for our new construction business. So not while ago, but we do see a little bit of deceleration in that area for 2019.","Stephen Kim","Okay, that's helpful. But just when that -- just to clarify, you're expecting some modest growth excluding or in addition to Menards win?","Keith Allman","We -- given the fact that we've taken some headwinds, given the tariffs and decelerate -- or the overall market demand, I'd say it'd be kind of flat to very low single-digit growth ex-Menards.","Stephen Kim","Ex- Menards. Okay. Got it. And then you talked about the outlook for housing certain things being kind of low single-digit growth for the year. At this point that seems like it's reasonably conservative, but also there's a lot still up in the year in terms of what the housing markets going to do as we just entered the spring selling season this week. And so I was curious if you see upside to this housing starts figure that you laid out of low single-digit growth, is there anything about your strategy that would change? And are there any particular segments that we should be expecting you would be able to generate outside sales or profit growth as a result of housing starts specifically?","Keith Allman","If there's -- if rates start to go down a little bit, then obviously that could be an upside for us. In terms, Stephen, of your direct question, if we see upside in our guidance, I would say no. I think we put our guidance right where we think it would be where we expect to come out based on what we know now. With regards to our specific strategy and what we change anything in our strategy, should there be an increase in housing demand? No, not really. We've got our capacities in a good spot where we need to fulfill the demand. We've purposefully moved our portfolio to a less cyclical, higher margin, more stable state because we think that's the right thing to do for shareholder value. We talked a little bit about doing that in our cabinet business how we shifted it now to some close to 70% of our business coming from repair and remodeling rather than new construction. Obviously going back we spun off our services business. And we're continuing to drive our Paint and Plumbing business and our Lighting business, particularly into that R&R space. So that's our strategy. We think that strategy is sound and it's working. So I would not say that we would have any material strategic change should we see housing pickup in '19.","John Sznewajs","And Stephen, I just remind you that housing as a percent of our total revenue is now down to about 15%. So it's really a key point. Because of the strategic reposition that we've done over the years, it's really a very minor impact toward the overall part of our sales and our business.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Dahl with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Q \u2013 Mike Dahl","I wanted to just go back to some of your commentary around sales and thinking about the cadence of things, you guys have called out a couple of things that are idiosyncratic about the pull-forward in the Paint and Plumbing segments with respect to the impact on 1Q, you pointed out some margin headwinds in 1Q. But I guess at a higher level, when we think about that 3% to 5% organic sales growth, how should we think about that playing out kind of 1Q, 2Q versus the second half?","Keith Allman","Well, we've talked about some of the pressure that we're seeing in 1Q, as it relates to margin and also on top line with the pull-forward that we experienced in Paint and Plumbing. So that would be a factor on the first quarter. When we look at that from first half to second half, we certainly will see it pick up in the second quarter as those first quarter headwinds don't exist with regards to the pull-forward. And then the second half to be somewhat similar to the first half, so we're maybe a little bit stronger in the back half, but really pulling out the effect of the pull-forward out of Q1 into Q4 of '18, really not a significant change beyond that.","Q \u2013 Mike Dahl","Okay, got it. And then my follow-up question. Just looking at the decorative segment, in particular with respect to the 2019 guidance, I was hoping to drill down on Kichler a bit more, because clearly that's a business that has potentially outsized exposure from a tariffs standpoint. You've expressed some conservatism broadly speaking around what potential demand impacts could be, should the 25% go into effect. So I guess on Kichler specifically, what are you guys embedding from a growth and margin standpoint to the extent you can give us a little more detail there.","Keith Allman","Yes. I won't break it down into specific details for Kichler, but into speaking more on in general terms. You may recall, we have 10 months of Kichler in 2018, starting basically in March. So we'll have starting basically in March. So we'll have the full quarter in Q1 as Kichler. And just on face value of Kichler, that would be a margin drag as Kichler's margins are lower than the average in the segment. But particularly, in Q1, that's seasonally a weaker quarter for Kichler. So that will put some drag on the segment as we look at the performance in Q1 and that's part of our guidance, some of our prepared remarks with regards to margin in that segment. Very happy. We continue to build out the team down in Kichler has an outstanding leader that's demonstrated performance across the number of our businesses and a number of functions. As I interact with the dealerships and get more exposure to our customers, I'm really seeing a strong brand and then also seeing an opportunity for us to bring some of our [indiscernible] and operational skills and some of our purchasing power to that area. We have an outstanding ability and opportunity to bring e-business capabilities to that business. So we're very happy with Kichler acquisition, and we're going to continue to drive performance throughout the year. Understanding that given the full year or full quarter ownership of Kichler and the fact that Q1 is a seasonally weaker quarter that will be a little bit of margin drag in the segment.","John Sznewajs","Yeah, Mike, or maybe just to add on to Keith's comments just a bit. If you think about how we look at the lighting business and when we talked about when we acquired the business, we really don't see the fundamental market for lighting shifting dramatically from when we initially talked about. It should grow kind of at the same rate as the overall R&R market kind of in that mid-single digit 4% to 6% range, as you might call it. That said you raised the point about the tariffs and the tariff impacts, because that have a little bit of a headwind on that. Yes, they could, without a doubt. So something we need to look at and see how the tariffs actually roll-out and see how that plays.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Bouley with Barclays. Your line is open.","Matthew Bouley","Hey, thank you for taking my questions. I just wanted to follow up on the discussion earlier around how you would kind of flex margins depending on different market assumptions, because you gave a point estimate for both Plumbing and Cabinets margins in 2019 in light of obviously a lot of moving pieces around tariffs and commodities. So I guess just what gives you confidence in such precise estimates? And then would you be able to kind of give, I guess, some more specific range or bracket around those margin estimates? Thank you.","Keith Allman","I think the specificity comes from being able to identify the pull forward, for example. I think that's a significant benefit. We wanted to get some more detail in those segments, because there were so many moving parts. I think the -- historically, we understand how those businesses operate and the effect of Kichler as it relates to a seasonally slower point in time. And the fact that we own it three out of three months, instead of one out of three months there. So that was straight math and we wanted to make sure that we talked about that. So we could be more precise than that for specific quarter. With regards to more detail, I think we've laid out the detail that we're prepared to lay out with regards to our margin performance for the year. And with respect to the impact of tariff, which is obviously the big moving piece here that we're talking about, that would have -- if those were to go away that would move us up toward the higher part of our range and we'll leave it at that and will provide more detail as we get more certainty around the number with the dates, et cetera.","Matthew Bouley","And then just the margin guidance specifically for Decorative, understanding the larger impacts in the first quarter, it still suggest that you're expecting a lower margin year- over-year from the second quarter to the fourth quarter. So is there any additional color on why that maybe in light of oil prices obviously moving lower. I guess how much of that would be the Kichler headwind from tariffs is mix of pro, a meaningful part of that just any additional color on why the conservatism on margins there? Thank you.","Keith Allman","Kichler is a big mover there which that we've already talked about. We do expect some price commodity headwind in the first half of '19. We are going to continue to invest in hub stores and pro reps and recall that we don't anniversary our 2018 pro rep additions until the third quarter. So when you look at Kichler, you look at what we expect to be commodity headwinds particularly in the resin area that will be facing early in the year. We look at our growth investments in hub stores and pro reps and the fact that we don't anniversary some of those additions we made in '18 to late in the year. Those are combined to put our guidance in that 17% to 18% range.","John Sznewajs","The one other thing I would add to that list of items that Keith just called out is our depreciation and amortization in the segment. I called that out in my prepared remarks, will be up compared to what we've experienced historically, Matthew. So that's another margin headwind a little bit, but from an EBITDA perspective, where probably EBITDA does not -- no impact on EBITDA whatsoever.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Susan Maklari with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Q \u2013 Susan Maklari","My first question is just around, you've done a fair amount of work on the working capital side over the last year or so. How much more do you think you can do there and how should we think about that potentially adding to some of the cash generation that you expect?","John Sznewajs","Certainly. So we [indiscernible] and thank you for noticing the fact that we've been working on working capital. Indeed, the businesses have been working hard at it. It has actually elevated a little bit from where we've been historically, a large part of that has to do with the Kichler acquisition as they carry a higher working capital than most of our business historically, our businesses, core businesses typically have done. That said, we are working with the Kichler team. We know they know that they see opportunity to reduce the working capital in their business. So there could be a little bit of a tailwind for us going forward. And as you may know, we have all of our businesses focused on working capital. So we're -- while we are happy with what we've posted so far, we always strive to get better than within where we've been. So I think there's an opportunity to grind out a little bit better working capital as we go into 2019. That said, the one thing that will be a bit of a headwind for us in working capital is the tariffs, because the tariffs, you have to pay the government in very short period of time. I believe its seven days and so that will impact our working capital a little bit as we go into 2019.","Q \u2013 Susan Maklari","Okay. And then my next question is just now that Kichler is integrated, how are you thinking about M&A going forward? Can you give us any color on what you've been seeing in terms of the pipeline there?","Keith Allman","We have not changed our strategy in M&A, our pipeline remains solid. We're focused on identifying spaces, if you will, that we think have good fundamental growth and tailwinds and good pricing power and then we identify specific targets and then start our cultivation activity and we have a pipeline process and I'm pleased with the level of the pipeline, we really are not changing our strategy. We are -- we have a strong balance sheet that affords us the ability to do the kind of deals that we want to do as well as allocate capital on a balanced approach toward share repurchases, dividends, and of course we are going to continue to fund our brand and innovation in our existing core business. So we like what we're seeing and we're going to continue to drive it and when we are ready to do to announce a deal, we'll do that.","Operator","This concludes the Q&A session and the Masco fourth quarter and full year results conference call.

As a reminder, today\u2019s conference call is being recorded for replay purposes. [Operator Instructions]","I will now turn the call over to David Chaika, Vice President, Treasurer and Investor Relations. You may begin.","David Chaika","Thank you, Regina, and good morning. Welcome to Masco Corporation\u2019s 2019 fourth quarter and full year conference call.","With me today are Keith Allman, President and CEO of Masco; and John Sznewajs, Masco\u2019s Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Our fourth quarter earnings release and the presentation slides that we will refer to today are available on our website under Investor Relations. Following our remarks, we will open the call for analyst questions. Please limit yourself to one question with one follow-up. If we can\u2019t take your question now, please call me directly at 313-792-5500.","Our statements today will include our views about our future performance, which constitute forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements.","We describe these risks and uncertainties in our risk factors and other disclosures in our Form 10-K and our Form 10-Q that we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Our statements will also include non-GAAP financial metrics. Our references to operating profit and earnings per share will be as adjusted, unless otherwise noted. We reconcile these adjusted metrics to GAAP in our earnings release and presentation slides, which are available on our website under Investor Relations.","Finally, please note that we have accounted for our Windows and Cabinetry businesses as discontinued operations for all periods presented.","With that, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Keith.","Keith Allman","Thank you, Dave. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us today. I\u2019ll begin with some brief comments on our fourth quarter, before I turn to our full year results, and conclude with our thoughts on 2020.","As Dave mentioned, our financial results have been restated to reflect Cabinetry and Windows as discontinued operations for all periods presented.","Turning to slide four. In the fourth quarter, our topline increased 1%, excluding the impact of currency, driven by solid growth in North American plumbing and paint. In line with our expectations, operating profit was down and our operating margin was 15.7% in the quarter. As we\u2019ve previously communicated, this was due to higher input costs due to the full impact of tariffs and an increase in variable cost as compared to the fourth quarter of 2018. Our earnings per share for the quarter matched prior year at $0.54 per share.","Turning to our segments. Plumbing growth in the fourth quarter was led by our North American plumbing business which grew 5%. This was driven by record sales for both Delta and Watkins. Delta experienced growth in trade, retail and e-commerce in the fourth quarter, and Watkins continued to outperform the market with its industry-leading portfolio of products across price points and channels.","In our Decorative Architectural segment, Behr continued to perform well with mid-single-digit pro paint growth and low-single-digit DIY growth. This was aided by increased year-end ordering that pulled forward sales from Q1 of 2020, similar to what we experienced last year. We saw good results from the recently reset Color Solution Centers, as well as other new innovations such as our easy-pour paint can and our new Behr Ultra Scuff Defense paint. Our paint growth was offset by lower sales in our lighting business, an industry that has been significantly impacted by tariffs.","Lastly, for the fourth quarter, we made significant progress on our strategic plan by completing the sale of our Milgard Windows business for after tax net proceeds of approximately $560 million and signing an agreement to sell our Cabinetry business for $850 million in cash at closing and preferred stock with a liquidation value of $150 million. We now expect the Cabinetry sale to close by the end of February.","With the proceeds from the sale of Milgard and our strong free cash flow, we executed share repurchases of $456 million in the quarter, and retired approximately $200 million of debt that was scheduled to mature in early 2020, further strengthening our balance sheet and reducing our interest expense. We were pleased with our fourth quarter performance, and it concluded a transformational year for Masco.","Please turn to slide five. As we look back on the full year, we effectively navigated this challenging year while executing our strategy to transform Masco into a stronger, more stable, less cyclical and higher return building products company.","For the full year, sales grew 2% excluding the impact of currency, largely driven by pricing actions as we mitigated the impact of tariffs and other inflation. Despite the challenges of increased tariff costs and slower end markets, Delta, Hansgrohe, Behr and Watkins each achieved record sales for the year.","Delta gained share with bath fixtures at retail, and its Brizo brand in showrooms, while also expanding its line of voice-enabled faucets. Hansgrohe launched several new products early in 2019, helping to drive solid growth, particularly in Germany and China. Our innovation excellence was demonstrated at the recent kitchen and bath industry trade show or KBIS, as we earned two of the best of KBIS awards. Our Brizo brand won the KBIS Best of Show award for its new Kintsu bath collection, and our Hansgrohe brand won the KBIS Impact award for its Rainfinity shower system. Watkins, our leading spa business also had another outstanding year, driven in part by innovations such as its FreshWater salt system. This unique water care system provides a maintenance-free, disposable cartridge that uses less chemicals to provide a simpler and cleaner spa experience.","Behr continued to perform well in 2019, driving high-single-digit growth in pro paint. Pro paint is a large growth opportunity for us. And we will continue to invest in people and capabilities, along with our partner, the Home Depot, to gain share in the pro paint market.","While we were pleased with our paint performance in 2019, the lighting category was one of the hardest hit by tariffs, and this impacted our results. The headwinds we experienced in lighting in the quarter will continue for the next three quarters as we exit certain private label skews and expect some inventory reduction to occur in the retail channel. As we outlined at our Investor Day, we believe that our performance in lighting will stabilize by the end of 2020 and we will be positioned to return to growth at that point.","Wrapping up our 2019 performance, we delivered on our commitment to drive shareholder value, as we increased earnings per share by 6%, executed our strategy to make Masco a better company for the long term by completing the divestitures of our Windows businesses, and signing an agreement to divest our Cabinetry business. And we deployed over $1.2 billion of capital by returning approximately $900 million to shareholders through share repurchases, increasing our dividend for the 6th consecutive year, and reducing our outstanding debt by approximately $200 million to finish the year at a net debt to EBITDA of 1.7 times.","With our effective capital allocation strategy and strong operational performance, we achieved a return on invested capital from continuing operations of 29% in 2019.","Before closing the book on 2019, I\u2019d like to thank all of our employees, especially those that are Cabinetry and former Windows businesses, for all of their hard work and perseverance that made 2019 another successful year for Masco.","Now, turning to 2020. I\u2019d like to share with you our view of our markets. For the repair and remodel market, which is approximately 90% of our revenue. We expect market growth to be in the range of 3% to 4% in 2020 with growth accelerating in the second half of the year. For the paint market, a subset of the repair and remodel market for us, we expect the DIY paint market to be flat and the pro paint market to grow low to mid-single-digits.","For the new construction market, which is approximately 10% of our revenue, we expect id-single-digit growth as we have seen an improvement in both starts and permits, particularly in the single family sector.","As for our international markets, principally Europe, we expect a flat to low single digit growth environment. Based on these assumptions, we expect full year sales growth to be in the range of 2% to 3%, excluding currency, margins to be approximately 16%, and earnings per share to be in the range of $2.35 to $2.55. With our strong balance sheet and the $645 million in after-tax net proceeds from the sale of Cabinetry expected to be received in February, we will continue our balanced capital allocation strategy to drive shareholder value. We will likely deploy $500 million to $600 million of the Cabinetry proceeds toward share repurchases, shortly after closing. And with our expected strong free cash flow conversion of approximately 100%, we will look to deploy up to another $600 million towards M&A or share repurchases throughout the remainder of 2020, subject to market opportunities.","Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to John to go over our fourth quarter, full year and 2020 outlook in more detail. John?","John Sznewajs","Thank you, Keith, and good morning, everyone.","As Dave mentioned, most of my comments will focus on adjusted performance from continuing operations, excluding the impact of rationalization and other onetime items.","Turning to slide seven, we finished the year on plan. Fourth quarter sales matched the prior year and increased 1% in local currency. Currency translation unfavorably impacted sales in the quarter at approximately $7 million. In local currency, North American sales increased 1% in the quarter, driven by pricing actions and volume growth in our plumbing and paint businesses. This was partially offset by lower volumes in our lighting business. In local currency, international sales decreased 1% in the quarter, driven by unfavorable mix, partially offset by pricing actions. We reported operating income of $257 million with operating margins of 15.7%. Operating profit was impacted by mix and unfavorable price cost relationship and higher variable costs. For the fourth quarter, our EPS matched prior year at $0.54 per share. Please note that this performance is based on a normalized tax rate of 26% versus the previously guided 25% tax rate, prior to discontinued operations. Due to the move of Cabinetry and Windows segments to discontinued operations and a change in the tax rate, we have provided restated adjusted EPS numbers for 2018 and the first three quarters of 2019 in the appendix on slide 22.","Turning to the full year 2019. Sales increased 1% and grew 2% in local currency. Currency translation unfairly impacted the full year by $77 million. In local currency, North American sales increased 2%. This performance was driven by disciplined pricing actions across both segments, partially offset by lower volumes. In local currency, international sales matched the prior year. While we experienced some international market softness in 2019, Hansgrohe continued to drive share gains in its home market of Germany and in China.","Our SG&A as a percent of sales increased 10 basis points to 18.9% for the full year. And for the full year, operating income decreased $16 million or 1%, with operating margins of 16.5%. Lastly, our EPS increased 6% to $2.25 for the full year.","Turning to slide eight. Our Plumbing segment grew 3% in the quarter, excluding the impact of currency, driven by strong growth in North America. Foreign currency unfavorably impacted sales by approximately $9 million in the quarter.","North American sales increased 5% in local currency as we experienced improved demand from our wholesale, retail, dealer, and e-commerce customers. This growth was against an 8% comp in the fourth quarter of 2018. Growth was led by Delta as they achieved another record sales quarter through increased volumes across their product categories. Additionally, Watkins, our spa business continued to outperform by also achieving another record quarter with its innovative new products and industry-leading brands.","Our international sales in the fourth quarter decreased 1% in local currency, due to lower sales in Germany and Hansgrohe outpaced a difficult comp with sales growth of 7% in Germany in the fourth quarter of 2018. This was partially offset by strong growth in China. Operating profit in the quarter decreased $5 million due to higher variable costs, partially offset by incremental volume.","Turning to the full year 2019, sales increased 2% in local currency. This solid growth was driven by record years at Delta and Watkins. North American sales grew 2% in local currency, as a result of early and aggressive pricing actions taken to mitigate the impact of tariffs, offsetting lower volumes.","Our International Plumbing sales matched prior year in local currency as Hansgrohe\u2019s solid growth in Germany and China was offset by softness in other regions. Full year operating profit matched prior year, due to a favorable price cost relationship as we priced ahead of feeling the impact of tariff costs in certain instances, partially offset by higher spending, unfavorable currency translation and mix.","For 2020, we expect the Plumbing segment sales growth to be in the 2% to 4% range, excluding currency, principally due to our low growth expectations for the European Plumbing market. As a reminder, 35% of the Plumbing segment sales are outside of North America. We anticipate full year margins will be similar to 2019 as we experience the full impact of the List 3 and List 4 tariffs in 2020. We expect the tariff impact will be the greatest in the first half of the year and we anticipate operating margins will be down roughly 100 basis points in the first half of 2020 before recovering in the second half of the year. Also, given current exchange rates, we do not expect currency to materially impact our 2020 revenue.","Turning to slide nine, the Decorative Architectural segment declined 3% in the fourth quarter. This performance was driven by strong paint sales, which were more than offset by lower sales in our lighting business due to the loss of a portion of a private label business and inventory rebalancing with a key customer, which impacted volumes in the quarter by approximately $20 million.","Behr\u2019s solid mid-single-digit growth in Pro and low-single-digit growth in DIY products was aided by approximately $20 million of sales pull-forward from Q1 2020, similar to the pull-forward we experienced in the fourth quarter of 2018. Operating income declined due to lower volumes in lighting and an unfavorable price cost relationship, driven by the impact of tariff costs and higher incentives, partially offset by lower spending.","Turning to the full year 2019, sales grew 3%, driven by our pro paint initiative, as we achieved high-single-digit growth continue to grow share with the pro. Growth was also aided by the acquisition of Kichler in March of 2018. This performance was partially offset by lower volumes in our lighting and builders\u2019 hardware businesses, as a result of our disciplined pricing actions in 2019.","Full-year operating income decreased 1%, principally due to lower volumes and increased commodity costs, partially offset by selling price increases and lower spending. In 2020, we expect low-single-digit growth in DIY paint and mid-single-digit growth in pro paint. We also expect revenue in this segment will be impacted by the loss of a portion of our private label program and inventory rebalancing at a Kichler customer. The revenue impact of these items will be approximately $15 million each in Q1 and Q2, and approximately $5 million in Q3. This volume loss and the full-year impact of tariffs will depress operating segment -- segment operating margins by approximately 300 basis points in Q1, before recovering in the balance of the year. For full year 2020, we expect sales growth in the segment will be in the zero to 2% range, with operating margins between 17% and 17.5%.","And turning to slide 10. Our year-end balance sheet was strong with net debt to EBITDA at 1.7 times, and we ended the year with approximately $1.7 billion of balance sheet liquidity. Working capital as a percent of sales finished the year at 15.7%, an improvement of 10 basis points over prior year.","During 2019, we repurchased 7% of our outstanding shares for approximately $900 million and we increased our annual dividend by 13% to $0.54 per share. We took further action in 2019 to strengthen our balance sheet by reducing our debt by approximately $200 million. And we initiated the plan to terminate and annuitize our U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plans. We should complete this plan by the end of 2021. This will reduce our ongoing pension expense and contributions once completed. Lastly, we expect the sale of our Cabinetry business to close in February. And we expect net proceeds from the sale of approximately $645 million after taxes and expenses.","Going into 2020, our disciplined capital allocation strategy is unchanged. We will continue to prioritize investment in our businesses to drive organic growth. We will balance acquisitions with the right strategic fit in returns with share repurchases and we will maintain an appropriate dividend. Including the expected net proceeds from the sale of our Cabinetry business, we expect to deploy up to $1.2 billion for share repurchases in 2020, subject to market conditions. This activity would bring our expected 2020 average share count to between 265 million and 270 million shares. We generated $660 million of free cash flow in 2019 and we expect 100% free cash flow conversion rate in 2020.","Lastly, for the full year 2020, we expect annual revenue growth of 2% to 3% with operating margins of approximately 16%. And as Keith mentioned earlier, our 2020 EPS estimate is $2.35 to $2.55, which represents 9% EPS growth at the midpoint of the range.","With that, I\u2019ll now turn the call back over to Keith.","Keith Allman","Thank you, John.","2019 was a dynamic and transformational year for Masco. We mitigated significant tariff headwinds faced by our plumbing, lighting and hardware businesses. We continue to grow our plumbing segment with record sales at Delta, Hansgrohe, and Watkins. We continue to gain share and pro and DIY paint with our leading Behr brand. We simplified our portfolio with the divestitures of our Windows businesses and signed an agreement to sell our Cabinet business. And we continue to execute on our capital allocation strategy.","As we enter 2020, the fundamentals of our business in our core repair and remodel market are healthy. Consumers remain confident and wages are growing. Home price appreciation is increasing. Housing stock continues to age. Existing home sales have improved and household formations have steadily increased. With these favorable fundamentals and our continued focus on executing our strategy, coupled with our strong balance sheet and liquidity, we will continue to create shareholder value in 2020 and are well-positioned to deliver on our 2021 EPS target of $2.80 to $3 that we put forth at our Investor Day last September.","With that we\u2019ll now open the calls up for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Stephen Kim with Evercore ISI.","Stephen Kim","Yes. Thanks very much, guys, and appreciate all the detail here. I guess, first question really relates to the margin guidance that you\u2019ve given. I\u2019m curious first of all, when you look at the Kichler business, I guess within Dec Arc, can you give a sense for what kind of a margin impact you think this private label program being discontinued at your retail partner? What that is representing and how much you think some of the margin guidance you\u2019re looking for, particularly here in the first quarter is being driven by other impact to the margin?","John Sznewajs","Yes. Steve, good morning. It\u2019s John. I think, the margin impact from the loss of a private label business is relatively modest, because it is indeed a private label program. I think, the bigger impact on the margin in the segment is due to absorbing the full cost of the tariffs here in the first part of the year.","Stephen Kim","Thanks. And then, I guess, might as well stay on the Dec Arc segment and particularly Kichler, I\u2019m curious, as you look at that business, obviously there is a lot that\u2019s happened, the tariffs coming in shortly after the acquisition was an unfortunate event. And there\u2019s continuing to be issues in China due to the coronavirus, one can imagine affecting your supply chain. I\u2019m curious, I guess, number one, are you -- I don\u2019t believe you mentioned anything with the coronavirus, but if you could maybe talk about how that might be factoring into your outlook at all? And then, two, if you believe that there is any adjustment or has there been any adjustment in your improvement plan in Kichler, in light of what\u2019s happened as you\u2019ve watched things develop over the last three months, since the last time we spoke to you? Has there been any change in your strategic thinking around how to approach improving the results in that business, given the changing world?","Keith Allman","Stephen, this is Keith. I\u2019ll take that and will talk about the coronavirus first. When you think about the revenue that we have in China, it\u2019s about 3% of our revenue. So, I want to keep that in perspective. Obviously, China plays an important role in our supply chain. So, it\u2019s important to us and it represents about 3% of our revenue. As of now and it is a fluid situation without a doubt, we are not expecting a material impact on our performance from the coronavirus. It is a fluid situation, as I mentioned.","When you think about, first of all, in terms of our factories and where we stand, I guess, most importantly, none of our employees, as we know, sitting here this morning, have been infected by the virus, and we\u2019re very thankful for that. We\u2019ve instituted significance, precautions, travel restriction, hygiene guidelines, we\u2019ve eliminated gathering and meetings. We have a small manufacturing force that started -- about 15% of our biggest factory that started yesterday and will be ramping that up throughout the week. So that represents about a one week delay from what we had anticipated due to the Lunar New Year. So, not a significant delay, but definitely a slower ramp-up than we anticipated.","From a supply chain perspective, a very similar story with our biggest suppliers where they are ramping up, they\u2019re bringing people back from the countryside where they were out on Chinese New Year, and they\u2019re coming back. And there\u2019s a planful ramp-up. So, right now, as I\u2019ve talked to our biggest suppliers and to our own factories, we are cautiously optimistic, but it is a fluid situation.","In terms of the demand over there in China, again, that\u2019s 3% of our volume. And as you may know, a lot of the building products are sold through retail malls and small dealers. Most of those are still closed, and they will start to open up over the course of the next 10 days. Our sales teams are all working from home. We\u2019re reviewing the revenue and the orders as they come in. We\u2019ve reserved spots in terms of premium freight to help us maintain our delivery performance as we ship some of our products back -- to a large degree back to Germany. So, my point is, we\u2019re taking precautions. We\u2019re thankful that none of our employees have contracted the virus. It\u2019s a serious situation. We\u2019re taking it seriously. We have contingency plans developed. And at this point where we stand, we don\u2019t expect a material impact on our business.","With regards to Kichler, no question about it. Kichler has been growth challenge in 2019. I mean, the overall lighting industry was significantly impacted by the tariffs. And we were firm on our pricing, and we were aggressive, one of the first out in the industry in building products in terms of pricing for these tariffs. And we did suffer a loss of a portion of our private label business. And as John mentioned, there is a inventory rebalancing at one of our large customers that we expect to take place. And we\u2019ve outlined the impact across the quarter. So, certainly, the tariffs were not expected when we made this acquisition.","In terms of your direct question regarding if we\u2019ve changed our improvement approach. We really haven\u2019t. Certainly, there was a change as it relates to pricing for tariffs, but I\u2019ve already discussed that. But fundamentally, we had a work plan to drive what we thought would be improvements in our cost structure and our total cost productivity. We\u2019ve done that. We\u2019re ahead of that plan and we\u2019re going to continue to drive that and we expect to continue to outperform our plan, as it relates to productivity and cost.","With regards to the top-line, it\u2019s really about having the right products and the right commercial programs and relationship in the industry. And the Kichler brand is very strong, and we have in some cases 2 and 3 generations of customers that we continue to serve. And we\u2019re focused on new products. And we\u2019ve reinvigorated our new product development process. We just executed the launch in January and we\u2019re receiving very positive feedback on that. We\u2019ve looked at and we\u2019ve tweaked our dealer programs to simplify and incentivize our dealers. And our Kichler team is very focused on executing this plan. So, without a doubt, there were some volume challenges in 2019. They\u2019re going to continue through the first two quarters and then a little bit into the third quarter. And then as we exit 2020, we\u2019re going to be on solid footing to return this business to growth.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Bouley with Barclays.","Matthew Bouley","I wanted to follow up on the decorative side, just around that Q1 guidance for the 300 basis-point decline. It sounded like you\u2019re saying that that\u2019s largely reflective of the tariffs flowing through. And obviously, your full year guidance suggests that the margins will recover through the balance of the year. So, I guess, my question is more cadence-wise. Are you expecting kind of a steady improvement sequentially through the year, or is that margin improvement, kind of more waited to the end of the year as you anniversary those tariffs? Thank you.","John Sznewajs","Let me give you a little bit of color here. So, if you think about how the tariffs impacted us starting in 2019 and how they phased through our P&L through the course of the tail end of 2019 and going into 2020. We have about $60 million of incremental tariff costs impact to P&L in 2019. We expect another incremental $90 million to impact the P&L in 2020. And most of that $90 million should be in the first half the year. If you consider that $60 million started to flow through our P&L, kind of the middle of the third quarter and really hit us, the full effect hit us in the fourth quarter of 2020. So, we should experience the full impact in the first two quarters of the year. And then, it continued a little bit in the third quarter and this then should dissipate as we get into the fourth quarter of this year. So, we\u2019ve implemented the pricing to mitigate the full $150 million of tariffs. But, we\u2019re also continuing to work on margin recovery efforts through cost-out opportunities, supplier negotiations, and looking at other resourcing opportunities that we may have.","The one thing that I should point out is we might face a little bit of margin compression, because what we are experiencing is cost recovery on these tariffs. So, we don\u2019t have necessarily margin dropping to the bottom line. That said, we should expect to resume some margin expansion in the back half of the year, once the tariffs work their way through the P&L. So, hopefully, that\u2019s helpful to you.","Matthew Bouley","It is. Thank you for that. And then secondly, just kind of bigger picture around Kichler. Just hoping you could elaborate a bit around kind of a longer term growth plans? I mean, kind of how you envision this business positioned from a channel perspective, or what I guess needs to change that that you think would allow this business to kind of return to growth after you\u2019ve moved past some of these near term losses? Thank you.","Keith Allman","Similar answer to how I answered Stephen\u2019s question. I think there was specific events that occurred in this business as it relates to tariffs and some losses in private label business and inventory rebalancing by a significant customer. As those things, particularly the tariffs begin to -- the loss of the private label rather begins to flow out through the year, this business will be on solid footing to return to growth. In terms of the specific strategies, it\u2019s really about leveraging the strong brand and the deep channel relationships that we have in Kichler. And Kichler is one of the few businesses in this industry that have a broad presence across all channels. So, it is a multi-channel strategy for us. And fundamentally, at the root of that strategy is good products and great service. And we\u2019re working through different programs, as I highlighted earlier, in terms of new product launches and commercial programs to drive incentives and to align -- not unlike what we did, as we revamped several years ago when we were down at Delta and went through this process, to revamp our product development, shore up our assortment, and make sure that our incentives were aligned to the specific needs of the channel.","A little bit unique here in lighting is the movement to the e-commerce channel. And we have put in a leadership team, actually several players from Delta Faucet Company that were instrumental in driving our share leadership in e-business down to Kichler. We have a great team down there. And we\u2019re focused across all channels, e-business, landscape, retail and showrooms. So, it really is a multipronged approach. But at the core of it, it\u2019s commercial programs. I\u2019ve said it but I\u2019ll say it again, everything we do here at Masco is focused on productivity and cost productivity, and that will continue as Kichler as well. That\u2019s a component of the plan that we\u2019re outperforming and we intend to continue that.","So, as I mentioned on my earlier answer, no significant change to the strategy. There were some defined events that happened to this business and we\u2019re going to get through it. And at the end of the year, we\u2019re going to be on solid footing, and we\u2019re going to continue to grow.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Wood with Nomura Instinet.","Michael Wood","I wanted to see if you can elaborate a bit more on the incentives that you called out impacting paint profitability in the presentation. And what are you seeing in terms of consumer reaction to these incentives? And if you could just talk about, maybe what\u2019s changed in the industry in terms of how competitors are behaving with pricing incentives in paint? ","John Sznewajs","Mike, I think, there might be a slight misinterpretation. It\u2019s incentives between ourselves and our retail partners, it\u2019s not necessarily consumer-based incentives.","Michael Wood","Understand. So just to clarify that, you\u2019re saying that the actual price and incentives offered at the store have not necessarily changed. This is between you and large customers? ","John Sznewajs","That\u2019s correct. Yes. Largely due to volume rebates that we have with our major customers.","Michael Wood","Great. And in terms of the market share gains that we should expect going forward for the business overall, if I do just rough back of the envelope math for the end market assumptions overlaid to your business, I get a roughly 2% growth rate and you\u2019re calling for 2% to 3%. Is that the typical share gain that you\u2019d expect, or is there something kind of impacting that that\u2019s preventing it from being larger?","John Sznewajs","No. I mean, it\u2019s -- the share gains we\u2019re expecting -- as you recall, we\u2019ve got now a pro paint businesses that\u2019s now [technical difficulty] dollars. And so, it\u2019s harder as -- when you get to the law of large numbers, and it\u2019s harder to gain share off of that that base at the same rate that you are gaining share at when it was a much smaller business. But, we continue to invest behind that business. Our channel partner Home Depot continues to invest behind that business. We think we have established a very successful and winning model to attract the pro contractor into their stores and to buy paints. It\u2019s -- and to focus them on one of the highest ranked quality brands in the industry. So, between ourselves and Home Depot, we think we\u2019ve established a terrific business model here.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Dahl of RBC Capital Markets.","Michael Dahl","John, just a pick-up on the last question. If we think about the paint business, that pull forward into Q4, it looks like it was probably a couple of cents, and maybe that\u2019s borrowing from 2020 by the same amount and a point of top line in that segment I think. So, if you think about paint specifically, when you have DIY as a market flat; pro, low single to mid single flat, you\u2019ve got that 1 point headwind. Do you expect to perform in line then with the broader paint market, even with that comp headwind, or do you still think you can outperform that those overall numbers?","John Sznewajs","Yes, Mike. So, to react to your comments you have, one, I think your mouth is largely right on the pull forward and the bottom line impact. As we think about the growth in both DIY and pro, we do think we can outpace the market in both instances. We\u2019re still -- even though we\u2019re a $0.5 billion business now, we still have a relatively light market here and we still think there is further share to be gained in the pro. And as we look at our performance on the DIY portion of the business, again, because of our alignment with our channel partner at the Home Depot and the growth rates that they\u2019re experiencing and the folks they draw to their stores, we think we can outpace the DIY market growth as well in here in 2020.","Michael Dahl","Second question, also following up on another question earlier about the kind of price tariff margin impact. I think, you were answering a question in aggregate, including Plumbing and lighting, talking about that pace of margin, and kind of the recovery on tariffs. But just to clarify, is that also specifically true for Plumbing? And it looks like within Plumbing, second part of this is -- your second half margins have to be up year-on-year to get to that flat full year, if you\u2019re down 100. And so, is that incremental actions around price, supply chain, raw materials benefiting you, or is that just pure volume leverage to get you to that?","John Sznewajs","Yes, Mike. So, again, you\u2019re right. My prior comments were about the enterprise-wide and not specifically with respect to any single segment. As you break down the plumbing segment, you\u2019re right. Those are -- the margin expansion that we expect in the second half of the year is required given the margin headwinds in the first half of the year due to the impacts of the tariffs. What we expect in the back half of the year is that\u2019s largely volume-driven. We don\u2019t expect any further pricing actions or anything else incremental outside of volume to drive that margin expansion in the back half of the year?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Seldon Clarke with Deutsche Bank.","Seldon Clarke","Just continuing on the last question, how should we think about volume and price within your revenue guidance for plumbing and decorative?","John Sznewajs","So, if you think about volume -- I would consider most to be volume. As we indicated earlier, with the impact of the tariffs flowing through, we kind of laid out our top-line estimates. I expect modest pricing, very low impact at all on pricing, because of the pricing we put through on the tariffs back in 2019, early in 2019, I should say. And so, most of that is -- most of the growth that we have outlined for you today, both with the Decorative Architectural segment as well as the Plumbing segment and therefore the Company in total is volume-driven.","Seldon Clarke","And then, just kind of continuing on the 2021, you reiterated the expectation for $2.80 or $3 of earnings. But, I think you guided to something like a 16.8% underlying margin, which obviously implies another 80 basis points improvement on top of this year. What\u2019s like the right bridge to think about on how to get there? Is that still going to be volume-driven or are there some cost actions that you see down the line or pricing actions that you see down the line a little bit longer term?","Keith Allman","A couple of things that would be driving our 2021 performance. Firstly, we anticipate that the tariff headwinds are behind us. In terms of the overall market, when we think about R&R as we mentioned in the earlier remarks, we expect an acceleration through 2020. And we believe that will hold into 2021, based on improving fundamentals, increase in our supply and the strong consumer. So, with the tariffs behind us, the market improving and continued growth as we talked about in terms of market share gain and pro, DIY paint and our Plumbing business with that drop down together with our planned repurchase, share repurchases in 2021, that\u2019s what gives us confidence in that $2.80 to $3 range for 2021.","Seldon Clarke","Okay. So, is 16.8 still kind of the right number to think about, roughly?","Keith Allman","Yes, I think so.","Seldon Clarke","Okay. I appreciate the time. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line is Michael Rehaut with JP Morgan.","Michael Rehaut","Thanks. Good morning, everyone. First question I just had, I just wanted to break down the tariff impact. And I guess, John, you\u2019ve said earlier that you estimated there is about a $60 million impact in 2019 and incremental $90 million in 2020. I was just trying to get a sense for the offsetting actions to those headwinds through price, cost, specifically productivity, I think is -- if you want to throw that in there, if you feel that that was either supply chain or other things that you did specifically to offset. I\u2019m just trying to get a sense of the offsetting actions there to get to like a net headwind or such. How did you see that flow through in 2019, and how do you expect 2020 to shake out when you think of those offsetting actions?","Keith Allman","In round numbers, Mike, I\u2019d say, let\u2019s call it 90% of our mitigation actions were through price. So, that was the biggest lever that we pulled in 2019. So, that leaves about 10% in terms of the cost of the tariffs mitigated through supply chain resourcing, negotiations with suppliers and that sort of thing. We\u2019ll continue to do that. The majority of our movement out of China is our existing suppliers that have established production in other low cost countries and we\u2019ll be ramping that up, we\u2019ll be moving some to -- in some limited cases to some new suppliers. But, that\u2019s a longer term play for us. And it\u2019s going to take a while to do that. So fundamentally, when you think about the mitigation, it was mostly price. And we\u2019ve put that through aggressively and early in 2019, and hence now with the combination of the timing of the tariffs and when they hit and more importantly the flow of inventory through our system into the P&L. That\u2019s why we had that overhang and that $90 million headwind heading into 2020.","John Sznewajs","But, Mike, I guess, as we -- maybe to supplement Keith\u2019s comments here, as we exit 2020, we don\u2019t think there\u2019s going to be a net headwind. We think we\u2019ve got between the pricing actions and the supply chains actions that Keith mentioned, we think we\u2019ve got the impact of tariffs fully covered.","Michael Rehaut","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. Secondly, I just wanted to circle back to circle back Kichler for a moment. And apologies, I know you\u2019ve answered a bunch of questions. But, I\u2019m just trying to make sure I have some of the numbers right in how to think about the business as it is, by the end of this year. John, I think you said that private label and inventory rebalancing will each be $15 million in the first couple of quarters going to five in the third quarter. Was that right?","John Sznewajs","Maybe just to be clear. Collectively, the private label and inventory rebalancing will be $15 million in each of Q1 and Q2. So, total impact in the year, Mike of 35 from both of those actions.","Michael Rehaut","Okay. So, I was just trying to get a sense of, as the business has -- and I assume you had maybe a $15 million hit in 4Q. So, you\u2019re talking somewhere in the range of 50 to 100 -- 50 to maybe 75, depending on how things traversed in 2019, of a hit to revenue from your original purchase. You\u2019ve also talked a lot about the different types of cost actions that you\u2019ve done to improve the business. I was just trying to get a sense of -- with all the moving pieces, how you would characterize the margins today or by the end of 2020 rather I think it\u2019s more importantly, for that business relative to where you purchased it? Are you kind of in line, still a little bit behind or even ahead, given some of the company-specific actions and how you think about any potential further improvement in 2021? ","John Sznewajs","Yes, Mike. So, with respect to the margins, we don\u2019t break out margins by individual company. I can appreciate the question. As Keith mentioned in his comments a couple minutes ago, we continue to work and successfully work on supply chain and cost-out initiatives at Kichler. Clearly, the volume has been a little bit more of a headwind than we would have anticipated when we bought the company. But that\u2019s about as much as we can say on that topic.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Lovallo with Bank of America.","John Lovallo","Just sticking with lighting here. And I don\u2019t mean to beat a dead horse. But, just from a broader industry perspective, I\u2019m just curious, there\u2019s been a number of headwinds obviously, and you guys have handled them fairly well. The question is, though, is there any concern that there\u2019s something structurally changing in the lighting industry similar to maybe what we\u2019re seeing in cabinets and flooring as it pertains to consumer preference that is creating a headwind here?","Keith Allman","No, we don\u2019t view it as a structural change. If there was anything that would be approaching a structural change, it would be the shift to e-commerce. But that\u2019s -- we\u2019re seeing that honestly pretty broadly across a number of our product categories. So, no, it\u2019s not a -- we don\u2019t view it as a structural hit. It was definitely a significant change. When you talk about an industry that\u2019s by and large imported from China, we have the kind of tariffs that we had come into there. So it\u2019s -- that\u2019s more of a onetime event as it relates to the change, versus a structure.","There\u2019s -- it\u2019s a significant component of the remodel process. And it continues to be that. It certainly is a design cue, it\u2019s very design-forward. What it takes to win in this industry, as it relates to consumer intimacy and understanding design trends and having a product -- a new product introduction, process that\u2019s solid, those things haven\u2019t changed. So, we know how to compete in this industry. And the change really has been that that tariffs that came in, and we\u2019re going to put that behind us throughout the course of 2020. And then, we\u2019re going to return to a growth rate.","John Lovallo","Okay. Thanks, Keith. And then, John, just on the SG&A front for $310 million in the quarter, that was up fairly meaningfully dollar basis and also as a percentage of sales. Can you just help us understand maybe some of the key drivers under that, please?","John Sznewajs","Yes. Sure, John. As you may recall, last fourth quarter is actually one of the lightest quarters we had in SG&A in a long time. So, maybe it\u2019s more of a low SG&A comp that we are up against. The one thing that you may recall that we called out in the fourth quarter call last year as we did have a $4 million gain on a sale of a building, which did not occur, which would be a headwind against that comp. But, I think it was more just extremely tight or low SG&A last year on kind of a one-off basis as opposed to anything else.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Justin Speer with Zelman & Associates.","Justin Speer","I just wanted to unpack some of your more margin forecasts. You mentioned the 300 basis-point headwind in the first quarter being more -- out of the Decorative Architectural segment being more tariff affected. But then, I\u2019m trying to reconcile that with the fact that you obtained price. Are you just saying that it\u2019s volume deleverage or is there something else, is there a lag in your pricing relative to the cost rolling through? Can you help me understand that? And then also, on top of that, just any tailwind from lower raw material costs across your business, or lower -- and even transport costs, any other factors that are offsets that we need to be aware of?","John Sznewajs","Yes. So just -- a couple of questions in there. Let me try to address those. So, in terms of the margin degradation from the fourth quarter to Q1, there\u2019s a couple of things going on there. One is lower volumes, right? We referenced the fact that we lost a portion on private label program. Also with the pull forward in paint, that $20 million obviously comes out a little bit, that should indicate we have lower volumes in Q1. We\u2019re anticipating lower volumes, I guess, I should say in Q1 in a Decorative Architectural segment, that would help drive that operating profit margin lower.","In terms of raw material costs, -- the third thing I should say is, on the margin side is the tariffs, because it\u2019s cost recovery, that will drive margins lower as well. On the offset side, obviously, we always work on cost productivity. In terms of commodity costs, specifically, the input costs to paint have moderated here in the -- since a year ago. But recall, the way things work with particularly with our paint business is that, -- we tend to be price cost neutral over time. And so, may have -- that would impact margins. So, it is really -- as prices moderate, input costs moderate, there may be some impact on pricing as well. So, I think that puts it all together. Did I hit all your questions?","Justin Speer","Well, I guess, I\u2019m just trying to understand because I know there\u2019s a lot of unevenness with the paint, because last year,, I guess in the first quarter of 2019, your comps were down 7%. I know some of that was Kichler. But that was because you had pull forward the prior year. So, I would have thought that those would have kind of evened out, such that you wouldn\u2019t have as much of an impact there from the coding side, and obviously of the Kichler business. But, I\u2019m just trying to reconcile your comment that it\u2019s mostly tariffs that are hitting you. Is it -- it\u2019s not the tariff cost that you\u2019re trying to get price and you\u2019ve lost share as a result of that or losing business, and that\u2019s affecting your margin profile in the Decorative Architectural segment?","John Sznewajs","I don\u2019t know if you -- maybe I didn\u2019t communicate right. But I think, if you go into Q1, I\u2019d say there is going to be lost volume, we talked about the lost programs. And so, that\u2019s going to be the main contributor to the margin degradation, followed by the tariff impact. Of the two, volume is a much greater impact than the tariffs on the margins in Q1.","Justin Speer","That makes sense. And then, lastly for me is just who you\u2019re losing share to in the lighting businesses? Is there perhaps another player that doesn\u2019t source from China that\u2019s advantaged post tariffs? Because I was under the impression that everyone was kind of in the same sandbox, so to speak, in terms of the supply chain, or is it something else?","Keith Allman","I think, the industry is down. I think, the impact of the tariffs industry-wide has been in effect. We\u2019re not -- we haven\u2019t really identified any single competitor that\u2019s particularly taking more share than another one, across the board.","Justin Speer","Thank you, guys.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Keith Hughes with SunTrust.","Keith Hughes","Thank you. Can you give us, in 2019, what was North American Plumbing growth?","John Sznewajs","North American Plumbing growth was 2%, I think for the full year, Keith?","Keith Hughes","Is that all volume or is there pricing in there?","John Sznewajs","There was a little bit of pricing in there. Yes. I mean, if you consider the tariffs, actually a fair amount of pricing in there. We put in place to offset the tariff impact, Keith, probably in Q1 and Q2 of last year. ","Keith Hughes","Okay. And so, you\u2019re not expecting -- and I think you said this earlier, you\u2019re not expecting any price in this Plumbing guidance that you\u2019ve given us for -- again, let me ask this way, in North America, you don\u2019t expect any price coming in, in 2020 in plumbing?","John Sznewajs","Not much. Keith, there might be a little bit of it we put in, but not a ton. No.","Keith Hughes","Okay. That\u2019s all. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Phil Ng with Jefferies. ","Phil Ng","Hey, guys. Can you give us a sense how we should think about the pace of buybacks as you lay that in, in 2020? And then, any update on the M&A pipeline?","John Sznewajs","In terms of -- I\u2019ll take the share repurchase question, Phil, and I\u2019ll let Keith talk about the M&A pipeline. In terms of the way we\u2019re thinking about it is, I think we mentioned, we\u2019ll probably do a large portion, maybe a good chunk of the proceeds that we get from the Cabinetry transaction, surely after the proceeds are received, so. And then, through the balance of the year, we look to deploy the balance of the $500 million to $600 million that we discussed. That will probably be more opportunistic, depending on how the market plays out. In terms of M&A pipeline, Keith, why don\u2019t you take that?","Keith Allman","Phil, our pipeline remains solid. We continue to drive it. Overall, I would say that the M&A activity was a little bit slower in \u201819 than I expected with the global trade uncertainty and some of the business valuations being in flux because of that. But it seems to pick up -- have picked up lately. We like some of the things that we\u2019re looking at. Most of them are fairly small. I would say that seller expectations still remain high. So, we\u2019re going to be patient. But, solid pipeline.","Phil Ng","Got it. And just one last one for me. On the lighting stuff, I mean, obviously, there\u2019s some tariff dynamic and share loss. As we think about 2021, when you work through some of these issues, and you got -- as Keith mentioned you expect to return to growth. Should we expect margins in that segment, Decorative, to kind of get back to that 18% to 19% range?","Keith Allman","Well, we\u2019re going to continue with that growth. We have a good drop down on that incremental volume. We\u2019ll continue to drive that. So, I would expect that margins would be improving as we compare \u201820 to \u201821. ","Phil Ng","Okay.","John Sznewajs","Phil, you may recall, we laid out 17.5% to 18% margins in that segment per our Investor Day in September. And we -- our thought process around that has not changed since September.","Operator","Our final question will come from the line of Truman Patterson with Wells Fargo.","Truman Patterson","First, I wanted to touch on the coronavirus again. Could you dig into that a little bit more? What portion of Plumbing Products have component piece sourced from China? And Keith, I believe you mentioned contingency plans as well. Just trying to understand what\u2019s going on there. And it does seem like it\u2019s intensifying. Could you discuss your current inventory balances and maybe an update of your supply chain, if plans actually remain shut for another week or two? Will that actually impact the product that you can get on shelves?","Keith Allman","Our factories are coming up to speed. Really, that represents about a week of delay over what would normally be -- have been a delay related to the Chinese New Year. So, they\u2019re coming up. They\u2019re coming up a little bit slower than what they would normally. We have about 15% of our workforce in our biggest plant, for example. And that\u2019s going to be coming into the course of the next week, week and a half.","As I said earlier from a volume perspective, a lot of the retail home improvement malls and dealers remain close and they\u2019ll be opening. Anticipated -- again, there\u2019s a lot in flux here. But there\u2019ll be a happening over the course of the next week or two. So, with China representing 3% of our revenue, as I said in an earlier answer on the Q&A session here, we\u2019re not anticipating it to have a material impact on us.","In terms of contingencies, as I said, we\u2019re looking at premium freight to help us with some of the delivery so that we can maintain our outstanding fill rate and lead time proposition to the customers. And we\u2019re continuing to keep an eye on it. We\u2019re most keenly paying attention to the help our employees, and we\u2019ve got different procedures and policies to make sure that we\u2019re paying attention to that first and foremost. It\u2019s a fluid situation we\u2019re watching closely. And as I said, we\u2019re not anticipating it to have a material impact on our results, at this time.","Truman Patterson","Okay. Thanks for that. And then, on R&R side pretty slow in 2019. It looks like your guidance has R&R picking up a little here. Are you actually seeing activity start to recover early in 2020? And if so, do you think weather has had any impact on that? I\u2019m just trying to understand how sustainable any kind of near-term green shoots are.","Keith Allman","I think, the weather has been pretty good, all things considered and what it could have been. We\u2019re calling R&R at that 3% to 4% growth range and we see it accelerating towards the back half. When we\u2019re looking at the numbers in the economic indicators that we look at, generally there\u2019s lag from those numbers to R&R. So, we feel confident in that 3% to 4% R&R with acceleration in the back half.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude today\u2019s conference call. Thank you all for joining.

Welcome to the Masco Corporation Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2012 Conference Call. My name is Brent, and I will be your operator for today's call. As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded for replay purposes. [Operator Instructions]","I will now turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Maria Duey. Maria, you may begin.","Maria Duey","Thank you, Brent, and good morning to everyone. Welcome to Masco Corporation's Fourth Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me on our call today are Tim Wadhams, President and CEO of Masco; and John Sznewajs, Masco's Vice President, Treasurer and Chief Financial Officer.","Our fourth quarter earnings release and the presentation slides that we will refer to during the call are available on the Investor Relations portion of our website. Following our prepared remarks, the call will be open for analyst questions. [Operator Instructions]","I'd like to remind you that statements in today's presentation will include our views about Masco's future performance, which constitute forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. We've described these risks and uncertainties in our risk factors and other disclosures in our Form 10-K and our Form 10-Q that we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","Today's presentation also includes non-GAAP financial measures. We've provided a reconciliation of these adjusted measurements to GAAP on our website at www.masco.com.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Tim Wadhams. Tim?","Timothy Wadhams","Thank you, Maria, and thank all of you for joining us today for Masco's Fourth Quarter 2012 Earnings Call. And if you would please move to Slide #4. We're pleased with our fourth quarter results, which wrapped up a relatively solid 2012 for Masco. Our fourth quarter sales were up 9%, 12% in North America, and we go into 2013 with a fair amount of momentum. To that point, our January sales were up low double digits on a consolidated basis.","While general economic conditions in both North America and Europe were challenging and bigger ticket remodel activity continued to be slow, our top line benefited from new home construction activity, with housing starts up approximately 28%, and our top line also benefited from new product introductions in several of our product categories. As it relates to our bottom line, we benefited from operating leverage, good execution on pricing and profit improvements to expand our margins. In addition to improving the math related to our financial results, we also accomplished each of the priorities we identified at the beginning of 2012, which are included on Slide #5.","In essence, we delivered on what we said we were going to do at the beginning of the year. We'll touch on each of these items as we work our way through the presentation. They represent areas of emphasis in support of our strategic initiatives, which are included on Slide #6.","We communicated these strategic initiatives to the investment community at the beginning of the year, and they include expanding our market leadership positions. In that regard, we felt like we made a lot of progress in 2012. We had a lot of new product and program introductions in Plumbing, paint and decorative hardware. In the fourth quarter, our sales to key retail customers were up low double digits. For the full year, our sales to key retail customers were up mid-single digits.","We also did a nice job in the Installation segment with adjacencies and retrofit and commercial, a couple of areas we entered a couple of years ago during the downturn. Our window businesses in both North America and the United Kingdom continue to take share. Our vitality index for 2012 exceeded 30%, and that's the percentage of our products that were introduced in the last 3 years, manufactured products to our total sales. So a very healthy outcome there.","In addition to expanding our market leadership positions, another strategy that we focused on is our cost structure. We had a good outcome there. John will talk about that a little later on. We did exceed the targets we set early this year. We continue to benefit from restructuring activities, actions that we've taken over the course of the last couple of years and our continued emphasis on supply chain and lean initiatives.","We also had made progress with our balance sheet. We had a net debt reduction. We ended the year with solid liquidity and good borrowing capacity. Our fourth strategic initiative is improving the performance of our Installation- and Cabinet-related segments, and we had a pretty good outcome there in terms of full year performance. On a combined basis in aggregate, those businesses improved $85 million in terms of year-over-year comparison, and that's $85 million of loss reductions. We did get some help from the marketplace. Obviously, both of these segments are impacted by new home construction, but we also had good execution. Our Installation business was profitable in the fourth quarter. Now you might remember we just missed breakeven in the third quarter. We were profitable in the fourth quarter.","As it relates to cabs, and if you would please flip to Slide #7, we still got some work to do as it relates to our Cabinet-related segment. Our focus, first and foremost, is to get back to profitability. As it relates to the Cabinet segment in total, we announced the planned disposition of our Danish subsidiary in our press release.","As it relates to our North American business, on Slide 7, we're very pleased with the new team. We've made some good progress over the course of the second half of the year as we've discussed previously. That team has been in place now for about 6 months, 7 months. We gave them a clean sheet of paper in terms of assessing the situation. They've taken a very systematic approach starting with our customers by channel, really listening to the voice of the customer, and we've gotten a lot of very constructive feedback.","To that point, we have set up dealer consuls to ensure that we can get the continued dialogue and input from our customers, and we used a lot of that information to really energize our sales force in a all-hands meeting earlier this year. We came out of that sales meeting with a lot of enthusiasm and a lot of energy. Input from our customers and channel partners will help form our channel strategies as we move forward. Those strategies may include pricing actions, promotions and product introductions. All of which will be focused on leading us to profitable growth.","We also continue to look at our cost structure, and we've already taken several recent actions that will drive improved performance. That includes a couple of plant closures, as well as a headcount reduction.","If you please flip to Slide #8, we'll turn the presentation over to John Sznewajs, our CFO. John's going to walk us through our operating performance by segment.","John G. Sznewajs","Thank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. If you just please flip to Slide 9. As Tim mentioned, we exited 2012 with a lot of momentum. Sales in the fourth quarter increased 9%, as we experienced strong double-digit sales growth in our Installation, Plumbing and Decorative Architectural segments and our North American Cabinet business. Now one item to note, the information included in the slides includes the results from our Danish RTA business. We expect to restate our financials to exclude this business at the end of the first quarter.","The overall sales in North America were up 12%. Revenue increased in all channels of distribution with the strongest gains driven by our businesses selling into the new home construction market, which were up more than 25%. As Tim mentioned, sales to key retailers were up low double digits in the quarter, and we realized selling price increases.","International sales increased 2% in local currency in the quarter. That's a great outcome considering a challenging European market. Excluding our Danish RTA business, international sales increased 8% in local currency in the quarter.","Adjusted gross margins expanded nicely by approximately 310 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of last year to 25% due to improvement in every segment. We are also pleased with our bottom line performance, as adjusted operating income increased nearly 250% in the quarter to $94 million, with an adjusted operating margin of 5%, the strongest fourth quarter we have reported in several years. Our adjusted EPS was $0.04, an improvement of $0.13 versus a loss of $0.09 in the fourth quarter of last year.","If you turn to Slide 10, we can see the components of our operating income improvement in the fourth quarter. Net price\/commodity improved approximately $37 million in the quarter, largely driven by our Cabinet, Plumbing and Decorative Architectural segments. This $37 million reflects the year-over-year impact of our metals hedge, which was approximately $5 million negative in the quarter. The $32 million increase in net volume\/mix was principally driven by the strong volume increases we experienced across all of our segments. This was, partially offset by an expected negative mix impact of approximately $10 million in our Plumbing segment. As we have mentioned in the past, this is largely related to Hansgrohe in their successful penetration into new international markets.","We recaptured $52 million of profit improvements gross in the quarter, exceeding our expectations, and these were realized in all our businesses. These improvements were offset by higher employee-related expenses, including equity-based compensation given the increase in our share price and the incremental program costs related to new product introductions as we continued to invest to grow our company. We are pleased with our full year profit improvement initiatives gross totaling $195 million, exceeding our prior year -- our prior estimate for the full year by $20 million.","If you turn to Slide 11, you see that our Plumbing segment sales increased 10% in the quarter. North American Plumbing sales were up 12%. The strong momentum that we've been experiencing in North America continued in Q4, as several of our most important brands, including Delta, Peerless and Brizo saw sales in the quarter increase nearly 20%, aided by faucet and toilet program load-ins in the retail channel, as they continue to gain share to new product introductions. As we mentioned last quarter, the recent launch of our Delta-branded toilet program is exceeding all preliminary estimates, as these terrific new products gain traction in the market.","European sales in the segment increased 6% but more impressively, increased 9% in local currency for the quarter despite a very difficult economic environment. I should point out that our Hansgrohe unit enjoyed record sales in 2012. Operating profit increased 29% driven by increased volume and a favorable price\/commodity relationship and was negatively impacted by the mix of $10 million, the commodity hedge of $5 million and foreign currency of $2 million in the quarter.","Turning to Slide 12, you can see that revenue in our Decorative Architectural segment grew $38 million or 11% in the quarter driven by strong sales of Behr's Premium Plus Ultra products, our Paint & Primer in One products, significantly improved sales performance at Liberty Hardware, sales gains at Home Depot with Behr's Pro Paint business and Behr's product placement in Home Depot's Mexico stores, along with selling price increases. The new formulations Behr introduced earlier this year are performing well, exceeding all expectations.","Operating margin expansion in the quarter is aided by a relatively easy comparison to the fourth quarter of 2011. You may recall last year's fourth quarter was negatively impacted by, at that time, record-high input costs for paint, Behr's additional advertising spend to drive foot traffic at Home Depot and program costs at Liberty Hardware as they won several programs with major retailers. Without these headwinds, Q4 operating margins reflect the benefits of significantly improved operating performance at Liberty Hardware where they went from a loss in the fourth quarter of last year to a profit in 2012. Behr's new program win in Mexico, in the present, a stabilizing commodity basket for paint, with TiO2 prices coming down and propylene prices up by about 30% in the quarter. Looking at this segment's full year adjusted operating profit of $46 million, our Liberty Hardware unit represents approximately 40% of that $46 million improvement as they returned to profitability in 2012.","Turning to Slide 13, we can see that the environment for Cabinetry remains challenging. This said, we saw improved performance with segment sales increasing 1%. Our European sales decreased 21% in local currencies and 23% in U.S. dollars. Excluding our Danish RTA business, segment sales were up 11%.","North American Cabinet sales increased an impressive 13% in the quarter, reflecting strong direct-to-builder sales growth in the high-20% range, home center sales growth of the low -- in low-teens percentages and low-single-digit sales growth in the dealer channel. This was supplemented with solid countertop sales.","Recently, we have seen a decline in promotional activity in both the big-box and dealer channels. We're experiencing favorable results from these actions, which we attribute to increased demand and discipline within the industry.","We improved our operating loss in the quarter by $12 million and in the full year 2012 by $32 million, in line with our full year profit improvement estimate for the segment. We realized $14 million of profit improvement gross in the quarter driven by principally in North America through our current year initiatives, as well as benefits realized from prior year restructuring activities. These benefits were partially offset by other inflation and the loss of leverage as a result of declining volumes in our European businesses.","And as Tim mentioned, we are very pleased with the new North American Cabinet management team. The strength of their turnaround plan is apparent in the segment's fourth quarter results, and we expect continued progress in 2013. Since the management change in July, the new team has taken action to address capacity and improve profitability. These changes aggregate $25 million of annual profit improvement and coupled with the disposition of our Danish RTA business, should improve the segment's 2013 operating profit by approximately $55 million.","Now turning to Slide 14, you can see our Installation segment. We are very pleased with the continued improvement in both the top and bottom line performance of this segment. As Tim mentioned, we turned a profit in this segment in the quarter, something we have not done since the fourth quarter of 2008 when segment sales were more than $40 million higher and annual housing starts exceeded 900,000 units.","We expanded our market leadership position, as segment sales grew 13% and were fueled by higher sales volume in our residential new construction and commercial channels. We continue to focus on increasing our Installation sales across all lines of business, and we are well positioned to grow with the big builders, particularly D.R. Horton, Lennar, Pulte and KB. We also recently entered into a strategic alliance agreement with Toll Brothers.","Residential new construction contracting sales increased nearly 30% in the quarter. In addition to solid top line performance, management's strong execution delivered significantly improved bottom line results, with adjusted operating profit improving by $12 million and operating margins expanding by 400 basis points. This segment exhibited strong operating leverage in the quarter delivering nearly 32% incremental margins resulting from increased fixed-cost leverage, cost control and the benefits from our prior profit improvement actions.","Turning to Slide 15, you can see that our Other Specialty Products segment sales increased 6% in the quarter. Excluding the exit of select U.S. window markets, North American window sales increased high-teens percentages in the fourth quarter due to increased sales in both the new home construction and replacement window markets and new product introductions.","We are particularly pleased that our replacement window sales increased mid-teens percentages, reflecting share gains driven by new products despite what we believe is a replacement window market in the Western U.S. that was essentially flat in the quarter. And sales of our U.K. windows increased low single digits in local currency the quarter aided by strength in both the new construction and retail channels. Segment adjusted operating profit improved by $7 million, and adjusted operating margins expanded 460 basis points, benefiting primarily from the rationalization activities undertaken in our U.S. window business in the third quarter and fourth quarter of last year and reduced promotional spend.","Turning to Slide 16, you can see that we continue to work on strengthening our balance sheet. During the course of 2012, we ended with a net debt reduction of $400 million in the year, continued a strong working capital execution by delivering working capital as a percent of sales at approximately 12.1%, and you can see that we ended the year with approximately $1.4 billion of cash on the balance sheet.","With that, I'll turn it over to -- turn the call back over to Tim Wadhams.","Timothy Wadhams","Thanks, John, and a couple of comments before we go to the question-and-answer session. If you would please flip to Slide #18. As I mentioned, we're pleased with our 2012 results in a variety of areas, and we certainly want to thank and recognize our employees worldwide for their continued dedication and contribution. Made a big, big difference last year. While we expect general economic conditions in North America to continue to improve modestly, we are concerned that declines in disposable income may slow consumer spending. Having said that, we expect big ticket remodel activity to remain relatively slow in North America. In addition, we expect general economic conditions in Europe to continue to be somewhat uncertain. However, we're very pleased with the fact that in both 2012 and 2011, our international businesses, in terms of top line, were up in local currencies. Having 3 businesses in the United Kingdom and Hansgrohe's global expansion has been a major plus for us in that regard. And I'd like to join John in recognizing Hansgrohe. They had the record year in 2012, a great accomplishment in a very tough environment, and we're certainly very proud of the Hansgrohe team. We expect to continue to benefit from increased activity in new home construction. Starts are projected to be up 20% to 25% in 2013. We also expect to continue to benefit from new product introductions that have recently been launched.","We closed 2012 on a strong note, with fourth quarter sales up 9%, sales in North America up 12%. And as I mentioned at the start of the call, we're off to a good start in 2013. January sales are up low double digits.","Our priorities for 2013, on Slide 19, support our strategic initiatives, and again, those strategic initiatives include expanding our market leadership positions, continuing to improve our cost structure, driving our Cabinet and Installation segments to profitability and enhancing our balance sheet and liquidity. Our priorities for 2013 are very similar to the areas we emphasized for 2012 and that's by design. We'll continue to focus on the things that we can control to proactively drive our performance, and we'll hold ourselves accountable to deliver on those priorities in 2013.","And with that, we'll open up the lines for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of George Staphos with Merrill Lynch.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I had 2 questions. First of all, would you be able to either qualitatively or perhaps more precisely discuss the level of program costs and growth initiative spending you expect in '13 relative to 2012 and how might that vary within the segments? And then I had a follow-on.","John G. Sznewajs","George, we expect that the program -- kind of the program costs to be about flat for the year. There will be some puts and takes depending on the segment in 2013. I think we'll be down a little bit in our paint segment. We launched some new products last year that had some program costs associated with it, and also Liberty Hardware had some program costs. We also incurred some program costs in Plumbing in 2013 as we launched a significant number of new products. So those were probably the areas we were at a high watermark last year, probably come off it a little bit in 2013 in those 2 segments.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. The related question, there was some progress on SG&A, the sales in the quarter on a year-on-year basis. I know you're pleased with the cost reduction progress you had during the year. Having said that, the ratio is still relatively high as compared to other companies that we look at. Can you give us some discrete goals or steps you expect to see in 2013 whereby you might be able to reduce that SGA-to-sales ratio?","John G. Sznewajs","Yes, George, thanks. You're right. We did make some progress in the year and in the quarter on this. I think, generally, the way that we would look at this is as we increase our revenues over the course of 2013 and beyond, we would expect to get some operating leverage as a result of those increased sales. So at the -- couple of years ago before the downturn, we were kind of running at the 16%, 17% sales SG&A as a percent of sales. We definitely think we can get back in that direction, as our sales volume increase over the course of the next several years.","Timothy Wadhams","Yes, George, I would add one element there. As we've mentioned a couple of times in the past, we have, in the Behr sales force, for example, 450 people who helped service The Home Depot stores from a paint perspective. We also have a retail sales service support group that works with Lowe's. Those are fixed costs for us that don't really vary very much based on top line volumes, so I think John's point about leverage as things continue to pick up is certainly accurate.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Rehaut with JPMorgan.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","First question on new products, really been a focus for you guys, and I was hoping if you could give any granularity in terms of 2013 in terms of your views on incremental contribution either by segment or overall and perhaps able to give us a sense of what the new products contributed to sales in 2012.","John G. Sznewajs","In terms of new products as going forward, Mike, in 2013, we really didn't just launch the, an example, in the Plumbing segment, we launched the toilet program and the foundations program in late third quarter, early fourth quarter of last year. And so we expect to see the waterfall effect of that hit the financial statements in 2013. In addition to that, we won a number of other programs in some other segments as well. We've got some product launches taking place in our Cabinet area in the first quarter of this year and potentially, some later in the year in Cabinetry. Clearly, those will take a little bit more longer to digest. When we launch Cabinets, a new -- Cabinet products for instance, they don't necessarily have an immediate impact on the top line. It takes several quarters before those really begin to feel the effects of those. So I would say that to your point, we've been investing heavily in new products over the course of the last several years and throughout the downturn, and we expect that we would continue to do that. So I would think that our vitality index that Tim referenced on the call, just north of 30%, will be consistent in 2013.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. Also, I had a question about some of the movement around either restructuring in the Danish Cabinets unit. You also highlighted the solid profit improvement in Liberty Hardware. So when you think about maybe some of the lagging units that you have in the portfolio, you've taken a couple of actions, one, fixing; one, disposing. But if there's -- if you look across the different segments that you operate, the 5 major segments, if you've identified any other areas where either you feel that maybe it's non-core or that there's a fix that you're putting your arms around where -- perhaps you can -- if you don't want to necessarily identify it by actual segment for competitive purposes or market purposes, give us a sense of the amount of dollars that represents. And over what time period perhaps some of those either lagging units or non-core units might be addressed.","Timothy Wadhams","Yes, Mike, this is -- thanks for the question, Mike. This is Tim. Yes, I would say that as we look at the portfolio today, the only business that we have that is in a -- what we would describe as an underperformance kind of situation, would be in the Cabinet segment. We've got 2 businesses there. Obviously North America, we've talked a little bit about our plans to improve that. We also have a business in the United Kingdom in Cabinets, which is Moores, a relatively small business, roughly USD 70 million, USD 80 million on the top line. They continue to be in loss position, but we have seen some signs of progress there in terms of market share gains, particularly as it relates to public building. So those would be the 2 areas that would be problematic at this point in time. The rest of our businesses, obviously, would range in terms of returns and profitability, but those would be the 2 that are getting the most attention from a turnaround standpoint.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dan Oppenheim with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Daniel Oppenheim - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I was wondering if you can talk a little bit more in terms of just the overall Cabinet strategy where you talked about promotions but also the expectation that big ticket remains slow. So as you've thought about the strategy overall, think that -- how would you describe the promotional activity, the strategy with that? Is it sort of more targeted, more focused? And as you think about that in terms of leading to more profitability in Cabinets, can you just talk a little bit more about how you're viewing that?","Timothy Wadhams","Thanks, Dan. Yes, in Cabinets, we have seen a bit more discipline as it relates to promotional activity, and I think there's a couple of drivers there. We -- and others have taken some actions. For example, what we've done is really moved to an allowance for the ultimate end consumer, which gives them a little bit more flexibility as to how they might apply that in terms of their experience and their process. And the other thing that I think has added a little bit of discipline to the process is that demand has seemed to be increased a little bit, so there's a little bit more traffic at this point in time. We have always contended that the promotional activity would probably abate a bit as demand started to pick up, and so I think there's a couple of factors at play there. In terms of our view of bigger ticket remodel, our sense is that, that's going to continue to be slow for a period of time. And I don't really see a catalyst for the bigger ticket remodel side at this point. We think there's a lot of pent-up demand there. A lot of the survey work that we've done suggest that people are willing and desirous to take on a bigger project. Credit is still somewhat challenging. Obviously, with some of the changes that took place earlier this year, disposable income is down. So our sense is it's probably going to take a little while longer for us to get major traction with some of the bigger ticket remodel activity. But as I say, we think there's pent-up demand there, and that should be a plus for the industry going forward.","Daniel Oppenheim - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And I guess, in terms of the Installation, you've talked about the mix shift, how that hurt in terms of a little less activity in the multi-family side. On the single-family side, is that continuing to rebound here and sort of regaining share here? Do you think about doing more in terms of -- you've talked about -- do you think there's an opportunity now where you'll do slightly more but strategically focused to get a few more products in as you have historically, as we see more of the rebound in that -- in single family?","John G. Sznewajs","Yes, Dan, this is John. I'll take this one. As it relates to your question, while we do more products in single family, I think we're going to be fairly disciplined in our approach. We are now focusing on 5 core products that we install, Installation obviously being the lead with gutters, after paint, garage doors, fireplaces being the others. And so I don't think you should expect to anticipate us to expand that product offering in the near future. One of the things I should probably point out, you mentioned multi-family as part of your question. We are continuing to see an extended lag, particularly the multi-family side of things. It's -- in speaking with the folks in the field recently, it looks as though we are today insulating -- and this not anecdotal but actually more consistent than anecdotal. We are insulating today multi-family starts. They were counted as starts in the second quarter of last year, so you can see that now the effect of the lag on us and our business in that segment.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bob Wetenhall with RBC.","Robert C. Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I just wanted to understand -- could you talk about your incremental margin performance? It was 51% before general corporate expenses and 44%. Given the increased velocity in the housing market, are you expecting incrementals to sustain at current levels or expand as we move through the year?","John G. Sznewajs","Bob, we've always said that the incremental margins for the business generally run around 30%, a little bit more than that for our manufacturing businesses and a little bit less than that for our Installations business. And we have experienced for the first couple of quarters coming off the bottom incremental margins higher than that, and that's probably due to the fact that we've taken so much fixed cost out of the system. We still estimate that it's kind of in the neighborhood of about $580 million or so of fixed costs that we've taken out. And so we can see the operating leverage on the business. That said, as the economy matures and we get into more mid-cycle environment, I would expect that we migrate back to those 30% incremental margins.","Timothy Wadhams","Yes. The other thing, Bob, that I think is probably important to note is that we have had some positive impact the last couple of quarters with price\/commodity. And generally over time, as we've indicated, that would tend to kind of balance out. As you know, last couple of years, we've been negative in that regard. We're still behind as we look at the last couple of years, but that does contribute a little bit to that incremental margin in 2012.","Robert C. Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Got it. That's helpful. And obviously, in your slide deck, you note the $37 million price\/commodity is finally favorable for a change. How much of that went into the paint business? And I am little confused, if you could give some guidance in terms of how to think about the paint business in terms of margin performance. Is it going to be consistent with what we saw in the fourth quarter where you got 670 basis point pickup? Or am I missing something there?","John G. Sznewajs","Bob, in terms of the breakdown of the net price\/commodity in the quarter, it was split among 3 segments, really, Cabinetry, Plumbing. And really in Plumbing, that was largely driven by our European Plumbing business and then in our paint segment as well. So the way that breaks down -- I don't know if I have those numbers off my -- at my fingertips, but I'd say that Cabinets was probably the least amount, and then Plumbing would be the next amount, and paint would probably be the highest amount but only slightly higher than the Plumbing business. So that's the first answer to your question. I guess the second part of your question is what do we expect going forward. As I mentioned, as we walked through the segment slide, we had a relatively easy comp compared to the fourth quarter of last year. We had a lot of the headwinds. Commodity prices were extremely high. We did get some pricing in the first quarter of 2012. So that -- I'd say I would not anticipate the same kind of margin expansion that you saw in the fourth quarter to continue going forward. So we expect -- pricing's always something that we talk about on a regular basis with our customers. So margin, don't know where that's going to go in 2012 or 2013, I should say, at this point. We've got kind of conflicting signals as it relates to commodities in that segment with TiO2 coming down and propylene going up pretty significantly. So we'll see how that plays out as 2013 rolls out.","Timothy Wadhams","Yes. I'd add, Bob, that as we've indicated in the past, we expect to always have very strong margins in the Decorative Architectural segment. We have indicated that as we continue to grow the Pro side of the business and as I think you're very much aware, we've been investing for international opportunities in paint as well. As we make progress in those areas, we would anticipate that margins would probably come down over time. But having said that, we'd expect to grow the absolute profit dollars in that segment at a very good return. So we think that's a reasonably good trade, but we would always expect to have relatively strong margins in that segment.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Zener with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Given the very strong growth we're seeing in new construction, can you update us on your thoughts in Installation if we were to be at 1.5 million starts? And how much of that is the volume lift? And how much might be pricing specifically in Installation? And if you could update us on any comments you have there?","Timothy Wadhams","Well, yes, the way I would think about that, Bob, is that when we look at incremental starts, we estimate that 50,000 starts for us in that particular segment would equate to about 45 million of incremental volume. So that would give you a reasonable idea as to where we might end up in terms of the area of around 1.5 million starts. Having said that, I would say that we also have other growth opportunities in that segment when we think about retrofit and light commercial. So as we think about growth going forward, those additional adjacencies that we've been able to enter and successfully execute against should give us growth opportunities as well.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then obviously, just following up on that, the -- on Installation, given it's the majority of that business, could you comment on how pricing, if and when it occurs in that category, if that does fall kind of straight to the bottom line? And then, John, I think you mentioned the $55 million profit number for Cabinets. I was a little confused there if you were referring to actions that have already been taken in 2012, the benefits and\/or the benefit you'll get in '13 when you guys give us the restated numbers for the year European divestiture. So what was the European divestiture drag on EBIT, please?","John G. Sznewajs","Yes, Ken, I'll take the second of that question, right? So as it relates our Cabinet segment, really 2 buckets here. One -- a couple of -- 2 components to that $55 million. One is the $30 million improvement that would be driven by the elimination of our Danish RTA business from our financial statements, so that implies a $30 million loss in that business in 2012.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","On the $250 million of sales?","John G. Sznewajs","On $250 million of sales, correct. And then the other part of your question related to profit improvements, and yes, those are prior year, 2012 initiatives that we started that we expected to generate $25 million profit improvement in 2013. So that aggregates that $55 million number.","Timothy Wadhams","Yes, and Bob, to your other question related to pricing on Installation -- excuse me, Ken, I'm sorry. I said Bob again. I meant Ken. No, I apologize. Yes, Ken, in terms of your other question around pricing as it relates to Installation, generally speaking, as we've indicated in the past, when we do get a price increase, we've been able to either work with our suppliers, work on productivity or ultimately pass that along in the marketplace. And I think we've been pretty successful over time making that happen.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David MacGregor with Longbow Research.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","With respect to the $37 million of net price\/commodity benefit, have you talked at all -- if you did, I missed it -- on the price\/commodity benefit you anticipate for '13?","John G. Sznewajs","No, we do expect a little bit of tailwind for price\/commodity in 2013, David. That basically stems from the fact that in a couple different segments, we implemented price in the first quarter of last year. So we'll have the waterfall benefit of that. Beyond that, the balance of our commodities had been relatively stable over the course of the last several quarters, a little bit of headwind on some of the inputs into Cabinetry. But beyond that, pretty stable pricing or, I guess, commodity input costs across all 5 segments at this point in time.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","And then I think Tim had mentioned earlier that, over time, there had still been some unrecovered inflation over prior years. What segments are you seeing most of that?","John G. Sznewajs","That would principally be in our Decorative Architectural segment, David. I would say, if you look at the -- over the last 3 or 4 -- 3 years principally, we'd still be about $15 million, $20 million behind in the price\/commodity relationship on an aggregate basis.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Okay, last question. Just on the Behr expansion into Mexico and the builders' hardware business at retail, what did that contribute to growth in that segment?","John G. Sznewajs","Boy, I don't know -- I don't have either of those off the top of my head. I mean, just to give you a sense, David, there's about 90 Home Depot stores in Mexico. We said about half of those in the fourth quarter, the balance of them will be set here in the first quarter and then as it relates to our Decorative Architectural, I just don't have those numbers off the top of my head.","Timothy Wadhams","Yes, I think we were up, what, 9% in the quarter, and there was probably 1% or 2% that would have been driven by the 2 items John mentioned I would guess.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Adam Rudiger with Wells Fargo Securities.","Adam Rudiger - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I wanted to just talk about the Cabinets a little bit more and kind of, I guess, consolidate a bunch of the questions that are already been asked. But if I think about the exit of the European business, that should impact revenues by about 20%. And with your thoughts on repair and remodel being -- your big ticket items being somewhat delayed and that's the bulk of your business in that segment and then layering some strong growth maybe in the new builder business would suggest that overall revenues in the segment still are going to be down next year. And with the $55 million improvement, it looks like it would still be reporting losses. I just wanted to see if you think that was -- that made sense without specific guidance thematically and how to think about 2013.","Timothy Wadhams","Well, revenues will certainly be down by the $250 million of the Cabinet business that we exit. I wouldn't necessarily suggest that we expect revenues to be down after you back that number out. Obviously, we had a very good fourth quarter in North America. I think as John mentioned, I think we're up 13% in North America in the fourth quarter, and that is with a relatively slow bigger ticket remodel activity. We just -- we don't see a lot of change in that as things go forward. So from that standpoint, that would be the way we'd see the top line. On the bottom line, as John mentioned, we are anticipating about $55 million of improvement from the actions that have been taken, and obviously, that leaves a little bit of work to do. But our sense is that we have a chance to show significant improvement in that segment from a bottom line standpoint and I think particularly in North America. I don't think that we get to profitability in 2013 in this segment, primarily because of our U.K. operation. That environment continues to be pretty tough. But I think we've got a chance to show significant improvement in profitability in 2013.","Adam Rudiger - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then just going back to your opening remarks about all the discussions you've been having, what's been the biggest takeaway that you've gotten from your partners in terms of the dealer strategy that you think that we'll -- that you'll attack and kind of fix in order to improve your status there?","Timothy Wadhams","I think the biggest takeaway is that we have huge opportunity, that the communication that we've gotten back in terms of opportunity that exists in terms of our ability to improve in a variety of different areas, some dissatisfaction potentially with other suppliers, the fact that we've traditionally had 5 days delivery, for example, on the Merillat side. We've had 3- to 4-week delivery on the KraftMaid side. Those are industry-leading delivery statistics, and we certainly feel like we ought to be able to leverage those going forward. So I would say that I think the thing that was probably most important there is just a lot of opportunity to -- in areas where we may not have executed previously as well as we would have liked to win back business, as well as continue to gain some business in the dealer channel.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Keith Hughes with SunTrust.","Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Just going back to Cabinets one more time, if we look at just North American Cabinets taking the business your selling and others out, can you give us any kind of feel on where profitability level is there?","Timothy Wadhams","Yes, we improved, Keith, by about $32 million in the segment for the year, and basically, all of that was virtually in North America. So -- and I believe, if I'm remembering correctly from last year, I think we -- that would probably put us at about $40 million of loss in North America. And as we've discussed, we've talked about the 2 plant closures that took place, the headcount reduction. John gave the estimate of about $25 million of savings related to those. And so I think as I indicated earlier, when you take those actions and then think about some other things that are possible down the road, whether it's on the cost side and\/or the revenue side, as I said there earlier, I think we've got a pretty good shot to show some dramatic improvement in that segment and in North America in 2013.","Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","And follow-up question, switching over to Plumbing. You've talked on numerous calls on how well Hansgrohe has done despite what's going on in Europe. Can you give the audience any kind of feel on the size and then margin or just something to -- some kind of details on how well they're doing?","John G. Sznewajs","Yes, I mean, clearly, they're a significant piece of the segment. We don't, obviously, breakdown individual components of the segment, Keith. They've got a broad international footprint. They serve in more than 125 markets, and so I think that's a key component of their growth. While they're headquartered in Germany, they're not necessarily beholden to the economic conditions in Germany. They experienced solid growth in the Far East, in some of the emerging markets in South America, the Middle East even into Africa where they're selling their products. So they've really got a global perspective on the market. They've done a great job of penetrating particularly at the mid- to high-end price points all over the globe. So just fantastic operation over there.","Timothy Wadhams","Yes, Keith, in our appendix, we indicate that North America represents about 60% of the segment and the segment's about $3 billion. That obviously leaves 40% for Europe. We've got 2 other small, relatively small businesses, Bristan and H\u00fcppe, so you could probably assume that Hansgrohe is a pretty good piece of that and to John's point, it continues to just do a fabulous job in terms of execution.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Nishu Sood with Deutsche Bank.","Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Wanted to actually follow up on Hansgrohe there and to just generally, internationally. If I look over the last 4 or 5 years, a significant number of the divestitures you folks have had -- have come in Europe and if I think about the expansion and dispositions of stand-alone businesses and if I think about the expansion you've had, Hansgrohe has obviously been a superstar in terms of international expansion. Behr, I know you've had some of the Delta efforts in the Far East. So how should we think about your international efforts and footprint in the coming years? Is that kind of organic growth and maybe even some continued retrenchment on some of the stand-alone units. Is that how you also would think about the next few years in terms of your international footprint?","Timothy Wadhams","Well, I think that as we think about the international footprint, it's certainly an area that we have put some emphasis on as we think about our Delta organization and our Behr organization in the United States. We've talked about that over the course of the last several quarters. I think that Hansgrohe obviously has done a fabulous job of expansion, and a big piece of that has been more international. You are correct that we have divested some businesses in Europe. And generally speaking, the view there, Nishu, has been that some of those have been relatively small businesses participating in local markets with limited growth opportunities. And so as we assess the portfolio, we continue to look at the composition of it and continue to look at it from a return standpoint. I can't tell you there's anything imminent at this point in time other than the Danish subsidiary that we talked about. The rest of the businesses in the portfolio, with the exception of our Cabinet business in the United Kingdom, made a relatively nice contribution last year in terms of outcome from a profitability standpoint. Obviously, in Europe, the top line is a bit challenged at this point in time, but we have seen some pretty good bottom line improvement as it relates to our window- and Plumbing-related businesses.","Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And the second question I wanted to ask was now that the housing starts recovery is well established, how does your capacity set for 2013? Are there any facilities that you're looking at and thinking they might need to be mothballed with the 25% growth? I noticed your CapEx is rising in 2013 according to your guidance. It's pretty modest, so I wouldn't expect that includes any mothballing, but how are you thinking about that generally?","John G. Sznewajs","Generally, Nishu, I'd take a look at one item, the CapEx, your second question first. I'd take a look at it more as 2012 was a low watermark in terms of CapEx as opposed to it being kind of the norm. So the $165 million feels about right. You may recall that we generally spend about 2% of sales in capital every year, and so that $165 million kind of fits into that general range. And then also as it relates to -- you asked a question about capacity or expansion. At this point, we don't see any further mothballing. Could it be some minor pruning that we do here or there in the portfolio? Absolutely. But, because I think about our Installation business for instance, we had about 6, what we call, stocking points in 2012, probably look to add another 12 to 15 of those in 2013. And those are small not even full branches in markets that we're not currently serving. So as you may recall, we pulled back about half our branch locations during the course of the downturn. Now we don't have complete national coverage, and we're starting to add back these stocking units or stocking locations in areas where we see growth taking place. So I'd it see more on the expansion side than the contraction side in 2013.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dennis McGill with Zelman & Associates.","Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, LLC","First one, just on the -- whether you want to talk about this at the company-wide level or key retailer sales, can you maybe differentiate the revenue performance versus the point of sale -- I guess that would be more on the key retailer side, what you're seeing actually go up out the door?","Timothy Wadhams","Yes, not aware, Dennis, of any disconnect there at all. In terms of inventory build, if you will, obviously, GDP was very soft in the fourth quarter. I think one of the contributing factors was declines in inventory as I recall from some of the economic information that we saw. But I wouldn't necessarily say that there's any big disconnect that I'm aware of. John, I...","John G. Sznewajs","Yes, I would add, Dennis, to Tim's comments that there was a favorable load-in in the fourth quarter because of the Plumbing wins that we had in both toilets and faucets. Above and beyond that, to Tim's point, if you think about our Cabinet business, that's all made to order. So there's really no surprises there. No -- to Tim's point, no inventory balancing that we've seen.","Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, LLC","So the load-ins would still -- if you took out the load-ins, you'd still be double digits at key retail?","John G. Sznewajs","If we took out the load-ins, we...","Timothy Wadhams","Well, Dennis, there is an offset to that. We did mention earlier this year that we lost some utility tub business, and we also lost another bath product. And actually, those numbers basically kind of offset each other, if you will. And they're all retail-related sales.","Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, LLC","Okay. Second question would just be around the balance sheet. I think you mentioned $200 million of deleverage this year and still pretty elevated relative to historical leverage metrics. So how do you think about the leverage situation and the course of deleverage over the next handful of years?","John G. Sznewajs","Dennis, I think we have a pretty conservative effort in deleveraging over the course of the next several years. So we've got the $200 million maturity coming due this year, which we -- in August, which we'll intend to pay off. And then we're -- we've got -- yes, nothing in '13 and then $1.5 billion coming due in the - $500 million in '15 and $1 billion in '16. So as we look at those 2 maturities, those are where we got a lot of focus on right now. And I would think that as we tackle those 2 that we'd like to probably take those down, in aggregate refinance less than $1.5 billion, somewhere $300 million, $500 million of net debt reduction out of those 2 maturities probably. Don't know for certain just yet. Longer-term, Dennis, have you focus on the fact that we want to get back to investment-grade rating with both agencies, and we want to do that by getting our debt to cap in a better position and getting that to into about a more traditional 45%, 55% range that we've seen from us at pre-downturn.","Timothy Wadhams","Yes, and I would guess, Dennis, that a big, big portion of that would come from additional growth and retained earnings going forward. John has mentioned some debt reduction, but our sense is that most of that improvement will come over time through growth and retained earnings.","John G. Sznewajs","Yes, and I guess, Dennis, I'd should add to Tim's comment there, don't forget we've got evaluation allowance on our deferred tax assets. So when that flips, that's $600 million, $700 million of equity that pops back on the balance sheet.","Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, LLC","And the rating agencies treat that one for one coming back?","John G. Sznewajs","Yes, they would. Yes, they treat that one for one.","Timothy Wadhams","Okay. Thank you. We appreciate your participation, and thank you, Brent.","Operator","Thank you.

Allman","Thank you, Irene, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Turning to Slide 4. We are pleased to have finished 2014 with a strong fourth quarter. This performance capped of a year where sales grew 4%, an impressive result when considering the tough 2013 comparison we faced where sales were up 9%.","We drove year-over-year sales growth of $350 million while holding SG&A nearly flat. This is a testament to our growth strategy as well as our focus on execution and cost containment. We achieved a 10% operating margin for the year. This is a 120 basis point improvement over last year and our best operating margin since 2008, another example of how our discipline around profitable growth and strong operating leverage is paying off.","Our full year EPS grew 32% to $1.02 per common share and I would note that this is in spite of the challenges our cabinetry business faced in 2014. Our strong year was characterized by a series of significant accomplishments, as our business strategies yielded measureable results. Let me give you some examples.","Delta and Hansgrohe reaffirmed their global plumbing leadership positions by achieving record sales and record profit levels for the year. Our innovative products outperformed in the wholesale and showroom channels and our expansion into adjacent products with Delta branded toilets has augmented our retail results.","Behr continued its legacy of awarding winning innovation in the paint aisle with the introduction of its Marquee Interior paint. Not only was Marquee awarded Innovation of the Year by the Home Depot, it was also recently recognized as the number one rated interior paint by an independent third party. Behr\u2019s focus on innovation goes beyond product.","In late 2014, we introduced a new color selection center at the Home Depot designed to enhance the customer experience when shopping for pain in the aisle. We expect to complete the color center rollout by mid 2015. Behr remains focused on investing behind and growing the Pro paint business and we are working with the Home Depot towards our mutual goal of gallon growth.","Our Milgard window business capitalized on increasing R&R demand by introducing new products such as Essence windows and new multi-panel glass doors for this segment resulting in a diversified business mix and expanded margins. Our installation services business not only benefited from the increase in housing starts but also maintained a strong focus on growing its commercial business. Notably, their commercial business in 2014 included work in the Freedom Tower in New York City.","These examples demonstrate how our strategies and execution have generated great opportunities and given us momentum as we move into 2015. We complemented our strong operational performance with a new more balanced capital allocation strategy. We declared a 20% increase on our quarterly dividend in 2014 and authorized a new 50 million share repurchase program. In Q4 alone, we bought back 5 million shares or nearly 1.5% of our outstanding stock and we\u2019ll continue executing against this authorization in 2015.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to John Sznewajs who will go over our operational and financial performance in detail. John?","John G. Sznewajs","Thank you, Keith, and good morning everyone. As Irene mentioned, most of my comments will focus on adjusted performance excluding the impact of rationalization and other one-time charges. From a financial and operational perspective, the two themes that characterized our performance in 2014 were one, sales growth driven by customer-focused innovation and two, operating margin expansion resulting from cost control and productivity improvements.","This resulted in our best financial performance since 2008 and our 13th consecutive quarter of year-over-year sales and profit growth. We had a steady fourth quarter as sales increased 3% or 5% excluding the impact of foreign currency translation and 4% in the full year as we recorded strong sales growth in four of our five segments. Despite a difficult comp, the sales were up 9% in both Q4 and for the full year 2013.","Sales in North America increased 4% for both the fourth quarter and the full year. As the U.S. economy improves, we are experiencing growing demand for our products across all channels of distribution. As a reminder, repair\/remodel activity accounts for about 70% of our total sales.","International sales were up 6% in local currency in the quarter and up 4% in local currency for the full year, driven by the strength of our international plumbing in our UK businesses. Foreign currency translation negatively impacted our sales in the fourth quarter by approximately $32 million principally due to a weaker euro compared to the U.S. dollar.","Our focus on cost control continues to payoff. As Keith mentioned earlier, we held SG&A dollars essentially flat despite an approximate $350 million increase in revenue as SG&A as a percent of sales decreased 160 basis points to 17.8% for the quarter and declined 80 basis points to 18.4% for the full year.","In the fourth quarter, we delivered solid bottom line performance as operating income increased 32% to 202 million with operating margins expanding 210 basis points to 9.8%. For the full year 2014, operating income increased 18% to $851 million with operating margins expanding 120 basis points to 10%.","Our strong operating leverage resulted in a 74% incremental margin in the quarter and a 37% incremental margin for the full year. For the fourth quarter, our EPS increased 60% to $0.24 and for the full year increased 32% to $1.02.","Turning to Slide 7, our plumbing segment. You can see our plumbing segment delivered just terrific performance in 2014. Full year sales increased 4% driven by growth in faucets and showers, rough plumbing and spas. We saw the greatest strength in our wholesale and showroom customers. This reflects our continued investments in the showroom and commercial segments of this channel. As a result, we are benefiting from a richer mix of products, which is our showroom-focused Brizo faucets and our Highlife spas.","Our European businesses grew sales 4% in local currency led by the continued strength of Hansgrohe\u2019s brand, design and innovation. We delivered strong operating leverage and operating profit growth. A substantial portion of this growth came from increased volume and productivity improvements.","Sales in the fourth quarter increased 1%, driven by strong faucet, shower and spa sales partially offset by an unfavorable currency impact of approximately $30 million. Excluding the impact of currency, sales increased 5% in the fourth quarter.","We are pleased with our European performance as our international plumbing business grew sales by 5% in local currency, despite a tepid macroeconomic environment. Operating profit increased 20% driven by incremental volume, productivity improvement and favorable price commodity relationship particularly in Europe. As a reminder, our Q1 2015 profitability will be impacted by approximately $3 million due to our participation in a large biennial European trade show.","Turning to Slide 8. The Decorative Architectural segment, fourth quarter sales increased 7% driven by the performance of our new Behr Marquee Interior products, growth in our Behr Pro business and the timing of orders at the end of Q3. As you may recall, on our Q3 earnings call, we cited our strong sales in the segment in the early fourth quarter due to the timing of inventory replenishment orders.","Liberty Hardware had just a stellar fourth quarter in 2014, as they delivered solid top and bottom line growth through continued share gains from successful new product introductions and program wins in the retail channel. Operating income increased 21% in Q4, due to increased volume and effective cost management, which was partially offset by an unfavorable price\/commodity relationship.","For the full year, operating profit grew modestly over the prior year, driven by increased volume and productivity improvements, partially offset by an unfavorable price\/commodity relationship and an unfavorable mix driven by a growing Bahr Pro paint initiative. As we look forward into 2015 and as we mentioned on our Q3 earnings call, we expect to incur approximately $20 million of investment related to program wins in Liberty Hardware and the previously mentioned investment in the Bahr color solution center at the Home Depot. And at this time, we expect about $20 million of investment and to impact Q1 by about 5 million, Q2 by 7 million, Q3 by 5 million and Q4 by 3 million.","Turning to Slide 9. 2014 was a challenging year for our cabinets business. Segment sales declined 3% in Q4 and 1% for the full year, due to execution challenges in our Merillat business and our aggressive pursuit of price and reduction of promotional activity in the retail channel. As a result, our growth in the builder and dealer channels was more than offset by our declines in retail in 2014.","We have further work to do to improve this business and expect approximately $10 million of inefficiencies in the first half of 2015, as we complete this activity. Despite these inefficiencies, we have positioned this business to return to profitability in 2015 as we introduce new products at both KraftMaid and Merillat, improve our execution in the Merillat business and recalibrate our pricing and promotional strategies.","Turning to Slide 10. Our installation segment sales growth of 7% in both the quarter and the full year was driven by solid results in our residential new construction, commercial and distribution channels. Multi-family activity remains strong and we continue to grow with these customers. And we are beginning to see increased activity from custom builders, which should lead to an improved mix over time.","Our efforts to drive productivity and increased volume more than offset raw material price increases and wage inflation as operating profit increased $11 million and we delivered 6.5% operating margins, our best quarterly operating margin in this segment since the third quarter of 2007.","Turning to Slide 11, Milgard capped off 2014 with a great fourth quarter as they continued to benefit from a favorable mix shift toward our premium window and door product line. Milgard\u2019s growth coupled with the growth in our UK Window Company resulted in Q4 segment sales increasing 8%.","The segment\u2019s operating profit declined by 1 million, primarily due to an accrual adjustment of approximately 5 million at one of our window business. A favorable mix shift and continued recovery in our repair\/remodel sales in both the U.S. and the UK drove full year sales growth of 10% and operating profit improvement of 17%.","Turning to Slide 12, our year-end balance sheet was strong with approximately $1.7 billion of liquidity and our credit metrics are improving. We continued to deliver some of the best working capital results in the industry as working capital as a percent of sales was 10.7% at year end. I want to thank our supply chain operations and finance teams for continuing to drive this great outcome.","Finally, capital expenditures as a percent of sales in 2014 were approximately 1.5%, well below our long-term average of 2%. We will see CapEx at more traditional levels in 2015 as we expand an existing distribution facility for our growing Hansgrohe business. Beyond this, we anticipate normal levels of capital investment in the next several years.","Turning to Slide 14, as Keith mentioned earlier, we have taken recent initiatives to unlock shareholder value. One of these initiatives was to increase our share repurchase activity. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased approximately 5 million shares for nearly 1.5% of our common stock. We anticipate allocating between $400 million and $500 million to share repurchase activity in 2015. In addition, we increased our dividend to shareholders by 20% last year and we are well positioned to retire between 300 million and 500 million of debt in 2016.","That concludes my remarks. I will now turn the call back over to Keith.","Keith J. Allman","Thank you, John. 2014 was a transformation year for Masco and one in which a tremendous amount of hard work and organizational change took place. We\u2019ve made difficult decisions and looking back, I\u2019m proud what we\u2019ve accomplished. We have a new management team that is aligned with our goal of driving incremental shareholder value.","We have refined our portfolio and are on track to complete the spinoff of our services business by midyear creating two leading public companies. We\u2019ve redefined the role of our corporate office by adopting a lean operating model, which drives decision making down to our business units and increases our effectiveness as an organization.","We\u2019ve returned capital to the shareholders through our increased dividend and share buyback program, and perhaps most importantly Masco is more focused on the customer now than ever before. We expect that these actions will continue to create value and momentum as we move into 2015.","With this renewed focus, we will take full advantage of an improving economic environment. Particularly in North America, we believe that macroeconomic trends will support increased demand for repair and remodel as well as new home construction growth.","Outside of North America, as we\u2019ve demonstrated in 2014, our global businesses can perform even in periods of economic challenges. Overall, we expect to continue our trend of operating margin expansion and strong free cash flow generation, which will enable us to continue to generate solid returns for our shareholders. I want to thank all of our employees for their tenacity and dedication in 2014 and I look forward to our continued great execution in 2015.","With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over for questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Stephen Kim with Barclays. Your line is open. Mr. Kim, please check your mute.","Stephen Kim","Sorry about that. Can you hear me okay?","Keith J. Allman","Yes, we can hear you now.","John G. Sznewajs","Yes, Stephen.","Stephen Kim","Okay, sorry about that. I was curious about the cabinet business. First of all, good job in the quarter; very strong performance given a tough environment. I know in the cabinet business you talked about the fact that dealer and retail were challenging and you also mentioned that Merillat had some inefficiencies. I generally think about KraftMaid as your dealer business and since you didn\u2019t mention inefficiencies in KraftMaid, I was wondering if that might give us perhaps a better look at how things are trending in the cabinet business without maybe the noise from the inefficiencies. So can you talk a little bit about the trends you\u2019re seeing there? Are you seeing improving margins year-on-year or sequentially are you seeing improving trends in terms of the mix there? Anything you can shed regarding how that segment of your cabinet business is doing.","Keith J. Allman","Stephen, 2014 \u2013 this is Keith. 2014 was a challenging year for us in cabinets. We executed difficult but important initiatives for that business and we fell short of our commitment in terms of customer service, particularly on lead time and fill rates. That was focused and contained in the Merillat supply chain. We think that that did cause some issues for us in the dealer business, but we put a focus on bringing back our performance in terms of fill rates and lead times to that dealer base. So we\u2019ve fixed our customer service in that, but we did pay a price for that in the dealer business. In terms of the retail issues that we faced, we\u2019re committed as we\u2019ve talked in other calls to being a leader and resetting the promotional environment. We did that. We are a little bit too aggressive, I think, and we\u2019ve adjusted that and we\u2019re continuing to make adjustments in that or seeing good results. So primarily on the dealer side, our issues were focused around the Merillat issues that we\u2019ve had. And again, we\u2019ve addressed the customer issues. We don\u2019t believe that we lost dealers but rather share of wallet as we were working on the fixes. We have the fixes behind us and now we\u2019re driving to get the cost out and return this business to profitability in '15","John G. Sznewajs","Stephen, you asked some trends \u2013 I think piece of question there among \u2013 related to trends as well as some mix issues. So just to reset and make sure everyone\u2019s clear. KraftMaid product, this holds both through the dealer channel as well as big box retailers. And our Merillat offering is sold through dealer network and principally to builder-oriented customers. And so as we take a look at the trends at retail, as Keith alluded to earlier, we did see a little bit slowdown in our retail business in 2014. That said, we have introduced some new products to address some of the issues and as Keith mentioned, we have recalibrated our pricing and promotional activity. So we anticipate trends to continue to pick up. Now that said, the other thing that we are beginning to see also is a little bit of a trend in refinancing activity recently, which historically is supported big ticket repair\/remodel activity. It may take a little bit of time to play out in the marketplace but from a historical perspective, when people refinance their homes, generally that turns out to be favorable for us of our big ticket products. In terms of mix, a little bit of higher ASP or average selling price that we\u2019re seeing particularly on the retail and dealer side of our business, but it\u2019s been a trend that\u2019s only been occurring for a short period of time. I wouldn\u2019t want extrapolate that too far just yet.","Stephen Kim","Okay, great. That\u2019s very helpful. Thanks for that. I guess my second question relates to your corporate expense. It was a very strong performance there or good cost control, I would say, and yet when you know that there were some challenges in 2014 and so typically one might think that you would see maybe lower than normal kind of run rate in corporate when you look at the fourth quarter on year-end comp and that kind of thing. Can you give us a sense for what we saw in the fourth quarter whether that was affected with some quarter specific year-end type compensation issues that we should not expect going forward, or is what we saw in the fourth quarter pretty indicative of what we can expect going forward into '15? Thanks very much.","John G. Sznewajs","Stephen, I would tell you that the fourth quarter is a little bit lower than we would expect normally going forward into 2015 and beyond. We had about $21 million of general corporate expense in the fourth quarter. I would say we did experience slightly lower variable count than we experienced in 2013. And then we also had a little bit of favorable experience on the insurance side in the fourth quarter as well, which drove that number a little bit lower. So going forward, because of the cost reductions that we announced on September 30 that will impact the corporate office, I think you\u2019ll see our general corporate expense average more in the $100 million range than the \u2013 at this rate, it\u2019d be $80 million based on what we put forth in Q4. So, I think about $100 million is the right general range.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Wood with Macquarie Capital. Your line is open.","Mike Wood","Hi. Congratulations on the quarter. Can you give us an update on where you ended the year in 2014 from a net productivity standpoint and if you had benefited at all from any of the planned restructuring benefits in the fourth quarter?","John G. Sznewajs","Mike, it\u2019s John. Yes, we fell a little bit short of our goal on net productivity for the full year at about minus 6 million or so compared to we thought we\u2019d get back to kind of a neutral position for the full year. So some good experience in Q4 and we really thought we could get there. We just fell a little bit short by driving some good productivity improvement in the last part of the year. What\u2019s the second part of your question again, Mike?","Mike Wood","Just in terms of any \u2013 the restructuring tailwinds that you discussed for 2015 if any of that actually came through yet in the fourth quarter?","John G. Sznewajs","Yes, you can see our restructuring tailwinds in two spots, one you\u2019ll see it in our general corporate expense and I think we addressed that just on the prior question. And then you\u2019ll see a little bit of that also flow through and favorably impact some of the segment because some of the folks that we separated with in September were allocated to our business units.","Mike Wood","Thanks. Are you able to give any update on January sales trends?","Keith J. Allman","Well, we\u2019re starting to see a mixed bag when you look at it. We\u2019ve had some regions and pockets that have been affected by a little bit of weather. We\u2019re seeing a bit of slow down in the Texas market. But when you look at the overall market for us, we always see puts and takes on a regional or on a city-by-city or region basis. When you look at the full year, we\u2019re excited about how we expect 2015 to unfold. We\u2019re looking at from a new construction standpoint in the low teens increase. When we look at R&R, we still continue to think that we\u2019ll be in the GDP plus 2 range, which should put us in about 4% to 5% growth rate. So there are a number of indicators around the fundamental drivers of our business that we like. Consumer discretionary income is up. There\u2019s good job growth. We like the employment numbers. Consumer confidence is high. As John spoke, we\u2019re seeing a nice pace of home refinancing, which bodes well for us particularly on the bigger ticket items. So we\u2019re positive about 2015.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Dahl with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Michael Dahl","Hi. Thanks. Nice job on the quarter particularly with the margin performance. I\u2019m wondering if you could elaborate on the comments around the pricing and promotional activity and was that a situation where you pulled back, you reduced promotions or increased price and the market held steady, or did you actually see increased promotional activity from your competitors?","Keith J. Allman","As we\u2019ve talked in the past, we strategically decided to take a leadership position in resetting and driving changes in this area. I would say when we look at the market by and large, there has been an overall reduction in the promotion activity. What we\u2019re doing is getting creative to try to find the elastic point here and I\u2019m talking specifically in cabinets. And I think in hindsight, we were perhaps a little bit aggressive. The good news is as we tweak our promotional strategies, we see good results. So we feel good about \u2013 as I said, we feel good looking at the year about how we\u2019re going to drive the cabinet business.","Michael Dahl","Got it, thanks. And second question relating to paint margins, I think that one saw kind of an unusual uptick sequentially in margins, obviously it\u2019s very strong there even against seasonally lower volume. So was there anything that you would note as far as deferral of expenses or benefits that you may have been seeing from an input cost perspective or how we should think about that over the next couple of quarters?","John G. Sznewajs","Mike, it\u2019s John. No, we didn\u2019t \u2013 in terms of the comp compared to the fourth quarter of last year, you may recall in the fourth quarter of '13 we experienced higher advertising cost to the tune of about $6 million, which made for a relatively easy comparison although we did not incur that same amount in the fourth quarter this year. As it relates to pricing activity or commodity inflation activity, at this point no. As a matter of fact, it was still unfavorable for us in the fourth quarter and for the full year. So, no real benefit from commodity relief at this point.","Michael Dahl","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Rehaut with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Michael Rehaut","Thanks. Good morning, everyone. First question I had was just going back to cabins for a moment, Keith. You\u2019ve obviously been in the CEO spot for about a year now, a little more and if I\u2019m hearing it right, maybe I\u2019m not hearing it right. It seems a little contradictory in terms of some of the comments you\u2019ve made in terms of saying that you\u2019ve worked out some of the issues with the dealer channel in terms of service rates but yet you still see challenges, at least that was the press release. You also expect some of these inefficiencies to drag into the first half of the year. So I was hoping if you could maybe provide a little bit greater level of granularity in terms of number one, what\u2019s going on with the ERP implementation? Where you are with that? And why do you expect or why are these inefficiencies continuing into the first half? And maybe create a little bit of a path in terms of some of the putts and takes from a cost perspective in terms of why you expect to get to profitability in '15?","Keith J. Allman","The increase in inefficiency issues that we\u2019ve talked about are focused on the Merillat supply chain. We put in the ERP system and that was a rough implementation for us. And unfortunately we let down our customer with regards to providing the industry-leading lead times and fill rates that they\u2019re used to. The management team made the decision, the right decision to focus on the customer and get back to those industry-leading lead times and fill rates and we\u2019ve done that. So call it the reoccurring expense, if you will, or the issues that we faced going forward in 2015 are to pull out those cost that we have in the system that we put in to meet the customer requirements. So the ERP system is in, we\u2019re back to our industry-leading fill rates and lead times. And now this year we\u2019re working specifically with detailed work streams to pull those cost out. You asked I think for some examples, Michael, we\u2019re working on labor efficiency. We have strong work streams on material usage variance and material yields. We\u2019re working our scrap rates. There\u2019s a full program management structure that we have to drive this business to profitability and we\u2019re focused on it. This cabinet business represents about 10% of our overall portfolio and it\u2019s a focus of ours to fix it. And importantly we\u2019re also focused on extending the momentum of the other 90% of our portfolio that\u2019s operating quite well.","Michael Rehaut","Okay. I appreciate that, Keith. Second question turning to a bright spot in plumbing where you had a nice step up function now for a couple of years in margins there. And I think a quarter or two ago, you increased the let\u2019s say medium-term outlook for profitability to be in the mid teens versus the low teens. I was wondering if that\u2019s still the case and if we continue to see volume growth, you expect to continue to see a little bit of incremental \u2013 positive incremental margins and that mid teens rate is still achievable in the near to medium term?","Keith J. Allman","I\u2019d tell you I\u2019m pleased with the plumbing performance. There\u2019s no question about it. As we mentioned in the prepared remarks, we had a record sales and a record profit year for both Hansgrohe and Delta and we\u2019re seeing nice mix where our targeted new products and introductions like Hansgrohe Select functionality and a number of new products that Delta has launched in the showroom channel. If you happen to make it out at the show in Las Vegas, you saw the buzz around the booth, we have some good momentum there. So I\u2019m pleased with those margins. We also have some challenges as we go forward. We talked about the exchange rate out there that could give us some potential headwinds. The commodity basket for us there is really it\u2019s too early to tell how that is going to shake out in the year. So net of when I look at the segment, I\u2019m very pleased with the margins. The mid \u2013 maybe mid to high take on this segment is probably a good place to be, mid to high teens.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Nishu Sood with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Nishu Sood","Thanks. First question I wanted to ask was on the share repurchase program, exciting to see one of the major planks of the strategic restructuring coming through now, 5 million in the fourth quarter and you mentioned that that pace will continue, so a pretty significant allocation of cash. And my question around that was how should we view this going forward? I mean there was a period in Masco\u2019s history during the last housing recovery when a lot of \u2013 the excess cash was basically swept to share repurchases. It really accumulated over the years and was a major plank in cash distribution. How should we view this as '15? Is this an effort just to \u2013 because there\u2019s excess liquidity right now that there\u2019s an opportunity here in '15 or is it more like that earlier period when excess cash will continue to be swept over the next few years into share repurchases?","Keith J. Allman","We\u2019ve talked in the past about our capital allocation strategy and we haven\u2019t changed that. I mean first and foremost, funding our business and investing in brand innovation and growth. We\u2019re going to do that. We\u2019re going to continue to do that. We\u2019ve talked about paying down debt in the range of $300 million to $500 million over the next couple of years, we\u2019re going to do that. And of course we\u2019ve talked a lot about returning capital to the shareholders with our increase in the dividend and our share buyback program. We expect to spend in the range of 400 million to 500 million in 2015 in share buyback. And then we\u2019ve also talked about smaller acquisitions and we\u2019re looking at that. They\u2019ll be bolt-on acquisitions through our existing platform. So given the strong cash flow of this business that it\u2019s historically had and certainly we intend to continue to have, we can accomplish all of these strategies. So it\u2019s a balanced capital allocation approach is how I\u2019d characterize it.","Nishu Sood","Got it, okay. And second question, on the Pro paint initiative in Behr, certainly something that we\u2019ve been hearing about in recent times from you folks and an exciting initiative for us. Obviously, a big effort at the builder show recently. When can we expect to get more detail on that number wise? How big that\u2019s grown on the growth rates? What you might be targeting on that? Is that something we can look forward to at the Investor Day perhaps or when will we get more detail on that?","Keith J. Allman","That\u2019s surely our intention. In the Investor Day in May, we\u2019ll be giving more detail and talk more about our strategies and the milestones that we expect to hit as a result of those strategies.","Nishu Sood","Okay, great. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","George Staphos","Hi, everyone. Thanks for all of the details and taking my question. Congratulations on the year. I guess my first question, Keith, goes back to cabinets. If we move from Merillat to \u2013 it sounds like on the retail side you said you were trying to be a leader on promotion and pricing, you felt you did a good job of that, maybe you were too aggressive, you tweaked your strategy and you\u2019re happy with the results I think I\u2019m paraphrasing that relatively well. With the tweaks at a margin level that was sufficiently profitable for you or will the tweaks in your promotional activity require you to find other costs within the retail portion of your business to get margins to an adequate level? And then I had a follow-on unrelated to that.","Keith J. Allman","As you know, we don\u2019t talk specifically about margins and pricing in specific channels, specific customers but I\u2019d tell you that the tweaks that we\u2019ve done in this channel are productive for us and they\u2019re profitable.","George Staphos","Okay, I appreciate that. And then secondly in Decorative Art, can you talk at all about the implications from the $20 million investment, what it means perhaps as we try to think about margin trends either percentage margins or dollar profit margins for '15 versus very good performance in '14? And how important is the new, call it mixing center relative to the Pro initiative? Is it purely driven by the DIY consumer? Thanks and good luck in the quarter.","Keith J. Allman","Thank you. Our paint strategy is to have the best product, the best brand and to deliver it to the consumer with the best customer experience and we\u2019re doing that. We talked about the product and the recent awards we\u2019ve been given both by Home Depot and an independent third party. Clearly, we have the best DIY brand in the industry and on a customer experience and merchandizing perspective, we\u2019re working together with the Home Depot to invest, so that experience in the aisle is good as it can. I\u2019ll tell you on the color selection center, as we\u2019re launching it, we like what we\u2019re seeing. Behr\u2019s representation in that color selection center has gone from 18 feet to 24 feet, so that\u2019s real powerful for us. In terms of the margin in this segment, we continue to think about it as high teens. We\u2019re working together with the Home Depot to grow the Pro paint segment and you have to really look at this \u2013 at least I choose to look at this in totality in the segment and all of this work that we\u2019re doing to build the brand, to build the customer experience, it all helps with our Pro initiative as does the 140 Pro reps that we have out in the field that are driving this business together with the Home Depot.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Philip Ng with Jefferies. Your line is open.","Philip Ng","Good morning. It appears you\u2019re addressing the issues around cabinets, which appear to be waning but can you give us a sense how you\u2019ll be tracking relative to the market in 2015 going forward? And do you expect incremental margins returning back, like a mid 30% range in the back half of this year?","John G. Sznewajs","Phil, as we work through the inefficiencies as we talked about earlier and get the business back on track, we do expect this business to drop kind of the 30% to 35% incremental that we\u2019ve experienced historically. Obviously, we did much better than that in '13 and as we\u2019re going through a growth phase and coming off the bottom, we pulled back a little bit on that in 2014. But there\u2019s nothing fundamental to this business. It\u2019s changed the margin profile of the business and its contribution margin.","Philip Ng","Got you. And when you think about price cuts in 2015, especially with this pullback in energy prices, can you quantify what the potential tailwind could be especially on the Decorative side, just looking back in 2009 when petrochemical prices did rollover, you saw a pretty nice uptick on the margins front for your Decorative business?","John G. Sznewajs","Yes, so it is a little bit different environment. As we look across all the commodities that we buy enterprise wide, there are a fairly number of puts and takes, as Keith alluded to earlier. On the plumbing side, we\u2019ve seen some of the base metal; some are up, some have softened a little bit. Hardwoods has definitely experienced some inflation there along with installation. On the petrochemical side and the impact it has on paint, there\u2019s really over the course last couple of years been a disconnect between the price of crude oil and the price of natural gas. As I mentioned, natural gas has a big impact on the inputs to paint as well. And so while we have not seen really deflation in our input costs at this time, so it\u2019s really hard to say how this is going to play out throughout 2015 until we see where oil really lands for the year and if the feedstocks that go into paint actually do come down in price.","Philip Ng","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Keith Hughes with SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Keith J. Allman","Keith, you might be on mute.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of James Armstrong with Vertical Research. Please go ahead.","James Armstrong","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. My first question is on the international sales side. I know it\u2019s only about 19% of your mix, but could you help get a better handle around the sensitivity to the changing currencies, especially the euro? And could you give us a little more detail about how the international regions are doing? In order words, where\u2019s doing well and where isn\u2019t.","John G. Sznewajs","Sure, James. So a couple of questions in there. Just in terms on the top line, what\u2019s going well? As you\u2019d expect Western Europe for us that include the UK, Germany and Switzerland and France, they should perform reasonably well for us and this was a big part of our sales originally. But then as you look at the various pockets that we see, we\u2019re seeing some signs of life finally in Southern Europe but that\u2019s coming off a very low bottom, so not hugely excited about that growth opportunity but at least it\u2019s not declining any more. We have seen a little bit of pullback as you might imagine in Russia and the Ukraine just given the political environment that\u2019s there. We\u2019ve seen very good strength elsewhere. The Far East has done very well for us, Middle East we\u2019ve performed well. So a lot of good other areas of the world outside of Russia and Ukraine. In terms of the impact on our profit as a result of currency movement and this is really principally the euro as the biggest impact on both our revenue and our profit. If you think about a $0.10 movement in the euro, that\u2019s roughly $15 million, $16 million of impact from an operating profit perspective.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Garik Shmois with Longbow Research. Your line is open.","Garik Shmois","Thank you. I have a question on the installed business, good operating leverage in the quarter. Highlighted a couple factors is driving top line growth, commercial was highlighted as well as maybe your resumption in demand from production builders. Just wondering if you can provide maybe a little bit more color just on the incremental margin growth in that business in the fourth quarter and just how sustainable that trend is as you look out to 2015?","John G. Sznewajs","It was a little bit higher than we would customarily expect to see in that segment. Typically, we see incremental margins in that segment in the 25% area on a quarterly basis or on an annual basis. And it did benefit from some productivity improvements clearly that they saw. They also benefited from a little bit lower insurance experience in the fourth quarter as well. That\u2019s really what kind of drove the incremental there and we did have a little bit \u2013 there was some price increases that came through from the installation manufacturers and they were able to get a little bit tailwind from that as well.","Garik Shmois","Okay, thanks for that. And my follow up is just around the comment earlier around recent trends in the state of Texas just starting to see a slow down. Just wondering how material Texas is to the U.S. business just given that that state has been so instrumental to driving at least the initial phase of the U.S. construction recovery?","John G. Sznewajs","Texas is about 16% of total starts in the United States and it\u2019s kind of an unusual state because if you think about those single-family, multi-family breakdown of that state, unlike kind of the 30%, 35% single-family as a percent of total starts, Texas is closer to 45%. And so it\u2019s driven much more heavily by multi-family and lower end homes and then there\u2019s kind of a bifurcation. There are some obviously large homes as well. So, we feel that even if starts went down 5% in that market, that\u2019s really only 8,000 starts, not a significant impact on the overall business.","Keith J. Allman","I think of it in terms of our segments and when you look at our two big segments of plumbing and paint, those segments tend to be less sensitive to the regional variability that we can see. People in Houston are still painting their houses or still replacing their faucets, et cetera. When you look at our window business, we have a new factory and we\u2019re developing that market, we\u2019re growing very nicely down in Texas and we\u2019re going to continue to watch where that demand goes and insure that we ramp that capacity up consistent with it. And installation, as John mentioned, we are tied into new construction there but at 160,000 or so starts in Texas with a good portion of those being multifamily in the grand scheme of things, we don\u2019t see it as being particularly material. Again, looking at the full year across the market, we\u2019re positive about 2015 with new construction growth in the low teen range and R&R growth in that 4% to 5% range. And I think importantly, we worked our business and have our capacity in line to be able to meet this demand without a significant injection of capital. In other words, we don\u2019t have to put in capital and we\u2019re not faced with inefficiencies that can sometime arise when you make capacity increases. So we like how we\u2019ve positioned the business and we like the macros.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dennis McGill with Zelman & Associates. Your line is open.","Dennis McGill","Hi. Good morning. Just continuing on that, if you could go back to the comment about seeing some weakness, can you just be more specific on it, Keith? Is that in new construction or model site and what specifically are you seeing that leaves you to call that out?","Keith J. Allman","Yes, just a little bit of hiccups as they talk to our guys that our down in our branches down there that it slowed down a little bit in the new construction side. Again, I think it\u2019s over a short period of time and as I mentioned, these pockets or ups and downs occur across the country. We\u2019re focused on the total market.","Dennis McGill","So that\u2019s coming from your installation services branches?","Keith J. Allman","Yes.","Dennis McGill","Okay. All right, that\u2019s it. Thank you.","Keith J. Allman","Thanks, Dennis.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert Wetenhall with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Robert Wetenhall","Keith, nice way to cap a great first year. Wanted to dig in a little bit on paint. I think John had said that you had 8 million of promotional investment in the fourth quarter and I wanted to see if that money was spent or deferred because you got very good performance?","John G. Sznewajs","Bob, a portion of that was spent in the fourth quarter.","Robert Wetenhall","But the full 8 million or --","John G. Sznewajs","No, less than that. The number off the top of my head is closer I think to 4.","Robert Wetenhall","Okay. And then on the raw side and I think some people have touched on this. Could you talk about your hedging in the pain and decorative architectural and also when do you think you would start to see the benefit of lower raw costs and how that will flow through the P&L?","John G. Sznewajs","Bob, we don\u2019t hedge input costs on paint, we only hedge on our plumbing products, so copper and zinc is where we have our hedges. As I mentioned earlier, we have not seen any benefit yet from lower raw material input cost in the paint as of this time. If we were to experience that, it would take about a full quarter before that impact would flow through and hit our P&L. Just between \u2013 we have an inventory in between the supply chain that we\u2019ve got, it would take about that long to hit the income statement.","Robert Wetenhall","And obviously you guys have spent a lot of time investing behind the paint business. How do you think about gallon growth heading into 2015?","Keith J. Allman","We feel good about it. As I mentioned, best product, best brand, best merchandizing, those are all going in our direction and with this new color center, we feel real good about it where we\u2019ve rolled this color center out, Bob, we\u2019ve seen good performance. So on that side of the house, the core of the business, feel very good. On the growth side of the business, we\u2019re growing very nicely with the Home Depot. We continue to invest behind it. As I mentioned, 140 plus reps out in the market driving that Pro business, so feel going about it.","Robert Wetenhall","Cool. And if I could just sneak one more in. It looks like you\u2019re sharply increasing share repurchase activity. How should we think about year-end share count and what\u2019s kind of driving the decision to accelerate share repurchases? Thanks and good luck.","John G. Sznewajs","In that regard, we\u2019re buying our shares back a little bit on the opportunistic basis. As the share price moves up and down, we need to go in a little bit heavier in the market or pullback. Right now, we have not given any guidance in terms of what we think the year-end share count \u2013 I think for modeling purposes, I would just assume a pro rata purchase across the year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tim Wojs with Baird. Your line is open.","Tim Wojs","Good morning, everybody. Just I think, Keith, earlier you mentioned low teens new construction growth and about 4% to 5% repair\/remodel growth. Just given some of the comparability relative to last year with the weather and in Q1, could you give us a little bit of color how you think the pace of that growth materializes through the year?","Keith J. Allman","Historically, our business has been softer in the first and fourth quarter a little bit and in the middle of the year is where we tend to see a little bit more robust volume given our space. I think that will continue this year. With regards to \u2013 we certainly had very difficult weather in Q1 of last year trying to peg how material that tailwind will be is difficult. As I mentioned earlier, I believe we\u2019ve always seen some incremental weather here. We\u2019re experiencing some more as we speak and I don\u2019t know what old man winter is going to deal us here in the next six weeks. So, it remains to be seen.","Tim Wojs","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then I just want to make sure I understand just the cabinets, the level of profitability maybe in 2015. So, there were $35 million of ERP inefficiencies in 2014. I think there should be about 10 million in 2015. So net, that 25 million, does that go away and then I guess should we layer on top of that just the normal 25% to 30% incremental profitability in the cabinets business for '15?","John G. Sznewajs","That\u2019s where you should be thinking about that segment, yes.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research. Your line is open.","Eric Bosshard","Thank you. In terms of the cabinet sales momentum and market share momentum, I understand that you\u2019re managing or tweaking your promotional efforts but could you talk a little bit about how you think you\u2019re performing from a market share perspective and even how orders are behaving and the volume outlook looks in that business as we go into 2015?","Keith J. Allman","It\u2019s really difficult as we\u2019ve talked in the past to peg the size of the market particularly on a quarterly basis. We believe the market is going to grow with a combination of the repair and remodeling tailwinds that we\u2019ve talked about and certainly in new construction. Eric, what was your follow-on question, I\u2019m sorry.","Eric Bosshard","Just trying to understand even as you\u2019ve managed, we saw some promotional efforts as you\u2019re managing through that at 4Q, if you\u2019re seeing any benefit in terms of orders as we move into 2015 in that business? If there\u2019s anything notable going on, on the order line.","Keith J. Allman","From an overall industry order perspective, it\u2019s what we would expect. There hasn\u2019t been a material change from how the industry has been performing, what we\u2019d expect given the seasonality. In terms of the productivity of our tweaks and our promotion, they\u2019ve worked out very nicely for us.","Eric Bosshard","And then secondly, just to dig, I understand your comment on January and 1Q seasonally as a slower period, but is there anything you\u2019re seeing in the business, the 5% organic growth in 4Q is a pretty good number. Is there anything that you\u2019re seeing in 1Q or we should be aware of in 1Q that would materially change the overall growth rate of the business?","Keith J. Allman","No, I think it\u2019s right in there with what we see historically when you factor in the seasonality on a quarter-by-quarter basis. And importantly for us, we\u2019re looking at the full year and we\u2019ve measured it \u2013 we drive this business on a yearly basis and we\u2019re very excited about '15. The macros that we have in new construction and the good traction of R&R and all the signals we\u2019re seeing and the indicators are the fundamental driver for the business, so we feel good about '15.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that is all the time we have for today.

My name is Laurel, and I will be your operator for today's call. As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded for replay purposes.","I'll now turn the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Irene Tasi. Irene, you may begin.","Irene Tasi - Director-Investor Relations","Thank you, Laurel, and good morning to everyone. Welcome to Masco Corporation's first quarter 2015 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Keith Allman, President and CEO of Masco; and John Sznewajs, Masco's Vice President, Treasurer and Chief Financial Officer.","Our first quarter release and the presentation slides that we will refer to during the call are available on the Investor Relations portion of our website. Following our prepared remarks, the call will be open for analysts' questions. As a reminder, we would appreciate it if you could limit yourself to one question with one follow-up.

These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. We've described these risks and uncertainties in our Risk Factors and other disclosures in our Form 10-K and our Form 10-Q that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","Today's presentation also includes non-GAAP financial measures.

Allman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Irene. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Turning to slide four. We had a great start to 2015, with Q1 representing our 14th consecutive quarter of year-over-year sales and profit growth. All of our segments contributed to top line growth in local currency, resulting in our North American sales increasing 5%, and our international sales increasing 10% in local currency. We delivered this growth while expanding our operating margin to 9%, our strongest first quarter operating margin since 2007. Our focus on execution and cost containment continues to pay off as we improved our operating profit by $24 million, while decreasing SG&A by $6 million or 90 basis points.","As a global company, foreign exchange cost us $0.02 of EPS in the quarter. Despite this headwind, our adjusted EPS grew 43% to $0.20 per common share. This strong performance was augmented by several value-creating initiatives we accomplished in the quarter. We returned approximately $135 million to shareholders through our increased dividends and the repurchase of approximately 4 million shares of stock.","We announced an acquisition of Endless Pools by Watkins, a premiere spa business. This acquisition allows Watkins to expand its offering into the aquatic fitness category, opening new channels of distribution and access to a new customer base. The acquisition is reflective of a type of bolt-on opportunities we will continue to pursue. Additionally, the spin-off of our Installation Services business, TopBuild, remains on track for the middle of the year.","Before turning the call over to John, I'd like to highlight how our strategies and execution are driving results. In our Plumbing segment, our longstanding commitment to innovation and design continues to propel our market-leading brands to new levels. Delta and Hansgrohe once again broke records in the quarter and both experienced the highest sales quarters in their history. Behr's longstanding reputation as an industry leader in paint was reaffirmed. J.D. Power and Associates ranked Behr number one in customer satisfaction for interior paints.","You may recall that earlier this year, Behr was also rated number one in quality by a leading independent testing organization for its interior and exterior paints, as well as stains. These awards established Behr as the number one ranked paint based on quality and customer satisfaction and only add to Behr's brand awareness and brand equity. Milgard windows' history of innovation continues to drive sales with Essence windows and new multi-panel glass doors improving our business mix. Our Installation Services business continues to benefit from a strategic expansion into commercial construction, as well as targeted growth with custom builders.","Finally, Joe Gross was named President of our Cabinetry Business in mid-February. He and his team are already delivering on their turnaround plan with improved top and bottom line results.","With that, I'll turn the call over to John, who will go over our operational and financial performance in detail.","John G. Sznewajs - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & VP","Thanks, Keith. And good morning, everyone. Please turn to slide six. As Irene mentioned, most of my comments will focus on adjusted performance excluding the impact of rationalization and other one-time charges. We started 2015 with positive momentum from last year. As Keith mentioned, the first quarter was our 14th consecutive quarter of year-over-year sales and profit growth. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, sales increased 7% and we experienced sales growth in all five segments.","On a reported basis, sales grew 3%. Foreign currency translation negatively impacted our sales in the first quarter by $77 million, principally due to a weaker euro compared to the U.S. dollar. Sales in North America were up 5% for the quarter. As the U.S. economy improves we are experiencing growing demand for our new home construction and repair\/remodeling products including big ticket repair\/remodeling products. As a reminder, repair\/remodel activity accounts for approximately 75% of our total sales.","International sales increased 10% in local currency in the quarter, driven by the continued strength of our International Plumbing business. Gross margins expanded approximately 20 basis points compared to Q1 of last year to 28.2%. Our focus on cost control continues to pay off. As Keith mentioned, SG&A spend declined by $6 million in the quarter, despite a $53 million increase in revenue. As a result, SG&A as a percent of sales decreased 90 basis points to 19.2%. Our cost control enhanced our operating leverage as we generated a 45% incremental margin in the quarter.","We delivered strong bottom line performance as operating income increased 15% in the quarter to $181 million, with operating margins expanding 100 basis points to 9%; our highest first quarter margin since 2007. And our EPS was $0.20, an improvement of $0.06 or 43% compared to the first quarter of last year. Foreign currency negatively impacted operating profit in the quarter by $10 million or approximately $0.02 per share.","Turning to slide seven, our Plumbing segment sales decreased 1% due to the unfavorable impact of foreign currency. The strength of the U.S. dollar masked the terrific performance in Q1 across our Plumbing segment. Excluding the $71 million impact of foreign currency translation, sales increased 8%, driven by growth in faucets, spas, and new program wins with trade and retail partners. As Keith mentioned earlier, both Delta and Hansgrohe enjoyed their best quarter for any period in their history. We experienced strong growth in the trade channel in the quarter, as Delta and Brizo brands drive consumer demand for our innovative new products, and we continue to take share in this category.","Our European businesses continue to outperform, delivering 10% sales growth in local currency despite a strong mid-single digit comp from the first quarter of last year. Hansgrohe's record quarter in local currency was driven by emerging market growth, as well as the strength of Hansgrohe's brand, design and innovation, all of which were on display at the recent ISH trade show in Frankfurt. Operating profit decreased 7%, driven primarily by unfavorable currency of $10 million and negative mix of $5 million as we further penetrate the emerging markets.","As we mentioned on our Q4 earnings call, sales marketing and trade show expenses due primarily to our participation in the biennial trade show in Frankfurt impacted results by approximately $8 million. This was partially offset by favorable price commodity relationships, nearly all of which was incurred in our European businesses and increased volumes. We look at these costs in Q1 as investments for future growth and we believe this year Plumbing segment margins will approximate the 15% to 16% that we experienced in 2014.","Turning to slide eight, in the Decorative Architectural segment, first quarter sales increased 2%, driven by the performance of our new BEHR MARQUEE Interior product and growth in our BEHRPro business. As Keith mentioned, we are pleased that Behr was ranked number one in the J.D. Power's 2015 Paint Satisfaction Study in the interior paint category. This recognition, together with being ranked number one in interior paint, exterior paint, and exterior stains by a leading independent consumer testing organization establishes Behr as a quality leader in the architectural coatings industry.","Liberty Hardware contributed to the top and bottom line growth through the continued share gains from successful new product introductions and program wins in the retail channel. Operating profit increased 9% in the first quarter due to increased volumes, effective cost management, and the deferral of approximately $2 million in advertising and promotional expenses related to the coatings business from the first quarter to later this year. All of this was partially offset by some incremental expense at Liberty.","As we mentioned in our Q4 call, we expect to incur approximately $20 million of incremental investments in 2015, related to program wins at Liberty Hardware, and the investment in Behr's new Color Solution Centers in The Home Depot. These New Color Solution Centers should be in all stores by Memorial Day, in time for the kickoff of the painting season.","Segment sales were impacted by $3 million of these expenses in Q1, slightly lower than the $5 million we initially expected as a result of timing of some of these initiatives. We still expect to incur approximately $20 million of incremental investment related to these programs and initiatives in 2015 with Q2 impacted by approximately $8 million, Q3 by $6 million, and Q4 by $3 million in addition to the $3 million we experienced in Q1.","Turning to slide nine, our Cabinet segment sales increased 5% in the quarter due to improved performance of the KraftMaid brand in the home centers and with dealers. The bottom line improved $7 million over the prior year driven primarily by improved mix as our higher price point KraftMaid experienced strong growth, the reduction of prior year's incremental spend and the benefits associated with other cost savings initiatives.","Turning to Installation on slide 10, our sales increased 7% in the quarter as a result of improved end-market activity, with the strongest growth coming from residential new home construction and commercial channels. The growth in the residential new home construction was driven by strong single-family performance with both production and custom builders.","In addition, TopBuild was recently awarded ENERGY STAR Partner of the Year by the EPA for the 11th time for its home energy rating service. This reflects TopBuild's commitment to improving energy efficiency of homes in the U.S., and a recognition of TopBuild's expertise in building science.","Our efforts to drive productivity and increase volume helped offset raw material price increases and wage inflation as operating profit increased $12 million and delivered 2.2% operating margins. We are pleased that Q1 is this segment's first profitable first quarter since 2007. And as Keith mentioned, we're happy to report that we're on track to execute the spin-off in the middle of the year.","Turning to slide 11, our Other Specialty Product segment sales increased 7%, driven by low double-digit sales growth in our North American window business. This growth was driven by volume increases and the continued benefit of a favorable mix shift toward our premium window and door product lines. Excluding the impact of a negative impact of a stronger U.S. dollar, our European window sales increased 5%. The segment's operating profit growth in the quarter can be attributed to increased volumes and a favorable price\/commodity relationship, which was partially offset by approximately $2 million of cost related to ERP investment in Milgard and the timing of advertising and display expense.","And turning to slide 12, we ended the quarter with about $1.8 billion of liquidity. As a reminder, this number reflects the $500 million 10-year bond we issued in March to pre-fund our upcoming June 15 $500 million maturity. The issuance carrying cost is approximately $5 million, nearly all of which will impact the second quarter. And we continue to have strong performance in working capital. Working capital as a percent of sales came in at 12.7%, a 60-basis point improvement from the first quarter of last year.","And finally, turning to slide 13, we continue to take initiatives to unlock shareholder value. One of these initiatives was to increase our share repurchase activity. As Keith mentioned earlier, during the first quarter, we repurchased more than 4 million shares or approximately 1.2% of our common stock. It is our expectation and we will allocate in total between $400 million and $500 million to share repurchases in 2015, and we are well-positioned to retire between $300 million and $500 million of debt in 2016.","That concludes my remarks, so with that, I'll turn the call back over to Keith.","Keith J. Allman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, John. We're really pleased with our strong start to the year and our continued ability to execute against a backdrop of strengthening demand for our industry-leading products and services. We started the year well, we have good momentum as we move further into 2015, and we remain confident in our outlook for the year.","We look forward to sharing more of the Masco story and our growth plans with you next week at our Investor Day. So with that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Laurel for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, in order to ensure that everyone has a chance to participate, we would like to request that you limit yourself to asking one question and one follow-up question during the Q&A session.","Your first question comes from the line of Stephen East with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","Stephen F. East - Evercore ISI","Thank you, thank you. Good morning, guys. Thanks for the detail on Plumbing in Europe. I guess if you could talk a little bit more about what you all are doing with the emerging markets in Europe, just trying to understand where you're going with the business and what percentage of Europe is Plumbing for you all?","Keith J. Allman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","We have a, as you know, Stephen, a very strong global brand in Hansgrohe, and our plan for that brand is to continue to invest in it. And we have a substantial amount of upside as we look across the emerging markets both in Europe and outside of Europe. So, in general, our expectation is to continue to invest behind that. We see good returns on that. The business has good margins, and we feel really good about emerging markets.","You mentioned Europe, in particular. Of course, we continue to have challenges like everyone does in the Ukraine and in Russia, but we're committed to the European market and we like the results that we're seeing. And we'll have more detailed information at the Investor Day as we outline more specific growth plans and milestones.","John G. Sznewajs - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & VP","Stephen, maybe just to give you a little bit of color. International sales represent approximately 40% of the segment sales.","Stephen F. East - Evercore ISI","Okay. Okay. And within \u2013 embedded within that, I know you gave us the top line FX impact. The op margin impact would you mind giving? And then my second question revolved around Behr. It was a fairly easy comp. So, I'm wondering did the Lowe's paint rollout sort of disrupt the market, what do you think is going on there? And then are you starting to see any raw material tailwind from oil costs coming down and the derivative products off that?","John G. Sznewajs - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & VP","So, Stephen just to answer your first question, the operating profit impact of foreign currency was approximately $10 million in the Plumbing segment in the quarter.","Stephen F. East - Evercore ISI","Okay.","John G. Sznewajs - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & VP","Coincidentally that happens also to be the impact for the company in total.","Stephen F. East - Evercore ISI","Okay. Thanks.","John G. Sznewajs - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & VP","As it relates to Paint, Keith do you want...","Keith J. Allman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, on the Paint side, as we mentioned in our remarks, we have good strong momentum rolling with a lot of our awards rolling our way. And we're investing behind that. We have a new Color Center that we're launching and that will be rolled out in the end of March. We really feel good about that. We have an advertising campaign that's coming in consistent with that.","And we've also got new products that we're rolling out where we've rebranded KILZ PRO-X to BEHRPro and I think that's going to be very productive for us. We're rolling out Textured DECKOVER. When you put that all together we feel confident in where Paint's going.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tim Wojs with Baird. Your line is open.","Tim R. Wojs - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Hey, good morning everybody. Nice job.","Keith J. Allman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Tim.","Tim R. Wojs - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","I guess I just had a couple of questions on the EBIT. I was wondering if you could \u2013 I think in the past, you've given us an EBIT bridge year-over-year. I'm just wondering if maybe I missed that, but if you could kind of go through what the price commodity was productivity, those types of things?","John G. Sznewajs - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & VP","Yeah, Tim, we're not giving out that information any longer. So \u2013 but suffice to say, if you think about the volumes \u2013 we had pretty good volume growth in the quarter, obviously offset by a fair amount of currency headwinds and a little bit of pricing in there as well. So, I think I've got \u2013 I thought some of the segment detail that I provided was probably more useful than giving it in the company overall. So, take a look at the transcript and then if you have more questions we can perhaps circle back after the call.","Tim R. Wojs - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. No, I just wanted to make sure I didn't miss it. And then I guess, just as you guys stand right now, I know it's early, but any change to how you're thinking about the full year with one quarter under your belt? And then just a housekeeping question. How should we think of the FX headwind to revenue for the full year?","Keith J. Allman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","No change in our outlook for the year. We're excited about it and we continue to be positive about how we see 2015 shaping up. When you look at the fundamentals and the indicators from a macroeconomic standpoint, they're shaping up well. Consumer confidence is good. Household formation seemed to have spiked. Existing home sales are well-positioned and credit's easing up.","So, from a macro perspective, we continue to be very positive. When you look specifically at the demand drivers, in terms of new construction, we talked last call about how we felt that Blue Chip was maybe a little aggressive at $1.150 million they've since come down. We think they're still a little bit high. We're looking at about $1.1 million is how we're thinking out at it in terms of starts, so that's a good healthy 10% growth for us. And we're seeing indications of that growth importantly in the markets. Carolina's very robust. Florida is robust. Dallas is doing well. So this is fairly typical of what we see where pockets start to have that kind of heat, so on the new construction side, we feel good about it.","On the R&R demand drivers, when you look at, in addition to the macroeconomic indicators, you look at how our businesses that are more skewed to R&R are performing, you see good signs. Plumbing is a strong R&R business for us and that's doing very well. Milgard windows is principally an R&R play and that's doing extremely well. And in Cabinets, we're seeing KraftMaid, which is in the high end, more or less, in that space doing well and starting to grow which is indicative of a move towards that bigger ticket.","Our channel partners as they announced a month or so ago had very strong comps. So from a macroeconomic standpoint, a new construction demand driver, an R&R demand driver, we feel very good about the year and continue to be positive. And I think importantly, we have the supply chain in our company set up to handle it without a significant capital expense and the inefficiencies that can sometimes come with that. So, we're positive for the year.","John G. Sznewajs - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & VP","Tim as it relates to your housekeeping question on FX. FX will continue to be a headwind, particularly for the second and third quarters because of the way that currency developed last year. If you think about in the fourth quarter, we had about a $32 million headwind in currency in the fourth quarter of last year, so the comp will ease as we get into the back-half of the year, particularly the fourth quarter. So if you take a look at where currency rates are today versus where they were over the last year, order of magnitude of $300 million, so headwind facing us from currency this year.","Tim R. Wojs - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Great. Appreciate the color, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Dahl with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Michael G. Dahl - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hi, thank you. I wanted to go back to the Plumbing discussion and actually focus on the margins. I think you had said you expect full year margins in the 15% to 16% range, clearly a lot of the headwinds in the first quarter. But also seems to imply that any benefits that you're getting on the commodity side are likely to be offset by maybe currency and some of the spend in the near term. Just wondering how you'd think about that and going forward is this \u2013 I think you've talked about margins that could be a little bit higher in a normal environment than this, so is there any change there or is this just more of a temporary issue?","Keith J. Allman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Mike, there is no change to our mid- to long term expectations for margin in the segment, mid-teens. And specifically in the quarter, we incurred about $8 million of expense related to advertising, marketing and trade show expense which happens every other year at ISH. We believe this is really good spend for us to make, this is a productive segment for us. We have strong brands with good growth potential. So, this is a good place to put our investment.","And for those of you that were at the ISH show in Frankfurt, you were able to see the power of the Hansgrohe brand. I don't think it's saying too much to say that we were most definitely the best position in the entire fair. And that's a fair that happens European-wide every other year. So, we feel really good about the investment in it and we really don't see a change to our margin expectations in this space.","Michael G. Dahl - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay, great. And then shifting gears to the Cabinet side, just with the leadership change or the new leadership coming in, can you talk about just what some of the specific initiatives that Bill's been tasked with are \u2013 as far as kind of day one, first few months and then longer term, what's he you really coming in to do differently than you guys had been doing?","Keith J. Allman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Joe Gross is the right leader for this business at this time. We brought him in because of his experience. And he is steeped in turnarounds. He's spent a good portion of his career in private equity working for Cerberus and he's run and turned around and helped us in significant businesses here in our portfolio.","In terms of the specific initiatives and his plan of attack and what we're doing with this business, we've talked about our objective is to drive this business to profitability in 2015 and we're going to do that. And in terms of specifics, we'll talk about that next week and you'll get a chance to meet Joe.","Michael G. Dahl - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert Wetenhall with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Matt A. Bouley - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hi. This is actually Matt Bouley on for Bob. Thanks for taking my questions. So, just in Paint, on the raw materials side, I'm wondering if you can update us on what you're seeing now in terms of the Paint feedstocks and what you're expecting in 2015.","Keith J. Allman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","We really have seen modest deflation in Paint so far. We expect to see a little bit of favorability on the Paint side coming in in the next quarter. How long that's going to last remains to be seen. If you look at expanding it to our entire commodity basket, there really is a mixed bag. We're seeing copper in our Plumbing segment come off its lows, again how long and how high copper pricing will go remains to be seen.","We're seeing some slight inflation in hardwoods in our Cabinets side. And of course, a month or so ago, there was an announcement of a 10% price increase in our Installation. We are seeing a little bit of favorability out in logistics \u2013 in terms of logistics costs as the price of diesel starts to come down. As we talked earlier, we really see no significant change in our margin expectations, particularly in our big segments around Paint and Plumbing.","Matt A. Bouley - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Got it. Thanks. And then back to Cabinets, just given the recent consolidation in the space. So, I'm wondering if you could touch on maybe the competitive dynamics you're seeing and particularly in the dealer channel.","Keith J. Allman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","We really don't see a big change in terms of the competitive environment. We've competed against Norcraft for years, and we're going to continue to do that. We have strong competitors out in the space. We respect them for sure. We're focused on our business. And Joe and the team driving the turnaround and getting our Cabinet business back to profitability. But don't see any real fundamental changes in the competitive environment.","Matt A. Bouley - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research.","Please go ahead.","Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Thank you. Two questions. First of all in the Paint segment, the margin performance obviously quite good. But from a revenue perspective it sounds like the Hardware and the Paint both showed growth. I'm curious in how you think that growth compares to the markets in the first quarter and how we should expect that growth to behave as we move through the year?","John G. Sznewajs - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & VP","Yeah, Eric, it's John. Yeah, if you look at some of the others that have reported we're consistent with some. The one company's a little bit higher than us but they had a load-in going in in the stores. So we think if anything we are holding if not picking up just a little bit of share in the marketplace today.","Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Okay. And then a similar question on the Cabinets side. You know the Cabinet growth is I think a little bit better than prior trend. As you look forward in that business and you can get a little bit of a forward look with measurements in traffic in that segment, but curious what you're seeing and expecting in terms of the revenue growth opportunity there. And also the market share opportunity there, how that experience is playing out.","Keith J. Allman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","We're seeing some good traction, particularly in our KraftMaid brand at both retail and the dealer segment. Market share is very difficult in this fragmented market to report, particularly when you're talking about a quarter-over-quarter of variance. But we like our demand trend and we think we're winning with KraftMaid both in retail and in dealer.","We remain challenged in the dealer segment for Merillat, as we recover from some of our execution issues that we had last year, frankly. We have our deliveries and lead times back and we're starting to win back that, the trust of that segment. We have the leading brands in KraftMaid and Merillat in the R&R and the builder segment, respectively. So we're going to continue to drive that demand.","Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Just within that, again the underlying demand, I appreciate the progress on market share. The underlying Cabinet demand, especially on the R&R side, how is that behaving relative to your expectations and how do you think about that specific category this year, R&R Cabinets?","Keith J. Allman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think it's robust. I mean, when you look at the pent-up demand that we've seen over lack of spend in prior years, when we look at the indicators in terms of new home values, we look at store traffic, the fact that KraftMaid for us has momentum and that's on a higher end of the price continuum, I think that bodes well for the overall R&R dynamics.","Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Wood with Macquarie Capital. Your line is open.","Mike Wood - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Hi. Good morning and thanks for taking my question. First question in Cabinets, I'm curious if you can gives us how much ERP inefficiencies where in the Cabinet segment in the first quarter? And some of your competitors have gone through the portfolio and exited recently some unprofitable markets in Cabinets, regional builder share, have you gone through that your portfolio and made that decision yet as to whether or not you can exit certain underperforming businesses?","John G. Sznewajs - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & VP","Yes. Hi, Mike. As it relates to the ERP inefficiencies we experienced, it was about $3 million in the first quarter.","Keith J. Allman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","In terms of the strategy of the team that's in place and the leadership of Joe, we are definitely applying segmentation to customers, markets, geographies and channels and we're looking at that as a factor, without question. And again, at the Investor Day next week, we're going to go into more detail on that.","Mike Wood - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Great. And was the \u2013 in Paint, was the deferral of that spending just more of an execution timing? And if you could also just comment on the Pro initiatives, it was mentioned in the release, just wondering how large that business is?","Keith J. Allman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. So, Mike, the deferral \u2013 it was more due to the fact that we had some inclement weather, so we thought we'd ask the advertisement people in painting, so we just deferred it into second and third quarters. As it relates to the Pro business, they continue to have nice growth and we'll talk more \u2013 Jeff Filley, the Head of Behr will talk more about our Pro initiatives next week at the Investor Day.","Mike Wood - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Philip Ng with Jefferies. Your line is open.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC","Good morning, top line in your Cabinets were pretty strong, have you been able to regain some of that lost year in home center, the home center channel. And the high-single digit growth in KraftMaid is better than we would have expected. How does that stack up to your expectation and did you have to cede some price to regain market share?","Keith J. Allman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","It met our expectation. We planned on as we talked last call of recalibrating our pricing and promotional strategies. We're leveraging the brand and the designer advocacy that we have in KraftMaid. So Philip I'd say it was on plan and we do think that the growth that we showed was a share gain for us.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC","Okay, that's helpful. And can you give us a little color on how \u2013 it sounds like you're generally upbeat about the outlook but can you give us some color on how the start of the spring selling season is progressing and any sales trends you've seen in April?","Keith J. Allman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. We like what we're seeing, the demand is rolling along as expected. As I talked in some of the earlier remarks, the macroeconomics and what we're seeing in specific markets, the foot traffic we're seeing in retail, the movement with KraftMaid indicating that the buyer is moving up in terms of the price continuum, that all supports a nice spring selling season.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC","Okay, all right. Thanks, guys. Good luck in the quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Alex Rygiel with FBR. Your line is open.","Alex J. Rygiel - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Thank you, good morning, gentlemen. Looking at the Plumbing margins that expectation of 15% to 16% this year, is there any way you could sort of quantify the negative headwinds this year from emerging markets, trade show expense and foreign currency?","John G. Sznewajs - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & VP","Sure, Alex. Well, that impact comes over a period of time, we've introduced a lot of new products at those trade shows and particularly the one in Frankfurt. And so, we will see the benefit of those sales really from in 2015 and 2016 because a lot those won't hit the market until later this year. But when they do because they're new products and they \u2013 we've priced them approximately because of the innovation that's in these new products, you will see that the margin benefit at that time.","Alex J. Rygiel - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","And then secondly, can you go a little bit deeper on the double-digit growth in windows in the quarter? Was that market share growth, price or market share gains?","John G. Sznewajs - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & VP","It was probably a little bit of share gain along with some improved mix in the quarter. We've seen a lot of nice upward pricing \u2013 or price point driven demand from the consumers in the Western U.S. So, think of our Essence windows as we talked about or Keith mentioned it a couple of minutes ago, some of our paint and vinyl products are doing particularly well. The sliding glass door\/glass wall product that we came out with last year are all resonating very well with the consumers in the Western U.S.","Alex J. Rygiel - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dennis McGill with Zelman & Associates. Please go ahead.","Dennis P. McGill - Zelman & Associates","Hi. Good morning. Thank you, guys. Just wanted to go back to Decorative Architectural segment. John, are you seeing or did you guys see any difference between point of sale and your revenue recognition during the quarter?","John G. Sznewajs - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & VP","We did \u2013 yeah, POS was higher than our revenue recognition.","Dennis P. McGill - Zelman & Associates","And what was driving that?","John G. Sznewajs - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & VP","I think there may have been just a small amount of inventory balancing there, Dennis.","Dennis P. McGill - Zelman & Associates","And is that across the Hardware and Paint segment or more Paint?","John G. Sznewajs - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & VP","I'd say it's solely in the Paint segment.","Dennis P. McGill - Zelman & Associates","Okay. And then just going back to Cabinets. You touched on this a little bit I think around the Merillat performance, but can you speak to maybe a little bit more specifically the trends you're seeing in the home center versus Merillat in the dealer channel? How much of a drag is that for you, guys, right now that you're looking to reverse?","Keith J. Allman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","We're performing well in the home center dealer channel with KraftMaid. The challenge that we're facing to give you a little bit of color on that from the Merillat side, as you know, last year we had delivery and lead time issues associated with some execution problems we had with our ERP system. We've put that in the rearview mirror. We have our delivery and our lead times back. But there has been some hangover with regards to our ability to serve in businesses that those dealers go after. We're building that confidence back.","We haven't lost leaderships but we did lose some confidence in them. And we're working that back and step-by-step, we'll continue to do that. So, directly to your question, Dennis, we're seeing some good strong retail and dealer business in KraftMaid. We continue to be challenged with regards to the demand side at Merillat, but we're getting better.","Dennis P. McGill - Zelman & Associates","And I'm sure you'll touch on this next week, but as far as communicating that message to the Merillat dealers, what's the primary focus that you're communicating to them right now as far as why they should stick with you?","Keith J. Allman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, really, it's not so much, the communication isn't oriented on why to stick with us, it's why you should grow with us and why we're going to be dependable. And fundamentally, we do that with our numbers and our performance.","Dennis P. McGill - Zelman & Associates","Okay. I look forward to next week. Thanks, guys.","John G. Sznewajs - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & VP","Thanks, Dennis.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Rehaut with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks. Good morning, everyone. First question I had was on \u2013 just going back to Plumbing for a moment. The 14% margin in the quarter you mentioned, obviously, impacted by the trade show and some of the spend. And I believe you said last quarter the trade show itself was $3 million, so I just wanted to make sure that was the case. But getting to the 15% to 16% margin for the full year, from the 14% you're seeing in the first quarter, is that a function of most of that $8 million dissipating or is there sort of incremental profitability that you expect as well from volume growth or price mix? If you could go into a little more detail in terms of going from the 14% to the 15% to 16% for the year.","John G. Sznewajs - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & VP","Sure, Mike. It's John. So the trade show actually costs us $4 million, so a little bit more than we expected than the $3 million. But in the $8 million there's some embedded incremental advertising and marketing expenses that we referred to. So, that's how you bridge the $4 million to the $8 million.","In terms of the growth \u2013 the profit growth going forward from Q2 to Q4, clearly a big part of it is just the expense that we incurred in Q1 we don't expect to repeat itself in the following quarters. At the same time, we do expect to grow this business, so the balance of that relates to the volume drop that we expect to have in the remaining three quarters in 2015.","In terms of mix, we do probably see a little bit of improved mix over the quarter, but we did have kind of some crosswinds in there in the first quarter, just with the strong growth in the emerging markets that we experienced.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. No, thank you. And just a second question on Cabinets, you had a $7 million profit improvement off of $12 million in better volume or I'm sorry, better revenue. So, it would seem that a portion of the profit improvement was just from incremental margins. And I was hoping you could explain the other portion if that was maybe lapping some ERP or costs that you're not incurring this year, if you could kind of walk through the drivers of the profit improvement.","And in terms of the new management, I was hoping just to get a sense for \u2013 you kind of referred to the fact that the new leader, and I apologize for not catching the name, I believe, Bill (sic) [Joe] Gross, not coming from private equity place but if there's also \u2013 if could just go through his background in a little more detail, as well as if there were any other major changes to the leadership team I think we've discussed in the past.","Keith J. Allman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. We've \u2013 the improvement is a combination of some favorable mix that we've seen and KraftMaid growing. We certainly are performing better on the operational side and getting over some of the inefficiencies of ERP. We've also taken some costs out. So it's a combination of the usual suspects with regards to the improvements.","With regard to Joe Gross, he's not a bond guy; he's Joe and not Bill. He's been with Masco for quite a number of years. He came from our Tool business and then was moved into a President of our Rough Plumbing business and all along the way he's done a tremendous job. He does have significant turnaround experience as I mentioned, he's worked in private equity for a good portion of his career. So he brings a very good perspective in this business, and as I said, you'll get a chance to meet him, to talk to him, to have Q&A et cetera at the Investor Conference.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America. Your line is open.","George L. Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi everyone, good morning, most of my questions have been asked but I'll give it a shot with these two. First of all, can you comment at all or affirm what your views on the incremental margin and incremental profit uplift should be for Cabinets this year. I seem to recall there was a $25 million or so built-in benefit given last year's inefficiencies. And then, Keith, I remember still a goal of 25% incremental margin. Can you confirm that that's the outlook for 2015?","And then question for you, John, just on FX, can you comment at all on sort of how your debt is allocated regionally? I don't recall on whether there's an opportunity at all to use that as a natural hedge for FX going forward.","John G. Sznewajs - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & VP","So, George, with respect to your incremental margin question on Cabinetry, yeah, we do expect that there should be a $25 million tailwind from just the lack of the incremental expenses that we incurred in 2014 that will benefit 2015. So, above and beyond that, in terms of just the volume benefit, we should expect about a 30% dropdown on a contribution margin on incremental volume in the segment. So, that's how to kind of think about profit growth in 2015 and beyond in our Cabinet business.","As it relates to FX, right now all of our debt is U.S.-based. But to your point, given the attractive rate environment that we're seeing over in Europe, as we have upcoming maturities and we have that significant maturity that's coming up in 2016, if the rate environment stays similar to what it is now, we would definitely consider taking a look at perhaps doing some euro-based financing for that refinancing activity later next year.","George L. Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Keith, just one quickie, and not trying to be too short-term, in answering a prior question you were certainly espousing your optimism, your confidence in the way the quarter is developing. Is there a way to put a number or a range on the sales comp you're seeing thus far in the quarter? Thanks, and good luck in the quarter.","Keith J. Allman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. I think we're \u2013 I'm going to stay away from giving a number. Our outlook has not changed. We feel the same way about these businesses now as we did coming into the quarter and continue to feel good about the outlook for 2015.","George L. Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Susan Maklari with UBS. Your line is open.","Susan Marie Maklari - UBS Securities LLC","Good morning.","Keith J. Allman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning, Susan.","Susan Marie Maklari - UBS Securities LLC","In terms of the pricing environment and promotions, I know that you made a big effort towards the end of last year to sort of reset a lot of that. Can you talk about with the improvement that you saw during the quarter, any changes there and maybe any abilities to sort of get more pricing as we go through the year?","Keith J. Allman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","As we talked about \u2013 as I talked about last quarter, our intention was to adjust our promotional strategy and pricing in Cabinets. We got more aggressive than I think the market would bear, as we've talked about in the past, and we made some adjustments to that. We're competitive in terms of where we are in our strategy right now, and we saw good results from it. We're committed to driving this business to profitability and we're seeing some nice signs as Joe and the new team start to get traction.","Susan Marie Maklari - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And then in terms of your working capital, the improvement was really impressive there as you saw things take off in the quarter. Can you talk a little bit about how we can expect to trend during the year, and is there may be anything significant that you can do there?","John G. Sznewajs - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & VP","We continue to work on working capital, Susan. And as you highlighted, just great outcome that the team from an operations, finance, and supply chain execute upon. We do incentivize all of our employees across the enterprise on working capital performance, so there is incentive to continue to improve that.","So there's a variety of things that we're working on, principally around inventories. We think there's an opportunity to continue to improve. That said, I think given that we're kind of at record low levels of working capital, the improvement from here will be slightly incremental. Don't expect major step-change improvement from working capital going forward.","Susan Marie Maklari - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. That's great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Nishu Sood with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks. So, Keith, when your tenure started and you talked about portfolio restructuring, most of the investor focus was on what might be divested. But you folks are fairly consistent in talking about potential bolt-on acquisitions happening as well; so the Endless Pools acquisition. First, if you could give us some sense of the size of that, sales, maybe EBITDA? And also if you could give us some sense of how it fits in to the acquisition vision and what it might tell us about what sorts of future acquisitions you're considering and might make as time goes on?","Keith J. Allman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Endless Pools was a small acquisition for us. It was about $25 million. In terms of how it fits into the overall strategy, we're focused on bolt-ons rather than per se another leg, another platform for us. We view Plumbing and Paint, North American and Global, and that space is where our target is. We're targeting in the range of $200 million to $300 million as the kind of acquisitions that we're looking on.","So Endless Pools is small, but it's consistent in that it's in Plumbing; it's where we see the potential to leverage either our technologies or our access to markets. And that's what we've brought onboard a new VP of Strategy and Business Development, and his role is to help manage our pipeline and we're working with our teams to do that. So while it's small, it's quite consistent with what we're looking at in terms of our ongoing acquisitions.","Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Got it. And you mean up to $200 million to $300 million in the acquisition value?","Keith J. Allman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Correct.","Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Got it. Okay. And a second question, the Investor Day obviously, everyone is looking forward to that. You've mentioned we'll be hearing from a few of the divisions, Cabinets, ProBuilt, Paint. Are we going to be hearing from all of the different divisions? Is it going to be a pretty systematic review of what's going on across Masco? What \u2013 maybe \u2013 are there going to be some themes you're going to be looking at? Obviously, I'm sure we'll get all the details, but maybe if you could give us a movie trailer version.","Keith J. Allman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","You're not going to hear from every one of our general managers, but clearly you're going to have people talking to you about every segment. We're going to go through and put the business leaders in front to talk about their growth strategies. We're going to talk about specific actions as well as performance milestones, and we're going to talk about expectations.","Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Got it. Okay. Great.

Your line is open.","Will Randow - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hey, good morning, and thanks for taking my questions. I was curious on the Cabinet side. It looks like you guys introduced the Merillat Express, five day ship business along with recently purchased the Cardell trademark, and have been making some waves in Cabinets. Where's the strategic vision behind some of those initiatives?","Keith J. Allman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, Cardell was purchased some time ago. And, really, what we're focused on is trying to give our customers what they need to drive foot traffic and to be profitable for them and for us to be profitable. So, our strategy is a combination of market penetration with the strongest brands that we have, as well as getting our house in order with regards to performance and cost.","Will Randow - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thanks for that. And just one follow-up in terms of the pace of the repurchase program with about 4 million shares in the first quarter. Is there any room to accelerate that? And are you looking at this consistently on a free cash flow less share purchases neutral basis? Thank you.","John G. Sznewajs - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & VP","Yeah, Will, there is always opportunity to accelerate or decelerate this share repurchase activity based on where we see the share price go. As I mentioned in my remarks, we are \u2013 we did reaffirm the fact that we would purchase between $400 million and $500 million worth of shares this year. And so we'll continue to evaluate opportunities to accelerate repurchases based on where the share price is at.","Will Randow - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thanks again.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Keith Hughes with SunTrust. Your line is open.","Keith Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Thank you. My question's on Cabinets. You had discussed mix being a positive in the quarter. Could you give us a view of where volume was in the first quarter?","John G. Sznewajs - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & VP","Yeah. So, volume was up just a little bit, Keith. Pretty good volume in that we saw as a result of the mix though. So KraftMaid really led the volume charge in Q1 as Keith mentioned earlier, both at retail as well as our dealers. So, that initiative has gone very well so we're very pleased with the volume growth at KraftMaid.","Keith Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Does that mean that Merillat volume was down year-over-year?","John G.

Welcome to Masco Corporation\u2019s 2018 First Quarter Conference Call. My name is Regina and I will be your conference operator for today\u2019s call. As a reminder, today\u2019s conference call is being recorded for replay purposes. [Operator Instructions]. ","I will now turn the call over to David Chaika, Vice President, Treasurer and Investor Relations. You may begin your conference, sir.","David Chaika","Thank you, Regina. And good morning. Welcome to Masco Corporation\u2019s 2018 first quarter conference call. With me today are Keith Allman, President and CEO of Masco; and John Sznewajs, Masco\u2019s Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Our first quarter earnings release and the presentation slides we will refer to today are available on our website under Investor Relations. Following our remarks, we will open the call for analysts\u2019 questions. Please limit yourself to one question with one follow-up. If we can\u2019t take your question now, please call me directly at 313-792-5500.","Our statements today will include our views about our future performance, which constitute forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. ","We described these risks and uncertainties in our Risk Factors and Other Disclosures in our Form 10-K and our Form 10-Q that we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. ","Our statements will also include non-GAAP financial measures. Our references to operating profit and earnings per share will be as adjusted unless otherwise noted. We reconciled these adjusted measurements to GAAP in our earnings release and presentation slides, which are available on our website under Investor Relations.","With that, I will now turn the call over to Keith.","Keith Allman","Thank you, Dave. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us today. Please turn to slide 4. We had a good start to the year as our top-line grew 5% excluding the impact of currency. ","Our operating margin decreased to 160 basis points in the quarter mainly due to the planned growth investments we discussed last quarter and our Plumbing and Cabinetry segments. And a lag in our price cost relationship in Plumbing and Cabinetry. ","We are confident that we will leverage these strategies growth investments to achieve profitable growth and the margin expansions in the second half of the year. Additionally, we have implemented price increases across all our segments and we expect our price cost relationship to improve starting in the second quarter. While our operating profit decline our adjusted earnings per share grew 13% to $0.45 per share due to lower interest expense and the benefit of the recently enacted tax reform. ","I\u2019d like to provide you with some additional insights into the drivers behind each of our segments performance, starting with Plumbing. Our Plumbing segment grew 11% or 6% in local currency. North American Plumbing grew 9% led by Delta Faucet and Watkins Wellness, our leading spa business and the acquisition of Mercury Plastics. Delta\u2019s performance was led by its high-end Delta and Brizo showroom brands in the wholesale channel, strong growth in the ecommerce channel and strong sales from its recently re-launched [indiscernible] brand in the retail channel. Watkins Wellness drove high-single-digit growth as they leveraged their expanded product offering through their existing dealer network and through new channels of distribution. ","Outside of North America, our international Plumbing operation achieve 3% growth in local currency led by Hansgrohe, our leading international faucet and shower business. Hansgrohe continued to drive growth in both China and Germany with particular strength in its premium [indiscernible] product line. Decorative Architectural segment sales increased 10% due to continued growth from both Behr and Liberty as well as the Kichler Lighting acquisition, which closed in early March. ","Kichler integration is going well and I am pleased to announce that Kichler recently received recognition for its product innovation receiving four [indiscernible] awards for superior innovation, design and aesthetics, highlighting Kichler fit with Masco and our focus on brand innovation and surface. Congratulations to the Kichler team on this great recognition. ","Our pro paint sales experienced strong growth in the quarter and together with the Home Depot, we began another expansion of this initiative. As we discussed last quarter, we are recruiting and hiring additional pro hub store employees and outside programs demonstrating our commitment to continuing to invest in this successful program.","Turning to Cabinets. Our repair and remodel sales grew mid-single-digits delivering another quarter of strong performance. We also made great progress executing on the program launch of our new Menards business by resetting over 300 stores with new displays as showcased our Cardell brand. Initial sales of this business are strong and we\u2019re confident that we\u2019ll reach the 80 million annual sales run rate by the fourth quarter of this year. Our window segment grew 12%, excluding the impact of the divesture of Arrow led by mid-teens growth for Milgard, our leading Western North American Window business. ","Milgard experience strong demand for its products across all its markets in the Western United States, as its value proposition and strong brand continued to resonate with dealers and consumers. ","Our UK window business offset a portion of this growth due to softness in the UK cabinet. Additionally, the bottom-line was impacted by restructuring actions taken in the quarter. ","We also continued our share repurchase activity in the quarter by buying back 3.7 million shares for $150 million through an accelerated share repurchase plan. With this recent buyback activity, we now expect to deploy at least $100 million to $150 million for share repurchases or acquisitions for the remainder of the year. ","Our first quarter results were in line with our expectations and we are on track with our plan for the year. We affirm our expectation to achieve earnings in the range of $2.48 to $2.63 per share.","Now, I would like to turn the call over to John who will go over our operational and financial performance in detail. John?","John Sznewajs","Thank you, Keith. And good morning, everyone. As Dave mentioned, most of my comments will focus on adjusted performance, excluding the impact of rationalization, the inventory step-up for the purchasing accounting for the Kichler acquisition and other one-time items. ","In addition, any reference to prior period comparisons has been adjusted to reflect the adoption of the new revenue recognition and pension accounting rules. Please refer to page 19 of the earnings call presentation for the details. ","Turning to slide 6, we delivered solid top-line and earnings per share growth in Q1. On a reported basis, sales increased 8% or 5% in local currency. Excluding the divestitures of Arrow Fastener and Moores, and the acquisitions of Mercury and Kichler, sales increased 7% or 5% in local currency. Foreign currency translation favorably impacted our first quarter revenue by approximately $49 million as US dollar weakened against both the euro and the British pound.","In local currency, North American sales increased 7% in the quarter or 5% excluding acquisitions and divestitures. Consumer demand for our industry-leading repair and remodeling products across all the channels of distribution and across all price points drove this performance. ","In local currency, international sales decreased 2% in the quarter. Excluding the divestiture of Moores, international sales increased 2% driven once again by Hansgrohe.","Gross margins declined approximately 150 basis points compared to the first quarter of last year to 32.6%, principally due to the strategic growth investments we discussed on our fourth quarter call. The investments include increased display spending and depreciation in plumbing and launch costs related to the Cardell cabinet program at Menards, as well as a lag in price costs in plumbing and cabinetry. These items aggregate approximately $30 million. ","Our SG&A as a percent of sales decreased to 10 basis points to 19.5% as we continue to leverage our SG&A while making strategic investments to drive profitable growth. We\u2019ve achieved operating profit of $250 million with operating margins of 13%.","Our EPS was $0.45 in the quarter, an improvement of 13% compared to the first quarter of 2017. As a reminder, our adjusted EPS calculation assumes a 26% tax rate. ","If you look to the balance of the year, we anticipate some of the strategic growth investments will continue into the second quarter. These investments will diminish in Q3 and Q4 leading to a stronger second half of 2018.","As Keith mentioned, our performance in the first quarter was consistent with our operating and we are affirming our annual EPS guidance of $2.48 to $2.63 and our free cash flow estimate of $800 million.","Turning to slide 7, our Plumbing segment delivered another quarter of strong top-line results. Segment sales increased 11%. Excluding the impact of currency and acquisitions, sales increased 5%. This solid performance was driven by growth in our faucet, shower and spa businesses. Foreign currency translation favorably impacted this segment sales by approximately $43 million in the quarter. ","Our North American sales grew 8% in local currency in first quarter as we experienced strong consumer-driven demand for our industry-leading brands with wholesale, large retail, and dealer customers. We also benefited from approximately $10 million of pull ahead sales as customers pulled orders from Q2 into Q1 in advance of the launch of Delta\u2019s new ERP system in early May. ","Additional our spa business continued to outperform the competition as Watkins Wellness leveraged its strong network, innovative new products and industry leading brands to drive growth. ","Our international plumbing sales increased 3% in local currency and Hansgrohe\u2019s focus on key markets continued to yield results with strong growth in both China and Germany. The main drivers of the operating margin decline in Plumbing were higher strategic growth investments including display costs and increased depreciation and as we mentioned on our fourth quarter call, a lag in price costs. These items collectively amount to roughly $20 million.","The higher strategic growth investments will persist into the second quarter but then moderate in Q3 and Q4. We anticipate the price cost lag would dissipate in Q2 as our pricing and cost containment actions are fully realized. ","As a reminder, there will be incremental cost of approximately $5 million in each of Q2 and Q3 related to Delta\u2019s ERP implementation. ","While we have recently made investments in our Plumbing business, we will leverage these growth investments and when coupled with the improving price cost relationship, we expect in 2018 this segment will grow 4% to 6% with operating margins similar to our 2017 margins. ","Turning to slide 8, Decorative Architectural Products segment grew 10%. This performance was driven by another quarter of strong growth in various pro initiatives and our acquisition of Kichler in early March. Excluding the acquisition of Kichler, sales grew 4%. And as a reminder, that this segment is mostly impacted by the new revenue recognition accounting rule, and all comparisons reflect the application of this new rule in both 2017 and 2018.","Operating income in the first quarter matched the first quarter of 2017. The benefit of increased volume was offset by strategic growth investments and increased legal and other variable expenses. We continue to face raw material cost pressure in the paint category, we are diligently working to mitigate the impact of this inflation. And as a remainder, the acquisition of Kichler will increase our depreciation and amortization expense by approximately $20 million on an annual basis. ","Turning to slide 9. In the Cabinetry segment, sales declined 6% in the quarter, excluding the impact of the Moores divestitures sales decreased 1%, primarily due to declines in our new construction business. This build of business continues to be impacted by the effect of lost business in the second quarter of 2017, which we will anniversary here in the second quarter.","Our repair and model business performed well in the quarter, KraftMaid solid performance in our repair remodeling business delivered mid-single-digit growth to increased volume. In addition, [indiscernible] of our Cardell program [indiscernible] is on schedule and we were pleased with this program initial performance. Segment and profitability declined in the quarter by $12 million principally due to the approximate $10 million investment related to the Cardell retail cabinet win and a price cost lag. We expect this lag will abate in the second quarter as our cost control and pricing actions are realized. ","Turning to slide 10, our Windows segment sales increased 4% and excluding the impact of currency increased 2% in the quarter. Excluding the divestiture of Arrow Fastener, sales grew 12% or 9% in local currency. Foreign currency translation favorably impacted this segment sales by approximately $4 million. This performance was driven by strong growth across all channels in Milgard, which grew mid-teens percent in the quarter. Milgard\u2019s strong growth was due to increased volume, a positive mix shift towards our premium window and door products and favorable pricing. Segment profitability in the quarter decreased 4 million, largely due to the Arrow divestiture in restructuring costs in our UK Window operations. ","And turning to slide 11, we ended the quarter with approximately $500 million of balance sheet liquidity, as well as full availability on our $750 million revolving credit facility. During the quarter, we repatriated approximately $425 million to partly fund the acquisition of Kichler. Working capital as a percent of sales increased 340 basis points versus the prior year to 18%, largely due to the impact of the Kichler acquisition. Kichler\u2019s total working capital is added to the numerator of this metric but only 21 days of sales were added to the denominator. As such working capital as a percent of sales will decline throughout the year as an increasing the amount of Kichler sales impact this metric. ","Further, while Kichler\u2019s business model lends itself higher levels of working capital, than most of Masco\u2019s other businesses, we believe to our deployment of Masco operating system tools, there is significant opportunities to further improve this metrics overtime. During the quarter, we continued our focus on shareholder value creation by repurchasing 3.7 million shares valued at approximately $150 million. ","Finally, I am happy to report that Moody\u2019s recently upgraded our credit rating to investment grade. And as a result of its action, our credit rating is now investment grade with a three leading credit rating agencies, Standard & Poor\u2019s, Fitch and Moody\u2019s.","And with that, I\u2019ll now turn the call back over to Keith. ","Keith Allman","Thank you, John. I am pleased with our team\u2019s execution. We are on plan and we are off to a good start in 2018. Fundamentals driving our business remain strong. Demographics, namely the large millennial group are increasingly favorable and should drive household formations and housing for years to come. ","Home prices are appreciating, up over 5% year-over-year, boosting consumers\u2019 confidence to invest in their homes. Consumer confidence is up 8% year-over-year, the highest levels it\u2019s been in 18 years. And US residential housing stock is aging, a key driver of repair and remodel spending with 70% of homes in the United States now over 25 years old. We are executing our strategies to capitalize on these strong fundamentals. ","In Plumbing, we are driving strong top-line growth while investing for the future across our diverse plumbing platform, particularly at Delta and Hansgrohe. In Decorative, we are investing behind our powerful Behr brand to continue the growth of our pro paint initiatives along with our partner the Home Depot. And we are excited about the opportunities with Kichler, our new lighting business. ","In cabinetry, we are on track with a significant new retail program launch and continue to drive sales growth in our repair and remodel business. And in windows, we are increasing share with our market leading Milgard brand. ","Our leading brands on a strong execution generate robust free cash flow and we will continue to deploy that cash flow with a disciplined and balanced approach to acquisitions with a right fit and return, share buybacks and dividends to create value for our shareholders. ","With that, I will now open up the call for Q&A. Back to you Regina. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question will come from the line of Stephen Kim with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. ","Stephen Kim ","Thanks very much, guys. And appreciate all the color. In particular I wanted to ask about the strategic and price cost lag. I was curious -- you gave a lot of information but I was curious if you could help us out a little bit with a breakdown of how much was related to specifically strategic growth versus price cost in your segments in the quarter. And then also as part of that particularly in Plumbing, I think that you\u2019d indicated you thought that you would do about $4 million in the first half of \u201818. I was wondering whether or not that expectation had changed for strategic growth?","John Sznewajs","So yes, Stephen, good morning. If you think about that $30 million of strategic growth and price cost that you called out, and obviously a big chunk of that $10 million is related to Menards spend for the recap program we\u2019re launching under the Cardell brand. ","As it relates to the Plumbing segment, there are really two pieces there. One is what you highlighted, some of the display spend that we incurred in the quarter. The other portion of that is increase depreciation and as you may recall, I think we [cost out] in the last several costs. [We placed] to new facilities in Hansgrohe, our distribution center last year and we\u2019re investing in a new plating facility for them over in Germany and Ireland, so that is causing our depreciation to tick up a little bit. But that obviously was funding future growth for that business, which has performed very strongly globally for the last several years. ","And then the last piece of that. And that\u2019s all in, I come to have plenty investment of achieving a display spend and the depreciation roughly split evenly about 5 million each, so 10 million in aggregate. And the third $10 million is really price cost. And that affected principally the Plumbing segment, but also a little bit in the Cabinetry segment as well.","Stephen East","And then when you talk about the price cost improving beginning in 2Q, I believe Keith that with your expression. Just wanted to be clear there and you\u2019ve laid out, I think the strategic growth investments, so we can model that. But on the input price lag, price cost lag, could you give us a sense, are you actually expecting that to flip positive in 2Q or simply diminish the negative headwind in 2Q. At what point, I mean do you anticipate that will actually flip positive?","John Sznewajs","Stephen, John here. As we look at it, I think what we\u2019re doing is the pricing that we put in the market and across our segments is actually just recovering prices. So, I think by the end of the second quarter will be flush with the raw material inflation that we\u2019ve incurred in the market. ","Stephen East","Okay. And as part of that are you expecting input costs to continue to inflate from here in your outlook or is that, are you anticipating it just sort of where we are right now?","John Sznewajs","Look across our portfolio of businesses. I think the base metals copper and zinc have been -- they rose is in the second quarter starting on early second quarter of last year. And have been relatively narrow trading then since then. So, we\u2019re not anticipating significant movement in either copper or zinc. So, I think that should be relatively stable through the balance of the year. And across our other product categories, I think for the most part will be stable. The one that we will keeping close eye on, the input costs to paid. All-in-all now approaching $70 a barrel and as affecting derivative to go into paint. We are keeping to close eye on how that both the engineered resins that go into paint move as well as CIO2 moves and I think as we said earlier in the year mid-single-digit inflation and input costs to paint, would be out of realm of possibility here in 2017.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matthew [indiscernible] with Barclays. Please go ahead. ","Unidentified Analyst","I guess maybe shifting to the growth side of things. Keith talking about some of these investments you\u2019re making in Plumbing across the new displays and then some of the investments John, you just mentioned with Hansgrohe. Is there a way to just kind of help us understand some of the timing of the fruits of all that investment? And maybe just elaborate on where do you see growth kind of heading in that segment as we move through the year and into next year? Thank you. ","Keith Allman","As often as the case Matt, when you make these growth investments you earn your way [and] you leverage them in subsequent periods and that\u2019s the case certainly with some of the investments we\u2019ve made to support growth in our Hansgrohe business. But we\u2019ve invested in a new logistics center in Germany which obviously supports the base business but also is key as we endeavor to be a leader in the e-business space which requires that quicker delivery with higher fill rates et cetera.","We have made some investments across many of our segments, in pro paint for example, but in plumbing also where we\u2019re investing in [field industry] and people to drive revenue and their productivity comes overtime. ","Really what we are looking at is to start to leverage these investments, specifically to your question on plumbing, into the back half of the year. So, while we think about our expectations for growth, that hasn\u2019t changed, when we think about margin, we think it\u2019s going to be similar to the full year versus last year -- full year \u201818 versus last year \u201817. And with the pressures that we\u2019ve seen in price costs and all the growth investments that we are putting into this segment, we think that that\u2019s pretty good performance.","Unidentified Analyst ","Got it. Thank you for that. My next question, I wanted to ask about cabinets, alongside some of the investment spending with Menards, did you actually recognize revenue from that new business during this quarter or is that still something that we\u2019re going to expect to more meaningfully impact the top-line as we move through the year? Thank you.","John Sznewajs","Yes, Matt. It\u2019s John. We did recognize a little bit of revenue here in Q1. But to your point, I think what you\u2019ll see as the year progresses, that you will see greater and greater revenue come from that program as it begins to approach its run rate of about $80 million on an annual basis.","Keith Allman","It\u2019s a good program for us. We\u2019ve worked hard to capture a chunk of our business. It supports our profitable growth objective in this segment. And as John mentioned, its meaty, it will be $80 million program and we expect to hit that run rate by the end of the year. ","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Nishu Sood with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Nishu Sood ","Thank you. Yes, going back to Plumbing for a minute, the price commodity effects in first quarter, I think as you folks have talked about it in the past, it normally takes about two quarters for cost increases to come through and most of the time even I think in the fourth quarter you are able to get price ahead of that. So just wanted to understand what was mechanism, why the shortness in the effect in first quarter? And does it have to do with -- I think you mentioned some pull forward of sales ahead -- I don\u2019t know if I heard this right, the ERP implementation, was that a confounding factor here, I was just wondering if you could talk to that a bit please?","John Sznewajs","Sure. As it relates to price commodity element, recall that commodities elevated starting in the second quarter of 2017. And so, the P&L impact hit our income statement exactly as we would anticipate in the first quarter. And to your point, as we get out in pricing, obvious we don\u2019t get pricing in every customer at the same time. So, there was a little bit of a lag of putting price into the marketplace. And so, we feel really good about where we -- how our team's reacted to the commodity inflation and how they are actively offsetting price with -- are offsetting inflation with both price, as well as cost containment activities within their own operations. As it relates to the pull forward, no I don\u2019t think that the pull forward effective 10 million in Delta, really compounded the price costs affected all. That is really more or customers ensuring to take that inventory on hand as we go through our ERP implementation.","Keith Allman","Nishu, this is Keith. I think when you think about the impact of the growth investment that\u2019s continuing into Q2 as depreciation as we talked about. And then continued display spending and some ERP spend Delta. And if you look at -- if you recall last year, Q2, we had real strong margin performance. So, I think it was north of 21%. So, thinking about our Plumbing margins, they will likely be down in the second quarter to the same degree that there were down last year. But definitely expect expansion in the third quarter as we begin to particularly leverage the growth investment. So, for the full year, we expect Plumbing margins to be similar to last year. And as I mentioned given the work and the money we\u2019re spending on growth and the way we handle to price costs. We think that\u2019s good performance. ","Nishu Sood ","And then on paint. Obviously, the outline volumes in the market has been kind of soft, but there has been outperforming also very strong, strong performance on the pro side. Just trying, if you could give us a sense of how DIY volumes and the momentum in pro paint continued in the first quarter?","Keith Allman","We think, we\u2019re about flat in DIY all-in and overall for the DIY market that low-single-digit. We really haven\u2019t come out low-single-digit growth, we really haven\u2019t changed our opinion and where that will fall out. In terms of pro, we continue strong growth in that segment and we are continuing to invest even more into that. So overall, when we think about the paint market, we think it\u2019s pretty good particularly, when you look at our performance versus that market with the strong BEHR brand, our outstanding partner in Depot and our quality and service levels. ","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Michael Rehaut with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. ","Neal BasuMullick","It\u2019s Neal BasuMullick for Mike. So, I guess continuing on [page 8] you touched a little bit on this. But can you talk a bit about what you\u2019re doing right on price cost?","Keith Allman","Well, I think what we\u2019re doing right is continuing to perform like we demonstrated over the better part of a decade. And that is over the price commodity, over the commodity cycles as we go through them, while, there is leads and lags on both side of that. We\u2019ve been able to come out flush and mitigate those impacts overtime. I think, what we\u2019re doing extremely well in this segment is working with our partner to Home Depot to keep these pressures and balance strategically and to together invest for growth in this segment and that\u2019s really paying off. I think our relationship with Depot has never been stronger as evidenced by our performance overall and both DIY and pro. And I think I\u2019ve point to that as something we\u2019re doing well as well. ","Neal BasuMullick","And then I guess kind of factoring that what do you see as pace of margin recovery through the year. Specifically, how much do you think, you can pick-up in Q2?","Keith Allman","Well, it\u2019s important to note as John mentioned that the decor segment has been affected by the revenue recognition accounting standards, more than any other of our segments. So, when you recast our margins for decor, they were 19% last -- prior year quarter and 17.2% this quarter. A big driver of that, far and away was the Kichler\u2019s acquisition. Their margins are in that low double-digit range, lower than the high teens that we\u2019ve typically experienced in this segment. ","So, recast that Kichler acquisition is call it 150, 200 basis points on average per quarter. So, when we look at our base business with the inflation we\u2019ve experienced in the paint rods, and the actions we\u2019ve taken to improve that price cost relationship, plus the expansion of our pro initiative, plus additional hub store employees and outside pro reps to continue to drive the volume, we\u2019re expecting modest margin erosion for the full year. And again, when you look at all the investments we are making and the state of the commodities, that\u2019s pretty good. ","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Samuel Eisner with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. ","Samuel Eisner","Yes, thanks so much. And good morning, everyone. Just maybe sticking on the just Keith your comment on the modest margin erosion. I think prior to the Kichler acquisition you had made a comment that you expected margin degradation given price cost headwinds that would less than the 2017 levels, obviously that was before the Kichler transaction. So, I was wondering if we can may be just parse out, do you still expect kind of the base core business to still see margin compression this year, what your prior comment inclusive of Kichler as well, just any kind of greater clarity there would be helpful?","Keith Allman","Sure, Sam. With -- restated for the accounting changes, with Kichler our revised long-term margin expectations are in that 16.5% to 18.5% and we\u2019ve been operating at a higher end of that range and we expect to continue that through \u201818. ","With regards to the base decorative business, that\u2019s what my prior comment referred to. We are expecting modest erosion in that base business. ","Samuel Eisner","That\u2019s helpful. And then maybe your I recognize it\u2019s maybe a little bit for this question but Kichler you own now for just about two months. Maybe you can talk about kind of looking at that business what surprises you both positively and negatively now that you guys have your hands on it, where there are opportunities for margin expansion given the fact that it's going to be a driving on the business going forward. Maybe just an overall update on how Kichler stands two months in?","Keith Allman","No negative surprises whatsoever. The surprises for me really have been positive. I knew going in through the due diligence that they were particular focused on the consumer and that they were product driven and understood the trends ahead of the actual trend being realized and we had a very short development cycle, that\u2019s really impressed me and has been a positive side. ","In terms of the integration process, very smooth, very smooth. We have integrated treasury, risk management and legal. We are rolling out the introduction to the Masco operating system and they\u2019ve been very receptive and very eager to be part of the team. We have met with a significant number of key customers and that transition has been seamless. This is a good business for us. It fits in many ways in terms of the channel and the overlap. It fits with regards to the importance of influencers in this purchase journey in terms of designers and showroom associates which is very close to a lot of the work we do and in Plumbing and what we do in the aisle and paint. So, we\u2019re excited about being able to add value to Kichler. And honestly, we\u2019re excited about being able to learn from them as well. So very positive integration. ","Samuel Eisner","If I can just sneak one more in just John on freight cost this quarter or for the year. How you\u2019re thinking about that? What is the percentage of COGS just an overall kind of update on freight as a relates to your price cost discussion that you\u2019re getting earlier? Thanks. ","John Sznewajs","In terms of freight or distribution logistics costs, for the most part, a lot of our products are sent on standard distribution runs. And we\u2019re not expecting around incurring much incremental inflation. We are seeing just a tough of inflation is on some of the more ad hoc or short-haul runs that we make. And so, at this point in the game, it\u2019s not really that impactful to us. Keeping to close eye on it and but if I make certain that it doesn\u2019t exacerbate over the of course of the year. But right now, we think, we got that in pretty good control. ","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Susan Maklari with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. ","Chris Counihan","This is Chris on for Susan. Thanks for taking my questions. Can you mention Cabinet sales\u2026","Keith Allman","Chris, could you speak up just a touch? ","Chris Counihan","Yes, sure. So, you mentioned before that your lower Cabinet sales and build to direct channel due to your margin rationalization efforts in that business. Once you left that impact, how quickly do you expect to return to positive growth and what do you expect your run rate growth to be exiting 2018?","John Sznewajs","Yes. [indiscernible] for the full year 2018 excluding the divestiture of Moores, we expect the top-line growth in this segment coming [ph] at 5% to 7% range. And so [indiscernible] we can pivot to growth further quickly. Once we get the anniversary of this loss business behind us. ","Chris Counihan","And turning to Windows, I mean you had strong performance at Milgard this quarter. Can you just walk us through some of the aspects driving the favorable pricing environment there and just the overall strength you\u2019re seeing on that side of the business?","Keith Allman","Really, Milgrad's growth was driven by their brand strength and their value proposition. This business has done exceedingly well with regards to lead times and fill rates. And we found clearly when we stub our toes and don\u2019t do well that affects us. And we\u2019ve got some of the problems that we\u2019ve had a year ago, well behind us. We\u2019ve got a new leader in that business and a new leadership team and that focus is really what\u2019s driven the growth. That value proposition resonates with dealers, so we\u2019ve got an outstanding dealer network out there and that\u2019s very productive for us both in terms of big box and dealers and also the build a business that we choose to do out there. So, it\u2019s really the Milgard value proposition that\u2019s driving the growth. ","John Sznewajs","And the other thing Chris that I point to you. As you recall this time last year and we were in the midst of the turnaround and I\u2019d say that we did have a relatively easy comp in Q1 compared to Q1 of last year. In the comps we\u2019re going to be a little bit more difficult. So, you might not see the same mid-teens growth out of Milgard as you go deeper into 2018.","Keith Allman","I would say we\u2019re expecting full year sales growth in that range of 6% to 8% excluding the Arrow divestiture on that. And on the margin side, we\u2019re going to see some expansion, but I\u2019d remind you that, we do have continued ERP expense. And the ERP implementations are going very well and we will have continued ERP expense. So, while we are expecting margin expansion for the year, we probably won't make it to that long-term guidance for that 10% to 13%.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Dennis McGill with Zelman & Associates. Please go ahead. ","Dennis McGill","Hi. Good morning, guys. First question is on cabinets. You talked to mid-single-digit growth in repair and remodel. Can you split that between home centers and dealers and then also just discuss what you are seeing if any variance on price points and promotions?","John Sznewajs","Yes, so a couple of questions and again in terms of our remodeling growth between the various channels of distribution, we are really not breaking that out obviously, traffic stands across both home centers and dealers and both are positive. And so, we are feeling good about how that performed in the quarter.","Keith Allman","I think the retail promotion environment was a little bit elevated year-over-year in Q1 but just a touch. We would expect may be a slight increase in promotions for the full year but really not a whole lot. I think the retailers who view this class, this aisle is something that has a lot of add-on sales obviously so I think that\u2019s lucrative for them. And obviously as you know Dennis, they set their price and their promotional schedules and we support them where it makes profitable growth sense for us. So, pleased with the promotional levels. I think we are competitive where it's at [indiscernible].","Dennis McGill","And then the other part of my three-part question there was on the price plan \u201818, anything that stands out as far as within the cabinet business?","John Sznewajs","Our semi-custom product is doing real well and that\u2019s obviously on a bit of a higher end of the continuum. And when you look at the market data whilst it\u2019s tough as you know with the -- to take a judgment on the market with a couple of month's worth of data but the semi-custom piece is doing well. We\u2019re outperforming the market gaining share. So, I would say that for the areas that we compete in that semi-custom space is pretty strong. ","Dennis McGill","Okay. And then Keith for you. On the ERP within Delta, [indiscernible] a little bit across just the ERP implementations, I think it drove the disruption in the windows business as well, how confident are you that this can be implemented without disruption for you guys or your customers? ","Keith Allman","I am really confident in our preparation. We have been at this for a long time. At Delta we have moved some of our high potential talent over there. We have highlighted -- excuse me hired external people to come in, in both program management as well as quality. While -- you mentioned Milgard, while we had a little bit issue initially I will tell you that our last two implementations, planned implementations on Milgard are going very well and it was one of our biggest plans that we recently did. So, there\u2019s always inherent risk with ERP systems. I am really confident in the Delta team.","Dennis McGill","Yes, we\u2019ve incorporated a lot of the lessons learnt on the prior ERP implementations. The Delta team and to Keith\u2019s point has done just a tremendous job of preparing for this. And we are very confident in their ability to execute. ","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Stephen East with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. ","Stephen East ","Keith maybe turning back to Kichler a little bit. Could you tell -- as you look over, call it, the next 3 years or so what do you think is would be normalized growth rate for you and an up-margin rate for you? And then, I believe you source primarily from China. Steel tariffs, any tariffs impacting you all? And do you have opportunities for alternative sourcing?","Keith Allman","Well, in terms of -- there are a couple of questions in there. In terms of the overall margin that low-double-digit margin that we\u2019ve talked about in the past we\u2019re obviously going to continue to drive that up. We see opportunities from support and synergies not only in the working capital area, but also in some of the gross margin areas around procurement costs and those sorts of things. With regard to tariffs, the primary commodity here is class. And then on the steel side, we\u2019re really at this point haven\u2019t seen any tariffs because it\u2019s not tariffs are targeted or being levied towards value added products. ","So, so far, we\u2019re in good shape there and I would tell you that, when you look at the decorative lighting fixture industry, it follows a very similar model. So, should there be any price or excuse me cost pressures, we\u2019d be in the soup with all of our competition. So, it really comes down to supply chain management to vendor development et cetera. So, we\u2019re pretty confident in our ability to compete those, in those areas. And we see improvement opportunities as we start to get more into the business.","John Sznewajs","Stephen, as it relates to growth, we think the growth of Kichler will be very similar to the overall segments growth of 4% to 6% overtime.","Stephen East ","Okay. 4% to 6%. All right. That\u2019s helpful. And then the other question I had is, we\u2019ve had a lot of news in the paint side, the DIY channel over at Lowe\u2019s. Do you think as you get into the second half of this year in the first quarter of this year, promo spending for you all in this sector increases?","Keith Allman","No. I wouldn\u2019t characterize it that way. I mean, we\u2019ve seen some promo increase in the last quarter as different brands and different products are launched and that's normal. But I\u2019m not particularly expecting any significant increase in promo. If you look across the different players in the industry, I think our partners demonstrated some of the best discipline. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Lovallo with Bank of America. Please go ahead. ","John Lovallo","First one, I think on Hansgrohe, it looks like, it was a 3% year-over-year. That seems like, it\u2019s a bit of a slowdown over the past couple of quarters. I think it\u2019s been running kind of in the high-single-digits. Anything you could point to there?","John Sznewajs","Yes. Generally, saw good growth in Germany and China as I mentioned in our prepared remarks. So, we did see a little bit softness in the UK and a little bit slower growth in some of the Southern European countries growth. But now the stronger growth as we experienced in prior quarters. So just a little bit of a pullback in some out there, some of their core markets, but overall, their home country of Germany has done well and their emerging market growth has been just terrific. ","Keith Allman","And we\u2019re seeing good -- we\u2019re seeing the growth better around higher and actual brand as I mentioned as well as our good segment and we think in terms of good, better, best. And I think that\u2019s always from me a good indication of solid market performance when you have both ends of the price continuum growing. ","John Lovallo","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then my second question would be, I just want to make sure I understood this correctly. In terms of the raw material pricing dynamic, I think you\u2019d mentioned in segment quarter you\u2019ve going to catch up on the pricing side, is that really by the end of the second quarter, would you still anticipate a negative impact 2Q?","John Sznewajs","I think there will be modest impact in Q2 and will improve as we go through the quarter. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kathryn Thompson with Thompson Research Group. Please go ahead. ","Unidentified Analyst ","Good morning. This is Stephen on for Kathryn. Plumbing, the margin came in lower than expected. I guess can you maybe balance the mix impact. I am little surprised with the strength in Watkins, I figured the margin decline would be less than it was?","Keith Allman","The margin was really driven by our growth investment as we talked about in displays and in some depreciation of those assets that we put into support growth, new plating line, a new distribution center over in Hansgrohe. We had a little bit of a price commodity lag. So together those as John mentioned are about $20 million. ","John Sznewajs","Not much of a mix impact in the quarter, we have a little bit of mix but not much at all.","Unidentified Analyst ","Alright. And then maybe stepping back with a higher-level view. If this strength in trend to lower price point starter homes continues throughout the year, do you see any product gaps in your portfolio that you need to invest more in or acquire or do you expect one segment to benefit more on volume side than another? Thanks. ","Keith Allman","We\u2019ve paid particular attention over the years to make sure that we have a broad assortment where applicable whilst the opening price point does tend generally to have lower margins. They are not as low and as not as bigger as a spread as there once was as we work on both procurement and shop floor productivity and variable cost productivity. So, we are in pretty good shape. And I think that\u2019s evidenced by -- I\u2019ll go through a couple of them that stand out for me, and our Watkins spa business, world leader in that space with very strong performance in the high end. We have also worked to come in to get more reasonably priced good level of product that we can sell online. And that\u2019s going very well. We have recently re-launched our Peerless brand which is an opening price point brand in plumbing and that\u2019s taken up very well and is getting good positioning on the shelf. When we look at our ability to land profitable growth in Menards, that required some outstanding value engineering and brand positioning with regards to the opening price point as well as having a packaged on the semi-custom piece. So, our mantra is we need to be where our customers are buying from a channel perspective which obviously is e-business and we need to be where they are buying from a performance perspective as well. So, this is -- we put a lot of work and this happened over several years. ","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Alex Rygiel with B. Riley FBR. Please go ahead.","Alex Rygiel","Keith in your opening comments, you mentioned you\u2019re very pleased with the quarter and on-plumbing an aggregate. Could you comment on 2 or 3 surprises in the quarter either positive or negative that maybe you didn\u2019t anticipate three months ago that you\u2019re taking action on today?","Keith Allman","I expect the Kichler integration to go well, it\u2019s exceeded my expectations. I knew that there would be, we knew that there would be a price cost lag, and that we would be able to manage that. And that lent [ph] as expected, I would tell you, we got a little bit of a logistics headwind that I wasn\u2019t quite ready for so of speak, we didn\u2019t expect as a relates to some of the rules and how over the road truckers manage their time. And that\u2019s driven the cost up a little bit. Oil started to pierce north a little bit more than I probably expected. So, in the cost basket, there\u2019s been some higher than expected, lower-than-expected but on average, I think we\u2019re about ready for it. So, I think, I would characterize this quarter significantly more as on plan that I would surprises.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Keith Hughes from SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Please go ahead. ","Keith Hughes","Most of the questions have been answered, but with a heavy share repurchase in the quarter, what is the ending share count?","John Sznewajs","I think it\u2019s around 3.10, Keith. ","Keith Hughes","And you highlighted in the prepared texts, another share repurchase number. Is that in addition to what we saw in the first quarter?","John Sznewajs","Yes, that was either, again, we were careful with our wording there. We said either 100 million to 150 million of either additional share repurchases or M&A throughout the balance of the year. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Phillip Ng with Jefferies. Please go ahead. ","Phillip Ng ","Given the moving pieces in decorative. Just curious, how should we think about margins for the full year and to offset some of these headwinds you are seeing. Is that more on the price side to cost side and then in a rising raw material environment. How quickly can you kind of pass that through?","Keith Allman","As we talked a little bit about before Phillip, you think about the base business now separate that, because we\u2019re in the middle of the Kichler acquisition. The base business, we would expect margin erosion, slight margins, modest margin erosion is how we\u2019re characterizing it. When you think about the effect on this segment from the Kichler acquisition that would be in a range of 150 to 200 basis point reduction. ","Phillip Ng ","And then in terms of your ability to kind of pass that through from a pricing standpoint is it like a quarter lag, 2 quarters? How should we think about that?","Keith Allman","We have a significant customer concentration. So, we don\u2019t talk about specific pricing actions in there. And I go back to my prior comment over the long-term of price commodity fluctuations we tend to stay flush. ","Phillip Ng ","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And just one last one for me from a top-line perspective, pretty encouraging strong start in light of some the weather-related issues, some of the other companies have talked about. The market obviously nervous about higher rates. Just curious how inflated is your business and any early reads on the spring selling season? Thanks.","Keith Allman","We don\u2019t believe that rising interest rate is going to put a break on housing, full stop. The 10-year bond is up about 45 basis points since year-end. Mortgages rates are about 4.5% and we have that level of 2014. We are almost if not, almost there to 85% repair and remodeling which is significantly less than sort of the interest rates. Our home equity lending is a very small part of the R&R market financing nowadays. The biggest driver in our opinion our expanded real wage growth and home price appreciation, consumer confidence, all those are positive. ","Our affordability, particularly when you look at historical standards, still very good. Our view is that the market can digest a steady gradual increase in interest rates and that recurring model is a spend that\u2019s more around a lifestyle decision as opposed to say a tax decision or an interest rate decision. So rising rates, generally signal a good economy and we do well in good economy. So, we don\u2019t expect a break in \u201818 or \u201819 as it relates to rising interest rates. ","Operator","Our final question will come from the line of Ken Zener with KeyBanc. Please go ahead. ","Ken Zener","Good morning, gentlemen. The last question is basically without the rising interest rates, which categories, realizing you are obviously 85% R&R and we have favorable view of R&D tied to rising prices with the homeowners equity, how if rates are going up though, full stop, I heard you guys, which categories would be more susceptible when you think about price points, so think about paint versus cabinets which might be more tied to cabinets, faucets under renovation. Could you just discern it your comments a little bit by price point if you would? Thank you very much.","John Sznewajs","I don\u2019t think it\u2019s so much price continuum variation as it is new construction versus R&R. So, I would look more to the new -- the higher new construction segments as potentially being more impacted by that. But as I am out in the market and I look at the issues around new construction, it\u2019s not rate, it\u2019s more capacity and skill trades and the ability to get the jobs completed. So, I would maybe twist my answer and not go on a price continuum discussion, it\u2019s a more of a new construction impact than as I said we\u2019re about 85% R&R.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude today\u2019s conference call.

Welcome to Masco Corporation's First Quarter 2013 Conference Call. My name is Tiffany, and I will be your operator for today's call. As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded for replay purposes. [Operator Instructions]","I will now turn the call over to Vice President of Investor Relations, Maria Duey. Maria, you may begin your conference.","Maria Duey","Thank you, Tiffany, and good morning to everyone. Welcome to Masco Corporation's First Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me on our call today are Tim Wadhams, President and CEO of Masco; and John Sznewajs, Masco's Vice President, Treasurer and Chief Financial Officer.","Our first quarter earnings release and the presentation slides that we will refer to during the call are available on the Investor Relations portion on our website. Following our prepared remarks, the call will be open for analyst questions. [Operator Instructions] If we are unable to take your question during the call, please feel free to call me directly at (313) 792-5500.","I'd like to remind you that statements in today's presentation will include our views about Masco's future performance, which constitute forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. We have described these risks and uncertainties in our Risk Factors and other disclosures in our Form 10-K and our Form 10-Q that we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","Today's presentation also includes non-GAAP financial measures. We've provided reconciliation of these adjusted measurements to GAAP on our website at www.masco.com.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Tim Wadhams. Tim?","Timothy Wadhams","Thank you, Maria, and thank all of you for joining us today for Masco's First Quarter 2013 Earnings Call. And if you would please move to Slide #4. We're pleased with our first quarter results, and that gets pretty tough comparison given the first quarter of 2012. And we certainly feel like we're off to a good start in 2013.","Our Q1 performance reflects the strength of Masco's brands, our leadership position within the building products markets and our leverage to a continuing housing recovery. Our sales growth was driven by our execution against an increase in North American new home construction activity, which particularly benefited our Cabinet, Installation and Window-related businesses. Our top line also benefited from the new products that we've introduced at retail that continue to outperform our expectations and reinforce our strength in the repair and remodel channel.","We also reached a major milestone by achieving profitability in our North American Cabinet business and a breakeven level of profitability at the segment level for cabinets. And obviously, we're very pleased with that outcome. The improvement in Cabinets, together with our focus on cost containment and our operating leverage, helped us continue our margin expansion. Our segments with European market exposure, which include Cabinets, Other Specialty Products and plumbing, were impacted by the continued weakness in the Eurozone, which, coupled with unusually harsh weather in Europe, caused a drag on our stronger North American results.","And if you would please move to Slide #5. As we communicated in the past, our strategy is focused on 4 key elements to drive performance. We expanded our market leadership by continuing our legacy of introducing new products and programs which matter to our customers and consumers. In North America, our faucet and toilet businesses benefited -- benefiting from recent product introductions, delivered high-teens growth. And our Decorative Architectural business, which includes our paint and builders' hardware, continue to win new opportunities. Installation services is responding to new home construction growth by strategically adding greenfield locations in markets where activity is strong and the recovery is well underway.","We also had another good quarter from a cost reduction standpoint. We continue to benefit from restructuring actions, our focus on lean and our efforts in supply chain. And John will talk a little bit more about the outcome later on, but certainly pleased with our continued progress there.","We're coming off a solid 2012 in terms of our Cabinet and Installation segments in their improvement and had a lot of momentum coming into the first quarter, and we're really pleased with our first quarter results as it relates to Cabinets and Installation. On a combined basis, in aggregate again, those 2 segments improved by $24 million in terms of operating profit compared to the first quarter of 2012, and that's despite the first quarter generally being a little bit slower from a seasonality standpoint.","While there's still a lot of work to do, the potential of Installation and Cabinetry is promising when considering their operating leverage and exposure to recovering markets. Our commitment to strengthen our balance sheet is evident in our working capital improvement and our ability to successfully negotiate a new 5-year revolving credit facility. These execution highlights represent what we feel is a very good start to 2013, and we're certainly pleased with our performance coming out of the gate.","And with that, if you move to Slide #6. I'd like to turn the presentation over to John Sznewajs, our CFO. John is going to walk us through our operating performance by segment.","John G. Sznewajs","Thank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. If you could please turn to Slide 7. As Tim mentioned, we entered 2013 with good momentum coming off a strong fourth quarter, and we delivered a solid first quarter this year. Sales increased 4%, with North American sales up 6% for the quarter, and volume increases were strongest in our direct-to-builder channel.","As Tim mentioned, we faced a difficult comp to the favorable weather conditions in the first quarter of last year and unfavorable weather in both the U.S. and Europe in the first quarter of this year. This impacted international sales, which decreased 2% in the quarter, though currency was not an impact in the quarter. I should mention that this material excludes the results of our Danish RTA business, which is now reflected in discontinued ops, and in prior year results, have also been restated. And we are pleased with our bottom line performance as our commitment to cost control helped to increase adjusted operating income 19% to $140 million, with adjusted operating margins of 7.5%, our highest first quarter margin since 2007. And our adjusted operating -- our adjusted EPS nearly doubled in the quarter to $0.13 from $0.07 1 year ago.","If you turn to Slide 8, you can see our operating income bridge for the quarter. Net price and commodity improved approximately $11 million and reflects the year-over-year impact of our metals hedge, which was, coincidentally, $11 million negative in the quarter. The favorability was largely driven by our Cabinet segment. The $6 million increase in net volume and mix was principally driven by volume increases in the Installation and to a lesser degree, in our plumbing and Other Specialty segments. This was partially offset by mix, primarily in our businesses that saw solid growth in sales to new home construction channels and in our plumbing segment, where there's successful new programs and expansion into international markets. We captured $42 million of profit improvements gross in the quarter and believe we are on track to realize our full year profit improvement initiative gross of $150 million.","Turning to Slide 9. You see that our plumbing segment's sales increased 3% in the quarter. The strong sales momentum we've been experiencing with our North American faucet and toilet businesses, which include our leading brands, Delta, Peerless and Brizo, continues in the first quarter. Our sales of these products grew mid-teens percent in the quarter, aided by last year's program wins in the retail channel and strong balanced performance in the trade channel, reflecting our continued investments in the showroom, commercial and multifamily segments of the channel.","Offsetting this growth were weaker sales from our other plumbing companies, including bathing unit sales. As I mentioned in our Q3 call last year, we lost a retail shower surround and tub liner view [ph] and exited a product line. These negatively impacted sales by approximately $17 million in the quarter and will total approximately $40 million for 2013. A noted drag on the segment's top line was our European sales, which declined 2%. While our Hansgrohe unit was relatively flat for the quarter, our other European businesses were down approximately 10%. And year-over-year operating profit declined $19 million, driven by the commodity hedge of $11 million; higher marketing and program costs of about $8 million and a big piece of this relates to a biennial European trade show that we participated in; and then mix, with a negative $7 million in the quarter, which more than offset volume increases and favorable price\/commodity relationships.","If you turn to Slide 10, you can see revenue in our Decorative Architectural segment was flat in the quarter. We experienced growth in both our Pro and Mexico paint initiatives, which was offset by lower U.S. paint volumes, primarily due to a difficult comparison to Q1 last year, where sales increased 16%, driven by strong exterior paint sales. Operating margin expansion in this quarter was aided by relatively easy comparison to the first quarter of 2012 because, at that time, input costs for paint were at a high and we incurred expenses associated with the launch of Behr's reformulated products. Without these headwinds and with a favorable mix of paint products and improved performance at our builder's hardware unit in the quarter, this segment's operating profit increased $16 million.","As we look into the remainder of 2013, Behr intends to drive gallon growth and maintain its legacy as an innovator in the paint category, with 2 new products being placed into Home Depot stores in April and May, including BEHR MARQUEE, the finest exterior paint Behr has ever made, with features such as Paint & Primer in One, world-class durability and the ultimate in dirt and fade resistance. Retails have been targeted at the premium price point; and BEHR DECK OVER, an exciting new deck reservicing product that will be set in all stores by mid-May.","Turning to Slide 11. You can see that we are very pleased with our continued improvement in the bottom line performance of the segment as we broke even in the quarter, something we have not done since Q2 of 2010, when segment sales were more than $100 million higher. While the environment for Cabinetry remains challenging, we saw improvement -- improved performance in the segment, with sales increasing 4%. North American sales increased 5% in the quarter, reflecting strong direct-to-builder sales growth. We are profitable in our North American business and improved our operating results in the quarter by $14 million as a result of pricing realization, cost control and the benefits from prior year restructuring activities. The turnaround planned in North America is on track, and we believe we will realize the $20 million to $25 million of profit improvement resulting from actions taken in late 2012.","Turning to Slide 12. You see that our Installation segment sales grew 12%, principally fueled by higher sales volumes in our residential new construction business, with our commercial, retrofit and distribution businesses relatively flat in the quarter. We expanded our market leadership despite the first quarter seasonally being the weakest quarter for this business. Residential new construction contracting sales increased more than 30% in the quarter, and we continue to focus on increasing our installation sales across all lines of business, resorting [ph] to all builders, but particularly the big builders, including Toll, D.R. Horton, Lennar, Pulte and KB.","In addition to solid top line performance, management's strong execution delivered significantly improved bottom line results, with adjusted operating profit improving by $10 million and adjusted operating margins expanding by 370 basis points. This segment exhibited strong operating leverage in the quarter, delivering nearly 30% incremental margins despite the impact of rising material and labor costs. This business is focused on cost control, coupled with the benefits they're realizing from profit improvement actions to position them to grow profitably with the housing recovery.","Turning to Slide 13. Our Other Specialty Products segment increased a strong 8% in the quarter, driven by our North American window sales increasing more than 20%. This growth was due to higher sales in both the new home construction and replacement window markets and new product introductions. We are particularly pleased that our replacement window sales increased about 10%, reflecting share gains driven by new products. Segment adjusted operating income improved by $7 million, and adjusted operating margins expanded by 550 basis points, resulting from lean and sourcing savings.","And turning to Slide 14. We continue to add strong performance and working capital, as working capital as a percent of sales came in at 14.2%, a 50-basis-point improvement from the first quarter of last year. As Tim mentioned, we entered into a new $1.25 billion revolving credit facility, thanks to the banks that supported us on that transaction. And then, we ended the quarter with about $1 billion of cash on the balance sheet, as we are on a cash burn cycle the first portion of the year as we traditionally are.","So with that, I will turn the call back over to Tim to go through the outlook for the balance of the year.","Timothy Wadhams","Thank you, John. And if you would please move forward to Slide #16. As we've indicated, feel very good about our start in 2013 and certainly feel like we've made strong progress against the priorities we identified at the beginning of the year. These priorities are in support of our strategic initiatives, and as it relates to our Installation and Cabinet business, obviously, certainly pleased with our first quarter results and continue to be confident we'll see continued improvement during the rest of the year.","We continue to support our brands through strategic investments, including geographic expansion and new product launches, which are critical to our future growth. Debt reduction is planned for later this year. I think you're -- most of you are aware that we've got $200 million maturity in August. We'll take care of that with internal funds. And as we step back and think about our progress in the first quarter, we certainly want to thank our employees worldwide for their ongoing efforts to drive Masco's performance.","And if you please move to Slide #17, a couple of comments before we go to Q&A. As we look at the remainder of the year, there is certainly some economic dynamics which we'll need to navigate. European economic uncertainty persists and affects our businesses to varying degrees given their exposure to certain markets. And while new home construction in North America has certainly improved and increased significantly, the composition of starts includes more multifamily homes, which will have an impact on our mix as we go forward.","Commodities, which have, for the most part, been relatively benign for the last couple of 3 quarters, certainly have the potential for increased volatility, especially if demand picks up later this year. Having said that and despite these economic factors, we feel we're well positioned to accelerate our performance as additional opportunities develop. Our strong liquidity enables us to respond to greater demand in new home construction, including realizing share gains with top builders who are seeking stable suppliers with adequate capacity for growth.","Our pipeline of new products at retail, coupled with potential share gains, also represents a key area of growth for us. Our recent success with Delta's programs demonstrates our continued emphasis on innovative solutions for our customers and consumers. And perhaps, more importantly, we can execute against any additional opportunities for growth with a high level of operating leverage, given our continued focus on cost containment.","As we mentioned a couple of months ago, on our fourth quarter call, we came out of 2012 with a fair amount of momentum. We're certainly pleased with our first quarter performance and results, and it looks like our second quarter for 2013 is off to a good start, with April sales, on a preliminary basis, up mid-teens compared to April of 2012.","And with that, Tiffany, we'll open up the lines for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Peter Lisnic with Robert W. Baird.","Peter Lisnic - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I guess on that last sentence there, Tim, with April up mid-teens, can you give us a feel for what you're seeing, particularly on the big ticket, how that translates into that mid-teens growth? I mean, it looks like the window business was up pretty strong. Cabinets had pretty decent growth in North America. Just wondering what you're seeing in terms of the bigger ticket discretionary trends, especially as you kind of roll into the second quarter here.","Timothy Wadhams","Yes, as we go into the second quarter, Pete, the increase in sales was pretty widespread. Cabinets in North America is certainly an area that we saw some good upside in April, and our sense is that there is probably a little bit of a pickup there on the bigger ticket side. Obviously, as John mentioned, we had a good outcome as it relates to windows in the first quarter. So our sense is there's a little bit of momentum there, but I don't think we want to get ahead of ourselves.","Peter Lisnic - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay, all right. And then, if I could transition just to the price cost x that hedge in the first quarter. How should we expect that price cost relationship to trend through the remainder of '12 -- I'm sorry, '13?","John G. Sznewajs","Yes, Pete. Yes, the -- I'd say price\/commodity -- because commodities have been relatively stable, as Tim pointed out a couple of minutes ago, and we've not had as much pricing action in the last year or so except for our Cabinet business. So I think price cost should be slightly positive and then only impacted by the hedge as it moves up or down depending on how copper and zinc move.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert Wetenhall with RBC.","Robert C. Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","It's nice to see all the momentum. I just wanted to see what your expectations are for the paint business in terms of normalized margins and what kind of momentum you're seeing. And also, do you think the $11 million loss that you had in plumbing comes back at some point?","Timothy Wadhams","I'll take the paint question, Bob. In terms of momentum, as we mentioned, John mentioned the first quarter was relatively flat, but we have put that in perspective. Weather last year was very, very positive in the first quarter, and our Decorative Arc was up 16%. This year, the first quarter was much more challenging from the standpoint of weather, and we were basically flat. We did see a nice improvement, again on a preliminary basis, as we go into April. Decorative Architectural segment had very strong lift, if you will, in terms of our expectations for April when we wrap that up. In terms of margins, in that segment, obviously, we had a very good outcome there. I would remind you that as we've indicated in the past, as we continue to pursue growth in this segment, whether it comes from the international side of business or -- which we're investing in or from the Pro side, there's an expectation that the absolute margin on that may be a little bit lower than we previously enjoyed. We've always said that we expect to have a good return on that. John did mention in his remarks that one of the major initiatives for us and Home Depot this year is to drive gallons. We think there's an opportunity with the lift in the economy to go after increased gallons and share, and we certainly feel like that's a joint objective between the 2 of us and one that we think we can execute against. And as we do that, we certainly will be thinking more about absolute profit dollars return on investment, if you will, as we go forward. So we think there's opportunity to grow absolute profit dollars in that segment, and that's certainly an area of focus for us.","John G. Sznewajs","And Bob, you also had a question about the $11 million and whether that will come back. And just to remind everyone on the call as to how that works, is we have to mark to market our hedges at the end of every quarter. So to the extent that copper prices or zinc prices rise from where they ended at the end of March, we should see that come back. Copper was -- has trailed off over the course of the last quarter or so, so there is some possibility that if the economy heats up again, that copper prices could rise and then we'd see a positive mark to market on that hedge at some point in the future. But I'm not predicting copper markets at this point.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dennis McGill with Zelman & Associates.","Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, LLC","On the Cabinet side, could you maybe walk through the year-over-year bridge on the profit improvement between volume cost cuts and then maybe include the retail pricing and promotional strategies that you talked about and maybe elaborate on that last point?","Timothy Wadhams","Yes, Dennis, on the kind of $14 million of improvement that we experienced, I'd say while we don't give out in specifics, I would say the majority of it came from pricing realization, and then the balance, we'd probably evenly split between cost cuts and promotional activity.","Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, LLC","So can you maybe elaborate on the pricing strategies and what you're seeing both on a competitive standpoint and how you guys are reacting in the market and maybe what your forward strategy is on promotions?","Timothy Wadhams","Sure. I think as we talked about on our fourth quarter call, we pulled back on our promotional strategy in the fourth quarter of last year. And we have been very consistent since that time in the way that we've approached our promotional activity, particularly in the retail channel, which is where I think the biggest amount of activity has taken place. So as a result of that, our promotional activities have been fairly consistent through the first quarter since probably the early November time period, Dennis. I would say that we have seen competitors react and be more disciplined in their approach to promotional activity as well, kind of following our lead that we initiated in early November. As a result of that, we did see our retail sales of Cabinetry start to tick up in the middle of the quarter, and it wasn't much of an impact in Q1. Most of that will -- because of the way we ship the products, will hit our financial results in the second quarter.","Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, LLC","And when you think about the difference between dealers and retail, would those comments hold true for both end channels?","Timothy Wadhams","Yes, the promotional have activity would -- had been consistent across both of those channels. Dennis.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Zener with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Can you talk about how price in Installation is benefiting you guys versus, let's say, the volume?","Timothy Wadhams","Yes, I would say in terms of Installation related to price, Ken, generally speaking, if you go back over the last couple of quarters, and this was essentially true in the first quarter as well, price\/commodity relationships for us in that segment have been relatively stable. And so basically, we've been able to offset price either through working with our suppliers, productivity or certainly passing price along into the marketplace. So from our standpoint, there hasn't been a lot of impact there. I think we were slightly positive in terms of price\/commodity in the first quarter, but generally speaking, that relationship has been a neutral for us.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. I guess, as I think about it, I mean, wouldn't the pricing that some manufacturers are talking about be beneficial to you, given that you would just pass it through and perhaps help offset some of your fixed costs?","Timothy Wadhams","Well, it depends on whether you're getting margin on pricing. And as I was indicating, typically the price\/commodity relationship, as we track it, has been neutral. That would suggest to you that we've been able to offset material cost improve -- increases with price, as opposed to necessarily see a significant benefit from it.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then in windows, you really continue to outperform. You had a Western focus in that business. Is it really -- I mean, is it happening at the retail channel, as well as, I guess, some of your share gains amongst the builders? Because it sounded a bit really [indiscernible]...","Timothy Wadhams","Yes, we did see, Ken, both improvement in the builders side of that business and also in the repair\/remodel side through dealers. And I would remind folks that whereas that business was about 75% new home construction 6, 7, 8 years ago, it's about 75% repair\/remodel at this point in time.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","And is this kind of a onetime load-in that we're seeing? I mean, we saw it in the fourth quarter as well. It really is an outstanding result. If you could give more color there, I mean, if it's regional exposure out West or what.","Timothy Wadhams","Yes, there's real no load-in, Ken, associated with that, and it is the regional exposure in the West.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dan Oppenheim with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Daniel Oppenheim - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I was wondering if you can just talk a little bit in terms of the Cabinets. You're talking about the promotions coming down, especially on the retail side. As we see more of the R&R, for instance, sort of big ticket remodeling, then we should see further margin improvement in that business. And is that the way you're looking at it in terms of the outlook for that?","Timothy Wadhams","Yes, that would be the way that we would take a look at that, Dan. With the promotional activity coming down, that should be favorable to us on a gross-to-net basis and therefore, should increase our profitability.","Daniel Oppenheim - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And you're talking about sort of the trends in April being sort of widespread in especially Cabinets. Is that mostly just the new construction coming through? Or is some of that the remodelings? Looking at the installation, I would have thought that might -- I mean, is that -- where are you seeing that? In terms of just mostly the new construction versus the remodeling, where is that coming?","Timothy Wadhams","Yes, the new construction, Dan, would be a little bit stronger, but fair increase in terms of retail as we look at the preliminary results for April.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sam Darkatsh with Raymond James.","Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Wanted to look a little more at the April trends that you talked about, the up mid-teens. Could you break out the favorable benefit from Easter for that, if possible? And then, also remind us what the May and June year-ago comparisons are versus April.","Timothy Wadhams","Yes. No, we really couldn't, Sam, break out the impact in terms of the timing of Easter. Obviously, there are a lot of factors that get into things. Weather in the first quarter was obviously pretty tough. April has been a little bit better. But from that perspective, certainly feel like we're in a pretty good spot given that start to the quarter. And if you think about monthly sales in the second quarter, I think that was your question from last year.","Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Yes. April versus May and June, yes, please.","Timothy Wadhams","Yes, April last year would have been up low-single digits, May was up low-single digits, June was down low-single digits, and that's all in. And if you look at the elimination of foreign currency, I think we would have been right around 3% in terms of excluding foreign currency, and that was pretty constant for all 3 months.","John G. Sznewajs","And Sam, I might add to Tim's commentary that, you may recall, given the strength of the first quarter last year, that we thought there was some pull-forward out of the second quarter into the first quarter. So it's, I think, a relatively easy comparison compared to the second quarter of last year.","Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Got you. And then just a housekeeping question, if I could. You had 40 -- if my math is right, $42 million in D&A in the quarter, and you're guiding to $200 million. How should we look at the progression of D&A as the year progresses?","John G. Sznewajs","Yes, I think it will escalate a little bit, Sam, to get to that $200 million level. I think the actual number, if you factor in that we had to report it this way for reporting purposes, is a little bit higher than the $42 million because we had to layer into our general corp, as well as our discontinued ops. So I think that $42 million goes closer to $48 million for the quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Adam Rudiger with Wells Fargo Securities.","Adam Rudiger - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I think, John, I think it was about a year ago, on your slides, you guys gave sensitivity in the Installation business and in the Cabinets business, kind of a lagged starts number. I was wondering if you had any kind of framework like that you could provide us now.","John G. Sznewajs","Yes, and we do, certainly. We think, right now, for the Installation segment, that we're between $40 million and $45 million in revenue for every 50,000 housing starts, and that's come down just a little bit from what we saw this time last year. In the large part because of the mix of housing starts, more multifamily and more big building mix than single, custom home mix at this time. And then, on the kind of the Cabinet business, I think we've given the number of about $25 million for every 50,000 housing starts. And at this time, it looks like we're around that $20 million number for every 50,000 housing starts so that's kind of -- and for the same reason. We're a bit more multifamily mix and a little bit more big builder mix, which generally has smaller kitchens.","Adam Rudiger - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Great, that's helpful. And then a quick question on plumbing. Margins were a bit choppy last year. What's the right kind of run rate, if there is one, to think about on an ongoing basis in 2013 for the plumbing?","Timothy Wadhams","Yes, Adam, what we've said is that as we think about plumbing, we think that low-teens type margin in that segment is certainly something that we feel is achievable. That would kind of put you in a 12%, 13% kind of area, if you will. And again, we've had a fair amount of investment in that segment for new programs and some launch-related costs, and there is a little bit of choppiness in the numbers. The hedge gets to that a little bit. But generally speaking, we'd be pretty comfortable with sort of that 12%, 13% kind of area.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Nishu Sood with Deutsche Bank.","Rob Hansen - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","This is Rob Hansen on for Nishu. You've done a really good job restructuring the Cabinets business over the past couple of years. And I know you just gave that figure, 50,000 starts yields $20 million in revenue. For $25 million in revenue, you used to -- and 50,000 starts, you used to say $8 million to $10 million in profits. So I just want to see if the changes that you've made over the past couple of years have increased that profit percentage number.","Timothy Wadhams","Yes, Rob, I would continue to use a contribution margin of approximately 30%, which, obviously, $20 million would get you about $6 million. So I think staying with the contribution margin of around 30% is probably the appropriate place to be.","Rob Hansen - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then on the Installation business, I just want to see if you could talk about the kind of split between multifamily and single family. Multifamily seems to be growing a lot faster than single family, so it seems like you guys would have a bit of a tailwind from that. But the numbers are obviously not -- doesn't seem like it's growing as fast. So I just wanted to see if you could -- if I could get your comments around that.","Timothy Wadhams","Well, yes, multifamily has been a higher share of starts for the -- probably, the last 1.5 years or so. And I think in the first quarter, if my memory's correct, I think came in about 40%, which -- maybe a little bit lighter than that, but about around 40%, which is quite a bit higher than traditionally. I think our plan for the year, we assume that we'd be about the same rate as last year, and I think that was about 30% in terms of the total mix for the full year. That obviously has some impact on us. It impacts us in a couple of ways. It reduces our take per unit when we're involved in multifamily, and we tend to have less share as it relates to multifamily. I mean, that's an area that we're focused on and certainly pursuing. But it also extends the lag in terms of the timing of when work is done versus the single-family home. So there are some impacts there that tend to be a negative from a mix perspective. And -- but at the same time, it's business that we're pursuing. There's no question about it.","John G. Sznewajs","And again, maybe to add a little bit of color to Tim's comment on the lag. Anecdotally, we are now insulating multifamily units. They were counted as starts in July and August of last year. So you can see how that lag really does impact this segment of the business, that it's an 8- or 9-month lag compared to our normal 90-day lag with a single-family start.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Goldberg with UBS.","Susan Maklari - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","It's actually Susan this morning. In terms of new products, you guys noted that you have been able to hold your pricing there. Can you just talk a little bit about if there's any change in the sort of advantage that you get in terms of new product pricing versus your traditional more established products and if you expect that to change as we go through the year? And then, as part of that, too, is there anything significant that we should think about that could come through in terms of new products through the year and the sort of benefit that, that could have, without giving any -- too much away there?","Timothy Wadhams","Well, I think you hit the nail on the head there, Susan. We really can't talk about anything that might launch later this year at this point in time, and we certainly will as things develop. John did talk about a couple of paint-related products in his prepared remarks, and I assume you probably caught that. In terms of pricing as it relates to new products, oftentimes, our new products have distinct innovation in them, and that puts us in a position when we're bringing new products with features that really resonate with both our customers and consumers, gives us a little bit of an opportunity from a pricing standpoint to place those. Obviously, we need to be competitive. But I think we've demonstrated over time that when we think about pricing, our ability to cover raw materials is really, I think, the thing that is most important in that equation. And as we've demonstrated over the last couple of years -- and again, we had a couple of years where we were down a little bit in price\/commodity relationships. Last year, we were slightly positive. As John mentioned, in the first quarter, we're up slightly in the first quarter. Those tend to balance out over time. So we think we're in a pretty good place given the strength of our brands, the innovation that we bring to the marketplace to be able to price our products appropriately. And as we've indicated in the past, on incremental volume, generally speaking, as we think about our contribution margin and our leverage, that tends to run about 30%.","Susan Maklari - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then just as a follow-up, have you seen anything changing in terms of the M&A environment as things stabilize a little bit and sort of get back to some kind of a normalized level?","John G. Sznewajs","We are starting to see the M&A environment pick up a little bit, particularly smaller companies. And given the multiples at which building products companies are trading and the prospect for good future earnings, I think a lot of folks have been on the sidelines for a number of years and are starting to consider selling their business, so I think the M&A environment is slowly starting to pick up in our industry.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Rehaut with JP Morgan.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","First question, I wanted  to delve into comments you made, Tim, earlier about Decorative margins and growing the absolute dollars in volume but maybe margin being a little bit different. In the last few years, you've done margins in that business, obviously, it's kind of been, from a margin standpoint, the star of your business, plus or minus 20% for several years. Last year, you were at 18%, and this quarter, you actually also hit the 20% mark. So how are we to think about that going forward? Is it something that over time, over the next 2 years or so, with the strategy, you could expect mid-teens? Or is that too -- is that the right way to think about it?","Timothy Wadhams","No, I wouldn't want to predict where margins might go in that particular category, Mike. I think as you articulated, we've always had nice returns on sales in the segment. I think what we really want to convey to the investment community is that Masco, Behr, Home Depot are basically focused on trying to drive gallons, trying to drive share, trying to drive increases in absolute operating profit dollars, and we think we can do that with a good return on assets. So our sense is that to the extent that we can grow that bottom line and get a good return, that the margins will take care of themselves. We would expect to always have good margins in the segment. We would expect to always have good returns. But the real challenge for us is really try to grow this category, and we're excited about the opportunities. When we think about the Pro opportunity that's out there, when we think about what we've been able to do with the Behr brand in terms of the formulations, the Kilz brand, we think there's an awful lot of upside for us as we look out into the future.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I mean, certainly, there is different levers to pull to get a similar good return. But I mean, is that essentially what you're saying, a little more volume, a little less margin and getting a similar or if not, better return?","Timothy Wadhams","Yes, that would be the dynamic that we would certainly like to try to accomplish.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. Second question on the North American Cabinets growth of 5%. If you kind of do rough numbers and say 25% of that's new construction and that's growing new construction and so even single-family starts growing at 25%, 30%, that would imply a contribution growth of 7%, 8%. What's offsetting that, obviously, Europe is still tough, but the Danish piece is out of the business. Did you -- were you flat or down in the repair\/remodel or dealer channel? If you could kind of walk through the different components of that north -- of the other parts of the growth picture.","John G. Sznewajs","Yes, Mike, it's John. I'll take that one. We were pretty flat in our dealer channel, down a little bit in our retail channel. And that has to do with the fact that, as I mentioned earlier, we've been very disciplined in our promotional activity. Some of our competitors had more aggressive promotions in the back half of the fourth quarter, first part of the first quarter, and that did temporarily take some share away from us. Since those promotions have subsided, I think share has gone back to a more normalized level.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And how do you think about promotions going forward? I mean, you talked about last quarter being -- pricing strategy as being a part of getting back into the dealer channel, but at the same time, you're being more disciplined. So I'm just kind of not sure how to think about it going forward.","John G. Sznewajs","I think you should see the type of activity that we've got now in the marketplace continuing through the near term at least. We've moved away from giving away free products and free finishes and free upgrades and things like that to more of a either percentage or dollar off basis for our Cabinets. And that seems to have resonated well with the consumer. So I think we will continue with that program for the near term, Mike.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of David MacGregor with Longbow Research.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Just maybe a couple of higher-level questions. Let's start with Milgard. What's the long-term plan here for this? It's your smallest business. Prior to the downturn, you were beginning to open sales offices, moving east, but it's always been talked about as kind of a West Coast brand. You're banging up against 4 or 5 big national brands. What's the long-term plan for growing this business profitably?","Timothy Wadhams","Well, we're excited about the long-term plan, David, in relation to Milgard. I would point out that Milgard is the share leader in the West Coast market, the region where they participate, and that's basically west of the Rockies, and has taken share over the course of the last 4, 5 years. And so it's a very highly regarded brand. It's a product that is -- resonates very well in the marketplace. And from our perspective, as we've indicated on previous calls, we've expanded into Texas. We've expanded geographically into western Canada. Western Canada right now is quite slow from an economic standpoint. And I would mention to you, it's -- Milgard is far from our smallest company or business unit, if you will. So we think we've got a very bright future there. We think we've got a very good position in the marketplace. We tend to be an innovation leader. Good dealer relationships and certainly look at that as a key part of our growth strategy going forward. We think there's a lot of upside opportunity with Milgard.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. So it's really about geographic expansion at this point?","Timothy Wadhams","Well, it's the execution in the markets that we're in, which are coming back relatively strong. And as you saw some of our numbers, John articulated the increase in terms of the first quarter, so it's really execution and continuing to focus on opportunities in Texas and western Canada at this point.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. The second question is, I guess, more with respect to the balance sheet. Your book equity is less than $2 a share. Your gross debt is just over $10 a share. Would you issue equity at some point to bring this back to a more conventional capital structure?","John G. Sznewajs","Yes, David, a couple things there, I guess. Prior to issuing equities in the near term, I mean, we were very committed to taking down our debt. As Tim referenced, we have a $200 million maturity in August of this year. The other thing, just to remind you of is we do have a deferred tax -- a valuation allowance on a deferred tax asset, and that is kind of, call it, approximately $600 million. At some point, that will flip back on to the balance sheet and add to book equities. So when that does, that line gets another $2 or so per share in book equity. So I feel pretty confident about where we are with our equity. And then, as we come out of the recovery here, we think earnings should pile on and add to that equity base. So I feel pretty confident about the direction we're headed with our balance sheet.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Can you just talk about the timing, the expected timing around that deferred tax asset?","John G. Sznewajs","It's a tough one, David. I wish it was more formulated than it is. My guess is the earliest that we can start to look at it is late '14, early '15 would probably be the time frame, would be the very earliest.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of George Staphos with BofA Merrill Lynch.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I wanted to come back to Cabinets for a bit. You're mentioning earlier that your share, if I heard you correctly, John, was relatively flat. Can you comment at all in terms of your sales and marketing resources? Are they where you want them to be in terms of pushing more share within the dealer channel and then more broadly, within all 3 of your channels? And then I had a follow-up on paints.","John G. Sznewajs","Yes, I would say sales and marketing efforts across all 3 channels, whether it's the builder channel, the home center channel or the dealer channel, are where we want them to be. We did cut them back last year. I think we've added a little bit of resource to that area since that time. It feels like we are in good shape to serve all 3 channels still, as evidenced by the fact that we did launch some new products at KraftMaid here in the first quarter, in early February. A lot of those -- it's very early on those new products. Initial reaction has been positive. And we're looking to add and introduce some new products as well to the Merillat line later in the year. So feel really good about where we're at from a sales and marketing standpoint.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then in Decorative Arc, just briefly. I think I saw in the slide deck and in the commentary, you had some reduction program costs in the quarter, which was in line with expectations. Is there a way to put a finer point on what you might be able to see in terms of reduced program cost this year versus last year, if, in fact, that's your expectation within this segment?","John G. Sznewajs","Thanks, George. In terms of program costs, really what those related to were some programs that we initiated last year, kind of onetime costs, to get product in the store or on the store shelves. We are down in the first quarter. It's really tough to predict, quite honestly. We're hopeful to incur more of those in the future because that means we're winning more business, but it's tough from quarter-to-quarter to predict when and how those will play out. So we'll keep you updated as we make progress towards those, both -- in every quarter, but right now, no forecast for the balance of 2013.","Operator","Your last question comes from the line of Mike Wood with Macquarie.","Mike Wood - Macquarie Research","Also on the program costs, can you speak to the $8 million that you incurred in plumbing, what that was in the same period a year ago and if you are currently expecting to incur any additional program costs in plumbing throughout this year?","John G. Sznewajs","Yes, so the $8 million was an increase versus what we incurred last year, Mike, so that's the year-over-year increase. Again, as I mentioned, part of that $8 million related to a European trade show that take place every other year, part of that had to do with some other display and marketing costs associated with either our Delta or Hansgrohe or some of our other units within that segment. So again, as we look forward, tough to predict how those are going to play out, so we'll keep you updated on a quarter-by-quarter basis.","Mike Wood - Macquarie Research","Okay. And also it looks like you did raise your general corporate expense outlook for this year to $130 million from $116 million. Can you just speak to that and confirm if that's accurate?","John G. Sznewajs","Right now -- we always start off the year with kind of budgeted actual things, like variable compensation, things like insurance accruals and other accruals at the corporate office. And as the year progresses, we try to give you an update on a quarterly basis because those things tend to move. So last year, we had a very favorable insurance experience, both on the medical side, as well as on the general liability side. So right now, we're -- we've got a budget in there of $130 million. To the extent that it comes up or goes off to -- or comes down off that, we'll keep you notified on a quarterly basis.","Timothy Wadhams","Tiffany, thank you, and we'd like to thank all the participants for being with us today.

My name is Jonathan and I will be your operator for today's call. As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded for replay purposes. [Operation Instructions]","I will now turn the call over to Mr. Dave Chaika, Vice President, Treasurer and Investor Relations. Mr. Chaika, you may begin.","David Chaika - Vice President, Treasurer and Investor Relations","Thank you, Jonathan, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Masco Corporation's 2016 second quarter earnings conference call. Joining me today are Keith Allman, President and CEO of Masco; and John Sznewajs, Masco's Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.

With that, I'll now turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Keith Allman.","Keith J. Allman - President, CEO & Class II Director","Thank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Before we get started, I'd like to welcome Dave Chaika to his new role as Masco's Treasurer and Vice President of Investor Relations. And I'd like to congratulate Irene Tasi on her promotion to Vice President of Retail Sales at Masco Cabinetry. These changes are another example of Masco's people development strategy at work.","Turning to slide four. I'm pleased to report that the momentum we built in 2015 and carried forward into the first quarter of 2016 has continued year-to-date. We had a great second quarter, as strength in our underlying markets, combined with solid execution, translated into excellent financial results.","Looking specifically at the quarter, our top-line increased by 4%. Notably, our adjusted operating margin increased 260 basis points to 17.1%, reflecting our portfolio's strong operating leverage, a favorable price commodity environment, and our culture of continuous cost improvement. This represents our best second-quarter operating margin since 2002. Our adjusted EPS grew 21% to $0.46 per share, which includes the $40 million additional interest expense we incurred during the quarter due to the early retirement of a portion of our debt. These results reflect our ability to capitalize on improving end-market dynamics and our ability to generate robust consumer demand from our industry-leading brands.","I'd like to provide you with some additional insight into the drivers behind each of our segments' performance. Let's begin with Plumbing. Our portfolio of plumbing businesses continued its strong performance and grew sales in North America by 9%, and grew sales internationally by 11% in local currency. This segment's strong growth was broad-based, with Delta, Hansgrohe and BrassCraft Manufacturing, our rough plumbing business, each having record quarters for both sales and operating profit.","The Delta and Brizo brands continue to resonate with the consumer, and drive sales growth in both the retail and wholesale channels in North America, while the Hansgrohe and Axor brands continue to gain share internationally. Watkins Manufacturing, our premier wellness and spa business within our Plumbing segment, also achieved a record sales quarter, a good sign that consumer confidence continues to build, as exemplified by these big-ticket purchases.","Our Decorative Architectural segment delivered a solid quarter, despite being up against a tough comp, as we pointed out on our last quarterly earnings call. We continued our strong Pro paint sales growth, as a result of our mutual efforts with The Home Depot to grow and capture share in this channel. And BEHR MARQUEE, a high-price-point DIY product, continued to post exceptional year-over-year comps.","BEHR was once again acknowledged as the quality leader by achieving a number one ranking from a leading consumer testing organization for its BEHR PREMIUM PLUS ULTRA Exterior paint. Our BEHR products have now held the number one ranking for interior and exterior paint, as well as exterior stains, for four years running, demonstrating our commitment to customer-focused, award-winning, high-quality products. Our investments in paint are paying off, and we intend to continue to reinvest in this segment to drive profitable volume growth along with our partner.","Turning to Cabinets, the team delivered yet another strong quarter, growing our leadership position at retail and continuing to optimize sales mix by exiting low-margin, direct-to-builder business, as we described on our first quarter earnings call.","Moving to Windows and Other Specialty Products, our sales grew by 3%, but we did not meet our operating profit expectations. We're working diligently to address this underperformance and remain confident in our long-term operating margin expectations of 10% to 13% for this segment that we outlined in our Investor Day.","Overall, we are very pleased with our second quarter operating performance. Additionally, we continued progress against our key capital allocation initiatives, including finalizing our debt transactions and paying down $400 million in debt; repurchasing approximately 2.8 million shares, bringing our total shares repurchase to-date to 28 million against our 50 million repurchase authorization. And lastly, our board of directors announcing its intention to increase our annual dividend by $0.02 per share beginning in the fourth quarter, expressing confidence in our future outlook.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to John, who will go over our operational and financial performance in detail. John?","John G. Sznewajs - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Thank you, Keith, and good morning, everyone. As Dave mentioned, most of my comments will focus on adjusted performance, excluding the impact of rationalization and other one-time charges.","Our focused execution continued as we delivered strong top and bottom line growth in North America and internationally. The second quarter of 2016 was our 19th consecutive quarter of year-over-year sales and operating profit growth. Sales increased 4% for the quarter. The impact of foreign currency translation softened in the second quarter, and negatively impacted our revenue by approximately $6 million. North American sales were up 3% in the quarter.","We continued to experience strong demand for our repair and remodeling products in all channels of distribution and across the price continuum, as consumers are trading up to our better and best product offerings. As a reminder, repair and remodel activity accounts for approximately 83% of our total sales. International sales increased 9% in local currency in the quarter, driven by the continued strength in our international plumbing and window businesses. Gross margins expanded 220 basis points compared to the second quarter of last year to 35.2%.","And our track record of SG&A improvement continued in the second quarter, as SG&A as a percent of sales improved 40 basis points, driven by focused cost control and productivity improvement throughout the organization. We delivered very strong bottom line performances, as operating profit increased 22% to $342 million, with operating margins expanding 260 basis points to 17.1%, our highest second quarter margin in 14 years.","Our EPS was $0.46 in the quarter, an improvement of $0.08 or 21% compared to the second quarter of 2015. These results include the $40 million of one-time interest payment we noted in last quarter's earnings call to complete the retirement of debt maturities. This negatively impacted our EPS.","Turning to slide seven, our Plumbing segment had a terrific second quarter. Segment sales increased 10%, excluding the impact of currency, driven by growth in our faucets, showers, spas and rough plumbing products. Foreign currency translation negatively impacted this segment's sales by approximately $5 million in the quarter. Our North American sales grew 9% in the second quarter. We experienced strong demand for our innovative Delta and Brizo brands with both our wholesale and large retail customers as we gained share in the quarter. Our second quarter sales also benefited by approximately $10 million due to loan-in sales associated with a recent retail program win.","Our international Plumbing sales increased 11% in local currency. Hansgrohe continues to outperform, as it delivered its highest quarterly sales and operating profit in the company's history, breaking the record they set last quarter. We experienced sales growth around the globe, with particular strength in Central and Northern Europe, the Americas, and Asia. Additionally, our mix improved as our premium price point Axor brand grew double-digits in the quarter. Operating profit for this segment increased 39% in the quarter, driven by incremental volume, productivity improvements and a favorable price-commodity relationship, particularly in Europe.","This segment also benefited from a positive year-over-year commodity hedge impact of approximately $5 million. The second half of 2016, we anticipate investing approximately $10 million in advertising and displays to support new product launches at both Delta and Brizo. Given this segment's sustained performance improvement, but also taking into account further investments to grow the business, we are raising our long-term operating margin expectations for the segment from 16% to 17% to the high teens.","Turning to slide eight, the Decorative Architectural segment sales matched the second quarter of 2015. We experienced solid performance of our BEHR MARQUEE Interior product and continued strong growth across our BEHR PRO business. However, as I mentioned on the first quarter call, this segment faced a difficult comp in Q2, as the second quarter of 2015 was a record sales quarter for BEHR.","In the second quarter of 2016, the timing and amount of incremental promotional expense for the Memorial Day and July 4th promotional events negatively impacted our revenues. You may recall last year's July 4th event was entirely in Q3, while this year's event straddled Q2 and Q3. Additionally, sales were negatively impacted by an in-store inventory draw-down late in the second quarter of 2016.","Liberty Hardware had another solid quarter due to the continued share gains from successful new product introductions and program wins in the retail channel. We are also pleased that Liberty was recently awarded the final portion of a nationwide shower door program at The Home Depot. We will be resetting the remaining 800-plus stores with this innovative program in the fourth quarter.","Operating profit increased $6 million in the second quarter, principally due to operating leverage on higher volume at BEHR and Liberty. While we have experienced solid margins in the first half of the year, we will invest to grow gallons in the second half of 2016. At this time, we expect the amount of this investment to be approximately $30 million, the majority of which will be spent in the third quarter.","Turning to slide nine, we are extremely pleased with our Cabinet segment's improved performance in Q2. Segment sales declined 3% due to the deliberate exit of certain lower-margin business within the builder direct channel in the United States and at select low-margin accounts in our UK cabinet business. This decline was partially offset by KraftMaid's strong performance in the retail channel, resulting in double-digit growth in year-over-year share gains.","In the dealers' channel, we drove single-digit growth through increased volume and favorable mix with both our Merillat offerings and our dealer-exclusive KraftMaid Vantage program continued to resonate with our dealer base and consumers. Segment profitability in the second quarter improved $22 million or 147% over 2015. Our strong second quarter margin of 14.2% was driven by cost-savings initiatives as well as an improved mix as we reduced our exposure to lower-margin builder direct business and enjoyed (15:41) continued growth of our higher price point semi-custom KraftMaid offering.","For the balance of 2016, we believe the revenue impact of our decision to exit select builder direct business and our retail kitchen countertop business will negatively impact sales by approximately $15 million in both Q3 and Q4. In addition, during the second half of 2016, we will be launching new products under the KraftMaid and Quality brands, and anticipate approximately $10 million of expense associated with these new product introductions. Finally, given this segment's sustained performance improvement, we are raising our long-term expectations for operating margins from 8% to 9% to low to mid-teens.","Turning to slide 10, our Windows segment sales increased 3%, driven by growth in Milgard, our leading Western U.S. window business. Milgard's continued growth was driven by a positive mix shift toward our premium window and door product lines and favorable pricing. Excluding the negative impact of stronger U.S. dollars, our European window sales increased 10%, as this segment continues to benefit from share gains through the strong performance of our premium price point window and door offerings.","This segment's operating profit declined was due to ERP expenses in Milgard of approximately $6 million, which we previously disclosed, and an adjustment to Milgard's warranty reserve of approximately $10 million. In addition, we experienced approximately $8 million of incremental labor costs and inefficiencies as Milgard continues to grow. Despite this quarter's results, we continue to believe this segment will achieve 10% to 13% operating margins long-term.","Turning to slide 11, during the quarter, we took additional action to further strengthen our balance sheet and unlock shareholder value. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.1 billion of balance sheet liquidity. As we mentioned last quarter, in March, we issued $900 million of new notes, then in mid-April we used the proceeds from these debt issuances, together with cash on hand, to repay and also (18:04) retire all of our $1 billion notes due in October 2016 and all of our $300 million notes, which were due in March of 2017.","To complete the retirement of these two debt maturities, we incurred approximately $40 million in a one-time interest payment during the quarter, which increased our interest expense to $87 million for the second quarter. However, the results of these transactions will generate an annual interest expense savings of nearly $45 million. Starting with our third quarter of 2016, our quarterly interest expense will be approximately $44 million.","With these refinancing transactions, we have delivered on our long-term commitment to strengthen our balance sheet. Due to our strong cash flow and this recent debt retirement, we have greatly enhanced our financial flexibility, as our net debt to EBITDA now stands at approximately 1.6 times. From a working capital perspective, we delivered another strong quarter of performance with working capital as a percent of sales improving 70 basis points versus the prior year to 13.3%. Finally, as Keith mentioned, we continued our share repurchase activities and during the quarter, we repurchased 2.8 million shares valued at approximately $88 million.","So with that, I'll now turn the call back over to Keith.","Keith J. Allman - President, CEO & Class II Director","Thank you, John. I'm pleased with our team's continued strong execution. Our results reflect the strength of our powerful brands, and our rigorous focus on operational excellence. Due to our continued success in these areas, we are raising our long-term margin expectations for our Plumbing segment to the high teens and for our Cabinet segment to the low- to mid-teens.","The fundamentals driving our business continue to accelerate. Home prices continue to appreciate, which is a driver for larger ticket items such as cabinets and windows. Housing turnover continues to increase, which is a leading indicator of repair and remodel spend. And as you recall, repair and remodel is 83% of our business. And homes remain affordable, with improving access to credit, as well as lower mortgage rates, stimulating housing and home improvement activity. Consumers continue to gain confidence to reinvest in their homes, and we are well-positioned to benefit from those positive trends.","The strategies that we laid out last year are working. Going forward, we remain committed to investing behind our brands for growth; developing innovative, award-winning products to ensure we maintain our must-have position with our customers; focusing on operational excellence through our continued deployment of the Masco Operating System; and finally, balancing our capital allocation between investing for growth, acquisitions with the right strategic fit and returns, and returning cash to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends.","We remain very confident in achieving our 2017 earnings per share target of $1.80 that we set at our Investor Day last year. Our operational execution, coupled with our strength in balance sheet and strong liquidity position, provides us with multiple levers to continue to drive shareholder value.","With that, I'd like to open up the call for questions. So I'll throw it back to you, Jonathan.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from Dennis McGill with Zelman & Associates. Please go ahead.","Dennis Patrick McGill - Zelman Partners LLC","Hi, good morning. Thank you. First question just relates to the push in margin for the two segments. When you guys are talking about long-term, is that a year-dependent measure, or are you thinking about that as a certain amount of revenue in each segment or a certain macro backdrop? Can you just maybe update us on how that ties in to the prior 2017 outlook and timing?","Keith J. Allman - President, CEO & Class II Director","Dennis, I would say that it's consistent with the macroeconomic outlook that we had in 2017, so I would frame it in that manner. And in terms of the timing of it, we're looking at that as a multiyear, more longer-term outlook on what we expect from a run-rate out of these businesses.","Dennis Patrick McGill - Zelman Partners LLC","Okay and then maybe, so if we bridge from today to that longer-term view, are the incremental margins in the two businesses different than how you've talked about or similar, just from a stronger starting point today?","Keith J. Allman - President, CEO & Class II Director","No. I think incrementally, the margins are going to get a little bit better as we're going to maintain some of that gross margin improvement. Of course, there's some offsets to that, as we talked about with regards to investment. John, maybe you want to add a little bit to that?","John G. Sznewajs - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, Dennis. I would say that our incremental margin outlook for the businesses hasn't changed significantly. I think we're still in that kind of 30% for Plumbing and that 30% to 35% for Cabinetry.","Dennis Patrick McGill - Zelman Partners LLC","Okay and if I could just sneak it in, John, could you maybe elaborate a little bit more on the windows, the three different expenses or related expenses you mentioned? Are those intertwined, in that the ERP is causing the labor inefficiencies? And then also, on the warranty reserve, any color there would be great.","John G. Sznewajs - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, I'll take a little bit of it, and I think Keith's going to want to talk just a bit about the operational aspect of it. So I think they're three very distinct items, Dennis. So, the ERP is separate and discrete from the other things. So that was about $6 million in the quarter. We brought up our Portland facility on the system, and so we incurred a little bit more than we expected to incur by 1 million or so dollars, just given the way that went. But it's going well. We're shipping product out of Portland, and so we're pleased with that.","The second item relates to our warranty accrual adjustment, and what we do there is, on a very regular basis, we look at all of our accruals across the company. And as we looked at some of our experience and some of our assumptions going forward, we thought it was appropriate to change the reserve, and so that's reflected in what \u2013 the adjustments that we took this quarter. Then I'll turn it over to Keith to talk about the operational aspect of things.","Keith J. Allman - President, CEO & Class II Director","Dennis, I'd say that it's not uncommon for a business to hit some speed bumps along the way, especially when you're looking at the growth that Milgard has experienced. We've had mid-single to low-double digit growth for each of the past 14 quarters, so we've had a lot of growth there. Individually or separately, these items really aren't a big issue, but collectively, they've got our attention. We have teams addressing these issues aggressively. And we're confident that we're going to get back and maintain and get to our margin expectations of that 10% to 13%.","Dennis Patrick McGill - Zelman Partners LLC","Okay. Appreciate all the color. Good luck, guys.","Keith J. Allman - President, CEO & Class II Director","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from Bob Wetenhall with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey. Good morning. And congrats on a very encouraging quarter and a positive outlook. Trying to understand, if you could help me frame it a little bit better in thinking about it. The results are really strong and you're taking up your long-term profitability and margin targets. What's the mix here in the divisions where you're increasing the margin targets long-term, between self-help and strength of the cycle? What's giving you that confidence to say, hey, we've already gotten where we want to be faster, and here's what we're thinking about in the next couple years?","Keith J. Allman - President, CEO & Class II Director","Well, as you might expect, Bob, it is a mix between a strong market, which we expect to continue going forward, and our execution. I look it at it \u2013 we as a team look at it from a number of ways, the nature of our cost out, how are we driving the productivity improvements that we're seeing and are they sustainable, are they systemic, are they based on the approaches that we're driving in the Masco operating system? And, quite frankly, we look at the people and we look at the teams, and we evaluate how those teams are successfully implementing our operating systems and the nature of the improvements that they're driving. So when we look at sustained performance improvement, we look at how it's come to us and we looked at the people that are driving it and the confidence that we have in those teams. Those things, all together, have said, you know, we're comfortable in taking our margins up to the high teens in Plumbing, which is very, very solid business, and taking them up in Cabinets as we've described.","Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Got it. And that's helpful. Thank you. Could you elaborate a little bit more on in the paint business the profitability was really good. You guys had previously commented that there would be kind of a long-term multi-quarter glide path towards a normalized margin of 18%, and I was trying to understand the margin profile, the strength of it in this quarter, and any update you can give us on what's happening in do-it-yourself sales versus Pro channel. Thanks and good luck. Very nice quarter.","John G. Sznewajs - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Bob. In terms of our performance in paint, I think there's a couple things to think about. As we talk about that glide path closer to the high teens, 18% range, we're very pleased with the performance of the segment this quarter and the progress that we've made. But, as we've talked about historically, we'll be investing in this business over the long-term to help grow gallons.","I think there's a couple, three things that may influence the margin pressure downward. First is commodities. We have been experiencing some mild commodity cost inflation from our major suppliers of titanium dioxide, and as I think everyone's aware, they've announced further price increases for later this year.","The second is investments. As we've talked about historically, we are trying to grow this business and grow gallons in conjunction with our channel partner, The Home Depot. And so we're investing heavily to grow our Pro business. In fact, we are investing here in the back half of 2015 (sic) [2016] (29:10) part of the $30 million investment that I outlined in my prepared remarks really goes to growing hub stores. We have 100 new hub stores where we'll be employing people to help grow our paint business in The Home Depot.","And finally, mix; I think we've mentioned very clearly over the course of the last couple quarters, our Pro business does not have or come at the same margin profile as our core DIY business. So I think those are the three elements that, over time, will drive the margins closer to that high teens range from where we're at and from where we stand today in the 22% range.","Keith J. Allman - President, CEO & Class II Director","Bob, in terms of your specific question on the Pro, our Pro business continues to do very well. We grew in that low double-digit range again in the quarter. Our investments and strategies that we are driving together with The Home Depot are paying off very well, and we're encouraged with the trajectory. As John mentioned, we're adding 100 new hub stores, and that's on top of an install base of hub stores of 106. So this very productive for us. We like what we're seeing in the Pro and we're going to continue it.","Operator","Your next question comes from Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research Company. Please go ahead.","Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Thanks. Two questions for you. First of all, curious in what you're observing in terms of remodel spending. Obviously the Plumbing numbers look good in the quarter, but within the Cabinet business if you can exclude the business you walked away from, what you're seeing in terms of order rates and order patterns there? And then, secondly, would love you to elaborate a little bit further on the expected payback from the incremental investment that you're making in the paint business. Obviously you're talking that that may normalize or dilute the margins, but should this also accelerate the top line growth?","Keith J. Allman - President, CEO & Class II Director","Eric, in terms of the remodeling side, we continue to see good demand. I think home price appreciation is a good driver for that. And there has been some deferral in investing in big-ticket items that folks have put into their homes for a number of years and that's coming off the sideline. As we talk to the various dealer and constituents around our business, we're hearing about good foot traffic and continued good spend. In the Cabinet and Window business, which both of those have a very strong component of R&R in them, we are seeing improved mix as well.","Now, a part of that is driven by productive changes we've made to our assortment and how we're managing the business, but it's also a general uptick in mix in terms of the market. I think a great indicator is our Watkins spa business. As John said, we set another sales record there this quarter. And when you consider the discretionary nature of this product and its high price point, it really reflects on the consumer's appetite to reinvest in their home. So we're seeing the consumers utilize credit more with larger ticket purchases, such as spas. So I think the consumer is feeling confident. That's a direct reflection on demand in R&R, and then of course home price appreciation and new housing turnover, all which are continuing to grow, which continue to feed that.","With regards to your second question, Eric, around the incremental payback on the Pro initiative, it's an outstanding payback for us. It's very profitable. While it doesn't have necessarily the margin of our core DIY business, it has outstanding returns for us. And I think, importantly, the fact that we are so intertwined strategically with Home Depot that this is a very positive revenue source for us for quite a while. We're very confident in the Pro and paint.","John G. Sznewajs - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Yes, and, Eric, can you just give a little bit more color. I think part of your question was how did our Cabinet business grow if you factor out the business that we walked away from. And if you just take a look at our core business that's excluding that builder walk away business that we did, our core business was up kind of 5%, 6% in the quarter.","Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","And it looks like you're gaining market share. How do you view that relative to the market and what was that number in the first quarter?","John G. Sznewajs - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Yes, that's right, Eric. I think your assessment is right. We feel like we're picking up a little bit of share. Particularly in retail, we know we're picking up share for certain there. The first quarter, if you strip everything out, I think we had very similar growth rates in the first quarter of the year. And that business is a business that we did not walk away from.","Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Michael Rehaut with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks. Good morning, everyone, and nice quarter. First question I had was on the paint margins. Just want to make sure I'm thinking about it correctly, because I guess you highlighted $30 million of extra expense in the third quarter, which could be around 500 bps, 600 bps of a margin impact. At the same time, you highlighted the promotional expense, which hits more the top line, and I'm sure that also contributed to the margin strength itself. So looking into 3Q, I know you don't get too granular here, but given that I wouldn't expect the full 500 bps, 600 bps to hit because of a lesser amount of promotional expense. Should it kind of return to that high-teens type of number that you're looking at longer term, or could it still exceed 20%?","John G. Sznewajs - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Yes, Mike, first of all, the $30 million of expense will not be entirely in Q3. That's going to be split between Q3 and Q4, though the majority of which I would estimate will hit in the third quarter. And so as you think about the margin degradation from where we stand today to future quarters, I think the scenario that you outlined, yes, I think we'll see consistent or steady margin degradation. I'm not expecting necessarily a clip (35:47) back to 18%, but I think over time we'll drive that way. So I think high teens, low 20%s could be an opportunity for the third quarter. But as you referenced, we don't give out quarterly guidance.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. No, thanks. But just again trying to think of it the right way. Switching back to Cabinet growth, if we can get a little more detail there if possible. I don't recall hearing the exact or estimated dollar amount of the impact of the exited businesses this quarter. And then I guess maybe you can give some of the pluses and minuses, because if it's even $10 million, $15 million, that would imply kind of that best like a low single-digit sales growth rate. So just trying to think about how that might improve over time to like a mid-single-digit. If there are other drags that are holding back that business as we'd expect some of the new product initiatives and share gains to take greater hold.","John G. Sznewajs - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Yes, Mike, so we had about $10 million to $15 million of lost business this quarter from the exit of the direct-to-builder in the retail countertop business. I'm going to tell you that that our retail business grew in low-double digits and our dealer business grew at about single digits. So you put all that together, if you factor out, again, the business that we walked away from, our core business grew about 5%, 6%.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And is that a good run rate for the back half as well, excluding the exit of the low-margin business?","Keith J. Allman - President, CEO & Class II Director","Yes, I think that's a good way to think about it. We've got good traffic that we're seeing in our dealer customers. We have good mix. We're excited about the product launches that we have coming in, in Q3 and Q4. Now it's going to take some while for that to get traction as the designers start to get comfortable with it, but it's good stuff, and we like the prospects for the business, and nice steady growth rate, and continued execution, importantly.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks. One last quick one, if I could. Just on the labor inefficiencies and ERP expense and other specialty, should that start to peel off in 3Q? And excluding you're about at 4% excluding the warranty hit this quarter. Could we see that improve into mid-single digit somewhere in the like mid-single digit margin? I know, again, maybe not giving the guidance for that, but some of the ERP or labor, would that kind of be lesser of a headwind in the back half?","John G. Sznewajs - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","We have an ongoing roll out of ERP, Mike, at Milgard, and so I would anticipate $4 million to $5 million of ERP expense each of the next several quarters and that will probably go into the first part of 2015 \u2013 2017, I should say, as we continue to roll it out across all of Milgard's manufacturing locations. So that will continue.","Keith J. Allman - President, CEO & Class II Director","In terms of the labor, let me take that one, John. The nature of the issue that we're having here is really about supporting the high growth with additional labor, and labor turnover. So this is probably our toughest business when it comes to being in the northwest and getting our labor and keeping our labor. With this growth, we drive hard with respect to getting as much as we can out of our existing shifts. And when you put in new second shifts, there's always a learning curve for that, bringing in some new supervision. So I think we'll probably see some labor inefficiencies bleed into next quarter a little bit, but we're on this and we're going to get it taken care of quickly.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from Samuel Eisner with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Samuel H. Eisner - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yes, good morning, everyone.","John G. Sznewajs - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Good morning, Sam.","Samuel H. Eisner - Goldman Sachs & Co.","On the Plumbing segment, I just want to make sure I got the moving pieces correctly here. You commented that there was about $10 million of revenue load-in, assumed that's 20% margin, so about $2 million of EBIT, and you had a $5 million hedging benefit as well. Are those the only two major items in a bridge that we should be modeling, or thinking about for this quarter? Just because obviously, the profitability in this quarter was pretty substantial.","John G. Sznewajs - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Yes, no, Sam, I think you're thinking about it exactly right.","Samuel H. Eisner - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. That's helpful there. The $10 million for next quarter, is that essentially offsetting some of the walk savings for the hedging losses that you had in the third quarter as well?","John G. Sznewajs - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","No, the $10 million really is, for next quarter, the second half of the year, really. It really is some product launches that we're doing. Now I would tell you, the other thing that probably impacts the second quarter, Sam, that I forgot to mention probably is, we're (40:48) on marketing spend in the second quarter. So I think you'll see that grow as we go into the third and fourth quarter, and then there's $10 million of expense related to these product launches, if the collateral material displays and the like gets the products into our, either our channel partners or the wholesale showrooms where we're launching these products.","Samuel H. Eisner - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Maybe transitioning over to the paint segment, you commented that you're starting to see some price increases by your TiO2 suppliers. When do you anticipate some of that to start to impact your P&L, and how are you guys going to go about offsetting that? Do we expect that, back half of the year, that you'd start to see a raw material headwind? How do you think about the whole price-cost relationship going forward?","John G. Sznewajs - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","In terms of that, generally we have a 60-to-90 day lag before raw material price increases flow through and hit our financial statements. So I think you'll start seeing the impact of the second quarter increase really hit our third quarter. And then, to the extent that there are further increases later in the year, you can again calibrate those on those 60-to-90 day timeframe where it flows through.","In terms of, how do we offset, obviously we work with our suppliers very closely on that. We're working on cost productivity within our own operations to try to offset some of that. That said, I think we've got a good thing going right now with our Pro business and our MARQUEE business, that seems like it's heading in the right direction. So hopefully, as consumers mix up a little bit, that will help offset some of that pricing pressure.","Samuel H. Eisner - Goldman Sachs & Co.","All right. And if I can just sneak one more in here. Keith, you made the comment about, we're talking about R&R spending, how consumers are utilizing a bit more credit these days. I was wondering if you could expand on that a little bit more. Are you seeing that in the forms of people starting to use HELOCs and home equity loans again? Just curious if you can expand on that comment. Thanks.","Keith J. Allman - President, CEO & Class II Director","Sure. I'll point you to our use of credit and our \u2013 just a direct little statistic here, in terms of third-party consumer financing program that we have in our Watkins spa business. Year-to-date, that volume is up 60%. Our in-store approval rates are up nearly 80%, and applications are up 30%. So that's one example there, and certainly, HELOCs is another one where people are starting to pull that value out of their home. But very much close to home is that credit financing that we see in Watkins, which is for a big-ticket item. So we think that's a great sign for consumer confidence, and it shows a willingness to invest in that bigger-ticket item for the home.","Operator","Your next question comes from Tim Wojs with Baird. Please go ahead.","Tim R. Wojs - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Yes, hey, guys. Good morning. Nice job.","John G. Sznewajs - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Tim.","Tim R. Wojs - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","I guess, just on Decorative, you had made the comment that BEHR was up year over year from a volume basis. Could you expand a little bit, maybe what gallon growth was in BEHR for Q2? And then the inventory reduction you that cited, is that over, or is there some residual impact to think about for Q3?","John G. Sznewajs - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","So gallon growth is up low-single digits in the second quarter. In terms of the inventory reduction, we think it's largely behind us, though we continue to monitor that. I would tell you, though, that our sell-through with our channel partner was better than our sell-in to the channel partner in the quarter.","Tim R. Wojs - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Okay. And then maybe just a bigger-picture question. You guys have done a really nice job deleveraging the balance sheet. And so I know you're paying more dividends and you're still buying back stock, but how do you think about the aggression or the intensity within the M&A program, particularly in Decorative and Plumbing going forward?","Keith J. Allman - President, CEO & Class II Director","Tim, we laid out a balanced approach to capital allocation last year at the Investor Day. It's working for us, and we plan to continue to do that. As we talked about, we've repurchased 28 million shares against our 50 million share authorization. We paid down debt of $40 million \u2013 $400 million, excuse me, lots of zero. Increased our dividend twice. So we like the balance that this has given us, with specific regard to acquisition. We're focused on bolt-on acquisitions. As we've said, we're not changing our strategy, and specifically on paint and plumbing. We would look, and are looking in other areas, but our focus is on paint and plumbing.","Our pipeline is growing in terms of absolute size, and we're seeing accelerated movement of targets through our pipeline as we develop them, develop relationships, and start to understand better how we could add value. We're being prudent, I would say careful, in making sure that our acquisition targets, and a deal, should we do it, would bring good value. We're very disciplined in looking for the appropriate return on our investment, and the ability for us to bring synergies to it. So no real change to our capital allocation or our M&A strategy, anything that's significantly different from what we've talked about for the better part of a year-and-a-half or so. I would tell you that I like our balanced approach because it gives us flexibility, but our strategy is unchanged in this area.","Tim R. Wojs - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Great. Keep up the good work.","Keith J. Allman - President, CEO & Class II Director","Thank you.","John G. Sznewajs - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Will do.","Operator","Your next question comes from Mike Wood with Macquarie. Please go ahead.","Mike Wood - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Hi. Congratulations. On Cabinets, can you talk about the rate of margin improvement by channel between retail and dealer, where it's happening faster or beating your expectations, particularly on price? And in that same vein, if you could talk about the impact the common ERP system is having in terms of price and service?","Keith J. Allman - President, CEO & Class II Director","In terms of where the improvements of margin are coming, a channel-by-channel basis, the lion's share of our margin improvements is operationally based, and it's very hard to detangle that. It's reflected in both channels of distribution. So the biggest change in margin from a cost-out perspective is really shared between the channels.","When you look at where we're having the most margin productivity in terms of price, if you will, I'd point to the dealer side, where we're getting mix, and that's been very helpful. We've come out now some time ago with the KraftMaid vantage program, which really gives some differentiation to the dealers, and we're seeing that be very productive and that continues to raise in terms of the percentage of mix of our overall sell. And so I'd look at our margin as a combination.","Of course, there's factory and shop floor improvements that are shared by both segments. And then particularly in dealer, the mix-up is helping us. And I'll tell you, we're excited about the new products. We've got \u2013 John talked about and I summarized about the investments that we have in the back half around new products for both KraftMaid as well as our Quality brands. So from my perspective, that pipeline for continuing our improvement in this segment is important and we're hitting it.","Mike Wood - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Great. And also as a follow up, what feedback are you getting from the builders with the product exits that you're seeing? Are they shifting to lower-end cabinets from other manufacturers? Are you getting any builders coming back to the large manufacturers such as yourself?","Keith J. Allman - President, CEO & Class II Director","I haven't really seen the price point of the replacement for the work that we're walking away from and how that's being replaced. I suspect it's at a relatively consistent level of pricing and et cetera. In terms of who's getting that business, it's really not the big nationals. What we're seeing more often than that \u2013 substantially more often than that is the regional players.","Mike Wood - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Nishu Sood with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you. First question I wanted to ask was in the Plumbing category, specifically digging into the North American business. Terrific sales performance there. There's already been some discussion of big ticket and in the spa business. Across the kind of main Delta portfolio, what were you seeing in terms of what sorts of products were driving that very strong sales gains? Obviously, we saw a lot of design improvements at the trade shows early this year. So what are you seeing there, and what has been driving that very strong sales growth?","Keith J. Allman - President, CEO & Class II Director","It's really broad based. In our core business and through both wholesale distribution and repair and remodeling, we're seeing nice unit volume, and that Delta brand is very well known for those customers that are in that price point. And we're very pleased with the performance of our showroom brands, which would be that higher end. We mentioned our Brizo brand, which is the high-end brand underneath Delta Faucet company. That's double-digit growth and running very well. You look at our Axor brand, which is a high-end brand within the Hansgrohe organization that had double-digit growth. And then within the Hansgrohe continuum of product, the higher end is continuing to drive. So I'm happy with our channel focus and the work that our sales folks are doing in the showroom. That's very productive for us. But the bread and butter of the core is doing as well in terms of unit volume.","John G. Sznewajs - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Nishu, what I would add to that is you may recall we had a very strong fourth quarter with our wholesale customers. And therefore, that led to a pretty soft Q1 with those same customers because they had pulled forward some orders out of Q1 into Q4. As we look at the numbers, I would tell you that we think that there was some replenishment going on, particularly in the first part of the second quarter as they continued to fill lower inventories. That helped made the second quarter top line.","Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Got it. Got it. No, that's very helpful. And price commodity wise, you mentioned in Plumbing that that was a tailwind. And obviously, you talked a little bit about in paint, the headwinds there. As you look across just the kind of market pricing, some of the metals prices are rising, wood products as well, the energy chain. So I was just wondering if you could talk about how that might flow through across the separate divisions in the next couple of quarters and what your outlook is there, please.","Keith J. Allman - President, CEO & Class II Director","Yeah, so I think there's a couple things there, Nishu, to talk to you about. Brass, which is the main component of our Plumbing products, is made of copper and zinc. And zinc actually has risen pretty nicely over the course of the last couple of quarters. It's been up off its bottoms consistently. If you take a look at copper, copper really fell pretty dramatically in the November timeframe last year and really stayed low through kind of mid-January, and then it started to tick up from there. And as we've said in the past, it takes about two quarters for those impacts to flow through and hit our P&L, which is about the second quarter when that would \u2013 when we feel a lot of that impact. So feel good about that.","Looking around to our other product categories, though, not seeing a ton of inflation in our wood products at all. We've seen a little bit of inflation, but not much, TiO2, we've already spoken about. Petroleum has been up and down a little bit. The one area that we did see a little bit of inflation, and we called this out in our first quarter call was glass out in the western United States where a glass factory had gone down and so we had implemented price to offset that price increase that we incurred. That said, we're working hard on our continuous improvement through our Masco operating system to try to offset any of this inflation that we are incurring to continue to drive our margins even higher.","Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Susan Maklari with UBS. Please go ahead.","Susan Marie Maklari - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you. Good morning.","Keith J. Allman - President, CEO & Class II Director","Good morning.","John G. Sznewajs - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Good morning.","Susan Marie Maklari - UBS Securities LLC","It seems like, doing some quick math here, you did make some improvements in your working capital this quarter. Can you just talk a little bit about what's been going on there, and are there further efforts that we can expect to see as you continue to maybe drive some efficiencies?","Keith J. Allman - President, CEO & Class II Director","Let's talk about inventory first, Susan. We really look at inventory as an indicator of how well our supply chain is doing, we look at working capital as an indicator of how well our supply chain is doing. So when we look at these improvements, I think it's really a reflection of the work that the teams have been doing in the factories and in our supply chain organizations to drive down and drive out waste in the shop floor through things like setup reduction and focused on one-piece flow and all of those fundamentals that we have as part of our operating system.","In terms of inventory from a supply chain perspective, we look at and are constantly developing and improving our methodologies for identifying minimum order quantities and working with our suppliers so that we can get shorter supply chains. So it's a combination of a lot of work that we're doing. Quite frankly, Susan, I didn't expect us to be able to continue to improve to this degree. If you look at where we are, it's pretty darn good. I don't know if we're best in breed in our peer group, but I know we're very close. And the better you get, the harder it is to get better. We're not going to stop. But I wouldn't look for any material real improvements here. But don't tell my guys that.","Susan Marie Maklari - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. All right. Sounds good. And then in terms of the free cash generation, I mean, you've obviously done an amazing job there as well. But as we think about your ability to perhaps drive some even more-improved operating margins in these businesses, is there any change to how you're thinking about your ability to generate free cash and how that could possibly trend looking out?","John G. Sznewajs - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","No, I don't think so, Susan. As you cite, as our free cash flow \u2013 as our profits continue to grow, I think a couple of good things. As Keith just mentioned, we've got working capital locked down pretty tight so as that continues to grow, that should help our free cash flow. Our capital expense, our CapEx is a relatively light touch. We've been averaging around 2%, just under 2% of sales for the last several years, a little bit more than that this year as we completed a couple of investments that we're making, but after this year, we do expect that to migrate that back down to kind of to that 2% of sales range. So don't feel like there's significant investment to be poured back into the business as we continue to grow, so that should really enhance our free cash flow in the next several years.","Susan Marie Maklari - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, we have time for one additional question. Mr. Mike Dahl with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Michael G. Dahl - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. A couple of questions around paint. First, obviously a lot of initiatives around kind of the Pro and building that business, I think interesting with the hub store roll out and doubling there. Could you just talk a little bit more about beyond this next 100 stores what the opportunity is and I guess as part of this, is this really the most-successful initiative that you've seen as far as what it actually takes to crack the code with the Pro, just any color around there?","Keith J. Allman - President, CEO & Class II Director","Well, this is a $6 billion market when you look at it and we look at where we are, I'm happy with our growth rate certainly, but I think there's a substantial runway for us to continue in working with The Home Depot to do better and better here. The additional hub stores, obviously we're making that investment because it works. But we still have a lot of value to generate here, no question, given the size of the market, and given our relative newness. We're continuing to learn. We have an outstanding team in paint, and we have an outstanding partner in Home Depot. And as I've talked about on several occasions, to me, it's the interwoven strategy that we have with these guys and our cooperation and our relationship that's really driving a good chunk of this value. And that's continuing to increase.","So I'm very positive on the outlook in Pro. And we're going to continue to deploy our operating system against this initiative. Our people are developing. We're learning more. We're servicing the Pro better. We're getting faster. There's a lot of room for upside here.","Michael G. Dahl - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","And, Keith, how much of the business is still going through a Home Depot store versus some of your direct-to-customer initiatives?","Keith J. Allman - President, CEO & Class II Director","Oh, goodness. Most of it. Almost all of it.","John G. Sznewajs - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Over 99%, Mike, is going to the Depot store. Very \u2013 almost nothing's going direct-to-customer.","Michael G. Dahl - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Thanks. And then second question is around the Liberty program wins, John. Just wondering if you could give us a little color on just how to think about any potential load-in factor. How much of the investments that you highlighted are related to this Liberty program? And how to think about kind of then an ongoing run rate for kind of sales there.","John G. Sznewajs - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, so this program is something that Liberty launched a couple of years ago, and they won the West Coast and then subsequently won the Midwest region. And now they've won the balance of the United States with these 800-plus stores that we'll be bidding in Q4. In terms of the investment that's going to go \u2013 and it should be kind of in the order of magnitude of $5 million, mostly in Q4, Mike, when we set those stores.","There will be a bit of a load-in on that. Don't have a good estimate for you. I'll probably give you some greater clarity in Q3 as we get closer to the launch of those \u2013 on the Q3 call when we get to the launch of those stores. But I got to tell you that the Liberty team has just done a terrific job of coming up with new programs consistently, new merchandising concepts which this really is, and really enhancing their business with their channel partners. So hats off to Mark and the Liberty team. They've done a great job of building that business.","Michael G. Dahl - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Great.

Welcome to Masco Corporation's 2017 first quarter conference call. With me today are Keith Allman, President and CEO of Masco; and John Sznewajs, Masco's Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Our first quarter earnings release and the presentation slides that we will refer to today are available on our website under Investor Relations. Following our remarks, we will open the call for analyst questions. Please limit yourself to one question with one follow-up. If we can't take your question now, please call me directly at 313-792-5500.","Our statements today will include our views about our future performance, which constitute forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risk and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. We describe these risk and uncertainties in our Risk Factors and other disclosures in our Form 10-K and our Form 10-Q that we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","Our statements will also include non-GAAP financial measures.

We reconcile these adjusted measurements to GAAP in our earnings release and presentation slides, which are available on our website under Investor Relations.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Keith Allman.","Keith J. Allman - Masco Corp.","Thank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today.","Please turn to slide 4. We're off to a strong start in 2017. We delivered good top line growth and saw strength across our end markets, channels and price points that we serve. Our top line increased 5%, excluding the impact of currency. Our operating margin increased 60 basis points to 14.4%, largely driven by the outstanding performance in our Plumbing segment this quarter, particularly in North America. We continue to leverage our top line growth across the organization into greater margin expansion through our operating leverage and cost productivity initiatives. Importantly, our adjusted earnings per share grew 28% to $0.41 per common share.","I'd like to provide you with some additional insight into the drivers behind each of our segments' performance. Let's begin with Plumbing. Our portfolio of Plumbing businesses continued its outstanding performance by growing sales in North America by 9% and growing sales internationally by 6% in local currency. With our strong operating leverage and a favorable price to commodity relationship in Plumbing, this volume dropped substantially (3:24) to the bottom line.","Of note, Delta Faucet Company achieved record sales and operating profit for the quarter with very strong growth in its wholesale channel. Delta's luxury high-end Brizo brand continued its outstanding performance in the wholesale channel with strong double-digit growth. Outside of North America, Hansgrohe's growth was led by continued strong performance in Europe, Asia-Pacific, and the Middle East.","In our Decorative Architectural segment, we achieved 2% growth against a difficult 9% comp last year. Our Pro paint sales grew double digits and significantly outpaced the market as our mutual efforts with The Home Depot continued to drive share gain in this channel. We remain committed to investing behind this important growth initiative. Additionally, we benefited in this segment from our innovative Liberty Hardware shower door program this quarter, which is now fully launched nationwide.","Turning to Cabinets, this segment is a good example of our focus on developing and leveraging our talent across the organization. As you know, for the past few months, we've been utilizing Joe Gross' impressive turnaround leadership on a temporary basis at Milgard, our West Coast Window business, while he has also been serving as President of Masco Cabinetry. He's done a fantastic job at this double duty, and was recently promoted to the position of Masco Group Vice President for both Cabinetry and Windows. Gordie Fournier, formerly Masco Cabinetry's Chief Financial Officer, was promoted to the position of President of Masco Cabinetry. Gordie was instrumental in working with Joe in the highly successful turnaround of Cabinetry and I'm confident that Cabinetry's impressive momentum will continue under Gordie's leadership.","Turning to the segment's performance, our new products launched in the dealer channel this quarter were very well received. These new products, under both the Merillat and Quality brands, will support growth later in the year as they gain traction by providing consumers with more options at an affordable price. In the retail channel, our Cabinet team delivered another strong quarter of growth as our KraftMaid programs, with our channel partners, continued to drive consumer demand.","In our Windows segment, we returned to profitability in the quarter as the team rapidly applied its business improvement plan to reduce costs. We expect that this segment will achieve mid-single-digit operating margins for the full year, a significant improvement over 2016.","On the subject of capital allocation, we continued our share repurchase activity in the quarter by buying back 2.8 million shares. We've now repurchased almost 40 million shares against our 50 million share repurchase authorization, returning over $1 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and thus delivering on our commitment to drive shareholder value.","Lastly, at our Investor Day in 2015, we set a lofty target to more than double our earnings per share and achieve $1.80 in earnings per share for 2017. Based on our continued execution of our strategies and our strong start to 2017, we are now updating our target for earnings per share in 2017 to be in the range of $1.90 to $2.00, exceeding our target of $1.80 that we set two years ago.","Now, I'd like to turn the call over to John, who will go over our operational and financial performance in detail. John?","John G. Sznewajs - Masco Corp.","Thank you, Keith, and good morning, everyone. As Dave mentioned, most of my comments will focus on adjusted performance, excluding the impact of rationalization and other one-time items.","Turning to slide 6, we continued on our positive momentum coming out of 2016 with a solid start to 2017. The first quarter of 2017 was our 22nd consecutive quarter of year-over-year sales and operating profit growth. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, sales increased 5%. Foreign currency translation negatively impacted our sales in the first quarter by approximately $22 million, as the U.S. dollar strengthened against both the euro and the British pound. North American sales increased 5% in the quarter due to strong demand for our repair and remodeling products across all channels of distribution and across the price continuum as we continued to experience strong consumer demand for our better and best product offerings. As a reminder, repair\/remodel activity represents approximately 83% of our total sales.","International sales increased 5% in local currency as our international Plumbing businesses continued to drive growth. Gross margins expanded approximately 120 basis points compared to the first quarter of last year to 34.3%. Our SG&A, as a percent of sales, increased this quarter by 60 basis points to 20% of sales. This was primarily due to the strategic growth investments we made in 2016 such as the 200 new Behr hub store employees we hired last year. We will leverage these investments throughout 2017 to drive profitable growth. And we delivered strong bottom line performance as operating income increased 8% to $255 million with operating margins expanding 60 basis points to 14.4%.","Our EPS was $0.41 in the quarter, an improvement of 28% compared to the first quarter of 2016. Starting with the first quarter of 2017, our adjusted EPS calculation will assume an expected tax rate of 34%. Reduction from our previous guidance of 36% is driven by the adoption of a new stock-based compensation accounting pronouncement and the continued execution of our tax-planning strategies. Lower tax rate benefited our earnings per share in the first quarter by approximately $0.01, and we anticipate that it will increase EPS for the full year by approximately $0.06.","Turning to slide 7, our Plumbing segment continues to deliver outstanding results. Segment sales increased 8%, excluding the impact of currency, driven by growth in our faucets, showers and spas. Foreign currency translation negatively impacted this segment's sales by approximately $15 million in the quarter. Our North American sales grew 9% in the first quarter as we experienced strong consumer-driven demand for our innovative brands with both our wholesale and large retail customers.","As Keith mentioned, Delta delivered another record quarter of sales and profits. Additionally, our spa business continues to outperform the competition as Watkins leverages its strong dealer network, innovative new products and industry-leading brands. Our international Plumbing sales increased 6% in local currency as Hansgrohe continues to outperform and benefit from investments in brand, design and innovation.","Revenue growth in the first quarter was aided by a relatively easy comp from the first quarter of 2016 as sales were pulled into Q4 of 2015. Additionally, I want to remind you that we face a difficult comp in the second quarter as this segment's revenue grew 10% from the second quarter of last year. Operating profit for the segment increased 19% in the quarter, driven by incremental volume and a favorable price commodity relationship.","Turning to slide 8, the Decorative Architectural Products segment grew 2% despite facing a difficult 9% comp from the first quarter of 2016. This performance was driven by another quarter of strong double-digit growth of our Behr Pro business and solid performance of Behr MARQUEE, our highest price point offering. Liberty Hardware also contributed to the top line growth as they benefited from the expansion of its innovative shower door program, in addition to growth in its core hardware business. Operating income decreased 4% as increased volume was more than offset by the strategic growth investment related to the staffing of the 200 new hub store employees with Behr Pro reps in 2016, the timing of additional advertising expense, and a slightly unfavorable price commodity relationship.","Turning to slide 9, in the Cabinetry segment, sales declined 2% in the quarter due to the deliberate exit of certain low margin builder direct business in the United States and in select low margin accounts in our UK Cabinet business. These actions, in aggregate, reduced segment sales by approximately $16 million (13:24). As we mentioned on our fourth quarter call, this exit will be completed in the second quarter and will impact the second quarter's revenues by approximately $5 million.","Our core business performed well in the quarter. KraftMaid had strong performance in the retail channel resulting in high single-digit growth and year-over-year share gains. In the dealer channel, we drove low single-digit growth through increased volume and favorable mix as our KraftMaid and Merillat brands continued to offer new styles, finishes and features that resonate with our dealer base and consumers. Segment profitability declined in the first quarter by $7 million, driven by $5 million in launch costs related to the new product introductions that we discussed on our fourth quarter call.","Finally, I'd like to mention that we will not be affected by the recently announced tariffs on Canadian softwood lumber, as we do not purchase any material amounts of Canadian softwood lumber.","Turning to slide 10, our Windows segment sales increased 3% in the first quarter, excluding the impact of currency, driven by growth in Milgard, our leading Western U.S. Window business. Milgard's continued growth was driven due to positive mix shift toward our premium window and door product lines and favorable pricing. Excluding the $6 million negative impact of a stronger U.S. dollar, our UK Window sales increased 7%, driven by improved mix and favorable pricing. Segment profitability doubled in the quarter to $6 million over the prior year, driven by cost savings initiatives and improved mix. We're pleased with the progress that Joe and his team have made on Milgard's improvement plan and we continue to be on track to deliver improved results in 2017.","Turning to slide 11, we ended the quarter with approximately $900 million of balance sheet liquidity. Working capital as a percent of sales increased 110 basis points versus the prior year to 14.4%, and during the first quarter, we continued our initiative to create shareholder value by repurchasing 2.8 million shares valued at approximately $92 million.","And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Keith.","Keith J. Allman - Masco Corp.","Thank you, John. I'm pleased with our team's execution and our start to 2017. The fundamentals driving our business are strong. Demographics, namely the large Millennial group, are increasingly favorable and should drive household formations and housing for years to come. Home prices are appreciating, up over 5% year-over-year, boosting consumers' confidence to invest in their homes. Housing turnover, a leading indicator for our business, is up over 5%, reaching an annualized rate of 5.7 million units this past month, the highest housing turnover rate in more than a decade. And U.S. residential housing stock is aging, a key driver of repair and remodel spending with 70% of homes in the United States now over 25 years old, an increase of more than 19 million units in the past 10 years.","The strategies that we've laid out last year to leverage these fundamentals are working. Going forward, we remain committed to investing behind our brands for growth, developing innovative products to ensure we maintain our must-have position with our customers, focusing on operational excellence through our continued deployment of the Masco Operating System, and finally, balancing our capital allocation between acquisitions with the right strategic fit and returns, share buybacks and dividends. Our operational execution, coupled with our strong balance sheet and liquidity position, provides us with multiple levers to continue to drive shareholder value and outperform the industry.","We hope to see many of you at our Investor Day on May 16 in New York City when we will update you on our progress towards our goals and our longer-term strategy.","With that, we'll open the call up for questions and answers.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Phil Ng. Your line is open.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC","Hey, guys. Your Plumbing margins were actually quite strong. How much of that upside was driven by mix? And then, from a price\/cost standpoint, I think in your prepared remark you said it was favorable. How should we think about that dynamic over the course of the year, just because metal prices are up dramatically?","John G. Sznewajs - Masco Corp.","Hey, Phil, good morning, it's John. Yes, so, you're right. Mix was a little bit of a benefit for us. I think the strongest benefit in the quarter came from volume, just because of the strong volume in both Delta and Hansgrohe. In terms of commodities, we are seeing a little bit of inflation in copper, but recall it takes about two quarters for any inflation to flow through to our P&L. So, we still had a little bit of a benefit here in Q1. I will tell you that we have not been trying to put pricing into the market, either, to offset some of that commodity inflation.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC","Okay. And just one last one for me, just from a capital deployment standpoint, you guys are actually generating a lot of cash. There was obviously some paint assets that were available, which looks like wasn't a good fit. But, talk about M&A going forward. What are some of the pockets that look compelling to you and how you think about evaluation? Thanks.","Keith J. Allman - Masco Corp.","Phil, we really haven't changed our strategy with regards to M&A. We're actively seeking inorganic growth opportunities. It's important, obviously, to have the right strategic fit and our portfolio can generate the proper returns. So, that's fundamentally the main criteria that we're evaluating against in terms of strategy and return on invested capital. Our pipeline is large. It's getting larger, active, we measure both the size and the movement of the pipeline. There's many opportunities out there, frankly. It takes time to cultivate them and we're going to be patient. And it's important that we balance our M&A activity with our share repurchase activity, depending on the opportunities in each category.","So, we look at the opportunities. We've certainly looked at what came out of the Sherwin-Williams\/Valspar divestiture, but it wasn't exactly the fit that we're looking for, for various numbers of reasons and we're continuing to move. It's an important part of our strategy.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC","Okay, thanks a lot, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Rehaut. Your line is open.","Neal BasuMullick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, guys. This is Neal BasuMullick on for Mike. I guess going back to the Plumbing margins, you'd mentioned there was some incremental spend related to a trade show this quarter, but yet you had strong margins despite that. Was it more so due to timing? I guess, what is it that you're doing right, besides what you mentioned?","John G. Sznewajs - Masco Corp.","Yes, so we did have about $4 million, $5 million in trade show expense this quarter that we called out in our fourth quarter call 90 days ago. That said, I think that what was favorable in the quarter was the strong volume that we experienced, and it was pretty consistent volume across both our wholesale and large retail customers. So, I think that's \u2013 because this segment generates about 30% dropdown on incremental volume, that was a big factor in what helped us, aided by the other things that we mentioned, favorable mix and a slightly favorable price commodity relationship. Also, aided was some cost productivity initiatives that we drove in the quarter, as well.","Keith J. Allman - Masco Corp.","Just to add on a little bit, our Plumbing segment is really humming, to put it simply. The teams there are executing the Masco Operating System quite well. John mentioned that we're able to get some price in the market ahead of some of this commodity inflation that we're seeing, and that's helpful, particularly in Europe. We are investing in growth and when we look at the full year in 2017 we'd expect our margins to maybe see a little bit of modern expansion, in spite of these investments, because of how well we're doing in operations and a strong dropdown that we have.","Neal BasuMullick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, that makes sense. I guess a follow-up on investments. The hub store initiative, how has the outlook changed, if at all? And do you see maybe more potential for future investments there?","Keith J. Allman - Masco Corp.","We're going to continue to invest behind our Pro growth initiative, our DIY initiatives. This is a good segment for us and it certainly is worthy of our money and generates a great return. So, we're going to continue to invest behind this category.","In terms of specifically the hub stores, we've got 200. We've got them all hired. We're bringing them up to speed. There's a bit of an investment in front of the revenue here, and so we're going to work these into a very solid payback for us and then we're going to continue to investigate with our partner, The Home Depot, where the best location is for further investments to grow. This is a good initiative for us.","Neal BasuMullick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. That's all for me. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Stephen East. Your line is open.","Stephen East - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you and congratulations, Keith and John. Keith, if you look at, you've got the highest first quarter margins since 2001. Can you just talk a little bit about what's driving that? Obviously, you've talked about volume, but I know you've done a lot in the past, so I'm just trying to understand how independent this is versus what commodities are doing, et cetera. I don't know where your capacity utilization is today versus in the past, that type of thing, so maybe just sort of a broad-brush explanation of how you all are driving what you're driving.","Keith J. Allman - Masco Corp.","Well, I think we've talked a little bit already on Plumbing where we've got a little bit of price in Europe ahead of the commodity increase, so that's helping a little bit. But fundamentally, I think it is about incremental dropdown on our volume and the success that we're having with our Masco Operating System to drive continuous improvement across the entire supply chain, from sourcing to operations, manufacturing, efficiencies, and the like. And that, of course, leads into fixed cost improvement. We intend to maintain our diligence and our control in SG&A. As we've talked about, we're going to \u2013 my favorite investment is to invest in the core and we're going to continue to do that, so we'll work our improvements and our leverage on those growth investments throughout the year.","When we think about where we'll end up, maybe a little bit of modest operation \u2013 or excuse me, margin expansion in the back half and for the full year is about how we're thinking about it. And that's pretty good, I think, considering where commodities are and as much as we're investing into the business for growth.","Stephen East - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. I appreciate that. And then, just following on that raw material inflation, you got out ahead of it a little bit on Plumbing, but as you look forward through 2016 (sic) [2017] (25:37) are you seeing more inflation, have you seen announcements, is more inflation coming through, and will you be able to stay in front of it, if so, or is this going to be some lag as you try to catch up to the raw material inflation?","Keith J. Allman - Masco Corp.","Yes, Steve, you said 2016, I assume you meant 2017.","Stephen East - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","2017.","Keith J. Allman - Masco Corp.","Yes, we are seeing some inflations in copper and zinc and across some other commodities, and as we've talked about in the past, over the long-term, we feel that our ability to basically come out as flush between price and commodities is very strong due to our operational performance that I talked about, the strength of our brands, our innovation pipeline that gives us that must-have position on the shelf. So, there's a number of things that help us feel good about overall price commodity mix, and I think we'll be able to offset that, as I talked about overall, with some slight margin expansion as we earn our way into leverage on our growth investments throughout the year.","John G. Sznewajs - Masco Corp.","Yes, Stephen, this is John, just to follow up on Keith's comments. There might be a little bit of lag, depending on the segment, depending on the quarter, where we might be a little bit behind the inflation versus price. But, we feel like, to Keith's point, that we can maintain it over the course of the longer-term, and that's really what's reflected in the $1.90 to $2.00 that we put out earlier today.","Stephen East - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Garik Shmois. Your line is open.","Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC","Thank you. Just wondering if you could speak a little bit to the paint business and outside of Pro, and you called out MARQUEE, as well, but what are you seeing just on core, I guess DIY sales? I think some of your competitors were speaking to some sluggishness in that category this last quarter. Did you see that and what is your expectations moving forward?","John G. Sznewajs - Masco Corp.","Yes, Garik, recall that we were up against, and I think both Keith and I mentioned in our prepared remarks that we were up against a tough 9% comp. And you reflect back on what took place last year, we had very strong exterior paint sales in the first quarter of 2016 due to some very favorable weather conditions. While the weather was still pretty good, and you never really like to cite weather, we did have some impact on our exterior paint sales here in the first quarter, no surprise to anyone. But overall, our gallons were up modestly Q1 versus \u2013 Q1 of this year versus Q1 of last year. So, feel good about how we played in our core DIY market.","Keith J. Allman - Masco Corp.","Just to add on to that a little bit to John's comment. As he mentioned, we think that the DIY market was down slightly in the quarter, mainly due to some of the \u2013 specifically in the weather-sensitive categories, around stain and exterior, but we believe we've outperformed the market, and then when you couple that with our DIY performance, we feel good about it \u2013 or excuse me, our Pro performance.","Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC","Okay, thank you. And then just as a follow-up on Cabinets, you had some compared headwinds in the first quarter, profitability was down because of that in Q1, but what's your expectation moving forward through the rest of the year in that business with respect to profitability and margins?","Keith J. Allman - Masco Corp.","We think we'll see some margin expansion from 2016.","John G. Sznewajs - Masco Corp.","Garik, recall in our first quarter 2016 call, we identified about $4 million of underspend in Q1 of 2016, so slightly inflated margins a year ago. And the $5 million of investments this year, you know, margins were pretty well flat year-over-year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Radnor (29:38). Your line is open.","Unknown Speaker","Hey, good morning, Keith and John. Question on Cabinets. If you exclude the exited sales, your overall segment is running about mid-single digits. I think that's been pretty consistent with the disclosures you've provided the past few quarters. Within the guidance, should we see that type of growth in the back half of the year when those exited sales are no longer in the comparisons?","John G. Sznewajs - Masco Corp.","Yes, Scott (30:04), that's what we're anticipating at this point, yes.","Unknown Speaker","And then when we think about the margin in that segment, I know you'd specified nothing on the softwood lumber side, but there were also tariffs on imported Chinese plywood. Could you maybe just talk to how there may or may not be an impact on the cost side?","John G. Sznewajs - Masco Corp.","Yes, that's still yet to be finalized at this point. We do think that that will have a, at this point, based on what we know, a several million dollar impact. So, we'll see. I mean, I think we're still driving to low double-digit margins.","Unknown Speaker","Got it. And then maybe just squeeze in a quick one, last one in. John, the international cash is about half or so of your what's on the balance sheet. Could you maybe talk to how you could create value with that cash? Whether it is repatriation or M&A?","John G. Sznewajs - Masco Corp.","Absolutely, Scott (31:02). So, it really depends on what tax policy comes out of Washington over the course of the coming months as to what we do with it. But, there's a couple of things that we could do with it. If we make an international acquisition, that would be anything outside of the U.S., whether it's Canada, Mexico, or anywhere else in the world, we could use that cash to make such an acquisition and not pay any tax on that cash, obviously. The other thing that we're looking at is to the extent that tax reform does take place and there's an ability to bring that cash at a very attractive cash rate, we may look to do that, depending on what M&A activity is bubbling up in our pipeline at that time.","Unknown Speaker","Great, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Dahl. Your line is open.","Michael Dahl - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi, thanks for taking my questions. One question on paint side. A lot of focus on the price\/cost relationship in paint over the past quarter, both for you and your competitors. And clearly, I think you're demonstrating that there are levers through which you can still drive very strong operating margins, and wondering if you could just lay out what your expectations are for the year now, as you think about starting to leverage the hub store investments, but then also potentially facing some greater material headwinds. Just what should we expect from paint margins?","Keith J. Allman - Masco Corp.","Hey, Mike, this is Keith. When we look across the pluses and the minuses and contemplate the growth investments that we're making and the time that it's going to \u2013 there's some investments, as I talked about last call and this one. Those investments are a little bit ahead of the revenue, so we've got to drive the volume, but we fully expect to do that throughout the year and get them to pay off. We are and expect to see some commodity increases in TiO2 and some of the inputs into resin, but we also have a very strong brand and a strong innovation pipeline that gives us some favorability with regards to where we are in that price\/cost relationship.","Overall, when we look at where we think the year will come in, we're expecting some, I would call it, modest to moderate compression on our margins, and we're at a very high level, but we expect to finish the year above the margin in terms of the long-term guidance that we've talked about in this segment.","Michael Dahl - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks. And shifting over to Windows, starting to see the signs of improvement and I think you mentioned that Joe's taking over as Group President officially. Can you talk about what your expectations are for Windows margins? I think you laid out mid-single digits for 2017, but as you look at the potential for improvement over the next two years to three years, what kind of the task is for the team there?","Keith J. Allman - Masco Corp.","Well, we really haven't changed our long-term outlook on that. We call it the 10% to 13% margin expectations long-term for this business. It's going to take us some time to get there, but you know, we might \u2013 Joe's doing a great job. The team, frankly, is pulling point together very nicely. They are behind Joe. It's a nice team that we have out there and we're going to work hard to get back to those levels or get to those levels as quickly as we can.","Michael Dahl - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tim Wojs. Your line is open.","Timothy Ronald Wojs - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Hey, guys, good morning. Nice job.","John G. Sznewajs - Masco Corp.","Thank you.","Keith J. Allman - Masco Corp.","Thank you.","Timothy Ronald Wojs - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","I guess just going to the international business, I think EBIT margins were down there year-over-year for the second consecutive quarter. Is there a \u2013 can you talk about any investments that you're making in the Hansgrohe or is there any sort of different price\/cost relationship that's happening internationally versus in North America?","John G. Sznewajs - Masco Corp.","Yes, Tim, there was a little bit of investment in Q1 across the international businesses. One was this international trade show that we go to that cost us $4 million, $5 million in the first quarter. So, that's a component of it. And then similar to some of our other businesses, we're just making some small investments in management and some growth investments that \u2013 the four other small businesses that we have over in both UK and Germany. So, it's just some small investments that we're making across those businesses.","Timothy Ronald Wojs - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay. And then just maybe bigger picture in the paint business, I mean, are you seeing \u2013 there's been some speculation that there's just a structural change in the dynamics between Pro and DIY and I'm curious what your thoughts are on that, if you're seeing just maybe a lot more pressure on the DIY market as people maybe turning towards more professional painting.","John G. Sznewajs - Masco Corp.","We've heard that, Tim, from others in the market, and our view is that while that may be a near-term phenomena, our view is that as the 90 million Millennials come through the system here and start getting into homes, whether they're multi-family homes or single-family homes, that they're going to be a little bit cash-strapped with their student debt and the like, and so therefore an easy home improvement initiative to undertake is painting your house. And they're more likely to be DIY painters than do-it-for-me painters. So, yes, we think while there might be a near-term \u2013 short-term issue, longer-term the dynamics play in our favor.","Timothy Ronald Wojs - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Great. Good luck on the rest of the year.","John G. Sznewajs - Masco Corp.","Thank you.","Keith J. Allman - Masco Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Kim. Your line is open.","Trey Morrish - Evercore Group LLC","Hi, guys. It's actually Trey on for Steve. Thanks for taking some time for our questions. So, first I wanted to go back to your guidance of $1.90 to $2.00. You talked about it being a $0.06 benefit due to tax for the year. I was wondering what the other pushes and pulls are that caused you guys to change your guidance by, call it, $0.09 at the midpoint ex tax?","John G. Sznewajs - Masco Corp.","Yes, I think a couple of things, Trey, that we've been seeing in the business over the course of the last several quarters and that's the continued strength we're seeing really across the business, in particular, Plumbing, as Keith mentioned early, is performing at an extremely high level. Then as you look at some of the other businesses, the sustainability and the improvement in our Cabinet operations there, and we feel very confident about how it will perform in the coming quarters, particularly once we get through the exit of this low-margin builder direct business.","If you look at our paint business, again just continued solid performance from the Behr team and what they've been able to execute on both the DIY side as well as the Pro side in that business. So, that gives us a lot of confidence. And then we really are impressed with what Joe and the team are doing at Milgard to get that Window business turned around. So, if you think about each of the businesses and how they are performing, each is performing at a slightly higher level than we had initially anticipated, and so that gave us the confidence to raise our view of our performance for the balance of the year. You couple that with the $0.06 benefit from tax, and that's how you end up between that $1.90 and $2.00.","Keith J. Allman - Masco Corp.","Trey, you may recall last call we talked about being very confident that we would exceed our $1.80 target. We felt that it was prudent to come out with some more clarity around a range of outcomes, particularly to serve as a jump-off point for our Investor Day when we're going to talk about our long-term growth strategies.","Trey Morrish - Evercore Group LLC","Got you. Thanks for that. And following a bit more on paint, you cited that Behr MARQUEE was definitely a benefit in the quarter. I was wondering if you could potentially quantify what better margin, the high-end Behr MARQUEE has against the normal Behr brand? And also, if you could, how much did raw mats impact the Decorative Architecture business as a whole in the quarter?","John G. Sznewajs - Masco Corp.","Yes, Trey, just given the unique relationship that we have with a very large customer, we don't disclose those types of items, but appreciate the question.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Lovallo. Your line is open.","John Lovallo - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, guys, thanks for taking my call. First question is on, I guess, on the Milgard restructuring effort. Can you give us an idea of just kind of some of the things that Joe has accomplished so far? Maybe, kind of what's left to do here, and when are you anticipating that you'll have this thing wrapped up?","Keith J. Allman - Masco Corp.","Well, we've really attacked it. Joe's organized a plan that touches across many fronts, so we've reorganized the reporting relationships and the structures. What really happened with this business is it's changed quite dramatically from where it was say five years ago or six years ago, where we were mainly a builder line of windows making, let's call it, open to mid-price point range products and very much consistency across the factories.","And then over time, that's changed to where now we have gotten a much, much broader assortment focused, frankly, on repair and remodeling, which is good for us, more steady business, more repeatable business, higher margin business. So, it's all positive, but it did induce some change over time into the requirements of the supply chain.","So, there was a significant amount of work that Joe and the team have done and continue to do with regards to dialing in the supply chain that is comfortable with increased SKU count and proliferation, if you will, of a larger assortment to go after DIY. And we've made some changes to the team. I would tell you that we're recruiting and are very close to landing a very talented executive to be the President for that business unit. And the reason for Joe's promotion is obviously commensurate with his performance that he's demonstrated and the way he's done it, his prowess with the Masco Operating System, but also a strong desire to want to continue and have continuity across these two businesses. And Joe gives us that, so we're excited about it, and Joe's going to do a great job.","John Lovallo - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, that's helpful. And then any updated thoughts around currency? I think you guys had outlined about $100 million hit to revenue in 2017. It looks like some of the rates have moved in your favor. Any updated thoughts there?","John G. Sznewajs - Masco Corp.","Yes, no, we continue to look at about $100 million. No, you're right, John. If currency rates stay, that will probably come down a little bit off of that.","John Lovallo - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Wood. Your line is open.","Michael Wood - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Hi, good morning, Keith and John. I understand the tough comp in the paint gallon growth that you had this quarter. I'm curious if you can give us any color in where that gallon growth is either tracking now at the start of 2Q or maybe where you're betting in your full year guidance in terms of gallon growth for paint?","John G. Sznewajs - Masco Corp.","Mike, we've kind of walked away from giving intra-quarter numbers, just because of some of the volatility that can be induced. So, not much to comment in the quarter. I think, for the full year we do expect, again, a continued modest gallon growth over the course of 2017.","Michael Wood - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay. And you had called out incremental investment in Cabinets and Plumbing. Did you have any in paint this quarter? And just longer-term, is there any room for any more product expansion in paint? I know you've been pretty active over the past decade really there with rolling out new products.","John G. Sznewajs - Masco Corp.","Yes, I'll take the first part of that and I'll let Keith talk about the new products. So, yes, we did have a little bit of incremental investment. That's related to the \u2013 it's really the waterfall effect of the hub store investments that we made in the first part in the second half of 2016. So, we'll still feel the effects of those really pretty much through all of 2017, though it should be diminishing effect as the year rolls out.","Keith J. Allman - Masco Corp.","On the innovation side, we've really been very proud of Behr and just building the team out there in terms of their steady pipeline of innovation that they've been able to deliver on, whether it's on the merchandising side with the Color Selection Center, to Paint & Primer in One, to DECKOVER. I mean, the list goes on and on with what they have been able to do. And as we review and look at the pipelines out there, we remain confident, and I would definitely not tell you that there's no more new products to be developed in the coatings space and Behr is going to be an active part of that in the industry.","Michael Wood - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Keith Hughes. Your line is open.","Keith Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thanks. Going back to Windows, you had talked about a goal of getting to mid-single digits in terms of EBIT for this year and I think longer, more like 10%. Are those goals still achievable?","Keith J. Allman - Masco Corp.","Yes, I would say 10% to 13% on the long-term, and yes, mid-single digits is what we're going to get.","Keith Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","And I think there was an ERP issue last year that (44:37) cost in addition to the other problems you highlighted earlier. Is that now fixed?","Keith J. Allman - Masco Corp.","Well, the ERP issue really involved the rollout to one of our factories and we've got that behind us and that factory is running very smoothly. In fact, we've started to roll that out to other factories. We had a rollout to our Dallas factory in the quarter and it went flawlessly. So, yes, we're in good shape there.","Keith Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bob Wetenhall. Your line is open.","Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey, thanks for all the color. I guess we can skip the Investor Day. So, great quarter. I just had like kind of a cleanup question. Would it be okay just thinking about 2017, and again this is for Mr. Sznewajs, kind of like cash flow from operations, $750 million and CapEx at $150 million and free cash flow of $600 million as a ballpark just to think about your firepower for M&A?","John G. Sznewajs - Masco Corp.","Yes, Bob, I think we've got CapEx of about $200 million for the year, so probably a little bit higher than that. But, I think your net number that you calculated is probably pretty much in the ballpark.","Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Got it. And are you having increased working capital intensity in the quarter?","John G. Sznewajs - Masco Corp.","Bob, we did have a little bit of seasonality going into the spring selling season, so I think our folks stocked up a little bit in order to meet anticipated demands, but I think that over the course of the year, that will tail off, and we'll get back to more normalized levels.","Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Got you. And just one kind of big picture question and then I'll hop off. If you're thinking about domestic versus international markets and you look at the strength of domestic Plumbing versus Hansgrohe, how'd you qualify kind of like domestic R&R? It seems very robust, both in paint and Plumbing, contrast that with kind of what you're seeing in European markets and how you just \u2013 there's less clarity into demand side of the equation over there, what are you seeing on the ground and how do you think that evolves during the rest of the 2017 for Europe and international? Thanks and good luck.","Keith J. Allman - Masco Corp.","Thanks for the question, Bob. I think demand over in Europe remains solid. It's always been a case of where some of the countries run a little hotter at one point than the others, but by-and-large, when we look at Europe, we have good demand over there and we anticipate that to continue. Spain and Italy, believe it or not, has actually picked up and is performing nicely for us. So, on the European continent, and the UK is showing good solid demand.","So, overall on the continent, it's good for us and outside, in terms of China and Asia-Pacific, very strong market and strong share gains for us with Hansgrohe. And we're continuing to invest in sales force to drive volume in our focused markets and innovation and design, et cetera. So, we feel good and we have a jewel, frankly, in Hansgrohe and it's doing well.","Operator","Your last question comes from the line of Adam Baumgarten. Your line is open.","Adam Baumgarten - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Hey, guys, just a quick question on Cabinets. Can you walk through the promotional activity throughout the quarter, especially in retail?","Keith J. Allman - Masco Corp.","Yes, retail promotions are good for us, oftentimes, and certainly that was the case this past quarter, our retail partners choose exclusive promotions because they want to promote the best brand in the category, and that's KraftMaid. That's good for them in terms of its driving foot traffic and it's good for us. It's profitable growth business for us and we participate in that. So, I would say overall the promotional environment was maybe up a little bit in the aisle, but it's a very solid business for us and continues to drive profitable growth.","Adam Baumgarten - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Thanks a lot, guys.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call.

I will now turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Maria Duey. Maria, you may begin.","Maria Duey","Thank you, Christie, and good morning to everyone. Welcome to Masco Corporation's First Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me on our call today are Tim Wadhams, President and CEO of Masco; and John Sznewajs, Masco's Vice President, Treasurer and Chief Financial Officer. Our first quarter earnings release and the presentation slides that we will refer to during the call are available on the Investor Relations portion of our website. You will note that we have changed the format of our presentation and analyst package as we continue to work on improving our communication with the investment community. Following our prepared remarks, the call will be open for analyst questions.","[Operator Instructions] If we are unable to take your question during the call, please feel free to call me directly at (313) 792-5500. ","If you'd refer to Slide 2 in the presentation, I'd like to remind you that today's presentation includes our views about Masco's future performance, which constitute forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. We've described these risks and uncertainties in our risk factors in our Form 10-K that we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Today's presentation also includes non-GAAP financial measures. We\u2019ve provided a reconciliation of these measurements on our website at www.masco.com. ","With that, I'll now turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Tim Wadhams. Tim?","Timothy Wadhams","Thank you, Maria, and thank all of you for joining us today. And if you would please flip to Slide #4. We're pleased with our first quarter results. Housing dynamics improved, helped a little bit by weather, but for us, a solid quarter. Top line was up 7%. We had very strong performance in our Decorative Architectural segment, where we have our paints and stains and builders' hardware. Our Installation segment was also strong in the quarter, and we had pretty good topside in terms of our Plumbing-related businesses, impacted a little bit by foreign currency. Sales to key retailers were also strong, and you'll hear more about that as we work our way through the presentation.","Another area that was certainly pleasing to us were our margins in the quarter, which were the highest for any first quarter since 2008's first quarter. On an adjusted basis, our operating incremental margin was 44%, which is particularly pleasing, reflecting our operating leverage, the fact that we had price\/commodity relationships positive in the quarter and also reflecting our ongoing focus on total cost and productivity.","Earnings per share were a positive $0.05 on an adjusted basis again, and that compares to a loss last year of $0.04. So we had a nice swing in terms of EPS, and we'll get into the details as we work our way through the segments during the presentation but off to a good start in 2012.","In addition to our financial results, we also made a lot of progress on the strategic initiatives that we're pursuing. And if you would flip to Slide #5, these are the strategic initiatives that we communicated earlier this year that we're focusing on to drive improved performance and position us to outperform the housing recovery. Those strategies include extending our market leadership by leveraging our brands with innovative new products, cost reduction, improving our underperforming businesses and strengthening our balance sheet.","And if you would please flip to Slide #6, we'll talk a little bit about how we performed against those strategies in the first quarter. We feel like we continue to enhance our industry-leading brands and market position across our product groups. We continue to win international project opportunities in Plumbing, and our late fourth quarter 2011 acquisition of a bolt-on entry-level price point  spa business has broaden our hot tub offerings and is going very well.","Our Installation business, I mentioned earlier, was up significantly in the quarter, and a couple of the adjacent channels that we've been cultivating over the course of the last couple of years had very strong performance. That would include retrofit and commercial. We continue to expand our window offerings in the Western U.S., successfully into Canada -- Western Canada, excuse me, as well as Texas. And our new Behr paint product offerings that we talked about at the end of the fourth quarter have been launched very successfully at Home Depot, and our Pro paint business continues to do well.","Our focus on total cost and productivity generated over $40 million of gross profit improvements in the quarter, and we're well on our way to the $150 million that we mentioned in the first quarter -- or the fourth quarter earnings call for 2011. And again, that's a gross number, the $150 million.","During our fourth quarter 2011 earnings call, we talked about some of the -- in detail about some of our plans to improve our Installation and Cabinet segments. And we had very good performance, we believe, in the first quarter. In aggregate, we reduced losses by over $25 million and certainly believe that we're well on our way and feel confident about the targets that we set in the fourth quarter earnings call. We'll do a more in-depth update on those 2 segments as we get into and through the second quarter in July. But certainly, we feel like we're on track to deliver what we talked about back in the fourth quarter call. ","And in terms of our balance sheet, we successfully issued some debt during the quarter. We've got $750 million of maturity due in July of this year. John will talk about that as he works his way through some of the detail here. And we ended the quarter with $1.8 billion of cash. ","And at this point, if you'd flip to Slide #7, we'll turn the call over to John Sznewajs, our CFO, who will talk a little bit about some of our financial and operational detail.","John G. Sznewajs","Thanks, Tim, and good morning, everyone. I guess I'd ask you to flip to Slide 8. As Tim mentioned, we delivered improved results in the first quarter. Revenue grew 7% due to increased demand across our key channels, particularly our retail channel, where sales to key retailers were up high single digits and, excluding product exits, were up low double digits. International sales were up 1% in the quarter and 5% in local currencies. Adjusted gross margins expanded to 26.5% as a result of increased volume, profit improvements and price increases. We did a better job of leveraging our SG&A in the quarter as adjusted SG&A as a percent of sales dropped 180 basis points to 20.5%.","We're also very pleased with the bottom line performance as adjusted operating income increased 93% in the quarter to $112 million with an adjusted operating margin of 6%. Our company-wide incremental margin was 44% in the quarter, reflecting strong operating leverage in the business. And our adjusted EPS improved $0.09 in the quarter from a loss of $0.04 last year to $0.05 positive in Q1 2012.","Turning to Slide 9. We see the components of our operating income improvement in the first quarter. The $18 million product -- improvement in net volume\/mix was principally being driven by our increased volume in our Installation, Plumbing and Decorative Architecture segments, partially offset by the negative mix of approximately $14 million in our Plumbing segment, which largely relates to Hansgrohe as they continue to penetrate new markets.","Net price\/commodity improved $22 million in the quarter, largely driven by our Plumbing segment and reflects the benefit of our metals hedge, which was approximately $7 million positive in the quarter. While we anticipate raw material cost escalations in our Decorative Architectural segment, we continue to believe that we can, at a minimum, neutralize commodity costs companywide in 2012.","The profit improvements of $14 million were principally driven by our 2 most challenged segments, Cabinets and Installation, as those management teams continued to drive productivity and cost improvements into their businesses. As an example, enterprise-wide headcount is down approximately 4% in the first quarter of -- compared to the first quarter of 2011.","Turning to Slide 10. You can see our Plumbing segment grew 5% in the quarter, driven by international project growth and increased share in both the retail and wholesale channels in North America, with our wholesale channel sales up low double digits. Several of our most important North American faucet brands, Delta, Peerless and Brizo, saw sales grow high single digits as they continue to gain share through new product launches. Sales were negatively impacted by $14 million, reducing segment sales by 2% due to foreign currency translation. And although our European outlook remains challenging, European sales in the segment were up 5% in local currency for the quarter due to international project growth. ","Our Plumbing segment enjoyed 160 basis points of margin expansion in the quarter, driven principally by a favorable price\/commodity relationship of approximately $20 million, which includes the $7 million benefit from our metals hedge. I should mention that our European Plumbing operations accounted for the majority of the favorable price\/commodity relationship in the quarter. Margins in this segment were also negatively impacted by mix in the quarter of approximately $14 million, again principally from our Hansgrohe unit, as I mentioned earlier.","Turning to Slide 11. You can see that the revenue in our Decorative Architectural segment grew an impressive 16% in the quarter, driven by a Behr's strong DIY paint sales, continued growth with a Pro paint contractor and price increases, the implementation of which was completed in early Q2. Paint volume was up mid-single digits in the quarter. The growth of Behr's DIY paint sales occurred amidst a competitive retail environment and was aided by favorable weather in the quarter and new product introductions. We also saw nice revenue gains from our builders' hardware business in the quarter as their results improved following a tough 2011.","The Behr product introductions we outlined in our fourth quarter call, the new and improved formations for both Behr Premium Plus and #1-rated Behr Premium Plus Ultra Interior, the 0-VOC colors and the new merchandising for our exterior wood products are in all stores, as planned, and are performing very well at retail. Our outreach to the professional paint contractors continues to grow. We saw increased growth in our Behr Pro program, which we continue to invest in heavily.","Sequential operating margin improvement was the result of increased volume, the timing of price increases and profit improvement initiatives. It was also aided by the performance of our builders' hardware business. This was partially offset by increased growth initiatives spend for both international expansion in our Pro growth and loading costs for the new programs. The price\/commodity relationship was neutral for the quarter. This said, we continue to expect further raw material pressures, especially in TiO2 and resins in 2012.","So please turn to Slide 12. While the environment for cabinetry remains challenging as our segment sales were down 3%, we had some positive developments in the segment during the quarter. If we exclude the sales related to the planned exit of our RTA products of $9 million and exclude the $3 million negative impact of foreign currency translation, Cabinet segment sales were up 1% in the quarter.","Breaking down the sales in a little bit more detail, we experienced solid growth with our countertop sales at both retail and with the big builders, and our direct to builder sales were up mid-teens percent. We're the clear market share leader in the builder channel and are well positioned to benefit from our relationships with many of the big builders, including DR Horton, Lennar and Pulte. We're also beginning to see success from our multifamily initiatives. ","This growth was primarily offset by a decline in dealer channel sales and was driven by our decision to pull back on our promotional activity. Competitive promotional activity remains elevated in both the dealer and home center channels, and we've responded with disciplined promotions to meet these competitive situations.","As we anticipated, we improved the -- our operating loss in the quarter by $9 million. Much of this improvement was driven by the benefits from our prior profit improvement initiatives. So at this time, we still believe we're on track to realize the $40 million of profit improvement that we outlined on our fourth quarter call. ","Flip to Slide 13, please. Looking at our Installation segment, we are very pleased with the performance of this segment in the first quarter. Segment sales grew 18% and were fueled by higher volumes and share gains across all 4 lines of business: residential new construction, retrofit, commercial and distribution. Sales were negatively impacted due to the closure of previously announced underperforming branch locations and a mix shift to multifamily starts. Our efforts over the last year to increase our participation in the multifamily segment have proved very successful, and our Installation businesses is now nicely positioned to take advantage of future growth opportunities within both the single-family and multifamily channels. We continue to focus on increasing our Installation sales with the largest homebuilders, and we are well positioned to grow this business with the big builders.","In addition to strong top line performance, management's strong execution delivered solid bottom line results, with operating profit improving by nearly 60% and operating margins expanding by 900 basis points. This operating profit improvement was largely due to increased volume and strong cost productivity. We expect this trend to continue throughout the year, and we believe we are on track to deliver at a minimum of $30 million of operating profit improvement that we detailed for you on our February call.","On Slide 14, you can see our Other Specialty Products segment sales declined by 2% in the quarter. We experienced share gains in the U.K. new home construction market and at Milgard in the Western U.S. We also saw increased sales of staple guns at retail in the quarter. These sales gains were offset due to the exit of select Eastern U.S. window markets in late last year. Excluding these market exits, segment sales would have been up 2%.","Operating margins improved by 390 basis points or more than 50% due to the profit improvements resulting from the rationalization activities undertaken in the third and fourth quarters of last year, also improved price\/commodity relationships, including a decline in rebate activity, partially offset by inflation.","Turn to Slide 15, please. As we announced in the first quarter, we issued $400 million of 10-year notes with an interest rate of just below 6%. These notes were issued to prefund a portion of our July 2012 maturity of $745 million, and we intend to pay down the balance of this maturity with cash from the balance sheet. During the course of the quarter, we repurchased $46 million on the July 2012 maturity. We had interest rate swaps outstanding in anticipation of this debt issuance, and the termination of these swaps increased the effective interest rate on the debt to approximately 6.5%. The negative interest carry is approximately $0.02 per share for the full year of 2012. ","We improved working capital as a percent of sales in the quarter, defined as AR plus inventory less payables, from 15.5% to 14.7%. This is great work from everyone in operations on that metric. Finally, we finished the quarter with $1.8 billion of cash in the balance sheet, which includes $400 million from the debt -- the March debt issuance. ","I will now turn the call back over to Tim to discuss our outlook.","Timothy Wadhams","Thank you, John. And if you would please flip to Slide #17. These are the priorities that we identified earlier this year in support of our strategies. And we won't go through -- we've talked about almost all of these as we've worked our way through the presentation, so I won't take a lot of time here, but we feel like we made significant progress in terms of accomplishing our objectives against these priorities in the first quarter. And as John mentioned, I'd like to thank our employees across the enterprise. Not only did we have a good quarter from a financial perspective, we also had a solid quarter in terms of the initiatives that are important to us from a strategic standpoint and, certainly, against the priorities that we've identified. And we'll continue to update the investment community against these priorities as we work our way through the rest of the year.","If you\u2019d please flip to Slide #18, a couple of comments before we go to the Q&A session. There still are some challenges out there. There's no question about that, some challenges and uncertainties as we look out into the rest of 2012. European economies, big ticket remodel activity, commodities, mix, lack of job growth are all issues that are certainly on the radar screen. ","But having said that, we're encouraged. We're encouraged from a couple of perspectives. One, that housing dynamics, as we mentioned earlier, have continued to improve. The blue chip consensus at this point in time for housing starts is at 740,000 units, and that's up 20%-plus over last year. But I think more important than that is the fact that over the course of the last 6 months or so, that average metric has gone up 10,000 units per month. That kind of contrasts to last year at this point in time when it was going the other direction at pretty much the same magnitude. So we see that as a plus. Housing inventories are low in general and very low in certain areas, and demand seems to be increasing, including from investors. Affordability remains attractive, and home prices appear to be stabilizing. ","In addition to those encouraging signs, we're also encouraged that we got off to a good start in 2012 as it relates to a couple of areas. And importantly, our Cabinet and Installation businesses, we've seen some meaningful improvement in the first quarter, and as John mentioned and I mentioned earlier, we feel like we're on track to drive the improvement that we communicated earlier this year. ","We're also encouraged that price\/commodity relationships have improved. We're still behind the curve. After the last couple of years, I think all of the investors know that have followed us that we've been a little bit behind the 8 ball, but getting to a positive relationship in the first quarter is certainly pleasing. And as John mentioned, we certainly expect that over the course of this year, we'll at least be able to neutralize price\/commodity impact on our operations. A lot of good work going on in the cost structure. Operating leverage is one of the strong points of our enterprise, and the 44% margin that we generated in the first quarter certainly is pleasing. ","We understand that one quarter does not make a full year. We've got a long way to go, a lot of work to do against our objectives but certainly feel that as we continue to focus on our strategies, continue to focus on the priorities that we've identified, we'll -- in terms of strengthening our brands, improving our execution, reducing cost, that we\u2019ll continue to drive value for our shareholders. ","And with that, Christie, we'll open up the lines for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Dennis McGill with Zelman & Associates.","Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, Research Division","One question on the Install business. Did you say that the guidance right now or the goal right now is to lessen the loss by $30 million?","Timothy Wadhams","Yes. That's what we communicated, Dennis, at the -- in the fourth quarter earnings call. We provided -- in fact, there's a slide in the Appendix, Slide #24. That is the same slide that we communicated back at the -- in the fourth quarter earnings call. And I believe that, that shows an improvement of about $30 million in addition to the $6 million that relates to the branch closure. So in essence, it's a $35 million -- or a $36 million improvement versus the prior year, and we obviously got about $19 million of that in the first quarter. And I think as John mentioned, we think we'll do at least this well as we work our way through the rest of the year.","Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, Research Division","Well I guess, Tim, why not update that, realizing you're halfway there and you're seeing the acceleration in volumes? And there's obviously some lag there, so you would expect that to continue through the year. What's the hesitancy with updating that now?","Timothy Wadhams","No real hesitancy, Dennis. I think what we decided to do on both Cabs and Installation is wait till we get through the second quarter and then provide a little bit more detail. But we certainly would anticipate, if we continue to see the same level of activity, the same conversion that we saw in the first quarter, that we'll be able to improve on the Installation number for sure as we work our way through the rest of the year.","Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, Research Division","Okay. And then I guess separately, can you maybe go into a little bit more detail on volumes and what you're seeing within your European business, both by product category and then maybe by your major regions there?","Timothy Wadhams","Yes. Volumes as it relates to Europe?","Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, Research Division","Yes.","Timothy Wadhams","Yes, we had a good first quarter. As John mentioned, we were up 5% in local currencies. Most of that was driven by Hansgrohe, which had a record March in terms of top line. So they continue to do very well. A lot of that, as you know, is emerging markets as well as project work related to some international opportunities. So they continue to make good progress. The United Kingdom continues to be relatively flat for us, Dennis. We look at our Cabinet business and our Plumbing business. Plumbing was -- I think both those were slightly down in the quarter. Our window business was up a little bit, so I think if you put all that together, we were probably flat. Certainly don't see any significant improvement in terms of the macro outlook for the U.K., but feel like our businesses, particularly the window business -- we've talked about that in the past -- continues to take share and has some nice growth opportunities, including a couple of things they're looking at from a retail perspective that aren't fully developed yet but will be a little later on, and we'll be able to talk about those. Our Danish business saw a little bit of top line improvement but not real dramatic in terms of that particular business. Still have a lot of challenge there in terms of input cost with particle board, but feel like we're getting a little bit of traction. We're doing some things from a sales representation standpoint, sales staff standpoint that should give us some better opportunity for penetration going forward. And in addition to that, our tub shower surround business, Hoopa [ph], had an okay month -- okay quarter. But I would say that things look like they're slowing down a little bit as we think about some of the challenges in Europe. So I would say that as we look ahead, we're still cautious relative to Europe. I think that we're in a good position with Hansgrohe because of their diversification, but the economies, generally speaking, I think on the continent, as everyone knows, I think look like they're going to be a little bit slower than last year.","Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, Research Division","And just to wrap up on that, is Hansgrohe growing in developed countries in Europe?","Timothy Wadhams","Yes, they are. Go ahead, John.","John G. Sznewajs","Yes. It is, Dennis. If they kind of break out their sales, I think they\u2019re doing fairly well in the stronger economies. So Central Europe, places like Germany, Austria and Switzerland are doing just fine. Northern Europe, Scandinavia is going okay for them. They are experiencing some softness, particularly in Southern Europe, at this point in time. They're also experiencing some -- actually, some pretty good growth in Eastern Europe. Whether it's Russia, Poland, Czech Republic, they're doing quite well over there. So pretty good broad mix of strength across most of the regions of Europe, except, of course, the southern tier of countries.","Timothy Wadhams","And remember, Dennis, we do have some mix-related challenges with that business. We've talked about that in the past as we continue to penetrate international markets, that's typically at a lower price point. And we've also seen with some of our existing business, given some of the economic challenges that exist, a little bit of a trade down as well.","Operator","Your next audio question comes from the line of Peter Lisnic with Robert W. Baird.","Peter Lisnic - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","First question, I guess. Can you maybe give us a little feel for what April's look like across the business, particularly in Paint? And maybe if we could strip out some of the favorable weather, that'd be great.","Timothy Wadhams","Yes. Tough to strip out weather, Dennis. That's for sure. Although in our area of the world, April is -- has been a little bit more like March, traditionally has been not real good from a weather prospective. We came out of March -- we were up mid-single digits in terms of March. And it looks like April -- we don't have the numbers in at this point in time, but it looks like April in North America will be up at least low single digits. At this point in time and kind of back to Dennis' question, it looks like Europe is going to be down a little bit in April. But our sense is...","John G. Sznewajs","Excuse me, Tim. I think, actually, April in Europe was flat in local currency.","Timothy Wadhams","Yes. In local currency, it's flat, but I think we've got some foreign currency translation that's impacting us. So from a local currency standpoint, Europe looks like it will be flat but down a little bit because of currency. So at that -- at this point, Peter, from our perspective, our sense is that there's probably a little bit of inventory balancing going on in April with some of our customers. Our POS has been relatively strong in April, so we're encouraged by that. But at this point, it looks like up in North America, I'd say mid-single digits -- or low single digits, excuse me.","Peter Lisnic - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. And then just on the -- Tim, you mentioned the productivity improvement, I guess, or the cost saves running at -- or targeted at $150 million. You got over $40 million in the first quarter. But if I look at that waterfall chart on operating income, there's only a $14 million benefit that I see there. What were the offsets? Or am I not reading that chart correctly?","Timothy Wadhams","No, you're reading it correct, Peter. The $40 million is a gross number. And as we've mentioned in the past, typically, we have inflation that is offset against that. We could have growth initiative spend, for example, in a couple of different segments. So what we try to do is net that down to the amount that ultimately drops to the bottom line. But in the first quarter, we had obviously some offsets to that. And I think that if you go back and look at last year, we were probably neutral, as I recall. Even though we did generate about $140 million to $145 million of gross cost reductions or profit improvements, we ended up the year in effectively kind of a neutral situation again, given some of the growth initiative spend that we had last year.","Operator","Your next audio question comes from the line of Mike Wood with Macquarie Capital.","Mike Wood - Macquarie Research","In the Paint segment, are you planning additional price increases to offset the higher TiO2 that you'd mentioned?","Timothy Wadhams","Well, yes. Just to give -- roll the tape back a little bit, Mike, we did announce in our fourth quarter earnings call that we were in the process of implementing price increases related to Paint. That started early February and was completed in early April. So we did implement, across all of our products, price increases at that point in time. Now that took into account, as we mentioned, what was currently reflected in some of the cost inputs that we were addressing.","Mike Wood - Macquarie Research","Okay. And the -- you provided the point-of-sale detail for April. Can you give it to us for the first quarter to give us a sense of whether or not there was actually restocking in the quarter or if you can give us any color on where inventory levels stand?","Timothy Wadhams","Yes. POS, I think, was pretty solid in the first quarter, Mike. Our sense is that we were up pretty strong in Plumbing, for example, in trade. There could have been a little bit of inventory build there, but we did have some load-in as it relates to Paint. We talked about that with the 3 new product launches, but it would be kind of difficult for me to comment on that. I don't think that there was an excessive amount of inventory build that would have helped our product. There could have been a little bit in a couple of different channels but not anything that would have significantly moved the needle.","Operator","Your next audio question comes from the line of Michael Rehaut with JPMorgan.","Michael Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","First question. I was hoping to get a little better granularity with the $40 million and the $150 million, which you -- and the detail is very, very helpful. We appreciate it and, of course, always ask for more detail as a result. But the -- just trying to understand kind of the math in terms of what falls to the bottom line. If you could go through what the $40 million going down to $14 million on the quarter, what were the offsets there? And on the full year, maybe just to extrapolate what you might think would also kind of ultimately flow through.","Timothy Wadhams","I wouldn't necessarily, Mike, want to give a full year estimate at this point. That can be affected by a lot of different things. But basically, as John mentioned, most of the drop to the bottom line was in the Cabinet- and Installation-related segments. And both of those were pretty healthy in terms of the gross amount, Cabs around $10 million, Install just a little bit below that. We also had a pretty significant number in Plumbing, around $15 million in the quarter. And most of that was offset by inflation and about $5 million of growth initiative spend related to our International business, some expansion we're doing in Western Canada with a tub manufacturer, one of our tub manufacturers. So that offset that for the most part. We also had cost savings in the other 3 segments -- or the other 2 segments, excuse me, Decorative Arch and Other. Other contributed to the profit turnaround that John talked about as well. As we look at a full year -- on a full year basis, on a gross basis, we would look for Cabs and Plumbing to be somewhere around $40 million to $45 million; Installation, around $25 million to $30 million; Decorative Arch, somewhere in the $10 million to $15 million range; and Other, around $20 million to $25 million, which gets us pretty close to that $150 million. And again, that's a gross number, but the way we look at that, we look at that as providing currency to help us fund some of the growth initiatives that we're pursuing as well as offset inflationary impacts that range from everything from healthcare to just normal inflation that's outside of the commodity area. We try to provide the investment community with price\/commodity relationship information that is outside of the profit improvement offset, if you will.","Michael Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Great. I appreciate it. Second question on Decorative. You had a great top line, but it didn't come through on the bottom line given the, still, lag on the price increase that you've noted set to go -- was set to go through early this second quarter. But now with the higher TiO2 prices flowing through on top of that, could you give us a sense of, if second quarter, third quarter, do you expect the price increases to get you back where you can match a year ago in terms of the margins or even exceed that? And how do you think about where you are from a bigger picture? Well, let me ask you -- I'll just let you answer this first, and then I'll just finish off on the question.","Timothy Wadhams","Yes. The question basically is in terms of TiO2 going forward. There has been an announced industry cost increase of $0.10 a pound that is supposed to be effective on April 1, and that would not have been included in our pricing discussion that we mentioned earlier relative to what we started to implement in early February and completed in early April. So we'll have to work either in terms of working on productivity, working with our suppliers or in terms of prices to offset that. Having said that, your question was, generally, do we anticipate that our pricing puts us in a position to accomplish or achieve the same margin level that we had last year. And at this point, we would anticipate having some additional pressure in terms of commodity-related costs. As I mentioned, we've got to do some work to offset what happened in April. Having said that, one of the things I think, Mike, that we should benefit from are increased volumes as we look at the second and third quarter. And my sense would be that we'll get a volume lift if things continue to move in the direction that they've been moving. And obviously, we've got pretty good incremental margins there, so that should help us. I'd rather not get into trying to predict margins going forward. We did say at the beginning of the year, in that fourth quarter earnings call that we expected a little bit of pressure in terms of commodities on margin in Paint. Our sense is that we'll get a little bit of lift in terms of volume as we continue to work through the year that will help offset that. But I'd rather not get into trying to predict what those margins might be at this point in time.","Michael Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. Just the second part of that was just bigger picture or longer term, when you look at Decorative Architectural, 2011 x charges is around 17% margin. This year, it might be a little bit less, depending on what you can do in terms of the incremental inflation. When you look at sort of the great years of '06 to 2010 when you were in that low 20s, generally low 20s type range, is that something that you can think you can get back to? Or given the fact that over the last couple of years, there's been more product innovation pressure, people matching -- certainly, that's kind of an ongoing exercise, but do you see impediments to getting back to that low 20s type of profitability? Or are we in more of this mid- to high-teens range for the near to medium term?","Timothy Wadhams","Yes. I think -- yes, good question, Mike. I think that we got a similar question when he we had our fourth quarter earnings call. And what we mentioned there is that as we continue to grow the business and grow the business through the Pro paint initiative, grow the business through opportunities that might be -- that we're developing and looking at internationally, that we probably would see some negative impact, if you will, on margin. So getting back to the levels that you cited, given that we're diversifying our product offerings, diversifying the markets that we go after, really trying to focus on growth -- and again, growth is very important to our channel partner, The Home Depot, as well -- that there probably will be a little bit of pressure on margin as we go after those different categories. So I would see us probably not getting back to those kind of levels. But having said that, I would expect that we would generate a nice return on assets. We've got a very efficient operation. And to the extent that we can grow our business, generate absolute growth in operating profit and manage our asset base and do that with a positive return, a return in excess of our cost of capital, which we feel very comfortable that we can do, we'll continue to create value that way.","Operator","Your next audio question comes from the line of Dan Oppenheim with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Daniel Oppenheim - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I was wondering if you can talk about the Cabinet business, still, obviously, going to be more late cycle. A very competitive environment out there. What would you need to see in terms of just -- are you willing to step away from business at this point? What do you think we need to see in terms of Cabinets overall to see a slightly more margin-friendly environment?","Timothy Wadhams","Well, certainly, Dan, in terms of margin, a little bit more on the macro side from a top line standpoint. We continue to see a lot of reluctance for folks to want to take on a major remodeling job. And a kitchen or a bathroom is certainly a big ticket, and that still is very slow. As job growth continues, as confidence picks up, that dynamic I would anticipate would change over time. The environment is still very competitive. I mean, there's no question about that. One of the dynamics for us is that we were promoting in January, sort of turned that off the latter part of February and saw some decline, especially in the dealer channel and a little bit of a fallback on -- in the big box channel for March. And so from our standpoint, there still is a lot of emphasis on promotions. We will ramp that back up, and we will be judicious as to where we put those dollars. Certainly, from a return standpoint, we're not going to chase every bit of business, but we do think that this year, notwithstanding the fact that we were hopeful earlier that it would be a little bit more disciplined from a promotional standpoint, looks like it's going to be a period that -- where active promotions are going to be important for folks to continue. We tend to see ourselves or have seen ourselves over the last several quarters, if you will, at those periods when we're heavily promoting, we tend do better. And when we pull back a little bit, things tend to go in a different direction. So we'll be as thoughtful as we can as we manage our way through that, but it's still going to be pretty competitive situation, particularly as consumers, although they're looking a little bit more, as we understand it, are still somewhat hesitant to want to pull the trigger on a bigger ticket remodel opportunity.","Daniel Oppenheim - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Great. And second question, I was just wondering -- thinking about sort of the investment of the business, CapEx ticking up slightly this year. What do you -- as we see the overall housing environment improve over time, what do you -- how much capacity do you think you have there? How much will CapEx move higher over the next several years?","John G. Sznewajs","Yes. CapEx, Dan, we generally guide people to focus on about 2% of sales as an appropriate number. It may tick up -- we\u2019re showing you a tick up from -- in 2012 versus 2011 of about $20 million or so. That said, we spent only $25 million in the first quarter, which is actually down a little bit compared to the first quarter of last year. In terms of your question as it relates to capacity, we\u2019re in a great position from a capacity standpoint. As the markets come back, we don't see any need for any significant bricks and mortar until we get back to a fairly robust recovery, that being 1 million, 1.5 million housing starts in a commensurate return in the repair\/remodel end of our business. So we feel like we're in really good shape from a capacity standpoint here.","Timothy Wadhams","Yes, I think that's very true, Dan. As you look at our business, we added a lot of brick and mortar back in the early 2000s. We've got some idle facilities as it relates to Cabinets that we can bring back on. The only area that I would maybe modify a little bit in terms of John's comment is that from a brick-and-mortar standpoint, we have made some expenditures to support Hansgrohe in both Germany and China and again, given their significant growth. But John is exactly right. We don't anticipate a need for a lot of brick and mortar as we work our way back into more healthy top line demand.","Operator","Your next audio question comes from the line of Keith Hughes with SunTrust.","Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Two questions. Within Cabinets, we've been rolling through some of the products that you got out of, I think, specifically, in the big box. Are we now through that? And do you anticipate any more actions like that in the future?","John G. Sznewajs","We're just about through that, Keith. It'll be $1 million or so, $2 million of RTA sales in Q2 that we\u2019ll have to anniversary in Q2 of this year. But beyond that, then we'd be done with that aspect of it. In terms of your second half of your question, is there anything else that we're looking at along those lines, the answer to that is no.","Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just quickly on the Installation segment. There's been yet more attempts here of price increases from the Installation producers for the second quarter. What is your view of those? Do you plan to pass those along into the channel?","Timothy Wadhams","Yes. We have always been able to manage our way through that, Keith, generally by passing those costs into the channel and\/or offsetting them with productivity or other means, working with our suppliers. But if you go back over the course of the last several quarters, we've had pretty good success on -- in our ability to pass those on and generally on a fairly timely basis.","Operator","Your next audio question comes from the line of Joshua Pollard with Goldman Sachs.","Joshua Pollard - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Excellent. My question is about the overall business and the pattern of growth over the year. If I\u2019ve got all my numbers right, it looks like January was up mid-single, low double for February, mid-singles for March and now -- and North America looking like low single digits. What's going on in the business that's causing that level of volatility? Or do you see any get-back from weather? Are you seeing a slowdown in any of the core pieces of your business? I'm really just trying to understand the slowdown in growth rates from January through to April.","Timothy Wadhams","Well, I think the -- I wouldn't necessarily put too much stock on the individual months, Josh. I think that if you went back to last year, our January and February were pretty weak in terms of 2011. And so we did have some -- a pretty good bump this year, but I think the dynamics in terms of housing really drove that. We've had an increase in terms of housing-related activity on the build side, and there's also been a little bit of a pickup in repair\/remodel-related activity. A lot of that has been driven by the weather. For example, our comps in exterior Paint were very, very strong in the first quarter, again, we think, driven in large part by the weather. So I think the weather helped us a little bit. I think that, as I mentioned, as we look at April, we're not overly concerned. Our POS continues to be very strong in April. As I said, it's very possible that some of our customers may be balancing inventories in that month, but don't necessarily see anything that is of concern at this point. We talked a little bit about Europe. Obviously, as we -- as John mentioned, our sense is right now -- and again, we don't have the numbers in, but our sense is that Europe looks like, on a local currency -- from a local currency standpoint, it'll be flat with a little bit of negative impact in terms of translation, but would not necessarily see anything that's concerning. As I mentioned, POS is strong, and Paint has been strong and Plumbing in April. So we're tending to look forward a little bit more optimistically than we might have been 3, 4 months ago.","Joshua Pollard - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Understood. Do you mind giving some of the numbers, actually, for some of the things you mentioned? I'd love to know what the POS is on April, and I'd also love to know what your comps were in exterior Paint versus interior.","Timothy Wadhams","I'm not sure that our channel partner would want us to give that level of detail out, Josh, in terms of those comparative numbers. And I think that's something that we would probably want to avoid.","Joshua Pollard - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. Understood. If you don't mind me sneaking one more in. Fortune Brands mentioned that they were a loser on the Lowe's line review in faucets but a winner in cabinets. I'm wondering whether or not Masco was on the other side of both of those. Have you guys won some business? Or maybe if you could just characterize your winnings and losings in the Lowe's line review. I know you guys were a part of the advisory board there.","Timothy Wadhams","Yes. To date, Josh, I think we've had 4 line reviews, and we lost one. That was a source-and-sell utility tub that wasn't overly profitable. And it was a very small piece of business, I think less than $20 million on an annual basis. So that was the only issue that we've had. The other 3, we were successful. So we've come out okay in terms of that process. Obviously, there still are some ongoing line reviews that will take place over the course of the rest of the year. But we tend to feel that if you're coming in there with strong brands, with good product offerings, good merchandising displays, the kinds of things that we put a lot of emphasis on, that you should do okay. And we think the better suppliers will continue to do well in terms of that dynamic.","Joshua Pollard - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And I'll just ask one more.","Timothy Wadhams","Josh, I think -- yes, we need to move on, but thank you. We'll talk to you a little later on.","Operator","Your next audio question comes from the line of Sam Darkatsh with Raymond James.","Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","One question regarding Cabinets and then just a housekeeping, a modeling question. So if we back out the expected change in depreciation and amortization in Cabinets on a year-on-year basis, which if my math holds, is I guess about $25 million, $30 million -- I'm looking at the expected incremental margins from there. And at least, on Slide 23, I think it looks like you're looking at that 30% to 35% range, excluding the change in depreciation. Should that be what we assume? Or because of input inflation, diesel fuel costs, promotional environment, that the actual realized incremental margins might be lower than that this year?","Timothy Wadhams","I think, Sam, the question is do we feel like the $30 million and the $10 million -- that basically is about 33% incremental margin. Your question is, do we still feel comfortable with that incremental margin?","Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Well, you have $30 million in revenue opportunities with a $10 million incremental operating profit on that. That would be, call it, 30% to 35% incremental margin. The $30 million, if my math holds, I think is largely just a change in the D&A on a year-on-year basis because of the structural improvements you've made. So when I...","Timothy Wadhams","No. No, the -- that is not a -- the change in D&A, Sam. That would have been backed out. The change in D&A was mostly driven by rationalization charges. So when we adjust our numbers for the 2 quarters, that tends to go away. And this $30 million here would be all profit improvement initiatives that we've got good line of sight to and talked about in the fourth quarter earnings call. So that is not the elimination of that accelerated depreciation that took place last year. And no, we do feel very comfortable. Our contribution margins in that segment in North America on volume in the first quarter were right around that 33% to 35% level. So we believe we can maintain that going forward.","Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Gotcha. And then just a couple of modeling questions real quickly. The $7 million in the favorable hedge impact, do you have an estimate as to how that translates the rest of the year? And then also, on the general corporate expense, John, I think it came in below the average run rate for the year, the $140 million over the course of the year. So was does the cadence look like for GCE over the next few quarters? Is it level? Or does it ramp as the year progresses?","John G. Sznewajs","Yes. Sam, in terms of your first question as it relates to the metals hedge, we're not giving guidance as to our metals positions at this point and what we think we\u2019ll benefit from -- part of it's hard to predict just given the volatility in the copper and zinc market. So we don't try to go out too far on a limb on that one. In terms of general corporate expense, yes, we did have a favorable quarter in Q1 compared to both our guidance. One of the things I think we called out in the fourth quarter call was that we kind of load up general corporate expense at the beginning of the year and, over the course of time, kind of re-guide the community as we understand how our experience comes in. You may recall that we had some favorable activity last year in 2011 as it relates to insurance experience, unfortunately, for several people, negative incentive comp, that kind of stuff. So as we go for full -- as we look at 2012, we fully go back to standards on things like that. And so as we understand what our experiences may be over the course of 2012, we'll give updated guidance on that component.","Timothy Wadhams","Yes. Sam, that's one of the areas that has been with us for -- and you guys have tended to drill in there a little bit, and I think John's comment is right on point. We tend to normalize certain of the accruals at the beginning of the year for a variety of things like profit sharing, incentive comp, medical. To the extent that we do a little better than that over the course of the year, we adjust that up and down but tend to start fairly conservative.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research.","Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company","A clarification on a question. Just in terms of clarification, can you -- to sort of help not have any confusion. In terms of POS, did April POS slow materially from 1Q POS?","Timothy Wadhams","No. I do not have that impression, Eric. And again, we haven't gotten into the depth of April at this point in time, but the impression that we have is that it has stayed relatively strong. And again, we'll have more information as we work our way through the quarter, through the -- our financial reviews and that type of thing. And the numbers aren't in yet, and we haven't seen all the data. But based on what we've heard from our folks in the field and their discussions with customers, our sense is that it has stayed relatively strong.","Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company","Great. And then in the packet, I think you commented that sequentially, Paint margins improved in 1Q versus 4Q. In Install, I think Install lost more in 1Q versus 4Q. So within Install, can you give a little bit of color of what's going on with pricing in that business and how you feel about the sort of profitability opportunity in that segment?","John G. Sznewajs","Yes. Sequentially, Eric, I think that a couple of things drove that. One is we had some favorable experience in the fourth quarter of last year in things like insurance. That kind of flipped on us in the first quarter too, kind of the same comments on our general corporate expense. When you start off the year, you've got higher -- things like payroll-related taxes and things like that that you have to account for. So that drives the negative comp there on a sequential basis.","Timothy Wadhams","Yes. I think in terms of pricing, Eric, in that business, I think that we are certainly competitive. We have done a lot of things to provide some additional training to our salespeople. We've got some pretty neat programs on lead generation and that type of thing. So from that standpoint, as we think about that business, think about what it's been through, think about the full implementation of the ERP system last year and midyear, we're starting to see some benefits from that. We're starting to see some benefits from the relationship with Owens Corning in terms of supply chain. So our feeling is that if anything, we're as competitive as we've ever been in that channel at this point in time and certainly feel like we've got an excellent opportunity, particularly as it relates to some of the bigger builders. We've got some great relationships there, and the expectation is as the recovery continues that they'll continue to take share.","Okay. Thanks, Eric. And Christie, that finalizes our comments. And we appreciate everybody taking part, and we\u2019ll look forward to talking to you at the end of our second quarter. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's Masco Corporation First Quarter 2012 Conference Call. Thank you for your participation.

[Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Maria Duey. Maria, you may begin.","Maria Duey","Thank you, Sarah, and good morning to everyone. Welcome to Masco Corporation's Second Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me on our call today are Tim Wadhams, President and CEO of Masco; and John Sznewajs, Masco's Vice President, Treasurer and Chief Financial Officer. Our second quarter earnings release and the presentation slides that we will refer to during the call are available on the Investor Relations portion on our website.","Following our prepared remarks, the call will be open for analyst questions. [Operator Instructions] If we are unable to take your question during the call, please feel free to call me directly at (313) 792-5500.","If you would refer to Slide 2, I'd like to remind you that today's presentation includes our views about Masco's future performance, which constitute forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. We've described these risks and uncertainties in our risk factors in our Form 10-K that we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","Today's presentation also includes non-GAAP financial measures. We've provided a reconciliation of these measurements on our website at www.masco.com.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Tim Wadhams. Tim?","Timothy Wadhams","Thank you, Maria. And if you would please move to Slide #4. After a relatively strong start to the year in the first quarter, with sales up about 7% overall, second quarter sales leveled out and were flat compared to last year at $2 billion. We were hit by the negative currency translation. That cost us about $46 million in terms of top line. And excluding that, we'd have been up about 3% in terms of sales.","From a positive perspective, our international operations were flat in local currencies in a relatively tough environment. We also benefited from price and improved new home construction-related activity.","On the other side, Retail repair\/remodel activity was slower, and our sales to key retail customers were flat in the quarter. Margins on an adjusted basis were up 40 basis points, and John will get into the detail there, but we did have some nice leverage in terms of our SG&A expenses, which offset the gross profit decline. We continue to benefit from profit improvement activities as -- and also had a positive price\/commodity relationship in the quarter.","Earnings per share on an adjusted basis, at $0.10, exceeded the $0.06 that we reported last year. And we did not pro forma those earnings for negative hedge and negative foreign currency translation, which each cost us about $0.01.","We also in the quarter had a fairly significant event in terms of the settlement of our Columbus Drywall litigation. I should say that's accounted for in the second quarter. It actually took place in the latter part of July. We've agreed to pay $75 million to settle that claim. We continue to deny any wrongdoing or unlawful conduct but certainly feel that this decision makes sense under the circumstances, it eliminates a significant uncertainty and also limits the expense of that case, which was fairly significant. And it's very good to have that behind us.","If you flip to Slide #5. Earlier this year, we communicated the strategic initiatives that we're focused on to drive improved performance and value going forward. Those include extending our market leadership positions, continuing to aggressively manage our cost structure through supply chain and Lean initiatives, improving our Cabinet and Installation-related businesses and strengthening our balance sheet.","And if you flip to Slide #6, we'll talk a little bit about how we've done against those strategies. As it relates to extending our market leadership positions, we continue to introduce new products, as well as win new business for the future. I think a good example of one of the new product introductions that we have includes the extension of our Delta brand, with new products, new finishes and complementary accessories in the bath category. As it relates to our Installation segment, we continue to get very good traction in the first part of this year as it relates to the relatively new retrofit and light commercial channels. And our Window businesses, both in North America and in the United Kingdom, continued to gain share. Milgard continues to do a very good job in the Western part of the United States. Recent product introductions: Essence -- Essence is our wood fiberglass window -- the vinyl color window program and our vinyl swing doors are all getting very good traction.","As it relates to cost reduction, we had another very strong quarter in terms of profit improvements. John will get into the details, but we came in around just a little bit below $50 million for the quarter. And we have updated, and John will talk about that in a minute or 2, our guidance for the full year as it relates to profit improvements.","Our balance sheet continues to be strengthened. As we indicated, we had a debt maturity payment in early July, that was about $750 million. And as a result of that, our debt, if you go back to the beginning of the year, will be down about 10%. We ended the quarter with $1.9 billion of cash. And if you take into account the debt repayment, we ended up at about $1.2 billion.","And if you flip to Slide #7, we'll talk about our Cabinet and Installation-related businesses. Back in February, during our fourth quarter earnings call, we discussed our expectations for improvement in these 2 segments, which have had relatively significant operating losses over the course of the last several quarters. At that point, we estimated that we could improve our operating performance in Cabinets by approximately $50 million for the full year and our Installation business by approximately $30 million for the full year. And again, that was based, at that time, on the assumption of flat housing starts. Obviously, housing starts have been up during the year, and we'll talk about that in a second.","As it relates to Cabinets, during the first half of the year, we have seen about $19 million of operating profit improvement, principally driven by cost reductions in North America. At this point in time, it looks like we're going to fall a little bit short of the $50 million that we anticipated earlier. We expect the second half that we'll see about $10 million to $15 million of improvement, which would put us in a full year number of approximately $30 million to $35 million, so a little bit short of the $50 million that we anticipated. We obviously are seeing some benefits from a lift in new home construction-related activity. Unfortunately, that's offset by continued difficult market conditions in Europe, as well as slower repair\/remodel retail activity in North America. And we've also had some challenges implementing our North American dealer and countertop-related strategies. We have recently made some leadership changes as it relates to our North American Cabinet business.","In terms of Installation, our first half operating performance has been improved by approximately $29 million compared to last year. We've had a nice lift in terms of top line activity, as well as a good job on the cost side. And at this point in time, as we look out through the rest of the year and anticipate housing starts, which the Blue Chip consensus suggests will come in around 740,000 for the full year, that's up about 20% compared to last year, our sense is that number will probably be pretty close to where we end up. On a lag basis for us that represents about 725,000 starts. And our sense is that our Installation business has a very good opportunity to get close to breakeven at that kind of level. Now what that means is that the $23 million of adjusted operating losses that we've incurred in the first half would be offset in the second half. So we feel pretty comfortable about that and certainly pleased with the increase in performance as it relates to Installation.","If you flip to Slide #8, I'd like to turn the call over to our CFO, John Sznewajs, who's going to walk us through some of the detailed operating information and talk about our segments as well.","John G. Sznewajs","Thanks, Tim, and good morning, everyone. If you could just please turn to Slide 9. So as Tim mentioned, revenue in the second quarter was flat compared to last year's second quarter. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation of about $46 million, sales grew at 3%. We saw increased sales in  those businesses selling into the new home construction channel, including our Installation business, which was up 10% in the quarter. We saw increased sales of North American Plumbing Products, and we benefited from selling price increases.","International sales were down 9% in the quarter though flat in local currency. The sales to key retailers were also flat in the quarter. Our adjusted gross margins were 26.1%, about 110 basis points lower than in Q2 of last year, due to material cost increases in our Decorative Architectural, Installation and European Plumbing businesses, partially offset by profit improvement initiatives.","We did a much better job of leveraging our SG&A in the quarter as adjusted SG&A as a percent of sales dropped 150 basis points to 19.9%. As result of the favorable SG&A performance, we're also pleased with our bottom line performance, as adjusted operating income increased 7% in the quarter to $124 million, with an adjusted operating margin of 6.2%.","And finally, our adjusted EPS was $0.10 in the quarter, an improvement of $0.04 per share in the quarter from the second quarter of 2011.","If you'd turn to Slide 10, we can see the components of our operating income improvement in the second quarter. Our net price\/commodity improved $14 million in the quarter, largely driven by our Plumbing, Cabinetry and other specialty segments, partially offset by a negative price\/commodity relationship in our Decorative Architectural segment. This $14 million reflects the negative impact of our metals hedge, which was about $5 million negative in the second quarter. While we have experienced favorable price\/commodity relationships in the first half of the year of about $35 million, based on current prices of our key commodities, we believe that in the second half of the year, the price\/commodity relationship will likely be in the range of $10 million to $20 million positive.","The $10 million reduction in net volume\/mix was principally driven by negative mix of approximately $13 million in our Plumbing segment, which largely relates to Hansgrohe as they continue to penetrate new markets.","The net profit improvements of $4 million were principally driven by our Cabinets, Installation and Decorative Architectural segments, partially offset by increased strategic growth spend in the Plumbing segment. For the first half of 2012, we are pleased with our profit improvements of $90 million gross and estimate that we can achieve $175 million for the full year, up from our original estimate of $150 million.","If you turn to Slide 11, you can see that our Plumbing segment sales declined 3% in the quarter, again, principally due to foreign currency translation. Excluding the impact of the $37 million of foreign currency translation, sales increased 2% in the quarter. European sales in the segment were flat in local currency for the quarter despite a challenging economic environment. We experienced good growth in our North American businesses, as several of our most important faucet brands, including Delta, Peerless and Brizo, saw sales in the quarter increase high-single digits in both the retail and wholesale channels as they continue to gain share through new-product launches.","Margins, however, in this segment were challenged by a number of items in the quarter: negative mix of the quarter of approximately $13 million, principally from Hansgrohe, as I described earlier; also, we incurred incremental costs for new programs and growth initiatives of about $15 million; we experienced negative currency of about $5 million. All this was offset by a favorable price\/commodity relationship, net of our hedge, of about $12 million.","Taking a look at the performance of this segment, we had 4 what I would call kind of unusual items that hit the segment in the quarter, each of which were about $5 million in magnitude. Now currency, as I mentioned earlier, was about $5 million; hedge is, as Tim referenced earlier, was about $5 million; we had program costs for some new programs that we gained at Retail in several major retailers, things like reset costs and the like, were about $5 million; and then we had some operational one-timers of about $5 million in the quarter. Things like we had a tank explosion at one of our facilities that took down production for several days. And fortunately, no one was hurt, just some damage, but it took production down for a couple of days, and we incurred some expense related to that. So all those 4 items in aggregate account for about $20 million.","If you turn to Slide 12, you can see that revenue in our Decorative Architectural segment grew $25 million or 5% in the quarter, driven by Behr's continued growth with the Pro painting contractor, share gains in our builders' hardware business and price increases, the implementation of which was completed earlier this year. The new formulation that Behr introduced earlier this year are performing well. And sales of our top-rated and reformulated Premium Plus Ultra products were up mid-single digits in the quarter. Overall, gallons were down slightly in the second quarter, though excluding the SKU reductions at Walmart, gallons were up slightly, and we believe we gained share at Retail in the second quarter.","As previously mentioned, we believe that sales in the second quarter were likely impacted by the pull-ahead of sales due to the favorable weather that we experienced in the first quarter of this year. We also saw nice revenue gains from our builders' hardware business in the quarter, as their results have improved following a tough 2011.","Operating margin improvement was the result of the benefit of profit improvement initiatives. It was also aided by improved performance in our builders' hardware business. This was partially offset by increased growth initiatives spend for our international expansion in our Pro growth with our Behr business.","And finally, the price\/commodity relationship was negative $5 million in the second quarter, which was offset by the timing of some promotional spend.","If you turn to Slide 13, you can see that the environment for Cabinetry remains challenging as our segment sales were down 5%. Excluding the $8 million negative impact from foreign currency translation, Cabinet segment sales were down 3% in the quarter. And as I mentioned earlier, our European sales were flat in local currencies.","We experienced solid sales growth with our countertop initiatives. And our direct-to-builder sales were up low teens percent. So we are well positioned to benefit from our relationships with many of the big builders as they grow and take share in the housing recovery. This growth, however, was offset by a decline in the dealer channel and big box retail sales. We believe that the repair\/remodel market for Cabinets is down mid-single-digits percent in the quarter, especially at the higher price points where we participate. And the intense promotional environment at Retail has continued the second quarter. And our spend on such promotions remains at levels consistent with what we experienced last year.","We improved our operating loss in the quarter by $10 million or 290 basis points and $19 million year-to-date. This improvement was driven by benefits realized from prior year restructuring activities and current year profit improvement initiatives, partially offset by start-up costs associated with our countertop programs.","Turning to Slide 14. You can see our Installation sales, and we are very pleased with the improved both the top and bottom line performance of this segment in the second quarter. Segment sales grew 10% and were fueled by higher volumes and sales across all lines of businesses, including our residential new construction, retrofit, commercial and distribution. Sales were negatively impacted from the previously announced closure of branch locations and the mix shift to multifamily starts, which on a combined basis, reduced segment sales in the quarter by more than 3%.","We continue to focus on increasing our Installation sales with the largest homebuilders. And we are well positioned to grow this business with the big builders, particularly D.R. Horton, Lennar, Pulte and KB. Our Installation sales in the quarter increased by more than 20%.","In addition to solid top line performance, management's strong execution delivered significantly improved bottom line results, with operating profit improving $10 million in the quarter and operating margin expanding by 400 basis points. This segment had a very good operating leverage in the quarter, delivering 38% incremental margins resulting from increased volume, successful price\/commodity management and profit improvement initiatives. And as Tim mentioned earlier, assuming lagged housing starts of about 725,000 this year, we believe this segment will approach breakeven for the full year in 2012.","As you turn to Slide 15, you can see that our Other Specialty Products segment declined 3% in the quarter. Excluding the exit of select U.S. Window markets late last year, segment sales would have been up 1% in the quarter. Our U.K. Window and Milgard businesses benefited from share gains and reduced promotional rebate programs in Q2.","Window and door sales in the Western U.S. increased high single-digits percent in the second quarter due to the improvement in the new home construction market, product introductions and geographic expansion. Our adjusted operating margins improved by $6 million or 430 basis points, benefiting from rationalization activities undertaken in the second half of last year, improved price\/commodity relationships, including the rebate activity I just mentioned, partially offset by inflation.","And if you turn to Slide 16. As Tim mentioned earlier, this month we retired our July 2012 $745 million debt maturity with cash from the balance sheet. As a reminder, we issued $400 million of 10-year notes in the first quarter this year with an interest rate of about 5.95% to partially prefund this July maturity. Since the beginning of the year clear, we have retired about $400 million of debt. The negative interest carry is approximately $7 million or about $0.01 per share for the second quarter and approximately $0.02 per share for the full year of 2012.","We continue to improve our working capital as a percent of sales, defined as accounts receivable plus inventory less payables, from 15.6% down to 14.6%. This is great work from everyone across the enterprise on that metric. And finally, we finished the quarter with $1.9 billion of cash on the balance sheet. And following the retirement of our July maturity, our cash balance is approximately $1.2 billion.","So with that, I'll turn the call back over to Tim for his look on our outlook.","Timothy Wadhams","Thank you, John. And if you would please flip to Slide #18. These are the priorities that we identified earlier this year in support of our strategic initiatives. And we feel like we've continued to make good progress in the first half of the year, including the second quarter, against all of these priorities. We've talked about most of them through the course of the last few minutes. I would add that, as John mentioned, we had some nice improvement in working capital management. And I'd like to join John in thanking our employees across the enterprise for their continued efforts and dedication.","If you flip to Slide #19, a couple of comments before we go to Q&A. I feel like we've made a lot of progress in the first half of 2012. Weather certainly has been a factor. It helped us, we think, in the first quarter; probably hurt a little bit in the second quarter given the heat in certain areas of the country. So the line between quarters might be a little bit blurry.","But having said that, sales for us in the first half were up 3% or $128 million. And if we exclude $65 million of negative currency impact, it would have been up about 5%. Margins in the first half are up 150 basis points versus last year. And our incremental margin in the first half is over 40%. That's helped by positive price\/commodity relationships, as John mentioned, approximately $35 million. We've made some very good progress there, but we're still behind the curve when we look at the last couple of years. EPS as adjusted is up $0.14 a share, $0.16 versus $0.02 last year. And we've seen some nice improvement in our Cabinet and Installation businesses, and our cost structure, as John articulated.","Second half 2012 looks to be a little bit more challenging from a macro perspective. European economies are still unsettled. And the U.S. economy appears to be slowing as consumers pull back.  Retail sales have been down now, I think, for 3 straight months. And certainly, big-ticket remodel activity is not generating an awful lot of traction.","I would point out that we're relatively pleased with our preliminary view of July. July, on an all-in basis, looks to be up low single digits. And if we exclude foreign currency, July looks to be up mid-single digits. And if we look at only North America, our preliminary view is that July will be up high single digits. So it looks like we're off to a reasonably good start for the second half.","Also on the plus side, we continue to invest in our businesses. And we continue to win new opportunities, especially in Plumbing. These costs are hitting our P&L today. John talked a little bit about that as we went through some of the segment deal -- detail, but we'll certainly see the benefits from those opportunities in the future.","We're also excited about the improving new home construction environment. As we mentioned, we expect housing starts are going to be probably somewhere around the 740,000 level. Inventories for new homes continue to be low, and in certain areas of the country are extremely low. Demand has picked up. Affordability has never been better. Prices are stabilizing, and in certain areas, moving up. And we've seen a lot of investors come in to acquire properties.","Also encouraging is 2013 estimates for new home construction at 880,000 as per the Blue Chip consensus. Some other folks are a little bit higher than that. But if we can hit that level this year and next year, the 740,000 this year, the 880,000 next year, that certainly is going to be a positive for the overall economy, as well as for Masco. The economy needs both housing and automotive. The multiplier effect as you think about job creation is significant. And anything that's good for the economy is good for us.","Having said that, we'll continue to focus on the things that we can control to drive our strategic initiatives, which include expanding our market leadership positions, continuing to focus on our cost structure, continuing to improve our balance sheet and continuing to drive our Cabinet and Installation businesses to profitability.","And with that, Sarah, we'll open up the lines for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]  Your first question comes from the line of Eric Bosshard from Cleveland Research.","Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company","Two things. First of all, within Cabinets, I'm curious about what's changed -- and especially as you look into the second half, has you taken a little bit more cautious view on the profit progress you're expecting from that segment this year?","Timothy Wadhams","Yes, what changed there, Eric, is a couple of things. One is that we're not getting the traction that we anticipated in the dealer channel. Again, that's a little slower than we anticipated. And I think from our perspective, we're just not getting the traction that we anticipated, which is a little bit disappointing. The other thing is with countertops, it's kind of a good news, bad news situation. We've had some basic difficulties scaling that business. Demand has been very, very strong. And we've run into some inefficiencies. We certainly think that we can drive profitability going forward. But we've had to pull back in terms of our expectations, and quite frankly, the profitability there is not what we anticipated. If we look at the cost side of the equation, I think at the beginning of the year, we estimated that we'd have a net of approximately $30 million of cost reductions. And we still feel like we're on target for that, so continuing to do a good job on the cost side, but basically on the revenue side, see the lack of traction in the dealer segment, along with the fact that repair\/remodel for the bigger-ticket items is a little bit slower, as John mentioned, for higher-priced items like many of our offerings on the KraftMaid side. Sales look to be down about 5%. So those would be some of the factors that we're faced with. We also haven't seen a lot of pickup in Europe. I should point out that Europe continues to be challenging. No question about that. We anticipate a little bit of improvement there, but the top line there continues to be a bit of a challenge.","Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company","When you look at the market share position or the average selling price of -- especially on the KraftMaid side, is there anything to look at and would view this to be a little bit more of a medium-term challenge that may take longer to restore profitability because of how the market shares pie has moved and also how the mix has moved in this category?","Timothy Wadhams","Well, yes, no, I -- we're optimistic going forward. I mean, there's no question about that. We continue to be profitable in the dealer channel. There's no question there. And KraftMaid continues to be overall profitable. But having said that, I think just in terms of top line, we're not getting the kind of traction that we anticipated. And I think that we should see some improvement there over the longer term. There's no question in my mind about that. I think we still got great brands. When you think about KraftMaid, Merillat and Quality. And so, yes, I see this more as a little bit of a speed bump. We have made some leadership changes, as I mentioned earlier, and so we're encouraged by that as well.","Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company","And one other. Could -- you've just squared you're more cautious on the second half. I mean as -- but it looks like July accelerated from the second quarter and maybe even the first half experience. How can you just put those 2 statements that seem to be conflicting in context for us?","Timothy Wadhams","Well, I think anytime you're in a recovery, I think that there's going to be some lumpiness in it. And we certainly have experienced that. Obviously, the first part of the year started out very well. As we mentioned, second quarter was pretty consistent when we look at sales trends from April, May and June. We were generally, without foreign currency, up about 2%, 3% each month. And our sense is just a little bit of caution as we go into the second half of the year. I think when you look at some of the uncertainty out there, with disposable income being down, the lack of job growth, I think caution by consumers, I think it's just prudent for us to think a little bit more cautiously. But obviously, July is a little bit -- or maybe a little bit more than a little bit of a plus as we head into the second half. And I hope we're wrong as it relates to that. But we'll just have to see how things shake out.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dennis McGill from Zelman & Associates.","Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, Research Division","I guess, Tim, just back on Cabinets, realizing that this restructuring is kind of 2 years in the making now, can you go into a little bit more specifics on what the challenges are in the dealer implementation? And then as you think about the management changes, getting involved there, what are you seeing new management doing differently than the prior management team?","Timothy Wadhams","Sure. I think as we look at Cabinets, Dennis, as everyone's aware, we did do a major integration going back a couple of years, putting our Builder Cabinet and our Retail Cabinet Groups together. We think we've made very good progress there in terms of the cost side of that. My sense is that as I think back and I think we estimated that on the integration, we probably would save somewhere around $35 million. I think we've got that in the bag, and there's probably another $5 million to $10 million that we've been able to realize as part of the integration. Having said that, I think we probably have had a little bit more disruption, if you will, relative to top line activities. And that has put us a little bit behind the 8 ball just in terms of a couple of the segments. The dealer segment is an area that we think has a lot of promise. We're profitable in the dealer segment. We've got some very good relationships there, but we're not doing as well as we -- quite frankly, as we'd like too. So having said that, we did make a couple of leadership changes. From a corporate perspective, we've continued to streamline our corporate executive group, if you will, and we've gone from 3 to 2 Group Presidents in North America. And again, we were going to make that move irrespective of any issues around Cabs. But in doing that, Keith Allman, who is one of our Group Presidents in North America now, has responsibility for our kitchen and bath group. We put North American Cabinets and Plumbing together, and Keith is going to have group responsibility for that. Keith has Cabinet experience from Merillat and the Builder Cabinet Group. He was in Cabinets for 10 years. He was Exec VP, Vice President of Operations, so he's got a lot of background there. Keith went and left Cabinets about 6 years ago, went to Delta and did an excellent job leading Delta as the CEO. And has got a lot of experience in all the channels that are important to us from a Cabinet perspective. We also have changed the business unit leadership. Rick Roetken, who was the VP of Marketing at Delta when Keith was at Delta and more recently spent 2 years running our Liberty Hardware operation, has taken over as CEO of our North American Cabinet Group. And between Rick and Keith, they've got a great track record together in terms of the improvement that we've seen at Delta and a lot of very good experience in all of the channels that are important relative to the Cabinet-related business, particularly as it relates to Retail. So from our perspective, we got a lot done over the course of the last couple of years and certainly feel good about that, but also feel that there's some opportunity for us to kind of refocus on the growth side, if you will. And I think with Keith and Rick involved in that going forward, we're optimistic that we can generate some of the top line opportunities that we think are available to the leading brands that we have.","Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, Research Division","And can you give us a little bit of color around, a, what key retail sales would have been, excluding Cabinets in the quarter; and then, b, what the top line assumptions roughly would look like in the second half of the year around that $55 million, $60 million loss in the segment?","Timothy Wadhams","No, we didn't breakout Cabs from key retail sales. I think [indiscernible] yes, we don't have that at this point, and we might be able to take that out for later. And the rest of your question, Dennis, was top line assumptions in the second half relative to Cabinets?","Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, Research Division","Yes, just give us a sense of what's embedded on the top line behind that loss that you guided to.","Timothy Wadhams","Well, what we're looking for is probably a little bit of a decrease in the second half. I think in the first half, we're down about 3% or 4%, excluding foreign currency. And our sense is that that's probably somewhat consistent with where we'll probably end up in the second half as well.","Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, Research Division","So -- and just lastly, so that implies deceleration on the remodel side in Europe since new construction is accelerating, as you said?","Timothy Wadhams","Right, yes, exactly.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Nishu Sood from Deutsche Bank.","Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I wanted to turn to Plumbing. In Plumbing, the issue of mix affecting margins as Hansgrohe has expanded has come up periodically over time. So I just wanted to focus in on that a little bit. Clearly, if the business is pursuing the incremental sales, which is hurting mix, it must be a good return on capital investment. But from a margin perspective, I just wanted to understand how we should think about this going forward. Obviously, these expansions into the new markets are meant to drive sales over the long term. So does that mean that we should expect the margins for Hansgrohe and Plumbing to drift down over time as the mix continues to shift?","John G. Sznewajs","What initially happened is over time in plumbing -- and Hansgrohe, they got a couple of 3 items that hit them from a mix perspective, one you alluded to, which was their expansion into international markets. A couple other things that hit them recently, one is the fact that, as you may recall, Hansgrohe principally started out as a shower business, and over time, they've really increased the number of offerings they have in the faucet side of their business. And while both of those businesses have great margins. It just turns out that showers are at a slightly higher margin than faucets. And so there's a negative kind of mix associated with the product mix that's developed over the course of the last couple of years. Then the last thing is that over the course of the last year or 2, we've seen some down trading. They've got a high-end brand called Axor, and we've seen some down trading on some of the larger international projects to more of the Hansgrohe mainline product. And so those couple 3 items hit it from a mix perspective. And to your point, you're right, from time to time, we had some -- experienced some negative mix at Hansgrohe. I would think that some of this is an investment, but in the near term, we'll experience some margin degradation as a result of the mix. But over the long term, what we tend -- generally tend to experience is that when they enter new markets, generally entering with their opening price point products, that over the course of time as those markets develop, they migrate people up the price continuum. And so I would generally tend to lead you to think that they've got a near-term issue that will probably start to correct itself over the medium term as these other markets start to mature.","Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Got it. Great. That's very helpful. Second, I wanted to turn to the settlement -- the Insulation settlement. What I wanted to understand was, clearly, the issue there was around Masco being large and getting better pricing on Installation. Has this process, over time, with these relentless lawsuits and the class action, and the settlement affected the pricing that Masco gets on Insulation? And so would it have an effect on the pricing and margins in that business going forward? Or conversely, does the settlement actually remove any issues that there might have been with pricing while all these lawsuits were going on?","Timothy Wadhams","Yes, I'm not sure I'd necessarily say there's a connection there, Nishu. I think as we think about our size and our buying power, we've talked a little bit about the relationship with Owens Corning on a strategic supplier relationship, we still are a large buyer of insulation. We still have leverage in terms of the opportunity in the marketplace. Obviously, it's very competitive at the level of new home starts that we're at today. But I would not see us disadvantaged in any way going forward relative to the fact that we settled this lawsuit or have had a couple of other litigation-related issues.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sam Darkatsh from Raymond James.","Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Some questions on Slide 11. There were a lot of moving parts, obviously, with the Plumbing margins, John, with respect to the program costs and the hedge and then the explosion in the -- in one facility. How many of these costs continue and; to what degree over the next quarter or 2?","John G. Sznewajs","Well, Sam, it's hard to predict currency and commodity movements, so I'm not going to really go there. But I would point to you that kind of the $10 million that I outlined, kind of the $5 million of program costs were -- was truly related to some retail activity that we had in the quarter, related to some share gains that we picked up at some of the major retailers. And then secondly, kind of what I call the operational one-timer is the plant explosion in the light that it kind of got lumpy into that. We're hopeful -- we're very hopeful that we don't have any further operational issues like that. So those, clearly, are one-time in nature. Could the rebates or could the reset costs occur -- to the extent that we continue to win new business here, that could be something that we experience in the future, I think we'd be happy to take that as we win new business. So -- but we'll continue to call those out as those things come up.","Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Second question. There was also, I believe, a change in your expectations for general corporate expense. I think that if my notes hold correct, from $140 million to $125 million, what was that -- what was the source of that? And what do you expect for next year? Is this the ongoing run rate now?","John G. Sznewajs","We haven't really gotten into next year. But the reason that things started to come down, as we guided on now, is you may recall initially, when we give out guidance, we budget everything at standard. And based on the experiences we've had through the first half of the year, with approximately $30 million in the quarter, we feel pretty comfortable at about $125 million we're guiding everyone to for the full year.","Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","And last question, it's a quick one. With the Installation business, I know you saw -- said that the Insulation was up 20, and the segment was up 10. I caught that there was 3 points of a headwind from the branch closures. But what accounts for the other 7% between the Insulation and the reported sales growth?","John G. Sznewajs","Well, we've got a couple other components of that business that, perhaps, they grow as quickly as our Insulation sales, such as our distribution business. Our retrofit business slowed a little bit in the second quarter, partially we think a little bit due to the hot weather. So those couple of things. And then some of our other products didn't grow as rapidly -- like our fireplaces and gutters didn't grow as rapidly as the 20% that we experienced in Insulation.","Timothy Wadhams","Yes, Sam, a lot of the pickup there tends to be with some of the bigger builders. And some of those homes tend to be a little bit smaller, with less features like fireplaces and that type of thing. And so there's probably less non-insulation-related product opportunity for us in certain situations. And you've also got the multifamily issue relative to mix as well, which would put you in a position where you're not going to probably have a fireplace, garage doors, gutters, that type of thing, to the same extent that you might with a single family.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Wood from Macquarie.","Mike Wood - Macquarie Research","You'd mentioned the $5 million additional program costs for the share gains. With the remaining portion of that, the $10 million, can you frame that in terms of how that shifted versus prior quarters and how you think about what the payback is on that growth spend?","John G. Sznewajs","Is it, Mike, in the Plumbing segment?","Mike Wood - Macquarie Research","Yes.","John G. Sznewajs","Yes, the $5 million in terms of what we spend, just one-time re-set cost, is to our price on the shelves of major retailers. So in terms of the return on that investment, we look for a pretty quick payback. Generally, these programs will go for 1 or 2 years, and so we look to recoup the return over the life of the program that we have in the aisle. That said, we're constantly managing our SKUs in the aisle and working with our retail partners to ensure that we've got product that moves quickly. So to the extent that something might not be moving as fast as either we or they would like, we'll continue to develop new products to make certain that we can add fast-moving SKUs in the aisles.","Mike Wood - Macquarie Research","And can you talk about the point-of-sale trends also that you experienced in July, and also for the second quarter, so that we can understand if there's any destocking or restocking benefit there?","Timothy Wadhams","Yes, I really don't anticipate and didn't feel like there was any impact in terms of inventory balancing at all as it related to the quarter. We saw a little bit of that, we thought, coming out of the first quarter into the second quarter. But really, our sales activity was, as I mentioned earlier, relatively flat each month. We're right around, excluding foreign currency translation, right around 2%, 3% in terms of increased sales. We ended up, obviously, without foreign currency, at about 3% for the full quarter. So really didn't see anything unusual relative to inventory balancing. And as we went in -- as we go into July, we talked a little bit about some pickup there, but don't necessarily believe that's attributed to anything relative to inventory one way or another.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Will Randow from Citi.","Will Randow - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Could you share your price increases and how well those have been sticking, particularly on the Paint business? Is the number [indiscernible]","Timothy Wadhams","No -- I'm sorry, go ahead, Will.","Will Randow - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","As a competitor comp -- sorry, at a competitor comps, I remember you said the April price increase stuck, and I'm curious if there's been any success after that price increase?","Timothy Wadhams","Talking about the commodity costs, are you taking about -- you're talking about Paint now?","Will Randow - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Yes, correct.","Timothy Wadhams","Okay. And you're talking about cost increases in terms of the commodities?","Will Randow - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","No, I'm talking about price increases rather.","Timothy Wadhams","Okay, our pricing, yes. No, we -- as we mentioned earlier, Will -- sorry for the confusion there, but as we mentioned earlier, we started to implement price related to our Paint products in February. And that process was complete in late March, early April, in terms of implementation. And that was pretty much across all of our Paint-related products, all of our Paint-related customers. Since that point in time, we have experienced some continued increase in TiO2 and resin-related costs. But in the second quarter, late in the second quarter, that seemed to kind of level out a little bit. Obviously, we're still elevated versus last year. And as John mentioned, we had a negative price\/commodity relationship in the Decorative Architectural segment. And our expectation is that we don't see in the second half given that worldwide volumes are down at this point in time as it relates to Paint, we're not anticipating necessarily any continued increases. But we're still a little bit behind in terms of where we'd like to be from a pricing perspective. And I can't really give you any further information on that at this point in time.","Will Randow - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Got it. I imagine the retailer you're working with, in particular, probably is going to push back if you try to -- push further price increases through the rest of the year.","Timothy Wadhams","Well, that remains to be seen.","Will Randow - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And second question for Cabinets, I believe you said promotions were flat year-over-year, which sounds like still high to me. And you had share gains at retailers. Is that correct?","John G. Sznewajs","No. I would say that our share at the major retailers is about flat for the year or for the quarter, I should say. And the promotional activity,  is flat for the first half of the year for us based --  compared to the first half of last year. So it's still intense. They're still elevated but no more intense than what we saw in the first part of last year.","Will Randow - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","So I guess, it sounds like it's relatively a price-taker business until you get capacity utilization back up. But are you guys thinking about some creative ways of creating value.  Possibly doing, and we've talked about this, an asset swap with, let's say, a competitor, where you pitch windows for doors versus cabinets, or something where you create consolidation in an industry that lacks it?","Timothy Wadhams","Well, we don't generally speculate on things that might be somewhat transformational, like what you suggested. I think our sense is that there continues to be a very good opportunity, fundamental opportunity, in the dealer channel, in the countertop market for us. As we've mentioned, we've got some new folks involved in that business. They're in the process of doing some assessment, as we speak, just in terms of kind of where we are in the different channels. And our sense is that there's a lot of opportunity for us to expand our penetration, improve our performance going forward and, certainly, are encouraged by the position we've got with our brands at this point in time. So I wouldn't necessarily want to speculate on anything of the nature that you suggested.","Will Randow - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Yes, I suppose NOL would take a ding too.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Goldberg from UBS.","Susan Maklari - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","It's actually Susan. You guys did a few smaller acquisitions earlier this year. And as we've sort of gone through the year, and you've seen how the housing market and conditions overall come together, are you seeing any changes in terms of some of the opportunities that are available out there and your appetite for them?","John G. Sznewajs","Yes, Susan, to be clear, we did a small acquisition, a spa manufacturer for our West Coast spa business late last year. And that actually is going very well for us. And the management team at Watkins has done a fantastic job of integrating that business and growing that business. So that's been a very positive acquisition for us. In terms of your question, are we seeing additional opportunities, new opportunities come on the marketplace, it's still pretty slow at this point in time. Even though end markets are starting to recover from the bottom, with still not a lot of sellers coming off the sidelines at this point, so I wouldn't want to speculate or say that we're looking at any more acquisitions at this point. But we're not seeing more activity of acquisition in the industry at this point in time.","Susan Maklari - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then in terms of the balance sheet, the July repurchase -- or July debt maturity was sort of  a point that we were waiting for. And we're -- we now that we're past that, can you give us any update in terms of how you're thinking about potential share repurchases or raising the dividend, anything in terms of shareholder value like that?","Timothy Wadhams","Yes, I think, Susan, at this point, given where we are in the recovery and the fact that we're still $4 billion, $5 billion behind sort of our peak in terms of revenue, I wouldn't necessarily see any activity around shareholder-friendly-related initiatives like share repurchases or an increased dividend at this point in time. Obviously, as we get further into the recovery and start to see some additional top line opportunity given our operating leverage, the history we've got in terms of free cash flow, and I would remind folks that if you went back to the period 2003 through 2007, that 5-year period, we averaged about $1 billion of free cash flow a year. And that was after $1.5 billion of capital expenditures, $300 million of investment in displays, and we were able to, during that same time period, repurchase about 30% of our outstanding stock. I think that gives you a little bit of perspective of the cash flow capacity that we have. And -- but again, that was at a different time and a different place. And I think at this point, given where we are in the cycle, it would be premature for us to start down that path at this point in time.","Operator","Your last question comes from the line of Stephen East from ISI Group.","Stephen F. East - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","If we look at your Paint business, again, you had a nice sequential improvement in op margin. How would you rank order what drove that from pricing volume? And did Pro build -- did your spend in Pro build accelerate versus the first quarter or not?","John G. Sznewajs","Yes, Stephen, a couple of things there. On a sequential basis, I think some of the improvement did come from the Pro. That included -- drove as I mentioned, I think, in my remarks.  Volumes were up just slightly in the second quarter if you factor out some SKUs that we lost at Walmart. So volume was such a huge driver. On the bottom line, profit improvements were a big driver in the quarter in the Decorative Arch segment. The performance of our Liberty Hardware business also aided their quarter pretty significantly. So in price [ph], a little bit if softness overall in the quarter just given the extreme heat, particularly in the last couple of weeks in the quarter due to putting up [ph] our exterior paint. So a couple of 3 things hit us there. But overall, improved pricing kind of helped us a little bit as well in the quarter.","Stephen F. East - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then the other thing, you mentioned the key retail -- the Walmart stuff, on an apples-to-apples, one is the key retail -- what is going on with the key retailers? And then the other question I've got is, when you look at your European business, can you remind us what percentage of your sales is going over there and what the op margin is in Europe versus the U.S.? And then just sort of if you rank order, what the pressures you see being in that market?","John G. Sznewajs","Okay. A couple of things there. One, our key retail sales, again, were flat for the quarter. And that's not only the -- our major retailers, Home Depot and Lowes, but the composite of a number of other probably 20-plus retailers that fall into that equation. In terms of Europe, our European sales are about 21%, 22% of our overall sales right now. And I think the last question was rank order, the -- some of the...","Timothy Wadhams","No, I think what Stephen was looking at is the operating margin in Europe, and that would be down a little bit this year year-over-year, Stephen. I don't know that, that's in our analyst package. I don't -- is that in there?","Stephen F. East - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","No, not really.","Timothy Wadhams","I don't think we have the international margin. But that would've been down a little bit. I think last year, at this point, Stephen, we were running around 10%, 11%, as I recall. And with some of the mix challenges that we've got, some of the top line challenges, we'd be off there. And I don't have that number right in front of me, but my guess is it's probably mid- to high single digits versus low double digits last year.","John G. Sznewajs","Yes. Stephen the way to kind of get it is if we had  a $5 million operating income hit on currency and about a $50 million top line hit on currency. That translates through at the same margin, so that's probably high single digits, to Tim's point.","Stephen F. East - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, got you. And is that the biggest headwind? Or are you seeing something else that causes you more concern?","Timothy Wadhams","In Europe?","Stephen F. East - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Yes, in Europe, I'm sorry.","Timothy Wadhams","Yes, I just think, for us, in Europe, obviously, the economies over there are pretty dicey. One of the things that helps us is the diversity of Hansgrohe's product offerings in emerging markets, project work in the Middle East. So we do have a bit of an offset. We don't have a lot of presence in Southern Europe: Spain, Portugal, Italy and Greece, that those are not major markets for us. So from that standpoint, we're in reasonably good shape there. So I think we're maybe a little bit more balanced than maybe some other folks who basically are pretty concentrated on the continent. But having said that, it's still pretty tough.","Okay. Sarah, thank you, and we'd like to thank everybody for joining us on the call today. And as Maria indicated, if we didn't get to you or you have additional questions, give us a yell.

Welcome to Masco Corporation\u2019s 2019 Second Quarter Conference Call. My name is Amy and I will be your operator for today's call. As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded for replay purposes. [Operator Instructions] ","I will now turn the call over to David Chaika, Vice President, Treasurer and Investor Relations. You may begin.","David Chaika","Thank you, Amy, and good morning. Welcome to Masco Corporation's 2019 second quarter conference call. With me today are Keith Allman, President and CEO of Masco; and John Sznewajs, Masco's Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Our second quarter earnings release and the presentation slides that we will refer to today are available on our website under Investor Relations. Following our remarks, we will open the call for analyst questions. Please limit yourself to one question with one followup. If we can't take your question now, please call me directly at 313-792-5500.","Our statements today will include our views about our future performance, which constitute forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. We've described these risks and uncertainties in our risk factors and other disclosures in our Form 10-K and our Form 10-Q that we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","Our statements will also include non-GAAP financial measures. Our references to operating profit and earnings per share will be as adjusted, unless otherwise noted. We reconcile these adjusted measurements to GAAP in our earnings release and presentation slides, which are available on our website under Investor Relations.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to Keith.","Keith Allman","Thank you, Dave. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us today. Please turn to Slide 4. Excluding the impact of currency, our top line matched prior year. Growth in North American Plumbing and Decorative Architectural Products was offset by softer sales in International Plumbing, Cabinetry, and Windows. We delivered operating profit growth and margin expansion across all segments, resulting in 5% operating profit growth and 100 basis points of margin expansion despite the flat topline.","Our profit growth and margin expansion were achieved through disciplined pricing actions to offset tariffs and other inflation and a continued focus on cost control. Our EPS increased 16% to $0.88 per share. As it relates to tariffs, our near-term mitigating action has largely been price. However, we continue to work with our suppliers and internal teams on cost reduction opportunities and have begun moving limited production out of China as a longer-term solution.","While pricing may have had a temporary impact on volume in the first half of the year, the consumer is still very healthy with unemployment at 50-year lows, incomes continuing to grow, confidence remaining high, and home prices continuing to appreciate all key drivers of repair and remodel activity.","Now moving back to this quarter's performance, let me give you some additional insights into the drivers behind each of our segment's performance beginning with Plumbing. North American Plumbing grew 3% in local currency with Delta and Watkins each achieving a record sales quarter. International Plumbing sales decreased 30% in local currency with growth in Germany offset by softer sales in a number of other markets.","International Plumbing sales are expected to improve in the second half as comps get easier and many of the new products introduced by Hansgrohe earlier this year begin to hit the market, such as Hansgrohe's Rainfinity shower product, a modern shower with Ultrafine and PowderRain shower jets for a truly luxurious showering experience.","In our Decorative Architectural segment, sales grew 3% led by high-single-digit growth in Pro Paint and low-single-digit growth in DIY paint. We were pleased once again to be named the top-rated interior paint by a leading independent testing organization. In fact, Behr had two products in the top three, and three products ranked in the top six, reinforcing Behr's position as the quality leader in the U.S. paint industry. In addition, Behr achieved a first-place ranking in customer satisfaction for interior paints in the J.D. Power 2019 Paint Satisfaction Survey. These recognitions speak to the strong brand, quality, and value proposition of Behr paint offered exclusively at the Home Depot.","In Cabinetry, good cost control and pricing actions contributed to profit growth and strong margin performance despite a soft overall market. We're very pleased with our Menards business now that it has been fully implemented and it is meeting our expectations. Additionally, in the second half of 2019, we will celebrate KraftMaid's 50th anniversary with the largest introduction of new finishes in KraftMaid's history. New paint and stain colors, along with new finish techniques such as weathered and translucent will keep KraftMaid at the forefront of industry trends.","Turning to Windows, flat sales in North American Windows were offset by continued challenging conditions in our UK Window operation. Despite these challenges, we achieved profit growth and margin expansion in the second quarter aided by continued strong performance and improved mix due to our Trinsic line of vinyl windows in North America launched late in 2018.","Now moving to capital allocation in the quarter, we continued our share repurchase activity by repurchasing 4.3 million shares for $167 million, bringing our year-to-date share repurchase total to $289 million. Based on the strengths of our forecasted cash flows and our strong liquidity position, we intend to deploy approximately $300 million towards share repurchases in the second half of 2019 for a full year total of approximately $600 million. This figure does not include any expected proceeds from the divestitures.","Our Board of Directors also announced its intention to increase our annual dividend by $0.06 per share to $0.54 per share, a 13% increase beginning in the fourth quarter. This is our sixth consecutive year we have increased our dividend. Maintaining a relevant dividend payout ratio of approximately 20% or greater is an important part of our balanced capital allocation policy. Lastly, we are updating our anticipated earnings per share for 2019 to be in the range of $2.62 to $2.72 per share from a previous range of $2.60 to $2.80 per share.","I'd also like to give you a brief update on our announcement to pursue the divestitures of our Cabinetry and Windows operations. We've begun the sales process and feel good about the initial market response to these businesses. As we laid out in our June announcement, we anticipate completing these transactions by the end of the first quarter of 2020, assuming each of these transactions can be completed on acceptable terms and conditions. This transformative step will create a more stable, less cyclical Masco that is focused mainly on lower ticket repair and remodel products.","The divestiture of these businesses will also generate healthy cash proceeds for Masco. While the ultimate use of these proceeds will be determined based on the situation and the opportunities at the time of closing of the transactions, our current plan is that most of the proceeds will be deployed to share repurchases.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to John, who will go over our operational and financial performance in detail. John?","John Sznewajs","Thank you, Keith and good morning everyone. As Dave mentioned, most of my comments will focus on adjusted performance excluding the impact of rationalization and other one-time items. Turning to slide 6, sales decreased 1% on a reported basis, but matched prior year in local currency. Foreign currency translation unfavorably impacted our second quarter revenue by approximately $26 million. At local currency, North American sales increased 1% in the quarter. This performance was driven by disciplined pricing actions offsetting lower volumes. Currency international sales decreased 4% in the quarter with growth in Germany and Asia more than offset by softness in other regions.","Gross margins were 34.5%, up 90 basis points. Our SG&A as a percent of sales decreased 20 basis points to 16.9% reflecting our continued focus on cost control. We delivered solid bottom line performance and operating income increased 5% to $399 million with operating margins expanding 100 basis points to 17.5%. Our EPS was $0.88 in the quarter, an increase of 16% compared to the second quarter of 2018, and we are updating our annual EPS estimate range to $2.62 to $2.72 per share.","This change reflects the softer top line demand we experienced in the first half of the year and the full cost of the tariffs beginning in the middle of the third quarter as inventory flows through the system. This EPS estimate range also assumes the tariffs remain at the 25% level, which is an increase from our guidance on our first quarter call where we assumed 10% tariffs for 2019.","Turning to Slide 7, Plumbing segment sales decreased 2% on a reported basis. Excluding the impact of currency, sales matched prior year. Foreign currency translation unfavorably impacted this segment's sales by approximately $24 million in the quarter. Our North American sales increased 3% in local currency in the second quarter against a tough 6% comp from the second quarter of 2018. This performance was driven by growth at Delta which achieved another record sales quarter through solid growth with our wholesale customers. Also as Keith mentioned, our spa business Watkins Wellness delivered another record sales quarter, partially due to strong consumer demand for spas with its recently introduced FreshWater salt system.","Our International Plumbing sales decreased 3% in local currency as Hansgrohe's growth in Germany and Asia is more than offset by softness in other regions. The segment's operating profit growth of 2% was driven by pricing actions partially offset by lower volume. For full year 2019 we now expect Plumbing sales growth to be in the 1% to 3% range due to lower volumes we experienced in the first half of the year, particularly in our International Plumbing business and we continue to expect margins to be similar to 2018.","Turning to Slide 8, our Decorative Architectural products grew 3%. This performance was driven by a high single digit growth in various Pro initiative, Pro Paint initiative and low single digit growth in the DIY business. Positive price and volume in paint were partially offset by lower sales in our lighting and builders hardware businesses compared to prior year as our disciplined pricing actions impacted volumes in the quarter.","Operating income in the second quarter grew compared to prior year due to net selling price increases and cost productivity initiatives, partially offset by higher commodity costs. We are pleased with the cost savings we achieved at Kichler which were driven by sourcing savings and business process improvements as we implement the Masco Operating System.","For full year 2019 we now expect Decorative Architectural product sales growth will be in the range of 1% to 3% including the benefit of the Kichler acquisition due to reduced volumes resulting from the impact of disciplined pricing actions in our lighting and builders hardware business. We also expect operating margins will be the range of 17% to 18% as we make merchandising investments to enhance consumer shopping experience and incur a greater impact from the tariffs in lighting and builders hardware. These investments in tariffs will have more of an impact in the fourth quarter than in the third quarter.","Turning to Slide 9, in the Chemistry segment sales decreased 6% in the quarter. This performance was driven by a softer market and excluding the Moores divestiture a difficult 13% sales comp against the second quarter of 2018 partially offset by price. Segmental profitability increased in the quarter by $1 million with margins of 13.5% representing one of the best profit quarters in this segment in 10 years. We continue to expect full year 2019 sales growth between 0 and 13%; however, based on our demonstrated cost control in the first half the year we now expect modest margin expansion in the improvement from our prior guidance.","Turning to Slide 10, our Windows segment sales decreased 3%. Foreign currency translation unfavorably impacted this segment's sales by approximately $2 million. While sales at our North American Windows business matched prior year, this segment continued to be impacted by market softness at our UK Window operation.","Segment profitability in the quarter increased $3 million driven by favorable pricing actions and lower spend partially offset by lower volume. For full year 2019 we now expect sales growth for this segment to decline 1% to 3% excluding currency due to the performance we experienced in our UK Windows business. However, we continue to expect modest margin improvement for the full year.","Turning to Slide 11, our balance sheet remained strong with net debt to EBITDA at 1.9 times and we ended the quarter with approximately $1.3 billion of balance sheet liquidity. Working capital as a percent of sales improved 60 basis points versus prior year to 16.5%. For the full year we now expect working capital as a percent of sales to be slightly higher as compared to our 2018 results or 14%.","During the second quarter we continued our focus on shareholder value creation repurchasing 4.3 million shares valued at approximately $167 million, and as Keith mentioned our Board of Directors has announced its intent to increase our annual dividend by 13% to $0.54 per share starting in the fourth quarter demonstrating the Board's confidence in our future performance in cash flows.","With that, I'll turn the call back over to Keith.","Keith Allman","Thank you, John. It's been a dynamic start to 2019 and I am proud of how our teams have responded to the market conditions and challenges to generate profit growth and margin expansion across all segments in the second quarter. As I mentioned earlier, the fundamentals of our industry remained strong. Demographics should drive household formation and housing for years to come as the large millennial generation has begun to form households. Home price appreciation, which has a strong correlation with repair and remodel spending, remains strong at nearly 4% year-over-year. Existing annual home turnover remains at a healthy overall level of 5.3 million units. Age of housing stock continues to increase as 65% of the U.S. housing stock is now 30 years old or older. And older homes have more repair and remodel spending per home than newer ones.","Consumer confidence and real wage growth remain high as consumers benefit from a healthy economy and declining mortgage rates could spur additional mortgage refinancing, which will put more disposable income in consumers' pockets. Against these strong fundamentals, we will continue to deploy our strong cash flow with a disciplined and balanced approach to investing in our current businesses, dividends, share repurchases, and acquisitions with the right fit and return to create value for our shareholders. Lastly, I hope to see you all at our Investor Day on September 17, in New York City.","With that, we'll open the call for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from line of Stephen Kim with Evercore ISI. Stephen, your line is open.","Stephen Kim","Yes, thanks very much guys. Good job in a tough environment. I wanted to ask a little bit about the Plumbing business, and just I want to make sure that I got a couple of pieces accurate. Last year, you had an impact from Delta's ERP, which if I remember created a pull forward effect, and I'm thinking that probably was a benefit in North America business, North America Plumbing of about 150 basis points this quarter and that was sort of in this 3% North America. I just want to make sure that that's the right way to think about it.","And as you, more broadly as you are lowering the sales guide in Plumbing by a couple of hundred basis points, how much of that reduction would you say is attributable to North America versus the International?","Keith Allman","You are right Stephen. We did have in 2008, a pull ahead of about $10 million from Q2 into Q1 due to the ERP launch at Delta. Despite that pull forward last year, Plumbing still had a great Q2 in 2018. I think the segment was up about 6% excluding FX. So, it was a pretty tough comp for us in the quarter.","In terms of how we think about the volume going forward in Plumbing, I think there are a couple key drivers. Certainly, there is a little bit of softness in International. While we did have good growth in the core market of Germany, there were some other markets internationally that were soft. Italy was particularly soft. There was some softness in Turkey and a little bit of softness in Latin America. So that's a component of how we're thinking about the remainder of the year.","And the other is price elasticity as it relates to some of our tariff pricing. We've been very effective in getting price out in the market in relationship to tariffs to equalize that cost impact as we talked about last quarter, and we have seen some elasticity as it relates to volume, particularly when we think about the lower price point which tends to be a little bit more sensitive, and we've also seen some elasticity around threshold prices for various products. So, when you think about the volume and going forward in Plumbing, I think international and pricing is a piece of that, but we're quite pleased with how we did this quarter against the tough comp.","John Sznewajs","Yes, and the only thing I would supplement Keith's comments with is, of the two international and pricing, I'd say international probably has a heavier weight to the impacts going forward than pricing.","Stephen Kim","And John, was that a general comment across the whole business or was that just in Plumbing? And I guess as a part of that question also, as you had mentioned, I believe in one of your segments I think it was Decorative Architectural that the elasticity effect was going to be greater in 4Q than 3Q. So, I guess my general question is, elasticity, what you just mentioned about that reducing your guidance versus the international weakness, how much is it for the company as a whole and is it - are you going to see more of that in 4Q than 3Q?","John Sznewajs","Yes, no. Stephen, my comment is specific to Plumbing, you know that said, you broadened out the question with your followup. And I would say that there's a dramatic impact, I think I guess my comment stands at face value that in Decorative Architectural there will be more of an impact in the fourth quarter as the tariffs and the rate of inventory starts to flow through our system.","Keith Allman","Just to add a little bit of color Stephen, in terms of the European buyer, we are seeing a little bit of overall market softness in the UK that we talked about, and that will be in the Windows.","Stephen Kim","Yes, okay thank you very much guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Rehaut with JPMorgan. Michael, your line is open.","Michael Rehaut","Thanks, good morning everyone. First question, I just wanted to get a little more detail maybe on the Kichler acquisition and integration, and you kind of pointed to some good progress in terms of some, I believe from the cost side. I just wanted to get a sense also from the top line and I apologize if I missed this earlier, how you're thinking about their performance this quarter given some of the challenges around tariffs as you've highlighted before? How you are thinking about the top line performance for the year for Kichler?","And on the bottom line, if there's any ability to kind of be a little more granular, if possible on what you're achieving from a cost saving standpoint from the cost synergy standpoint, and how you're thinking about the margins in that business going forward?","Keith Allman","Good morning, Michael. From a tariff perspective, I'm very pleased with how the team has performed. We set out to make sure that the cost increases from the tariffs were made up by either improvements in overall cost productivity and supply chain changes and of course in pricing, and we've done all of that. The majority of the lever without a doubt has been on the pricing side, and the team has done a very good job in getting that pricing into the market.","In terms of our activities to drive margin improvements, we continue to work hard really across all fronts as it relates to business process improvements that we're working on with the Masco Operating System, certainly with productivity and sourcing improvements, and we have begun some initial, while not a big number at this point, but we have begun some initial movement of product out of China as a longer-term mitigant.","With regard to growth in 2019, as I said last quarter, growth is going to be a challenge for us. We are off to a slow start. The team has been very disciplined around pricing and programs as we've talked about and that's going to affect the volume coming into 2019. Overall, when we look longer-term, we believe that Lighting is a good business and it should grow similar and consistent with the remodel market over the long term and we are working hard to get back to that pace.","Michael Rehaut","I appreciate that, Keith, thank you. I guess second question maybe just to switch to Cabinets for a moment, and I apologize I have missed some of these details earlier in the call. But with the top-line decline in the quarter, if you could just kind of review some of the factors there and was that decline a surprise relative to your expectations and relative to the industry backdrop, and how should we think about growth in the back half of the year?","Keith Allman","No, I think it's consistent with how we thought this business was going to perform. As I mentioned on the call, we are up against a 13% comp in the second quarter of last year when you exclude the divestitures of Moores, so that was a component. A lot of prices have been put in the markets to offset tariffs and we talked about that in past calls. So, it really is performing as we thought it would and we\u2019re pleased with the margin performance in this segment given the environment.","Michael Rehaut","Great, thanks so much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Wood with Nomura Instinet. Michael, your line is open.","Michael Wood","Hi, good morning. I was hoping you can give some more color on the international weakness that you pointed out. To what extent is the acceleration that decline there due to destocking? And is price discipline holding in some of those European markets?","Keith Allman","The price is holding, yes. Not a lot of destocking that we really saw. John, was there?","John Sznewajs","No, no, that was all in the first quarter, not in the second quarter.","Keith Allman","I would say it\u2019s, you know, generally speaking it\u2019s more around some specific markets that are a little softer than we expected. Certainly we\u2019re seeing some softness in the UK in our Window operation and as I mentioned on the call there are some markets over in Europe and Latin America that are a little softer than we had thought.","Michael Wood","And it was nice to see the Pro Paint accelerate from, I think it was low single-digit in 1Q to high single-digits here in 2Q. Is that a more normal pace of growth that you\u2019d expect going forward in that Pro business in terms of where it is now from a maturity standpoint or can you continue to accelerate that?","Keith Allman","No that\u2019s as expected. We\u2019re pleased with our Pro growth. We can- we\u2019re going to continue to expand our capabilities and we\u2019re confident that we\u2019re going to continue to grow above the market and we think we\u2019re doing that.","Michael Wood","Great, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Lovallo with Bank of America. John, your line is open.","John Lovallo","Hey guys, thank you for taking my questions. First one on Kichler, I guess, are you comfortable at this point the personal changes that you've gone through are pretty much behind you? And then along those same lines, if I recall correctly, Home Depot sells largely, private label lighting I think it\u2019s their Hampton Bay. Is there an opportunity for you guys to get more Kichler products into Home Depot?","Keith Allman","I'm very pleased with the team. We have a new leader in place down there that is a high performer that has been in a number of positions at Masco, with increasing responsibility in each stop along the way, whether it was from investor relations to the retail cabinet sales and a nice win that she put together with Menards, which as I mentioned in my prepared remarks that that program is performing well and as expected and that was very good win. She overall ran overall sales for Cabinetry and that - she did a great job there. And then, on her extended team, again very confident in that and we've made some significant changes and brought in professionals that I interact with on a regular basis and I couldn't be more happy with how that team has shaped up.","In terms of opportunities across the broader lighting market, I think there are several across multiple channels, and we have importantly a brand that is one of the few brands in the industry that in fact is successful across multiple channels. It has an outstanding assortment across price points and as I just mentioned, across the channel. So we\u2019re going after growth really across the board in Cabinetry, excuse me, in Lighting.","John Lovallo","Okay, thanks for that Keith. And then as a followup, can you guys give just a little bit more color on the merchandising investments that you mentioned in Decorative and Architectural?","John Sznewajs","Yes, so you know as I mentioned we\u2019re enhancing some of the in-store displays, John, here in the back half of 2019. So, you know, yeah and mostly that will be in our - in the Paint category and so the Behr team is going to get those in place here in the third and fourth quarter.","John Lovallo","Okay, thanks guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Keith Hughes with SunTrust. Keith, your line is open.","Keith Hughes","Thank you. Within Decorative and Architectural products, as you look at the second half of the year, will - to get to the guidance you\u2019d establish, will the trends remain the same of your Pro up high single-digits, DIY low, and seemed down at Lighting and builders hardware, is there some sort of rate changes going to occur?","John Sznewajs","Yes, Keith, I think that\u2019s certainly the general pattern that we expect to see in the back half of the year. The one thing I'd really ask you to remember is, in the fourth quarter of last year we have fairly significant pull forward of about $20 million related to our Paint business. And so that - you know we don\u2019t expect that to reoccur. And so, that will be a little bit of a top line headwind going into Q4. So, Keith I kind of just want to make sure you recall that.","Keith Hughes","And also in Lighting here in Kichler, when do you think you will fully offset the impacts of the tariffs, is that currently where we are or is there still some things to be worked out?","Keith Allman","I think in terms of our pricing actions and the costs, I think we've got it in place at this point, now the - in terms of the cost reductions that we\u2019re executing again. So when you look across price and some of our productivity improvements, I think we've handled that. Now, in terms of the cost of the products coming in, I would expect that in the third quarter and the fourth quarter we will start to see those costs hit our P&L as it flows through our inventory.","Keith Hughes","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Truman Patterson with Wells Fargo. Truman, your line is open.","Truman Patterson","Hi, good morning guys, nice quarter and a pretty challenging environment. So first, I wanted to look at your EPS guidance. You guys walked down the midpoint just very modestly by a few cents. Could you walk us through the drivers of this? And were there any offsets to the upside and could you also give us what amount of share repurchase is included in guidance of the $600 million?","John Sznewajs","Yes, Truman, so you know a couple of questions in there. And as we look at the puts and takes in terms of the revised guidance, I\u2019d say the first one was the trends that we have seen in the first part of the year and we laid out pretty clearly, I think, our sales expectations and margin expectations reach those segments. So that reflects, is reflected. The other piece to recall is, we did increase our view as to reach here [ph], so we're not \u2013 so in our last call, in the Q1 call, we though tariffs would be at 10% and now we think we\u2019re going to be at 25%. So those are the two principal components in there. In terms of the share count, the share count really is reflective of where we've purchased through today, it doesn't take into account that, but we do have $600 million that we're anticipating, as Keith mentioned in his remarks for the full year.","Truman Patterson","Okay, okay, thanks for that. And then thinking about the China tariffs and some of your Plumbing competitor supply chains, couple of the larger guys and then some of the smaller competitors, do the majority of them source through China as well and do you think, the industry is kind of on an even playing field with China tariffs jump in the 25%?","Keith Allman","Yes, you know, it really depends. There are different competitors that we have across different price points.","Truman Patterson","Sorry, I was meaning faucets.","Keith Allman","So even with faucets there are some private label competitors that sometimes come up against us in the low end which would have more of an impact, but on balance we think we are in good competitive footing as it relates to our exposure to China tariffs.","John Sznewajs","So Truman, I just want to clarify a remark I made a minute ago, our guidance does include the impact of all $600 million of share repurchase.","Truman Patterson","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Bouley with Barclays. Matthew, your line is open.","Matthew Bouley","Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. I wanted to ask back on the margin strength in Cabinet, specifically I think John, you mentioned some strong cost control there and you guys highlighted the pricing actions as well, so just some more color on that. Which channels are you taking price, to what degree did price relative to cost control drive that margin? And anything you're seeing on the promotional side with the customers as well would be helpful? Thank you.","John Sznewajs","Sure, you know on the promotional side, we've not seen - we\u2019ve seen pretty consistent promotional activity across the various channels in the second quarter. So not a significant increase or decrease in any of the promotional activity. You know, in terms of price versus cost, in one of the two I'd say price was probably a little bit of a heavier weight than the cost side, but both has a pretty good impact on the quarter because a lot of what's - that were coming, they come in offshore face the tariffs, so we saw pricing across the industry put in place.","Matthew Bouley","Perfect, that's helpful. And then just secondly, I wanted to ask what you guys are seeing on inventory levels at your customers in North America? You had previously talked of seeing some restocking back in April, how did that progress through the quarter and into July, do you see any room for any further restocking? Thank you.","Keith Allman","Matthew, we really didn't see much in the way of inventory fluctuations in the second quarter. I'd call it normal. There was some, as you mentioned some destocking in Plumbing in Q1, but that seems to have normalized and orders to us were more in line with their sales out to the consumer. So we are anticipating some inventory adjustments in the back half of 2019 I would say as is somewhat normal and those adjustments are contemplated in our guidance.","Matthew Bouley","All right, thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Megan McGrath with Buckingham Research. Megan your line is open.","Megan McGrath","Good morning, thanks for taking my question. A couple of questions just on the overall markets. In terms of Paint, some of our channel checks we heard from sales folks that all sorts of different retailers that they were seeing a little bit of mixing down maybe to more a mid-price point versus higher price point. I'm curious to see if you saw that as well at all in your, either your DIY or Pro business?","John Sznewajs","Overall, I\u2019d say the market was a bit challenged in Q2. There was some tough weather. So I think that affected us. I think when you look at the market and how we performed with our Pro business up high single-digits in DIY or low single-digits, we think we held our own to possibly maybe gaining a little. Admittedly it's hard to pinpoint with precision the size of the market in a particular quarter.","We didn't see a whole lot of mix fluctuations in Paint, and I think if you broaden that, your question out, if I may, into broader Masco as it relates to mix, we don't really see mix as being material one way or another as you know, either favorable or unfavorable as we look forward to the remainder of the year.","Megan McGrath","Okay, great. And then, just like a quick followup on your comments around sourcing and moving things out of China, do you feel like you are finished with that process or is there more to come assuming the tariffs stay where they, is there more to come on that front?","Keith Allman","I think, if we think about it from a perspective of tariffs staying where they are and staying with some sort of permanency, I would say that there's more to come, more taking, we\u2019re being very careful as we move products out and resource to other low-cost countries, careful in that we want to make sure that we\u2019re ensuring our delivery excellence and our quality excellence, and there is some variability in fact to whether or not that 25% will indeed stick for some extended period of time. So we're being cautious and we have moved some doubt. But I think long term, when you look at the impact of these tariffs in - with some of the pricing that we've put into the market that long term this will be absorbed by the consumer and we still believe in a very healthy R&R market.","Megan McGrath","Great, thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Justin Speer with Zelman & Associates. Justin, your line is open.","Justin Speer","Thanks guys, good morning. I wanted to spend a little bit of time on your guidance and keeping in mind that the tariff situation is incremental headwind, then the net balance against raw materials that are favorable, so I wanted to see if we could, maybe you could help us unpack what the incremental headwind from the tariff is discretely if you can walk through the discrete costs to the business from the tariff step up and to counter balance that against the raw materials? Because when you look at the range, just the back half margin range to the high and low-end of your guidance, is it implies a fairly wide range of outcome for margins, so just try and give us some context on how you get to that guidance in view of all those moving parts?","Keith Allman","I'll talk a little bit, Justin, this is Keith, to the commodities. I think some of the commodities in our basket have indeed moderated year-over-year. Copper and zinc and Plumbing started to moderate in the back half of 2018 and remained below what I would say the peak prices we saw in the first half of 2018. So, that will be a little bit of a benefit for us in the second half. TiO2 and resins, both still are up year-over-year, probably have peaked here in Q2, should be flat sequentially in the second half, but still up year-over-year.","So, not expecting significant inflation or deflation in paint ROS as we sit today. In cabinets, plywood remains elevated, but distribution and logistics have come down a little bit, still up year-over-year. So obviously, we're continuing to work with our suppliers and our cost productivity and all those types of improvement opportunities, but when we look at the commodity inputs, we're really not seeing a material benefit or a headwind as we think about 2019.","John Sznewajs","And Justin, maybe I'll take the tariff component of that is, - as we've articulated before, the tariffs are based on what we know today, yes, are roughly impact $600 million of our cost of goods sold or roughly $150 million impact. You know, obviously the way we're pursuing, Keith mentioned earlier, that we're pursuing price to offset tariffs, obviously we're getting price recovery from that. So that action in and of itself limits margin expansion as a matter of fact, oftentimes that has slightly dilutive effect on margins and so maybe that weighs in on your calculation.","Justin Speer","And then, just thinking about thinking about these moving pieces, you mentioned the $600 million of COGS today that were sourced from China, if we were to fast-forward 6 months to 12 months from now, what do you think your footprint looks like?","Keith Allman","Not anticipating a significant change in that over that over that time period. As I mentioned, we're moving some, products out. We've in-sourced some back to the United States. We've taken some to the other low-cost countries, but it's going to take some time for us to ramp that up. Our focus really is on keeping our delivery and quality excellence up with our consumer and our customers.","Justin Speer","So just pulling this altogether, as you think about the back half and the set up, clearly, the revenue trend, softer margin trends, maybe a little bit better, but if you could give us some context on what, how you're thinking about that downside, I guess elements to - I guess risk elements to get to the downside versus maybe upside of your range, where you see the most risk and maybe the opportunity?","Keith Allman","I think from a top line risk there is a lot of volatility that's out there with the consumer as it relates to what's going on and geopolitically what could potentially happen with trade and everything that we're all quite aware of.","So I would say, if something happens from a consumer perspective or from a broader confidence, I think that could be an issue that could take it to the downside. Having said that, as I went through it a couple of times on this call and prior calls, we think the consumer is in pretty good shape, so we're not anticipating that.","Justin Speer","Thank you, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Dahl with RBC Capital Markets. Mike, your line is open.","Michael Dahl","Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to ask first, just I guess Keith, going back to the Paint comments you just made around price costs and not necessarily expecting significant deflation, but if I kind of parse out the commentary between Kichler headwinds and then the overall margin performance, it seems like the core coatings margins have been quite strong. So I guess what do you attribute that to? Is it really just pricing actions and volume? And then if you look at your full year guide, embedded in that guide is there an expectation that coatings margins are up year-on-year? Thanks.","Keith Allman","When we think about the margins in Q2 we're very pleased with the cost productivity improvements we're making. I called out Kichler. They continue to do a very good job, both from a variable cost perspective, as well as on the sourcing side.","The second half impact of tariffs in lighting and hardware are going to be - are going to start to flow through midway into the third quarter. So that's a factor that, I ask you to think about as well. But fundamentally, our productivity in our movements are reflected in that margin range that we have in that 17% to 18% range.","John Sznewajs","Yes, I guess, Mike, if you think about it, we've had pretty good strong performance in our Pro businesses, as well as our DIY business for the full year. So yeah, I know, I think we've had good margins, but we're not going to break them out for the full year.","Michael Dahl","Okay, understood. Second question, I think Keith, you've kind of mentioned the different potential initiatives around shifting supply chain over time. I think in the past you've talked specifically around the relative low cost of shifting some assembly in Plumbing state side, where that can be one solution that's relatively low CapEx for you. Is that an initiative that you've begun to pursue at that point or is that still in the bucket of kind of wait and see how this all plays out?","Keith Allman","We have in-sourced some assembly back, but just a little bit at this point. Again, this is a very dynamic environment, and what's included and not included, moving forward, I think is still in play. So, this is a game of where we're moving slowly and carefully and as I said we're driving cost out and in some cases cost sharing with some of our suppliers. We're driving value engineering and productivity improvements, and of course we're getting price. And we're going to be very careful that we protect the customer as we move through this, and that's our focus.","Michael Dahl","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Phil Ng with Jefferies. Your line is open.","Philip Ng","Hey guys. You should be getting a pretty decent amount of proceeds from the divestitures. I'm curious how quickly will you use the buybacks potentially for buybacks and at this point of the cycle, how do you think about M&A and are there any pockets that really stand out or do you need a third leg to kind of continue to drive the growth story in your business going forward?","John Sznewajs","Yes. Phil. In terms of procedure, right, we do expect some significant proceeds. But as Keith mentioned in his prepared remarks, while we anticipate at this time using this year the proceeds from the divestitures for share repurchases, it's going to be facts and circumstances dependent upon what's happening at the time that we actually receive the proceeds. So, it's hard to give you a great deal of specificity as to how quickly we may redeploy those proceeds to share repurchases. . The second part of your question again was\u2026?","Keith Allman","I think there was \u2013 if I could jump in here John, and with regards to how we're looking at our M&A funnel and whether not we need, I think, Phil it was your words, they\u2026","Philip Ng","Would you like to add\u2026?","Keith Allman","A certain way if you will to, yes, to keep the growth story going, we don\u2019t believe we do know and we're looking at all options in the building products case - building product space in our funnel, but clearly, our focus is closer to the core. We think we have very strong businesses in Paint and Plumbing and that's where our focus is. And I would suspect M&A activity to be more along those areas, not saying no to other opportunities, but clearly, our focus is closer to the core.","Philip Ng","Got it. Given the margin expansion you saw in 2Q you're guiding to flat margins for the full year. Assuming part of that is just the tariffs kicking in more fully, I'm just wondering have you implemented all the price increases you need at this juncture for the full 25% and is there any risk that margins in the fourth quarter would be flattish or potentially down just given the full impact? Thanks a lot.","Keith Allman","You're right Phil, the impact of tariff costs as it rolls through our inventory will be more strongly felt in the second half. With regards to pricing, we do think we've got our pricing in place and where it needs to be.","John Sznewajs","Yes Phil, with respect to margins, recall again, I mentioned this earlier in response to I think Keith's question, that we had some pull forward of sales out of Q1 of this year into Q4 of last year, which created a bit of a stronger margin and you know which we typically see seasonally in the fourth quarter of 2018. And so, the margins could be flat to slightly down in Q4 given that dynamic that we experienced last year.","Philip Ng","Got it, thanks a lot.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Zener with KeyBanc. Ken, your line is open.","Kenneth Zener","Good morning, gentlemen.","Keith Allman","Good morning, Ken.","John Sznewajs","Good morning, Ken.","Kenneth Zener","I was just checking. Keith, you had mentioned in Plumbing in regards, well it was useful, in Plumbing, in regards to the entry price point which set in the U.S., so separate from the international, you mentioned that the entry price point was actually somewhat weaker category because of the pricing. And you mentioned this term threshold pricing, are you suggesting that you asked this, the delta, let's say big box is actually will deter demand if you take $45 or $50 faucet up to $58, is that where you're seeing the largest impact of pricing which - is that what you're saying?","Keith Allman","Yes, Ken a couple of, things with regard to pricing and elasticity. As I mentioned last call, this is a challenge and it's relatively new territory and that typical data analytics around elasticity involve a static environment where you move a price on SKU and you say if it goes up, you raise price a percent the volume goes down 3% or something of that sort.","So the data and the analytics is really in a more static environment. This is anything but static. We have a significant amount of price changes that's gone into the - cost changes that I've gone into the market and we have variable responses in the competitive aisle, if you will, around how much of that gets put by retailers into the market. So, it's not static. So, we are seeing a more elastic demand curve for opening price point products and that certainly stands to reason as you think about sensitivity and the total cost and what people are willing to spend at the low end versus the high end.","Conversely, we're not seeing a significant - as significant, nearly a significant amount of elasticity on some of our higher end products. We mentioned a record quarter in our Spa business for example, that's not a low-end product and it's discretionary. So, the elasticity is hitting us a little bit more on the opening price point.","What I mean by threshold pricing is pricing that's around a certain number where it makes a more of a material difference in volume and customer perception than say is necessarily warranted by the flat out percent of the price increase. So, when certain products, 100 at 99.99 is the threshold price.","Kenneth Zener","Got it.","Keith Allman","So if there is an increase over that threshold of 2% that's going to impact you more than if it was an increase of 2% say going from $80 up. So that's what I meant by threshold pricing hope that helps.","Kenneth Zener","For the variable - variability of the market were you referring to the variability of how retailers we're accepting your price or was it the variability of how your competitors were responding to tariffs? Thank you.","Keith Allman","Just the variability of what we're seeing the channel and the consumer pricing in the market.","Kenneth Zener","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steven Ramsey with Thompson Research. Steven, your line is open.","Steven Ramsey","Good morning. Just to start with the guidance to make sure I understand, what gives you the confidence to raise the low end slightly while lowering the top end a bit more, is the high-end volume-related and the low-end better margins or maybe unpack that and if it's a certain segment that is coming in with better margins maybe than expected?","John Sznewajs","Yes, I would tell you, I think you - yes that's the answer to the question. It is better volumes and slightly lower volumes and margins and kind of though, how we got there. As you may recall, as you break it down by segment, we did raise the margin expectation for a couple for the Cabinet segment and so that has definitely an impact on it, but you're reading actually was the answer to the question.","Steven Ramsey","Great, and then thinking on capital allocation, couple of questions there, why not raise the dividend at a more modest pace when the buyback is more accretive to EPS growth per share? And then, can you maybe talk to what CapEx might look like once the sales are completed?","Keith Allman","Yes sure. With respect to the dividend and I think one of the things that we mentioned on our prepared remarks is, part of our capital allocation policy is to keep our dividend payout ratio at roughly 20% maybe slightly lower or slightly higher, but in that 20% zip code. And so, the reason we raised it to $0.54 this time around was to make certain that we keep that payout ratio of nearly 20% intact. And so that's kind of the thought behind that. In terms of the CapEx post divestitures I think we're probably in that 2.5% of sales range, so not significantly different from where we're at today.","Steven Ramsey","Excellent, thank you.","Operator","Gentlemen, your final question comes from the line of Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research. Eric, your line is open.","Eric Bosshard","I'm curious as we think about 2020 and Kichler, what you're excited about and what the upside scenario might be for that business as we think about 2020 and beyond?","Keith Allman","I think new products is really, you've got me Jazzed and the team that we talked about before, which goes across not only new products, but also our human resource function, our supply chain function, et cetera. So we've got a very good team and we've got a nice focus on new products introductions. And as I mentioned, we have the luxury of having one of the few brands that competes across all of the channels. So we have opportunities with the new team and with our product assortment across the online channel and across retail and across our dealers. And certainly continuing to apply our Masco Operating System and getting that more ingrained in that business will yield improvements without a doubt.","Eric Bosshard","And then secondly, just clarity within the guidance, is there anything different in the sales outlook in the back half, is that regional or by business that you would call out where you feel different than you did 90 or 180 days ago?","John Sznewajs","Well, I guess, Eric, there are a couple of areas where we adjusted our sales expectations, but international is probably the one area that is coming in softer than we had expected, and so that has an impact on what we put out for our Plumbing guidance in a way. So, I think that's the one area that would probably be the one difference versus where we were at the end of the first quarter.","Keith Allman","I would say that while certainly a little bit softer in international. I do like the trends that I'm seeing in our Decorative segment and North American plumbing coming out of Q2. Strong backlog in our Spa business points to a healthy consumer. On the high end, we think that's a nice barometer for consumer spending. And then, just in general, as I'm kicking around in the markets we're getting good reports from customers across our product category. So I'd like the trends that we saw in Q2.","Eric Bosshard","Great, thank you.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call. On behalf of Masco Corporation thank you for today's participation.

My name is Tiffany, and I will be your conference operator for today's call. As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded for replay purposes. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Vice President of Investor Relations, Maria Duey. Maria, you may begin.","Maria Duey","Thank you, Tiffany, and good morning to everyone. Welcome to Masco Corporation's Third Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me on our call today are Tim Wadhams, President and CEO of Masco; and John Sznewajs, Masco's Vice President, Treasurer and Chief Financial Officer.","Our third quarter earnings release and the presentation slides that we will refer to during the call are available on the Investor Relations portion on our website.

These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. We have described these risks and uncertainties in our Risk Factors and Other Disclosures in our Form 10-K and our Form 10-Qs that we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","Today's presentation also includes non-GAAP financial measures.

Tim?","Timothy Wadhams","Thank you, Maria, and thank all of you for joining us today for Masco's Third Quarter 2013 Earnings Call. And if you would please move to Slide #4. As we have for the last several quarters, Masco's third quarter results showed strong revenue growth and margin expansion compared to the prior year quarter. We continue to execute on the strategic initiatives we laid out at the beginning of the year. As a result, this is the first time since the third quarter of 2007 that we have delivered double-digit operating margins. That outcome was driven by a double-digit increase in top line sales and strong operating leverage. We're very pleased with these results. Our leadership position in the building products industry and our focused execution against the housing recovery benefited all of our segments this quarter, with all 5 of our operating segments contributing to our top line growth. In North America, we continue to benefit from increased new home construction activity and improving trends in remodel activity, where we are starting to see an increase in bigger ticket-related items. In addition, the investments we have made to new products and programs have strengthened our business, particularly benefiting our paint and Plumbing business. We are seeing the benefit of our strict focus on cost containment, as well as our ongoing commitment to total cost productivity, as evidenced by our incremental margins. Importantly, our Installation and Cabinetry segments grew both top and bottom line in the quarter, reflecting our strong leverage to a housing recovery and significant improvement compared to last year. Our international sales and profits continue to increase, reflecting the slowly improving economic environment in the Eurozone and a solid performance by our international Plumbing and window businesses.","And if you would please turn to Slide #5. As we've communicated in the past, our strategy is focused on 4 key elements to drive performance. Our commitment and investment to expand our market leadership positions was recognized by one of our major partners, The Home Depot, in its recent Supplier Partnership Meeting. Both Delta and Behr were awarded The Home Depot Partner of the Year award in their respective categories. Both Delta and Behr were also recognized for The Home Depot's top 10 innovations of the year, reflecting the emphasis we place on innovation in Masco. In addition, unrelated, Delta was awarded the EPA WaterSense Partner of the Year. We're extremely proud of Behr and Delta, and congratulate both teams on their recent wins, and thank them for their hard work and dedication. Our company-wide emphasis on cost control as sales increase is demonstrated by our improvement in gross margins, SG&A leverage and our operating margins. John will discuss that in a couple of minutes, but we're very pleased with that outcome. Our Installation segment is capitalizing on improved market dynamics and drove sales in all channels of the business. By remaining focused on profitability, they continued their trend of improving their operating profit. North American Cabinetry is outperforming the new home construction market, and is benefiting from positive trends and remodeling. We had strong growth in the quarter, reflecting the stabilization of the business. The team continues to execute on their strategic plan, positioning the business for future profitable growth. Combined, these 2 segments, Cabinets and Installation, improved by $41 million of operating profit, compared to the third quarter of 2012. In addition, we remain committed to strengthening our balance sheet and continue to improve our working capital management. In addition, in August, we retired a $200 million debt maturity with cash on hand. These strategic highlights demonstrate our continued focus on execution which produced another strong quarterly performance.","And if you would please move to Slide #6, John Sznewajs, our CFO, will take you through our operating segments from a financial and operational perspective.","John G. Sznewajs","Thank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. If you would please turn to Slide 7. You can see, due to the improving fundamentals of our business, our momentum accelerated coming out of the second quarter and we delivered another quarter with double-digit sales growth and operating margin expansion. In fact, this was our eighth consecutive quarter of year-over-year sales growth and adjusted operating margin expansion. Sales increased 12%, with North American sales up 13% and international sales up 5% in local currency for the quarter. Currency had an approximate $13 million positive impact in the quarter. And while we experienced strong growth in all channels, volume increases were strongest in our direct-to-builder channel.","We did a great job of leveraging our cost in the quarter, as adjusted gross margins expanded 120 basis points to 28.5%. The strength of our bottom line performance and our commitment to cost control were evident in the quarter as our SG&A, as a percent of sales, declined to 18.2%, a 140-basis-point improvement, a terrific outcome in one of our best performances on that metric in many years. As a result, adjusted operating income increased 50% to $222 million, with adjusted operating margins expanding 260 basis points to 10.3%. As Tim mentioned, our first double-digit operating margin in 6 years. We realized good operating leverage as we delivered 31% incremental margins in the quarter. And our adjusted EPS nearly doubled in the quarter to $0.27 from $0.14 1 year ago.","Turning to Slide 8, we see the components of our operating income improvement in the third quarter. The $59 million increase in net volume\/mix was driven by solid volume increases in every segment. This growth was partially offset by a mix in both our Cabinet business, with strong sales growth to production builders; and in our Decorative Architectural segment, with their successful new programs and expansion into international markets. Net price\/commodity improved approximately $15 million in the quarter, largely driven by our Cabinets, European Plumbing, Installation and U.S. windows businesses, partially offset by an unfavorable price\/commodity relationship in our paint business. This also reflects the year-over-year impact of our metals hedge, which was $1 million favorable in the quarter. We captured $42 million of profit improvements, gross in the quarter, and believe we are on track to realize our full year profit improvement initiatives, gross of $160 million, up $10 million from our prior estimate of $150 million.","If we turn to Slide 9, you can see we delivered solid performance in our Plumbing segment and sales increased 11% in the quarter. The strong sales momentum of our North American faucet and toilet businesses, which include our leading brands, Delta, Peerless and Brizo, continued in the third quarter. Consumer demand for our innovative new products drove a mid-teens percentage sales growth in the quarter as we experienced good growth in retail and strong balanced growth in the trade channel, reflecting our continued investments in the showroom, commercial and multifamily segments of this channel. We are up against a difficult comparison in the quarter, as Q3 2012 benefited from approximately $12 million of load-in related to our retail program wins in the second half of last year. And as a reminder, we will face a similar headwind of $12 million in the fourth quarter.","We also experienced mid-single-digit growth from several of our other North American businesses, such as spas in our up [ph] Plumbing business. And following an improved second quarter, our European sales momentum continued, with sales increasing mid-single digits in local currency, led by Hansgrohe. Partially offsetting this growth was the exit of the unprofitable channel bathing business, and lost retail bathing programs. These actions negatively impacted sales by approximately $12 million in the quarter, and will total approximately $50 million for 2013.","Year-over-year operating profit increased $43 million, driven by incremental volume, especially in the trade channel; a favorable price\/commodity relationship, particularly in Europe; favorable currency and productivity and cost control measures. Recall -- you may recall that 2012's Q3 operating profit was negatively impacted by $10 million due to increased program costs and currency.","Turning to Slide 10, you can see our Decorative Architectural segment enjoyed good growth as new product introductions, such as BEHR MARQUEE and BEHR DECKOVER, which continued to perform well, increased Pro sales in international sales growth to over 9% revenue increase in the quarter. As a result, we realized low-teens percentage gallon growth in the quarter. Liberty Hardware also continues to contribute to both the top and bottom lines of the segment, as a result of share gains and several new programs in retail. Our efforts to drive gallon growth included $10 million of incremental investment in advertising and promotional expenses, which, when coupled with an unfavorable price\/commodity relationship, caused our operating margin to decline in the quarter.","If you turn to Slide 11, you can see that our sustained focus on profitable growth in the Cabinet segment resulted in improved performance as we posted a double-digit sales gain in the quarter and an adjusted operating profit for the second quarter in a row. The environment for Cabinetry is improving, as we experienced ongoing strengths with our builder accounts, and accelerating demand from our remodel customers. All 3 brands are benefiting from these improved market conditions. These trends led to segment sales increasing 15% in the quarter. North American Cabinet sales, excluding countertops, increased 20% in the quarter, reflecting strong direct-to-builder sales growth and improvement in the dealer and home center channels. We maintained our profitability in North America by improving our adjusted operating results in the quarter by $21 million, reflecting a 62% incremental margin. This improvement was driven by increased volume, cost control, productivity improvements and lower promotional spending. This was partially offset by higher input costs and negative mix due to increased sales to production builders. The turnaround plan in North America continues to be on track, and we are profitable in this segment sooner than we anticipated, as a result of our focus on cost containment, improving demand and actions taken late in 2012. After preparing one of our existing facility -- our existing facilities to absorb additional volume, we announced the closure of a component plant in the quarter, then, it was identified as part of our late 2012 footprint consolidation plan.","Turning to Slide 12. Our Installation segment saw a sales growth of 19%, which was driven by a 28% increase in residential new construction sales, and to a lesser degree, by higher sales volumes in our commercial, retrofit and distribution channels. We experienced strong growth at all builders, but particularly, the big builders. In addition to solid top line performance, management's strong execution delivered significantly improved bottom line results, with adjusted operating profit improving by $20 million and adjusted operating margins expanding by 540 basis points. This strong execution was complemented by the continued implementation of a leaner operating model which is allowing for efficiencies and facilitating growth in new geographies. We anticipate that we'll have opened 15 new locations by year end, and expect further greenfield growth in 2014. This segment exhibited strong operating leverage in the quarter, delivering 35% incremental margins despite the impact of rising raw material and labor costs.","Turning to Slide 13. Our Other Specialty Products segment saw sales increase 13% in the quarter, yielding another strong quarter driven by our North American window sales increase of mid-teens percent. This growth was due to higher sales in both the new home construction channel and replacement window markets. As Europe shows initial signs of economic stability, our U.K.-based window business produced positive volume increases in the low-teens percent, driven by continued growth in trade and retail channels and the success of our small composite door acquisition earlier this year. The segment's adjusted operating profits were flat in the quarter compared to the third quarter of 2012, despite increased sales. This is primarily due to the negative mix and several miscellaneous costs, including the initial costs of implementing a new ERP system at our Milgard window business. Our estimate, at this time, is that the ERP implementation costs will be approximately $2 million to $3 million in each of the next several years.","And then, turning to Slide 14. You can see, as Tim mentioned earlier, that we retired $200 million of debt with our August maturity; and that our working capital, as a percent of sales, increased -- or improved significantly, down to 12.1% in the quarter compared to 14.8% in the third quarter of last year. Also, at the table at the bottom of this chart, you can see that our liquidity, both our cash and cash investments and our short-term bank deposits aggregate $1.3 billion. I should point out that since the -- since January 2012, we have reduced total debt by $600 million, while our total liquidity has improved by about $200 million.","With that, I'll turn the call back over to Tim and his thoughts on our outlook.","Timothy Wadhams","Thank you, John. And if you would please move to Slide #16. Our success in the third quarter reflects our commitment to executing on the priorities we identified at the beginning of the year. Our Installation and Cabinet businesses are continuing to deliver results from their focused execution against improving market dynamics. The previous actions that they have taken to improve their business will continue to deliver benefits going forward. And as John just mentioned, we reduced our debt in August and do not have any maturities in 2014. Our commitment to innovation, new products and programs and strategic growth initiatives is producing results and augmenting market growth, as indicated by our third quarter performance. We continue to manage cost aggressively and are on target to achieve approximately $160 million of profit improvements for the year. We're very encouraged by our third quarter performance and continued progress against our priorities, and we want to thank all of our employees worldwide for their ongoing effort to drive Masco's performance.","And if you would please move to Slide #17. Just a couple of quick comments before we go to Q&A. The underlying fundamentals of our business remains strong, as evidenced by another quarter of sales growth and margin expansion. We expect that the positive trends in new home construction and home improvement in North America will continue. Having said that, we recognize that there are macroeconomic factors that will challenge us going forward, including the velocity of the U.S. recovery and global economic uncertainty. Despite these macroeconomic factors, we are positioned to continue profitable growth and value creation for our shareholders. Our size, scale and strong liquidity allow us to rapidly respond to increased demand in new home construction. Our focus on strengthening our brands through consumer-driven innovative solutions for our customers and consumers is driving share gains in the repair\/remodel channel, furthering our strategic relationships with key customers. And our emphasis on cost control and process improvement enables us to convert increased volume with strong operating leverage to improve margins and returns. We feel very good about our year-to-date results, and are particularly pleased with our third quarter performance. We will push to close the year with a strong fourth quarter and are off to a solid start, with October sales looking to be up high-single digits percent. We're excited about the future and believe that Masco is positioned for improved operating performance in 2014 and beyond.","And with that, Tiffany, we'll open up the lines for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Dennis McGill with Zelman & Associates.","Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, LLC","First one, you noted within Decorative Architectural on the gallon side, low-teens percentage growth there. But there is, as you noted, new products, some load-ins on some business that you've won. Can you maybe separate what you think is sort of apples-to-apples growth versus some of the market share or new product growth that's embedded in that low-teens percentage?","Timothy Wadhams","In terms of the gallon share increase, Dennis?","Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, LLC","Yes. In other words, I guess, what if same-store gallons go up and then, what would the new product introductions and\/or market share...","Timothy Wadhams","Don't have that level of detail, but the new products, particularly the DECKOVER products, had a very strong quarter for us. But as we've indicated, gallon growth has been an area of focus for both us and The Home Depot. And certainly, felt good about that outcome in the quarter. And I did see growth in other areas of the business, but the new products drove a lot of that.","Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, LLC","So is that a load-in effect or is that the success...","Timothy Wadhams","No, I wouldn't call it a load-in effect, Dennis. We've got most of that product in, in the second quarter, as I recall. I think most of that was done -- in fact, I'm sure that it was done in the second quarter. So that was all incremental.","Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, LLC","Okay. Second one would be just within the Cabinets business. There are several moving parts, it seems, from the pricing standpoint, with price announcements being announced across the industry. And then, you also have the Chinese plywood dynamic on the raw materials side. So can you just maybe talk more broadly about the moving parts between price, raw materials and then, promotional activity?","John G. Sznewajs","Sure, Dennis. It's John. There's a couple of things that, to your point, that -- to impact the segment. So in terms of promotional activity, we have seen promotional activity down pretty significantly compared to this time last year. In terms of raw material pricing, we have seen some of the input costs go up during the course of 2013, and we did implement price earlier in the year to offset some of those costs. But to your point, the Chinese tariff that was announced in the third quarter did impact us by about $2 million negatively in the quarter. And we have announced price increases to offset some of those -- that action specifically, later in the fourth quarter.","Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, LLC","And just a quick follow-up on that. Are you seeing competitors match or announce similar price increases?","John G. Sznewajs","We've not seen -- I don't follow all of our competitors, but there has been -- we have heard of other pricing actions taking place.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert Wetenhall with RBC Capital Markets.","Desi DiPierro - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","This is Desi filling in for Bob. When looking at the paint segment, I wanted to see if you can provide some color on the long-term strategy for that business. You mentioned, it's a few quarters now, that you want to drive gallon growth. So with sales up 8.5% but profit declining by $3 million, I want to see if you could think about the trajectory for promotional spending and profit growth of the business?","Timothy Wadhams","Well, we certainly have indicated in the past, Desi, the desire to want to grow gallons. And we did indicate earlier this year that we anticipate that there could be some investment that would help us drag that. So from a longer term strategy standpoint, that's certainly where we expect to be going forward. As we've indicated, we're willing to invest behind that. We did have about $10 million of additional advertising and promotion in the quarter. And that, obviously, had an impact on the margin. But I think if you'd look at the margin on a year-to-date basis, I think we're slightly above last year, maybe 50 basis points above last year, at 18%-plus. And certainly would, as we think about growth going forward, whether that's with the Pro, whether it's part of the international strategy, as we've indicated in the past, we expect that to have a very high return, but potentially some negative impact on margins. And we've also said that we still expect those returns on sales to be very strong. So that's been consistent and that's really the way we see that developing going forward.","Desi DiPierro - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Yes. And then, in the Cabinets segment. You rolled out some new products in the quarter and getting greater traction with the customers, particularly, the dealer channel. Can you talk about the success of those new products so far?","John G. Sznewajs","Right, Desi. So project benefit. We did launch some new products under the Merillat brand earlier in the third quarter. And I would tell you that since that was launched -- it was really in September, it's tough to tell what kind of traction those are getting, since they're just hitting the dealer showrooms at this point. I think we can probably give you a better update in 2014, when we've had more experience with those products.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Goldberg with UBS.","Susan Maklari - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","It's actually Susan for David. You guys noted that you're definitely seeing some improvement in the repair\/remodel side of things, can you just give us a little more detail on maybe what exactly you're seeing there and what's driving that? Are you having to increase promotions or incentives in any way? And is it that -- you noted it's at a slightly higher price point, and maybe just what you think is sort of encouraging about them?","Timothy Wadhams","Yes, what's encouraging there, Susan, is some increases we saw. We've seen -- we mentioned on the second quarter call that we start to see some trends in terms of pickup that's related to both windows and Cabinets. And I think that as we think about price points, our KraftMaid brand, which is semi-custom, was up low double digits in the quarter. And we also experienced sales in the dealer channel up low double digits. And I think that those 2 facts, from our perspective, certainly, would tend to reinforce and certainly indicate that we're seeing a little bit of movement from a price point standpoint, as well as additional activity in the dealer channel. Both of those would tend to point towards more activity from a remodel standpoint.","Susan Maklari - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then, even as we get into sort of a seasonally slower period in the fourth quarter, do you think that you'll somewhat buck those trends, given that we're sort of in the early days of this and that it's just starting to come back?","Timothy Wadhams","The fourth quarter is seasonally -- usually, a little bit slower. And remodel activity in the fourth quarter, because of the holidays and the time of year, tends to be a little bit lower. Having said that, I don't see anything, as we look out, that would suggest that remodel isn't going to be relatively strong going into the season next year, if you will. And so we're certainly optimistic as we look ahead.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Philip Ng with Jefferies.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","You mentioned October sales were up high-single digits. Is that kind of an indication that demand -- the velocity of the recovery is decelerating a little bit or just too early to call?","Timothy Wadhams","No, I wouldn't say that at all, Phil. In fact, if you recall, last year's October, for us, was up mid-teens. So we had a very, very strong October last year. And we're up high-single digits against that -- or we appear to be. Obviously, we've got a couple more days left in the month, but we look to be up high-single digits. So no, I wouldn't say that by any means.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Got you. And then, on the mix dynamic in your Cabinets business -- I appreciate that you're gaining share on the builders side which, I guess, is a negative mix. But on the flip side, you're seeing a pickup in R&R and the new dealer side. Should that mix dynamic turn positive going forward or how should we be thinking about that dynamic?","Timothy Wadhams","Well, I think, over time, we typically tend to be about 60% R&R, 40% new home in a more normal kind of environment. Obviously, we're not in a normal environment at this point in time. But I would expect that we would see our sales, at least, tilt towards more repair\/remodel activity as time goes on.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay. And just one last question on the paint business. During the quarter, you guys obviously made some investments on promotions for the rollout of some of your new products. That $10 million headwind, should that reverse going into Q4 or should it stay at an elevated level in the short term?","Timothy Wadhams","I wouldn't expect it to be at the $10 million in the fourth quarter. But there could be some incremental promotional-related expense.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Rehaut with JPMorgan.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","First question on the Cabinets, you had, really, a great acceleration of year-over-year top line growth there, and you mentioned that it was across all channels. But I was wondering to get a little bit more granularity, if possible, in terms of the builder, dealer and retail, which -- if you could kind of walk through the magnitude of growth for each and give us any sense of margin impact? It appears that the negative mix by the builder channel maybe had a little bit of a suppressing effect. But which channel is kind of the most profitable? And understanding that right now, I guess, you're still building out your dealer channel as well.","John G. Sznewajs","Mike, it's John. In terms of growth rates by the various channels which, you would expect, did take place in the quarter. So our direct-to-builder was up a little bit better than lagged -- 90-day lag to housing starts. So up high 20s, low 30s percentage. As Tim mentioned, the dealer channel was up double digits percent, as was the home center channels, in addition. So good strength in the cost -- the remodel channels, as Tim kind of alluded to earlier. We really haven't broken down our margin profitability by segment at all, or by channel, I should say. Though, I would point out to you that our KraftMaid product offering, which has a greater opportunity to be upgraded due to additional features and design elements, probably does carry a little bit stronger margin profile than our direct-to-builder offering.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Great. And just going back to the Decorative Architectural, I know there's been a bunch of questions there. But just trying to understand, I think we've talked about this on previous calls in terms of the longer-term margin profile of the business. Historically, it's been plus or minus around 20%. And now you've had a couple of quarters of promotional spend. I remember back in -- a few years ago, where there was 3- or 4-quarter kind of major upgrade, I believe, in Home Depot, where you were putting in a lot of displays. I think they were even computerized, and there was a big investment there and that really did yield a lot of, I would say, longer-term benefit in terms of the relationship. This sound -- it feels a little bit different this quarter and last, where -- what I'm trying to get a sense of is, is the promotional spend here more of just a shorter term, perhaps, even just cost of doing business with Home Depot, where you're trying to drive volume and take advantage of the season? Or are there longer-term benefits in terms of the volume growth that you saw in the last couple of quarters, going back a few years ago when you put in the displays, et cetera, there was more of a longer-term impact there? It feels like this is more of a shorter term seasonal impact, and maybe you could tell me if I'm on to that or is that accurate or fair or how to think about that?","Timothy Wadhams","Yes, I would say that's somewhat inaccurate, Mike. Well, you're right about the timing of the color centers, that was 2003 that we put those in. And those have been upgraded since then. And that was a long-term investment by us. But everything we do basically, is, in large part, driven for the longer term. The penetration of the Pro, for example, that we've worked on over the course of the last couple of 3 or 4 years is certainly longer-term opportunity for us. The move into international. We picked up the Mexican business from Home Depot earlier this year. We talked about that. Those are both efforts that are really driven on the longer haul. As we continue to innovate and bring out products, that cycle continues over time and has been evidenced by our Paint & Primer in One, along with the DECKOVER product, the MARQUEE product. So we continue to be longer-term-focused in that segment. And certainly, we'll continue to look at it that way. We think we've got great opportunity with the Pro. We think we've got opportunities from an international perspective. So from that standpoint, certainly, believe that there's a lot of upside for us over the longer term.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So just -- I appreciate that, Tim, and I guess, just following that, in terms of the increased advertising and promotions, how does that fit into -- do those increased advertising and promotions fit into those Pro and Mexico initiatives or are they there to support some of your more new recent products or how does -- or...","Timothy Wadhams","Actually, all of the above, Mike. And basically, when we're promoting or when Home Depot is promoting, generally speaking, that is to attract people to different opportunities. But we've got a variety of products that, that applies to. So I think, generally speaking, that's pretty much across the board.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Garik Shmois with Longbow Research.","Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC","Question on the Installation division. If the pace of the housing recovery slows, how is that going to impact how you view the business over the next 12 months? Can you -- you mentioned branch openings being planned for next year. Can you flex that up or down, depending on the pace of the housing recovery?","Timothy Wadhams","Yes, absolutely, we can flex that. And it really does not have any bearing if there's a little pause here. Obviously, there was an interest rate spike and a little bit of reaction to that a couple, 3 months ago, but from our perspective, that is a pause or could be a pause. We have not seen any impact on our business necessarily, because of the 90- to 120-day lag. But as we look ahead, we are very confident, very comfortable that we ought to continue to see growth on the new home side. Our sense is 150,000, 200,000 starts a year for the next couple, 3 years on the upside. So I wouldn't necessarily see anything that might transpire here as anything other than temporary.","Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. And then, you mentioned $2 million to $3 million in costs for the ERP implementation in windows. Was most of that in the third quarter? I'm just trying to figure out what the impact was recently?","Timothy Wadhams","Yes, it was a little bit more than half that in the third quarter. There'll be some more expense in the fourth quarter this year. And then, Garik, going forward, for the next couple of years, it'll be $2 million to $3 million each year. And we'll try to give you a sense as to in which quarter that will fall out as we incur the cost.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Wood with Macquarie.","Unknown Analyst","[indiscernible] in for Mike. Just a quick question on Hansgrohe. How much does that still drag in terms of the impact from the new market expansion on Plumbing margins?","Timothy Wadhams","There's very little mix impact from that particular business at this point in time. We do have a little bit of a mix related to some of the new products, the source-and-sell toilet that we have mentioned previously, which has a little bit lower margin. But obviously, a nice return.","Unknown Analyst","Okay. And then just kind of a little higher level, I mean, in the past, you've talked about 13% Plumbing margins, mid-cycle. And you're past that in this quarter. It seems like mix is improving in Hansgrohe. Is there an update you can we give us, maybe, as mix normalizes?","Timothy Wadhams","No, I don't think I would necessarily back away from what we've said. Obviously, we had a very, very good quarter in Plumbing, and we're really proud of that. No question about it. All of our teams did a nice job there. If you look at it year-to-date, we're at about 13.5%, I think, on a year-to-date basis. So I think that guidance for your modeling, going forward, is probably in the right spot. I mean, obviously, we'll work hard to do better than that. But I think that 13-ish is probably pretty -- a pretty good number to use.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","My first question is on Cabinets. Obviously, you've seen a nice rebound in profitability, given the low stepping-off point. You've done a lot of work to restructure the business. From here on out, what are the 2 most important initiatives for you to further improve your margin and profitability in this segment? Or is it really now just you like where you're at, you like your product portfolio and your cost position, you're just waiting on the volume improvement from here? Then, I had a follow-on.","John G. Sznewajs","Now, George, I think as we look at our Cabinet business, I think there's a couple of things that we are focused on here. One is, continue to drive innovation, and that's reflected in the product launches that we have under that Merillat brand that are coming onto market, really starting in the third quarter. That will continue all the way into the first quarter of 2014. And then, some differentiated product based on our dealer channel also looking to improve the customer experience across the organization, as part of our Cabinet offering. So those are critical items. And then on top of that, as you would imagine, always focused on our cost position and trying to get our productivity and efficiencies up. So -- and that's evidenced by the fact that we took out a component plant that I referenced in the prepared remarks. So always looking at our footprint. Obviously, volume is going to help. And -- but we're not waiting just solely for volume to come in order to drive the improvements in this operation.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And in Decorative Arc, and specifically, within paints, you obviously mentioned that gallonage is up low teens, and that's terrific. Is it possible to discuss what the revenue growth was within paints in the quarter? Was it a bit better than the overall gallons because, perhaps, some of the new products have a higher price point or, perhaps, was there a negative mix effect that we should be aware? Is there any kind of color you can give us around that?","Timothy Wadhams","Yes. I don't think there was any significant mix impact, George, in terms of anything that would have been negative. We did talk a little bit about the DECKOVER product, which was launched along with some of the promotional costs to support that. But don't know that we had a negative mix.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So revenue would have grown more than gallonage?","Timothy Wadhams","No, revenue was a little bit below gallon growth. And as you saw, we did have a negative price\/commodity relationship in the segment in that quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Nishu Sood with Deutsche Bank.","Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","In the Cabinets and Installation Services division, you folks had targeted those, I think, mid last year and you've made some nice progress in terms of stabilizing and turning the profitability positive in those divisions. What are you targeting for each of those divisions for longer term margins? So what can we expect as the recovery goes on here?","John G. Sznewajs","Sure, Nishu. As we were -- both -- if you think about the incremental margins or contribution margins of those businesses, they vary a little bit by business. So at the Cabinet business, it really runs at 30% -- a little bit, maybe a little bit north of that as time rolls on. And then, our Installation segment would run at about a 25% incremental margins or so on a kind of a mid-cycle basis. So if you think about those businesses, and depending on what you believe is mid-cycle, definitely, we believe both those businesses can get back to double-digit operating profit margin area, probably a low double-digit margin for the Installation business. Maybe a little bit better than that, maybe low teens for the Cabinet business, depending on how much volume comes back and the form of the volume. Obviously, the more semi-custom offering that comes back, probably, the greater opportunity for enhanced margin.","Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Great. That's very helpful. And the second question I wanted to ask -- a couple of the earlier questions have already referenced this, but I just wanted to revisit it. The soft patch that we've seen in housing and in remodeling as well, some people -- some of your peers have noted some slowdown recently. You mentioned the high-single digits for October did not show -- because of the tough comp, it did not really show any impact from this soft patch or slowdown that some others have noted. So -- but that it may come in the next couple of months. So I just wanted to kind of get the overall takeaway here. Because of the lag between starts and when your revenues show up, is it something that may come up in the next couple of months or have you not seen the slowdown as some of your peers have?","Timothy Wadhams","Well, as we indicated, we haven't, at this point, seen any measurable impact. It's possible that there could be a little bit of impact late this quarter, early next quarter. But again, it gets a little murky, I think, Nishu. With the lag start issue, typically, we run about 90 days. That has been extended in certain cases, with some of the mix of multifamily, for example. Some of the labor constraints. So I think we'll just have to kind of wait and see how that plays through. But again, I would remind folks that we don't see that anything, other than as temporary, if in fact, it does hit us at some point. Our sense is that new home construction -- when you look at the fundamentals, household formation, demographics, et cetera, certainly, we expect that to be strong over the course of the next 2 to 3 years.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dan Oppenheim with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Michael Dahl - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","This is actually Mike Dahl on for Dan. I wanted to ask about thoughts on the balance sheet here. I think you've made some progress and as you noted, there's no real maturities, I guess, until mid-2015 at this point. How are you thinking about free cash flow use, maybe, as it relates to dividend, acquisitions or further debt reduction?","John G. Sznewajs","Sure, Mike. Let me walk you through that. So to your point, we've had great cash flow generation this year so far. Really pleased with the efforts on behalf of everyone on the team. So as we think about our capital allocation priorities, I think they're kind of in this order of priority, right? Obviously, first and foremost, always invest in the business. Whether it's through capital requirements to continue to grow our businesses or to fund innovation or international expansion, we've seen good evidence of the success of all those efforts here in this quarter. After that, I would tell you, in the near term, probably, we'll look to pay down some debt in the next several years. So as we mentioned or you referenced, we've got $500 million coming due in 2015, and $1 billion maturity in '16. And so I think what we'll look to do between that aggregate of $1.5 billion of maturity is, that we'll look to pay down somewhere between $300 million to $500 million of those 2 maturities. We'll just figure out exactly how we'll do that when we're closer to the maturity dates. Then following that, I would look -- I would guide you to think about small tuck-in acquisitions for us. So I do not imagine a sixth or seventh product line for us, but rather, something that we can fold into one of our existing operations. And we've got some great examples of how we've done that over the course of the last several years. One would be, we integrated a small spa business into our Watkins unit in 2011, and had tremendous success growing that business just by pushing that product offering through our distribution network. Similarly, I referenced in my prepared remarks the fact that we've had good success with our composite door acquisition in the U.K. Again, a similar theme there where we've been able to quickly expand that business by offering that product through our existing distribution channel. Then after that, after debt repayment and small acquisitions, then, we would look to do more shareholder-friendly activity, whether it's share repurchases or dividend increases. We'll figure that out as we're in a better position. But for now, those are capital allocation priorities.","Michael Dahl - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","That's very helpful. And then, just as a follow-on. Just given the relative size of the windows business and your desire to kind of expand beyond what, historically, had been the focus. Is that an area of appetite for tuck-in acquisitions as well?","John G. Sznewajs","That business had done a nice job of expanding geographically. They've entered the Texas market recently. They entered Western Canada in the last year, 18 months or so. And so to the extent that there's a complementary tuck-in acquisition that makes sense for the geographic footprint, yes, that would be something we may consider.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Nick Coppola with Thompson Research Group.","Nicholas A. Coppola - Thompson Research Group, LLC","There was an earlier question about growth rates between direct-to-builder, dealer and retailer. But if you were to drill down into just Cabinets, within the Cabinet segment -- I assume there was growth at all channels, but what did the relative growth rates look like?","John G. Sznewajs","Nick, the question is -- was responding to specifically the Cabinet business.","Nicholas A. Coppola - Thompson Research Group, LLC","Okay. So then, I guess, then, the alternate question would be, what did it look like across the entire company?","John G. Sznewajs","Because we've got varying growth rates depending on the segment, I can give you a little bit of guidance and you can see it in the overall segment results. Obviously, new home construction was strong, as evidenced by my commentary on both Cabinets and our Installation business, where our Installation contracting business for residential new construction was up high 20s percent, in line with housing starts lag 90 days. Across a number of our businesses that deal with the dealer networks, so we referenced Cabinetry already, but we experienced a very strong performance to our wholesale customers in Plumbing, as well as our window dealers in our windows segment. Not much -- we saw some increase in our Pro business and paint, but again, it's a relatively small business compared to our very large retail business in paint. Other than that, retail sales were strong, I mean, that's evidenced by the fact that we were up by 9% or so in our paint business, which is our strongest retail-facing business.","Nicholas A. Coppola - Thompson Research Group, LLC","All right. That makes sense. And then, talking about Decorative Architectural. Even adjusting for the $10 million of incremental ad spend that you both have been talking about, you're still not at the typical leverage, and it looks like the balance is that price\/commodity piece. So what are you seeing in price of raw materials? I think there was a previous belief that the worst is behind us for titanium dioxide and propylene, but how should we be thinking about that going forward?","Timothy Wadhams","Yes, TiO2 has been relatively stable. But we have seen a little bit of a tick-up in resins, which affect both paint, as well as the window-related business.","Nicholas A. Coppola - Thompson Research Group, LLC","Okay. And any expectations for raw materials going forward?","Timothy Wadhams","In terms of looking forward -- no, TiO2 has been relatively stable for a while. Obviously, I think there's some signaling from the suppliers that as demand starts to pick up, that we could see a little bit of movement there. But at this point, that hasn't happened yet. But as demand picks up, I think the probability of that happening is pretty high.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sam Darkatsh with Raymond James.","Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","A couple of just fine-tuning questions here. First up, Installation in the quarter, actually, is now tracking housing starts lagged by a quarter, which has not been the case for a number of reasons in the past. And I also noticed that Owens Corning had an 8% installation growth, and yours is considerably higher at nearly 20%. Should we expect now that your Installation business should be tracking starts lagged by a quarter or was there some sort of a one-off impetus to growth in this quarter, perhaps, that might not be -- should not be sustained?","John G. Sznewajs","Sam, as I take a look at -- and we've been trying to break this out every quarter for the last several quarters. Our Installation sales to residential new construction have pretty much, for the last several quarters, mirrored housing starts lagged 90 days now. I'd tell you, well, we are seeing a little bit differently in the marketplace. It seems like lag times for the big builders are getting back to a more normalized rate than they've been historically. Where we're still seeing expanded or lengthier lead times is with the regional or custom builders. Those seem to be running kind of in the 5-, 6-month lag time as opposed to the 90-day lag time.","Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then my last question, a follow-up regarding your Plumbing margin commentary, Tim, where you mentioned that 13% might be a good number to assume for the year. That suggests a fairly significant stepdown sequentially.","Timothy Wadhams","No, I didn't say for the year, Sam. I think the question was going forward over the longer term. I did not -- that was not a suggestion for the full year.","Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. So then, how -- if you're doing a 15% now, how sustainable is that near term?","Timothy Wadhams","We don't generally predict margins, Sam. But obviously, this year has been a good year in Plumbing. I think what we're really seeing is the benefit from some of the growth initiative spend that hit margins a little bit over the course of the last couple of years. So in terms of looking ahead, we continue to be pretty optimistic about the way returns will flow coming forward.","Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Are there any seasonal aspects to the Plumbing margins at all, Q3 over Q4?","Timothy Wadhams","Well, there are seasonal issues that affect the top line. And usually, the Q4, Q1 timeframe for us, tends to be a little bit slower.","Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","And last question, if I could. Could you remind us what the year-over-year comparisons are in November and December versus what -- the difficult comparison that you saw in October?","John G. Sznewajs","Well -- Sam, I don't have the...","Timothy Wadhams","We were mid-single digits in both November and December last year, Sam.","Operator","Your last question comes from the line of Stephen Kim with Barclays.","Stephen S. Kim - Barclays Capital, Research Division","This is Steve Kim from Barclays. Most of my questions have been answered, but I guess my first question relates to just fine-tuning on the Cabinet side. We talked about the fact -- or you talked about the fact that there were about $2 million of headwind from the Chinese plywood issue. You talked about the fact that the builder market was a benefit to you this quarter, outstripping the growth because it was so strong in the dealer. I guess I'm curious as to what we can look forward to in the fourth quarter because the pricing action that you referenced, it sounds like it's not coming in until the sort of the end of the fourth quarter. The plywood tariff sounds like it really hit in the end of the third quarter. So we got a little bit of a gap here, where we could float [ph] them. I'm curious as to how we should be thinking about the cost dynamics in Cabinets relative to what we saw -- that $2 million we saw in the third quarter, what we can -- you think we can -- might be able to see or we should be thinking about in the fourth quarter?","John G. Sznewajs","Yes, Stephen, I think your commentary is pretty good, that there will be little bit of a lag in the fourth quarter as a result of pricing not going until late in the quarter.","Stephen S. Kim - Barclays Capital, Research Division","So then sort of following up on that, I guess, I just want to make sure we are sort of modeling things correctly. I mean, I totally hear you about both the hiccup in builder starts being a temporary phenomenon. I agree with that. I definitely understand the longer-term focus of the business and the trajectory being solid -- solidly upward. At the same time, I just want to make sure that if there's any hiccups along the way like in fourth quarter, that we are properly thinking about them. So you had an extremely strong incremental margin in the third quarter here in Cabinets. Would it be your expectation that the incremental margin would likely sort of come back down to a sort of more sustainable, more normal type level in 4Q in Cabinets? And then, just, if I could touch on -- tack onto that, are there any other unusual items that we should be thinking about in fourth quarter like any timing of promotional issues that you know about or tax issues or shipping days? I'm just trying to think -- making sure that there's nothing sort of on the sidelines that we're not thinking about that we should be.","John G. Sznewajs","Yes, Stephen, in terms of -- I think you had a number of questions embedded in there. But I -- trying to get I think the general theme of your commentary. Incremental margins in the third quarter were very strong. Though, we experience very strong incremental margins in this segment all year long. So I feel pretty good about the incremental margins that the team is delivering in Cabinetry. Secondly, you kind of had a series of comments or questions with respect to the fourth quarter, on how things look. I think the big question mark we have there is the remodeling. If -- to the extent that remodeling continues the trends that we've seen, that is favorable to our incremental margins and our margin profile going forward. So to the extent we continue to show strength in remodeling, could that help offset some of the negative impact of the Chinese tariff in the fourth quarter? Yes, that could be the case.","Timothy Wadhams","I think -- I would think about that, Steve, is that whatever you think third quarter looks like, if you use an approximate 30% incremental margin across the company, that probably is going to get you pretty close to whatever drop we'll have for our profitability.","And Tiffany, we're winding up here, but I want to thank everybody for their participation today. And have a good rest of the day. Thank you.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."],"13831":["Masco Corp.

Allman - Masco Corp.","Thank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone.","Turning to slide four, I'm pleased with our performance in the third quarter of 2016. We continue to successfully execute our strategic initiatives to grow both our top and bottom lines as evidenced by the fact that this quarter is our 20th consecutive quarter of both top and bottom line growth. Our end markets, both in North America and internationally, remain strong, and we continue to leverage this underlying market strength by introducing new products, improving our sales mix, penetrating new markets and gaining share with our industry leading brands.","For the third quarter, our top line increased by 2%, 3% in local currency. Our adjusted operating margin increased 70 basis points to 14.7%, reflecting our portfolio's strong operating leverage and a favorable price commodity environment. Our adjusted earnings per share grew 21% to $0.41 per share.","Notably, this adjusted operating margin and adjusted earnings per share includes the negative impact of a $21 million increase to our warranty reserve in our Windows and Other Specialty Products segment. John will provide you with more details about this charge in his commentary.","Turning to our segments, I would like to provide you with some additional insight into the drivers behind each of our segments' performance. Our Plumbing businesses continued their outstanding performance by growing revenue 6% in local currency, led again by the continued strength of our Delta, Hansgrohe and Watkins businesses.","In early October, Delta was once again honored by the Environmental Protection Agency, earning the EPA WaterSense Sustained Excellence Award for 2016. This is the second consecutive year Delta has won this award, an award which recognizes Delta's efforts to promote water efficiency through its innovative, water-efficient products, such as Touch2O faucets and H2Okinetic shower heads. Delta was also honored as the Best Overall Vendor in E-Commerce and as the Best Overall Plumbing Vendor in the showroom and builder segment by Ferguson Enterprises, our nation's largest plumbing wholesaler. Congratulations to the entire Delta team for its ability to bring innovative, environmentally friendly products to the market and for its ability to successfully focus, understand and deliver on the needs of its customers.","Moving on to our Decorative Architectural segment, we once again delivered a solid quarter. Our Pro Paint initiative with The Home Depot continued to drive double-digit sales growth in the quarter. And BEHR MARQUEE, our highest price point DIY product, continued to post exceptional year-over-year comps.","During the quarter, to further accelerate our Pro business, we began staffing an additional 100 Pro Hub stores. This will bring our total store count to over 200 by year-end. We're excited by the results of the initial Hub store investment and we believe that these additional Hub stores will provide us, along with our partner, The Home Depot, with an exceptional foundation to continue penetrating the pro paint market.","In our Cabinets business, we continue to execute against our plan to optimize our sales mix by exiting certain low-margin direct-to-builder business. Our retail cabinet business was particularly strong this quarter, as we partnered with our customers to offer highly effective, exclusive promotions for KraftMaid, the most recognized brand in the industry. Our brand recognition, coupled with these promotions, drove foot traffic into their stores and demand for our products.","Additionally, based on the success of our KraftMaid Momentum product at Lowe's, we are expanding the product offering to an additional 250 stores, taking the total store count to 500 stores across the United States. KraftMaid Momentum is a product line that extends the KraftMaid brand into the value semi-custom price point. This further roll-out is a testament to our focus on the customer, our product development capability, and our efforts to gain greater share of wallet at retail.","Our Cabinetry team also completed significant product launches for both the KraftMaid and Quality brands during the quarter. These launches included trend forward finishes to capitalize on the growing demand for gray paints, new door styles, decorative accessories and functional SKUs.","Moving to Windows and Other Specialty Products, our sales grew by 2%, excluding the effect of foreign currency. As we discussed last quarter, we continue to work through some operational issues in our Milgard window business unit related to labor turnover and other inefficiencies. The organization and I are keenly focused on fixing these issues. We've reorganized Milgard's management team, brought in top operational resources from across the company and, together with the Milgard team, are actively working through these issues. It's going to take some time, but I'm confident that we have the appropriate focus and urgency.","While we currently have some challenges in our Windows segment, overall I'm pleased with our third quarter performance and the continued execution of our long-term strategies. Our Plumbing businesses continue to produce outstanding top and bottom line results. Our Pro Paint initiative continues to post double-digit growth as we further penetrate this market segment and gain share. And our Cabinet business has improved its year-to-date profitability by approximately $50 million through cost reductions, improved mix and strong growth in the retail and dealer channels. Our results are indicative of the solid execution of our strategies.","Additionally, we took further action in the quarter to create shareholder value through our capital allocation strategy. We repurchased 2.3 million shares, bringing our total shares repurchased to 31 million against our 50 million share repurchase authorization. And we increased our annual dividend by $0.02 per share to $0.40 annually. This is the third year in a row that we have increased our dividend.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to John, who will go over our operational and financial performance in detail. John?","John G. Sznewajs - Masco Corp.","Thank you, Keith, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to slide six. As Dave mentioned, most of my comments will focus on adjusted performance, excluding the impact of rationalization and other one-time charges.","Our focused execution continued as we delivered top and bottom line growth in North America and internationally. As Keith mentioned, the third quarter of 2016 was our 20th consecutive quarter of year-over-year sales and operating profit growth. Sales increased 2% for the quarter and 3% in local currencies. Foreign currency translation negatively impacted our sales in the quarter by approximately $17 million, principally due to a weaker pound compared to the U.S. dollar. North American sales were up 2% in the quarter.","We continue to experience strong demand for our repair and remodeling products in all channels of distribution and across the price continuum, as consumers are trading up to our better and best product offerings. As a reminder, repair and remodel activity accounts for approximately 83% of our total sales.","International sales increased 6% in local currency in the quarter, driven by the continued strength in our international plumbing and window businesses. Gross margins expanded approximately 100 basis points compared to the third quarter of last year to 32.9%. This includes the negative effect of Milgard's warranty adjustment.","Our SG&A as a percent of sales increased this quarter by 40 basis points due to the strategic investment in several of our businesses in order to drive top and bottom line growth. Our teams continue to be focused on cost control and productivity improvement.","We delivered strong bottom-line performance once again, as operating income increased 7% to $275 million, with operating margins expanding 70 basis points to 14.7%. Our EPS in the quarter was $0.41, an improvement of $0.07 or 21% compared to the third quarter of last year. EPS was unfavorably impacted by approximately $0.04 due to the increase in Milgard's warranty reserves.","Turning to slide seven, our Plumbing segment delivered another strong quarter of growth, driven by terrific performance at Delta, Hansgrohe and Watkins. Segment sales increased 6%, excluding the impact of currency, driven by growth in our faucets, showers and spas. Foreign currency translation negatively impacted this segment's sales by approximately $9 million in the quarter.","Our North American sales grew 6% in the third quarter, as we experienced strong consumer-driven demand for our innovative brands with both our wholesale and large retail customers. Our spa business is outperforming the competition, as Watkins continues to leverage its strong dealer network, innovative new products and industry leading brands.","Our international plumbing sales increased 7% in local currency. We experienced sales growth around the globe, with particular strength in Asia and Northern Europe. Additionally, our sales mix continues to improve, as our premium price point Axor brand grew double digits this quarter.","Operating profit for the segment increased 30% in the quarter, driven by incremental volume and a favorable price commodity relationship. This segment also benefited from a positive year-over-year commodity hedge impact of approximately $10 million. This benefit was partially offset by approximately $5 million of incremental advertising and display expense in support of new product introductions, as we previously discussed in our second quarter earnings call.","Turning to slide eight, the Decorative Architectural segment grew 2%, as we continued to experience strong growth across our BEHR PRO business and solid performance of our BEHR MARQUEE interior product. This growth was partially offset by the timing and amount of incremental promotional expense that we had previously discussed on our second quarter earnings call.","Liberty Hardware also contributed to the top and bottom line growth. Operating profit increased 9% in the third quarter, principally due to operating leverage on a higher volume. As we mentioned on the second quarter call, we intend to invest $30 million in promotion and advertising in the second half of 2016 to grow this business. In the third quarter, we incurred approximately $10 million of this promotion and advertising expense, and we expect to incur an additional $15 million to $20 million of investment in the fourth quarter, which includes $5 million of reset cost for Liberty's shower door program win at The Home Depot.","Turning to slide nine, we continue to be pleased with our Cabinet segment performance. Segment sales declined 6% due to the deliberate exits of certain lower-margin business within the builder direct channel in the United States and at select low-margin accounts in our UK Cabinet business. These actions in aggregate reduced segment sales by approximately $25 million. This decline was partially offset by KraftMaid's strong performance in the retail channel, resulting in double-digit growth and year-over-year share gains.","In the dealer channel, we drove single-digit growth through increased volume and favorable mix, as both our KraftMaid and Merillat offerings continue to resonate with our dealer base and consumers. Segment profitability in the third quarter improved 5% over 2015, driven by our continued execution of cost savings initiatives as well as improved mix, as we reduced our exposure to lower-margin builder direct business, continue to grow our higher price point semi-custom KraftMaid offerings.","As we mentioned on the second quarter call, this growth was partially offset by approximately $5 million of incremental spend, which included expenses associated with our new product launches in the retail and dealer channels under the KraftMaid and Quality brands. We expect to incur an additional $5 million of product launch cost in the fourth quarter. I'm pleased to report these new products are driving strong foot traffic at our dealer customers and favorable end consumer reaction.","For the fourth quarter, we continue to believe the revenue impact of our decision to exit select builder direct business in our kitchen countertop business will negatively impact sales by between $15 million and $20 million. These impacts will continue through the first quarter of 2017.","Turning to slide 10, our Windows segment sales increased 2% in local currency, driven by growth in Milgard, our leading Western U.S. window business. Milgard's continued growth was driven by a positive mix shift toward our premium window and door product lines and favorable pricing. Excluding the negative impact of a stronger U.S. dollar, our European Windows sales increased 2%, driven by volume and share gains. Foreign currency translation negatively impacted this segment's sales by approximately $8 million in the quarter. The segment's operating profit decline was primarily due to the additional warranty reserve of approximately $21 million at our Milgard business, $6 million of incremental labor costs and inefficiencies and ERP expenses of approximately $3 million.","Let's go into more detail on the warranty adjustment and ERP expenses. You may recall Milgard recorded a $10 million warranty adjustment in the second quarter. During Q2, we initiated an analysis based on enhanced historical warranty claims data that became available in the quarter and, in accordance with GAAP, booked the $10 million adjustment. In the third quarter, we completed our analysis and we recorded an additional $21 million adjustment which was reviewed by multiple third parties.","Moving to ERP, as we had previously disclosed, we anticipated approximately $3 million of expenses per quarter related to ERP into 2017. We recently made the decision to deliberately slow down the roll-out of ERP, so that we could implement the system during seasonally slower periods. This decision will take the implementation through 2019. We are doing this to protect the customer and minimize disruption to the business.","And turning to slide 11, we ended the quarter with about $1.2 billion of balance sheet liquidity and delivered another strong quarter of working capital performance. Working capital as a percent of sales improved 20 basis points versus the prior year to 12.9%. As we approach the end of 2016, we are on track to generate close to $500 million of free cash flow again this year. We also continued our initiatives to create shareholder value. During the third quarter, we repurchased 2.3 million shares valued at approximately $78 million. Finally, we increased our annual dividend by $0.02 per share to $0.40 per common share.","And with that, I'll now turn the call back over to Keith.","Keith J. Allman - Masco Corp.","Thank you, John.","I'm pleased with our team's strong execution as we continue to drive for even better results. The fundamental demand drivers of our business continue to be positive. And going forward, we remain committed to leveraging these strong, long-term demand drivers by investing behind our brands for growth; by developing innovative, award-winning products to ensure we maintain our must-have position with our customers; by focusing on operational excellence through our continued deployment of the Masco operating system; and finally, by balancing our capital allocation between investing for growth, acquisitions with the right strategic fit and returns; and returning cash to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends.","We remain confident that we will achieve our 2017 earnings per share target of $1.80 that we said at our Investor Day in 2015. Our operational execution, coupled with our strengthened balance sheet, strong liquidity position and substantial free cash flow, provides us with multiple levers to continue to drive shareholder value.","Before we go to Q&A, I'd like to ask that we stick to the one-person, one-question guideline with a follow-up on that question if needed. Last quarter, we had nine people ask 25 questions, and I know that if we follow the guideline, it will help all you do your job the best that you can.","Thank you. And with that, I'll open the call up for questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And your first question comes from the line of Susan Maklari from UBS. Your line is open.","Susan Marie Maklari - UBS Securities LLC","Good morning.","Keith J. Allman - Masco Corp.","Morning, Susan.","Susan Marie Maklari - UBS Securities LLC","First off, just digging a little bit deeper into the Windows segment. I know you talked about some of the steps that you're taking there to kind of turn things around, but can you just talk to sort of incremental goals or how we should expect this progress to sort of come together as we look forward?","Keith J. Allman - Masco Corp.","As we've talked about, there are really three distinct issues that we are dealing with in Milgard. First, is the warranty accrual increase. We put that analysis \u2013 we completed the analysis. That's behind us.","Second, as you know, we are implementing an ERP system. We completed the first plant successfully. We used those learnings and experience, and our plan is now to methodically roll out our systems across all the other plants, but to do it in a way that avoids the peak periods, which is really Q2 and Q3. So we eliminated those quarters from our implementation plan and we're only going to be implementing ERP systems in the slow periods. That protects our customer. It's the right thing to do.","And thirdly, due to a combination of strong demand for our products, particularly around painted vinyl and fiberglass, coupled with a tight labor market in the Northwest that we have, we're dealing with some labor efficiencies. We've mobilized our best talent and operational teams. We have the Senior Vice President of Operations from Delta Faucet working with the Milgard team. We have the Masco Operating System Group working with the team. And together, I'm pleased with the initial success that we have. So we're turning it around. So those are three distinct issues that we're dealing with.","In terms, Susan, of your specific question going forward, I think our guidance that we talked about in terms of long-term growth is going to be a little dampened due to some of the short-term issues that we're facing. When you think about the long-term margins of this business, we haven't changed our point of view on that and we're seeing that right in that 10% to 13% range. So long term, nothing has changed. We're dealing with some short-term issues and we're making progress.","Susan Marie Maklari - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. That's very helpful. Thank you. And then, just turning to paint for a minute, you noted that you are expanding into your Pro Hub stores there. How should we think about that expansion coming together as we look to 2017 and perhaps the top line and the margin implications there?","Keith J. Allman - Masco Corp.","Well, we've talked about the incremental investment. John, maybe you can hit on that specifically.","John G. Sznewajs - Masco Corp.","Yeah, Susan, we put in the additional 100 Hub stores earlier this year and we saw very good response. And this is in an effort to attract pro paint contractors to The Home Depot stores. And so, we saw nice comp store growth for our Pro products where we had Hub store employees.","And so, what we're hoping for, as we go into 2017, is these 100 new Pro Hub store reps get into The Home Depot stores that will see additional comp store growth in attraction of the pro contractor in The Home Depot store. So we're excited about the prospect for these next 100 employees.","Susan Marie Maklari - UBS Securities LLC","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Dennis McGill with Zelman & Associates. Your line is open.","Dennis Patrick McGill - Zelman & Associates","Good morning. Thank you. Just turning to Cabinets, can you maybe elaborate a little bit more on the sales trends you're seeing across channels? I think you said double digit in the dealer channel, but I just wanted to make sure that was across the business, across brands. And then, I didn't catch what you said was the performance in the home center channel. And then, the third piece on the builder exits, it seemed like there was more of an impact this quarter, maybe more of an impact carrying forward, so I just want to understand if that's more of an impact from the walks that you already had or if there was incremental business that you walked away from. So all together on the sales side.","John G. Sznewajs - Masco Corp.","Yeah, Dennis, I'll start off and maybe Keith can supplement. So just to be clear, so our retail home center business was up low double digits in the quarter, and our dealer sales were up single digits in the quarter. So, to your comment about the decline in revenue due to the exit of the business, that's right.","And you may recall that we started this in the third quarter of last year, but you may also recall that on our first quarter conference call, we announced that we had chosen to exit our kitchen countertop business as well as some other business on the Eastern Seaboard. And so, as a result, that has elevated some of the exits that we've seen over the course of the last couple quarters. And so, I think the third quarter and the fourth quarter will be the biggest part and it'll start to decline as we get into the first quarter of next year. So feel pretty comfortable about how the team is positioning the revenue.","Keith, I don't know if you have anything to add.","Keith J. Allman - Masco Corp.","Real good quarter, Dennis, in the retail channel. The KraftMaid brand, as you know, is the most recognized brand in the industry in R&R and that's really playing well. So, good traction there.","On the dealer side, we talked about the single-digit growth that we're seeing. We've got some really nice new product introductions that we're launching, both in KraftMaid and our Quality brands, and the foot traffic that we're seeing in that dealer channel, broadly speaking, is really solid. In fact, we're seeing that pick up a little bit as we look across the \u2013 really across the entire country. So, good foot traffic, good product introductions that are helping to drive that, and we're focused on dealer growth.","Dennis Patrick McGill - Zelman & Associates","And the impact on the expense side of the promotions at the home center side -- is that the $5 million that you mentioned, John, incrementally, or is there more to it?","John G. Sznewajs - Masco Corp.","No, no, Dennis. It has to do with display centers and the like as we launch the new products. So, that's exactly what that is. And that's what we're going to incur, because as you might expect, when you're dealing with dealers, it takes some time before \u2013 some people aren't ready to launch the new products as soon as they come to market.","Dennis Patrick McGill - Zelman & Associates","Was the promotion an impact on the expense line, then, I guess is ultimately the...","John G. Sznewajs - Masco Corp.","The promotion would be an expense, Dennis, in the third quarter, but to a relatively small degree. A lot of the promotions were toward the tail end of the quarter.","Dennis Patrick McGill - Zelman & Associates","Okay.","Keith J. Allman - Masco Corp.","The big expense is for our new launches. We've launched new colors that we talked about in some of the prepared remarks. We've got, I think, four new door styles in KraftMaid, we have new SKUs for KraftMaid, and then a significant launch in our Quality offering. So that's the primary driver of the incremental expense.","Dennis Patrick McGill - Zelman & Associates","Thank you, guys.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Keith Hughes with SunTrust. Your line is open.","Keith Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thank you. Just digging in the Cabinet margins a little more. And even when we exclude the $5 million launch cost, it's not quite some of the margins we've seen the last couple quarters. Can you just talk about within the good sales you saw at retail and at the dealer channel, was there any kind of negative mix within there? And the new launches where the $5 million comes from, what part of the cabinet strata price are those coming in at?","John G. Sznewajs - Masco Corp.","So, Keith, to answer your second question first, the launches are both in KraftMaid as well as Quality. So really kind of both ends of the price spectrum for us, KraftMaid being our premium price point offering and Quality being our lower price point or opening price point offering. So that's it.","With respect to the margins, again, I hope you guys recall, everyone on the call recalls the fact that we said in our second quarter call that the margins that we posted there were unusually high because we really had a very clean quarter with no unusual expenses or some typical investment that we may have in advertising catalogs and displays, things like that. So it was a very light quarter for all that type of activity in the second quarter. So that was more of the anomaly.","So the way I look at it, Keith, is if you factor out the $5 million of expense, and with $25 million of business that we walked away from, while it was indeed low margin, it wasn't zero margin, and so there was some loss of profit on the business that we did walk away from. So net-net, as you look into that \u2013 as I look at it, it looks like to me about a 10% quarter to me for the Cabinet segment.","Keith Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Ken Zener with KeyBanc. Your line is open.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Good morning, gentlemen.","John G. Sznewajs - Masco Corp.","Morning.","Keith J. Allman - Masco Corp.","Morning, Ken.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Obviously very good execution in Plumbing, and that business tends to be very resilient because of the large installed base, as you guys have highlighted, with the low peak to trough in the past cycles, I think about 15%. Those very strong margins that you guys did here -- I know we had that $10 million commodity headwind \u2013 or tailwind, excuse me. Would that be the kind of a difference? I'm just trying to think about the almost 20% number versus what is now an upwardly revised high teens for the business over kind of a three-year basis. Does your growth, not only in Delta, which you're doing very well in, but I mean your vitreous china and these types of things -- how should we think about the steadiness, I guess, of the business quarter-to-quarter? I mean, could it be varying $10 million to $15 million from commodity but, otherwise, you're really in these high teens which, to me, means 17% to 19%?","Keith J. Allman - Masco Corp.","Yeah, we're seeing strong, steady growth across both retail as well as wholesale, and we're seeing steady growth in our United States business as well as our international business. So this is one of the most steady businesses that we have, and you hit it right on the head with regards to the strong repair and remodel component of this business that tends to level it out in terms of peak to trough. We've got strong growth, as I said.","And the commodity environment, when we think about it, we've got some puts and takes, but generally speaking, we see favorable commodity environment with a little bit of pressure coming on the zinc side, but that's offset a little bit from the favorability that we're seeing in copper.","So when we look at the nature of the improvements that we've made over the years with regard to targeted share gain and specific micro-segments, we look at the nature of the cost outset we've been able to drive with the Masco operating system and, really, the quality of the teams, as I mentioned last quarter, we feel pretty good about the stability of this business and, hence, our confidence in raising the margin targets.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Megan McGrath with MKM Partners. Your line is open.","Megan McGrath - MKM Partners LLC","Good morning. Thanks. Just a big picture question here. I think when I initially saw the top-line numbers this morning, I thought maybe, overall, we hadn't maybe seen a little bit of a deceleration in the repair and remodel expenses or spending by consumers, but there's obviously a lot running through your top lines and onetime stuff. So in general, it sounds like you're feeling pretty comfortable with consumer spending in repair\/remodel. Do you think we saw a little bit of a slowdown in 3Q, or do you feel like it was steady in the quarter?","Keith J. Allman - Masco Corp.","Well, I think the consistent thing about this recover, Megan, is that there has been some choppiness. We'll see a couple of quarters of pretty heated growth and then a little bit more muted growth. So, yeah, there was a little bit of choppiness here, but fundamentally, the demand drivers and the foot traffic that we're seeing, particularly in repair and remodeling which is over 80% of our business, are strong. Home prices continue to appreciate. Household formations continue to increase, and the demographics of the millennials as they go on at an average age from, say, 25 to 29 or 30, that's going to bode well for new household formations. Existing homes sales rebounded nicely. They're up to, I think, close to $5.5 million. And the affordability is still very favorable.","So we're not only seeing good fundamentals and good traffic, but we're continuing to see good moves in terms of our mix. So our higher price point products like our high-end Delta, our Brizo brand, our Axor brand, our spa business, things like that, and our Cabinet business, which is a big ticket item, so we're seeing good positive mix.","But we're also seeing good growth down in our entry-level products, which dampens down the mix benefit a bit, admittedly, but I think it \u2013 fundamentally, it's a good sign for the nature of the recovery, when you're seeing that kind of growth, both in the, call it, the household formation stage and the opening price point as well as the mix up and the higher mix. So, yeah, good foot traffic in our dealer base, good retail foot traffic. We feel good about the overall macros.","Megan McGrath - MKM Partners LLC","Okay, thanks. And then specifically on the paint market, I apologize if I missed this, but did you give gallon growth in the quarter?","John G. Sznewajs - Masco Corp.","We did not give gallon growth in the quarter. I think it was up low single digits in the quarter.","Megan McGrath - MKM Partners LLC","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Stephen Kim with Evercore. Your line is open.","Stephen S. Kim - Evercore ISI","Yeah, thanks very much, guys, strong quarter. First question, in Decorative Architecture, I think that you indicated that the investment was $10 million, not $25 million in this quarter, and you thought maybe another $10 million to $15 million in 4Q. So question on that, is there going to be spillover into 1Q next year? And if so, could you quantify it? And was the shower door win already anticipated in your overall $30 million guide that you gave last quarter?","John G. Sznewajs - Masco Corp.","Yes, Stephen, it's John. Yeah, it \u2013 $10 million versus the greater spend in the fourth quarter is just a timing issue as to when some of these expenses are going to hit. And yes, the Liberty shower door win, we mentioned that on the second quarter call that we'd won that program that we'd be rolling it out in the fourth quarter. So that was contemplated as part of our $30 million aggregate number.","Keith J. Allman - Masco Corp.","Stephen, to be clear on the numbers, in the third quarter, we spent approximately $10 million, and then we're anticipating spending in at $15 million to $20 million range in the fourth quarter, and that does include the Liberty launch.","Stephen S. Kim - Evercore ISI","Oh, $15 million to $20 million, okay. Thank you for that clarification. That's great. All right. And then second question relates \u2013 it's a follow-up to the Cabinet business. If I think about what you said last quarter about what dealer was up and in stock \u2013 sorry, retail. It sort of suggests that the rest of that business is down very dramatically year-over-year. And again, your numbers weren't terribly specific this time on dealer and retail, but it still seems \u2013 I'm coming up with numbers probably approaching 40% down year-over-year. And I know there's a lot of things you're doing, the UK business, et cetera. But maybe you could talk a little bit about your vision for the portions of your business that are not the retail and dealer that would explain what's going on there in terms of big top-line reduction.","Keith J. Allman - Masco Corp.","Yeah, I think the big driver there, of course, is the builder direct exit, where we've exited approximately $25 million in the third quarter and probably will exit in the range of $15 million in the fourth quarter, and looking forward into Q1 of 2017, in that $10 million to $15 million range in there. So the big drag on our top line, clearly, is our decision to exit specific portions of this builder direct business, where it's just not good business for us and there's a better supplier for some of these specific builders. So that's the main driver there.","In terms of our overall...","Stephen S. Kim - Evercore ISI","Well, yeah...","Keith J. Allman - Masco Corp.","Go ahead.","Stephen S. Kim - Evercore ISI","Well, yeah, I know, you've been very clear about that. I guess I was talking about what else is in that segment. (38:09)","Keith J. Allman - Masco Corp.","Yeah, our focus is on growth, and we've had some significant growth in our retail business. That's a very strong segment for us. Beginning with KraftMaid, we've addressed some of our issues in that brand first, and we're growing very nicely in the dealer channel with KraftMaid. We've launched significant new product introductions with very good execution and outstanding response from the dealer base in our opening price point brand, Quality brand. So that growth hasn't been as fast as we'd like it to be, but it's improving. And this new product launch is going to help. And of course, Merillat, we're continuing to drive growth through those dealers.","So in terms of your overall question with regards to the plan for this business, it's to drive growth. Now, I talked a couple calls ago about pivoting more towards a focus of growth, and we're doing that. We're seeing some good results.","In the UK, it's a little bit of a mixed bag, exiting some unprofitable business and also growing in some other segments over there. But fundamentally, for us, it's about North America driving retail and dealer growth.","Stephen S. Kim - Evercore ISI","Got it. Okay, that's very clear. Thanks very much.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Bob Wetenhall with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Good morning. It sounds like you guys had a lot of Kaizen (39:32) moments this quarter.","Keith J. Allman - Masco Corp.","Morning, Bob.","Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Just wanted to ask, and maybe off of Ken's question about your excitement around Plumbing, saying it's great in retail and wholesale and it's doing well domestically and international. I've never heard you guys this excited in terms of tone about the macro. And we were actually concerned about choppiness going into the third quarter maybe due to the election. Is your kind of view, and maybe I'm not really talking about the quarter but more broad minded, where do you think the consumer is? And I'm trying to get a handle on how you're reading kind of North American R&R going into 2017 and what your thoughts are in Europe with Brexit.","Keith J. Allman - Masco Corp.","I think in terms of big box traffic and dealer traffic, and when I think about dealer, it's a combination of our spa dealers that I'm close with and I have a lot of contact with and our plumbing wholesale dealers. And when you \u2013 and cabinets. I spent some time out in Boston and New York this past quarter with some dealers out there in plumbing, and they talked about very robust foot traffic. And while there was a little bit of choppiness earlier in the quarter, they're talking about how it's picked up and they feel good about it. Spent some time in the Midwest with cabinet dealers; same story. Just in general, Bob, good foot traffic and smiles on their faces, not only for our new launches, but also in general how the business was going. I was at a meeting with 15 or 20 CEOs of building builders, big builders, and they were all robust about how the overall builder market was going.","So I wouldn't say I'm any more robust about the macros than I've been in the past. We've liked where they've been and we think that our brands and our price points and our channel penetration is positioned to take advantage of it. So, yeah, fundamentally, my view really hasn't changed. It's good macros.","John G. Sznewajs - Masco Corp.","And, Bob, I guess with respect to the other part of your question, we're seeing surprising strength compared to some of the headlines that are coming out of Europe, at least within our business. We've had very good performance in Northern Europe \u2013 Central and Northern Europe and as well as Asia with Hansgrohe. And then, our smaller businesses that are in the UK, even since the Brexit decision, we've seen very good growth there. Now, we've seen some choppiness in the end markets, but our companies are performing exceptionally well there. So, we're pleased with the demand that we're seeing out of the UK at the moment.","Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC","That's great news. You guys are blowing and going. John, I think you spent around $65 million to $70 million on share buybacks. You guys got a real cash hoard close to $1 billion sitting on the balance sheet. I guess it's a jump-off for either Keith or John. In addition to the buyback activity, how do you see M&A playing a role? And if you don't find anything you want to buy just because valuations look a little rich in the public market and perhaps the private market, what do you want to do with the money? Thanks and good luck.","John G. Sznewajs - Masco Corp.","Sure, Bob. I think we're going to continue our disciplined capital allocation program. Obviously, number one is always to reinvest in the business. And as you I think all know, our business is relatively capital light with about 2% of sales going into CapEx on an annual basis.","And, Bob, to your point, and then the next thing we have to balance is share repurchases and M&A, and I'm pleased to tell you that we are looking at M&A opportunities, filling our pipeline. Our pipeline is robust, which is good.","To your also point, the valuations are rich at the moment, but we're all looking at acquisitions that have the right strategic fit and the right returns, and so that's going to be a discipline that we instill around our M&A program. And to the extent the valuations are too frothy, will we look to buy back more stock? Yes. I think that's a balancing act that we have to call on a regular basis depending on how we see the markets develop.","And then, periodically, we will continue to reevaluate our dividends as we talked \u2013 both Keith and I talked about on the call, we increased the dividend for the third year in a row here in the fourth quarter.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Stephen East with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Stephen East - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you. Good morning, guys. One last question on the cabinets. As you look at 2017, John, maybe you could give us the builder exit impact, what the actual year-over-year impact will be as you walked away from all of these different pieces, and do you have any incremental program launches that we should be factoring into our estimates there?","John G. Sznewajs - Masco Corp.","So, Stephen, if I understand your question right, the full year-over-year impact of sales loss in a dollar perspective is, I think, roughly $60 million here in 2016 all in between all four quarters, with the roughly $15 million to $20 million coming in the fourth quarter, and then another $10 million to $15 million in the first quarter of 2017. Then after that, it should really tail off pretty significantly because we made the decision to start exiting the last portion of business in the first quarter of 2016. So really, we should anniversary that effect in the first quarter. So we feel pretty good about that.","And in terms of product launches, our (45:26) team constantly working on new products and working with our customers to launch products? Absolutely. Is there anything specifically we can tee up and talk about at the moment? Nothing at the moment that we feel comfortable sharing.","Stephen East - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Fair enough. And then, if you look at BEHR paint on the aisles of Home Depot, it's definitely being advertised as new low price for some on the MARQUEE, some on the PRO, and it's also happening to your competitor a little bit as well. But trying to understand, is that just part of this promo that you have been discussing or is that a new permanent price? And just if you could help us out, what type of \u2013 if it's a permanent, what type of raw material impact you would have \u2013 or a margin impact you would have? And then, raw materials in this space, the TiO2 and oil derived, what are you seeing?","Keith J. Allman - Masco Corp.","Yeah, on the promotional side, Stephen \u2013 I'll take that. I think there was a few questions in there on commodities and promotion. I'll hit the promo side first. We did see an uptick \u2013 a little bit of an uptick in promotional levels as our competitors are supporting their recent product launches and we did have an increase in promotion in Q3 if you compared it to Q3 of 2015. We've had good success with them this past year with the July 4th and the Labor Day promotions. We're in continuing discussions with The Home Depot on what levers to pull to drive gallon growth and it's a balance, everything from advertising and promotion, price, rebates. We're looking at everything to drive gallon growth, and we're going to continue to do that throughout the year. It's productive for us.","Our relationship with The Depot has never been stronger. We're focused on gallon growth and it's working. We're focused on penetrating the pro and that's working, hence, the incremental new investment we talked about in the Pro Hub stores. So, things are doing well in paint.","In terms of commodities, John, if you want to talk a little bit of what we're seeing there.","John G. Sznewajs - Masco Corp.","Yeah, Stephen, you mentioned \u2013 well, before I get into commodities, one thing I want to amend is my prior answer. It looks like the total exit from our builder direct business, Stephen, will be will amount (47:36) to about $75 million here in 2016. So sorry about that.","Stephen East - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay, thanks.","John G. Sznewajs - Masco Corp.","As it relates to commodities and paint, we have seen a little bit of very modest inflation in titanium dioxide. We are starting to see a little bit of inflation, which we think might be temporary in some of the input costs that go into the engineered resins. We'll see how that plays out over the course of the next several months. So, overall, relatively modest commodity headwinds here so far in the first part of 2016.","Stephen East - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Mike Wood with Macquarie. Your line is open.","Michael Wood - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Hi. Good morning. First question just on paint, you may have said this, just looking to clarify the advertising expense in third quarter and if you are still on track for the $30 million in the second half?","John G. Sznewajs - Masco Corp.","Yeah, so we said, Mike, that we spent \u2013 of the $30 million, spent $10 million in Q2 \u2013 or I'm sorry, Q3, and we expect the balance, $15 million to $20 million in Q4.","Michael Wood - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Great. And then in Plumbing, I know the margins there are helped by the hedge. What are your thoughts, though, on the ability to pass along the higher commodity prices there in the future? And if you can just speak to the product vitality in Plumbing. Thanks.","Keith J. Allman - Masco Corp.","Well, it was a great quarter for us in terms of margin, strong growth, favorable commodity environment both helped us out, for sure. We think that we're going to have additional investment in Q4 that we've talked about in promotions and a little bit in product launch, mainly promotions, so that'll be a little bit of a headwind.","But again, as I've talked about in terms of the nature of our improvements that we've driven with our Masco operating system, the strong brands, and where we sit in the aisle and how well we're doing in wholesale, we're comfortable with moving our margin range up into the high teens and we think that's where it's going to be.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Nishu Sood with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you. So on the Plumbing hedge, I think you've done a good job of breaking that out when it's material. Now we've seen two quarters in a row of tailwind and I think this may be one of the larger tailwinds you've seen in a number of years. So I was wondering if you could just review the position of those hedges, what specifically has driven these two sequential tailwinds and whether that, based on how you're positioned at the moment, might extend into the next quarter or two.","John G. Sznewajs - Masco Corp.","Yes, Stephen \u2013 I'm sorry \u2013 sorry, Nishu. As we look at the commodity hedge, principally, we hedge two commodities, that's copper and zinc, because that forms brass, which goes into our plumbing products. And so if you take a look at the price of those commodities on a year-over-year basis on kind of an average through the quarter based on what the average of the third quarter was in 2015, that impacts the movement in our hedge. And so we've seen deflation in copper over the course of the last year, and so that's what's created the favorability in the hedge vis-\u00e0-vis last year. We have alternatively seen some inflation in zinc over the same period. So that's how that all plays through.","Thinking about our hedge position more broadly, because of the volatility of what we've seen, we've actually started to reduce our hedge position on our metals in terms of having contracts out there and are doing a \u2013 have taken a different form of negotiating with our vendors as opposed to relying on the financial markets for that benefit.","Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Got it. Got it. Okay. And on the pro paint initiative, so exciting investment into these hub stores. Thinking about the evolution of that business, so especially with the hub stores or the greater presence in those stores, are you seeing your \u2013 you mentioned double-digit sales growth. Is the sales growth now principally being driven by greater purchases from existing customers? Is it being driven by new customers? So just trying to get a sense of how that business is evolving organically. And also just in line with that, just wondering when you might begin to break that out sales-wise for us.","Keith J. Allman - Masco Corp.","The pro market, as we slice it, is about a $6 billion market. So it's a big market for us. And as you might expect, as we're ramping this up, we have a pipeline, if you will, of customers. So we're constantly out prospecting for new accounts, and the accounts that we've had now, in some cases for a year, year-and-a-half, they're starting to gain more momentum. So it really is a combination of share of wallet of the pros that we got initially and then it's also prospecting. Certainly as we add new hub stores, these new 100 hub stores that we're adding, there will be a higher percentage of new customers, but fundamentally, we're looking at both. And it's a big market and there's plenty of room for us. We're just getting going.","Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thanks.","Keith J. Allman - Masco Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of John Lovallo with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","John Lovallo - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you for taking my call as well. First question is, I guess, on CapEx was a little bit lighter than we had expected in the quarter, and I think it was down slightly year-over-year. And it looks like you brought down the full-year target. So I guess the question is, is this exclusively related to the kind of the pull-back on the ERP system, or is there some other things going on there?","John G. Sznewajs - Masco Corp.","No, John, it just had to do with the timing of expense in the quarter, so I think we're $117 million or so year-to-date. And throughout the year, we did expect a little bit heavier spend in the fourth quarter, just given some of the projects that we have teed up. So I think we've got \u2013 we brought our forecast down from $190 million to $170 million, and so I think we feel very comfortable at that level. But nothing to really read into this quarter based on the expense level that we had.","John Lovallo - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Great. And then I guess the last question would be on the ERP system. Can you just remind us who you're working with? Is this an SAP system?","John G.

Mr. Wadhams, please go ahead, sir.","Timothy Wadhams","Thank you, Shalon, and thank all of you for joining us today for Masco's Fourth Quarter 2011 Earnings Call. I'm joined by John Sznewajs, our CFO, and if you would please flip to Slide #3.","2011 continued to be a challenging environment. We didn't see any lift in North American housing till very late in the year. Europe continued to be unsettled from an economic standpoint, again, particularly in the second part of the year, and we saw a mix shift in both of our major markets, less favorable. Commodity cost pressures were an issue for us. We ended the year with about $35 million of unfavorable relationship between price and commodities. And the retail environment continue to be very competitive, a lot of promotional activity. And while we had some businesses that performed very well, overall, our financial performance in 2011 was disappointing. We didn't get the improvement we anticipated in certain areas, and that was disappointing to us. ","If you flip to Slide #4, I'll talk about some of our key financial data for the year. On a full year basis, our sales were flat. In the fourth quarter, we were up 1%. And to add a little color to that, our sales to key retail customers in the fourth quarter were down low single-digits. And if you adjust for some of the products that were exiting in Cabinets, we would have been up low single-digits. That's pretty much the same performance that we had in the third quarter. ","And from a trend standpoint, for us, October was down slightly, but November, December, we started to see a little bit of improvement. We were up 3% in both of those months compared to the prior year. And as we head into 2012, we've got some nice momentum. We're up mid-single-digits in January, and that has continued into February.","In terms of earnings per share, gross margins, operating profit, we adjust those amounts to normalize them for rationalization charges and other items, and those reconciliations are in the back of the Appendix. But for the full year, we were down $0.21 on an adjusted basis in terms of earnings per share. We were also off $114 million in terms of operating profit, again, on an adjusted basis, and $114 million at a 36% tax rate happens to be exactly $0.21. We think about that in 3 big buckets. Mix for us in 2011 was negative to the tune of about $45 million. Price\/commodity relationships, as I mentioned earlier, were unfavorable to approximately $35 million. And we had under-absorbed overhead related to the product exit, the exit of the ready-to-assemble products in Cabinets, of about $15 million.","In the fourth quarter, our operating profit was down $6 million from last year, and that's $0.01, and our earnings per share were $0.01 worse than last year. And again, mix was the big issue in the fourth quarter. Mix was negative for us in the amount of about $19 million.","Working capital was a plus. We continue to do a good job of managing our working capital. We were down to 12.2% when you take receivables plus inventories less payables. And my sense is that that's probably an all-time Masco record. So our folks are doing a great job across the enterprise in terms of managing working capital. Cash flow was relatively weak for us at $71 million. This is free cash flow after CapEx and before dividend. And we had pretty significant swing in terms of deferred income taxes from year-to-year, which really had significant impact there. From a balance sheet standpoint, we ended the year with $1.7 billion of cash, so we're in a very good position from a liquidity standpoint.","If you flip to Slide #5, please. And while the environment was tough and our financial results were not where we wish they were, we felt like we got a lot accomplished in 2011. We continued to rationalize our business. In the third quarter, we talked about the plant closures in our window group. On the West Coast, we talked about the planned disposition of some of our installation-related businesses. Those are in process. We also mentioned at that time that we thought we'd see headcount reduction in the fourth quarter of about 750. That actually came in at about 2,000 as we had some additional headcount reductions across several of our business units.","As we mentioned in our press release, we completed the major restructuring of our North American Cabinet and Installation businesses, and we continued to invest in new products and programs, future growth opportunities, international growth and strengthening our brands. And we did successfully amend our credit agreement just yesterday to reflect some of the impairment charges that we took for goodwill and intangible assets.","We believe that during the course of 2011, that we either held or improved our share position in most of our major categories. North American Cabinets would be one exception to that. We've talked about that in the past in terms of our big-box position, which we continue to be #1 in. And maybe a little bit earlier in the year in the terms of the dealer channel, a little bit of decline there, although we had some nice momentum coming out of the fourth quarter with some of the new dealers that we've attracted.","If you flip to Slide #6, please. We'll take a look at Cabinets. And it was a tough year for Cabinets, both in North America and in Europe. If you exclude the impact of the product exits in the fourth quarter, our sales would have been up 2%. And on a full year basis, we would have been down 5%. Our profit on a full year basis was off $44 million, reflecting volume and mix in that number. That includes the exit of the ready-to-assemble product group, which was about $13 million in terms of under-absorbed overhead and negative mix of about $7 million. We did have a net profit improvement in that segment of about $20 million, which offset price\/commodity relationships and drove the fourth quarter improvement, although somewhat modest in terms of impact. But we did have in the second half the year good performance in terms of profit improvement initiatives.","If you flip to Slide #7. I want take a look at Cabinets in terms of what we think is possible in 2012. Obviously, this is a segment that's been a lot of focus for us, and we believe we got a very solid plan for improvement in 2012. Basically, in North America, we're done with the restructuring. And if we go through the math here, it assumes a flat housing and retail environment in 2012, and we'll talk about that as we work our way through the analysis. If we segregate international and North American business, you can see in North America, we estimate that last year, we did about $860 million in sales and lost about $75 million, again, on an adjusted basis. The product exits that I mentioned earlier cost us about $13 million, and so from a core loss standpoint, that takes us down to $62 million. We've got net profit improvements that we've identified and very clear line of sight to those that we estimate will be about $30 million over the course of the year. We also believe, even in a flat environment, that we should see some top side opportunity. ","As I mentioned, we've got some momentum in the dealer channel. And as we've discussed in the past, we've done, I think, a pretty nice job of adding dealers to our Dealer Advantage Program. We're starting to see some traction with them. We also talked a little bit at the end of the third quarter about the launch of our vanity programs and our countertop programs predominantly on the East Coast. So we think, on a net basis, we ought to see, even in a flat market, about $30 million of incremental volume, and that would equate to about $10 million of incremental profit.","If you put all that together, that results in a estimated loss of just a little bit over $20 million. And I would point out, in that number is about $7 million of cost related to idle facilities that we have, the carrying cost and then most of that is noncash. I would also point out that, as I mentioned earlier, we're talking about a flat environment.  To the extent we see any improvement in housing this year, and blue chip consensus has gone up the last couple of months, I think it's at 7 20 at this point in time. And we certainly hope that that's correct, or maybe we'll even see a little better activity. But if you think about a 50,000-start improvement in housing on a lag basis, we estimate that that would generate about $25 million of top line and about $8 million to $10 million in additional profit. Again, just to give you a perspective of what we think might be possible.","Europe, as you can see at the top of the chart here, in 2011 was $370 million of sales and about $40 million of loss on an adjusted basis. We've identified at this point about $7 million of profit improvement opportunities that we have very good line of sight to. The issue around Europe continues to be the unsettled economic conditions there. My sense is that we can improve more than that $7 million this year. We're working very hard to make that happen. But given some of the top line concerns that we've got, we'll be able to develop a little more information as we move through the year and see how things kind of play out, again, from a demand standpoint.","If you flip to Slide #8. This is Installation and Other Services.  Again, another segment that has been hit very hard in terms of the downturn. It had a tough year, but we did see some very nice improvement in the second half of the year, particularly in the fourth quarter. Fourth quarter sales were up 12%, and we benefited from residential Installation share gains and the continued expansion of our retrofit and commercial business. ","Fourth quarter sales also benefited from an increase in lag housing starts of approximately 6%. Operating margins in the fourth quarter were favorably impacted, and for the full year, by incremental volume and profit improvement initiatives, and the guys continue to do a nice job of cost takeout in this segment.","If you flip to Slide #9. This gives you a little bit of a perspective as to what we think is possible in terms of improvement in this segment during the year. We've got some nice momentum going into 2012, and we expect that we can continue to improve, even in a flat market, again, the basic assumption here. We closed 12 branches late in the fourth quarter, early first quarter. Those will cost us a little bit of top line but will save us about $6 million in operating loss from 2011. We also believe that we'll have a net profit improvement of about $20 million in this segment. Again, as I've mentioned, and as I think you know, they've done a pretty good job of cost take-out over the last several years. ","We also think that even in a flat environment that we should see some incremental revenue in this segment. We're estimating, on a net basis, that that'll be about $40 million, and that's driven by share gains and in continued penetration in terms of retrofit and commercial. And you can see here that we're estimating that we think the incremental profit on that would be about $10 million. So we're looking to cut the loss in half, effectively, from $70 million to approximately $30 million based on the actions that we've talked about here in a flat market.  To the extent that we see any lift in terms of housing starts, 50,000 starts on a lag basis would generate for us about $50 million of revenue incrementally and about $12 million to $15 million of incremental profit.","If you flip to Slide #10, Plumbing Products. Sales were up 2% in the fourth quarter. Sales increase was driven by volume for the full year. We were up 8% for the full year on price increases, and for the full year, we did have about $70 million of positive effect of currency. In the fourth quarter, our European operations were much slower than they have been for the first 3 quarters of the year. We're starting to see some of the impact of the slowdown in the European economies, and so we didn't get a lot of lift. And in fact, I think Europe was essentially flat in the fourth quarter for us in this segment. Having said that, faucets in North America were up low double-digits in the fourth quarter, so we saw some nice penetration there. And I think we talked a little earlier about the load-in in terms of some of the new product opportunities that our Delta and Peerless brands have been able to win. ","Operating margins were down in the quarter from 10.6% to 8.3% and down on a full year basis from 12.9% to 11.6%. And the biggest issue impacting our business in this segment, and that's been pretty consistent all year, has been mix. Mix cost us about roughly $40 million on a full year basis in this segment and cost us about $12 million in the fourth quarter. ","In the fourth quarter, we had some additional spend that was a little bit unusual for Hansgrohe. We had some costs related to the change in their corporate status, which doesn't have a lot of impact on anything other than their corporate status in Germany. And we had some additional spend related to a building purchase in China that relates to some lease accounting, and that was about -- those aggregated about $4 million in the quarter.","If you flip to Slide #11. We're off to a very strong start in 2012 in Plumbing in North America. I mentioned Europe continues to be a little bit slow. And as we go into 2012, we'll continue to focus on supply chain, brand strengthening and international expansion.","If you flip to Slide #12, Decorative Architectural Products. Sales in this segment were up in the fourth quarter, about 4%, down 1% on a full year basis. Our sales for the full year and fourth quarter were impacted by reduced volumes, and that includes the loss of the Walmart business. We talked about that. That affects both Paint and our hardware business, and that was down on a full year basis about $50 million, $55 million in terms of sales. We did benefit from price increases in this segment, and that's what really drove the increase in terms of the fourth quarter on a year-over-year basis.","Operating margins, we were down, as I mentioned, 14.9% to 10.1% in the quarter, 20.7% to 16.9% for the full year, and that's reflected in terms of volume declines over the course of the year and unfavorable price\/commodity relationships. We were about negative 10% in the fourth quarter and about negative 15% on a full year basis. And we also incurred some cost for strategic growth and program-related cost during the year, $4 million in the fourth quarter, $14 million on a full year basis.","If you flip to Slide #13. A very competitive environment that we've been experiencing in terms of the Paint opportunities that we have. A lot of new products out there, a lot of promotional activity taking place. Together, The Home Depot, our channel partner, and Behr have focused on growth for both the DIY and the Pro segment in terms of our business opportunities and really put a lot of emphasis on share gain in the second half of the year. Given the extreme nature of commodity cost and after we, Masco, have worked very hard on productivity improvements with our -- and also -- from an internal perspective and also with our suppliers in terms of cost, we are in the process at this point in time of increasing prices for Paint with all of our customers and across all of our products. That process started early February and should be concluded in the early second quarter.","The weather has helped. There's no question about that. And we're off to a strong start in 2012, and we expect 2012 to benefit from the continued growth of our Pro initiative. We've got new product launches that began in the first quarter and are continuing through -- or excuse me, in the fourth quarter of 2011 and continuing through the first quarter. We're rolling out a new colorant with low VOCs in all The Home Depot stores. We've upgraded our Premium Plus Interior line with some self-priming attributes and also 0 VOC. And our #1-rated Premium Plus Ultra Interior line, which is paint and primer in one, we've added an improved stain-blocking capability to that paint. And those products will all be rolled out by the end of the first quarter. Last year, as I mentioned, we spent about $10 million in support of our Pro and international opportunities, and we also launched Kilz Pro-X in the first part of 2011. ","And we continue to execute at a very high level. An independent consumer evaluation recently continued to rate Behr and Kilz very highly in terms of both quality and value, and we continue to enjoy fill rates in excess of 99% in terms of delivery. So we're excited about the opportunities, off to a good start in 2012 and, as I mentioned, should have pricing in place by late first quarter, early second quarter.","If you flip to Slide #14, Other Specialty Products were down 11% in the fourth quarter, down 3% for the full year. The fourth quarter decline reflects the exploration of the tax credit in late 2010. There was a little bit of a push in terms of top line. Our operating profit drop of $3 million in the fourth quarter really relates to the decline in sales. We -- from a full year standpoint, we were off $15 million. We've talked about some of the volume declines, some of the costs that we've incurred for new product launches, geographic expansion and modestly unfavorable product mix -- or excuse me -- yes, product mix in this segment.","If you flip to Slide #15. And as we think about Other Specialty Products in 2012, we mentioned -- I mentioned earlier that we closed 3 plants in the fourth quarter. That obviously caused a little bit of disruption, but we're through most of that at this point in time, and we expect to realize some benefits from that. I think we estimated about $7 million the last time we were together. We'll continue to manage our supply chain. We continue to do a great job in terms of window share, both in the U.S.A. and the United Kingdom. We continue to grow there, and we continue to execute on growth opportunities for Texas and Western Canada expansion. We also have some retail opportunities in terms of both the United Kingdom and the U.S., but we'll talk about those as they develop over time.","If you flip to Slide #16. Talk a little bit about some of the information that we shared with you for your modeling. We're estimating that in 2012, rationalization charges will be approximately $20 million based on what we know today. And again, as I mentioned earlier and we mentioned in the press release, most of the major restructuring we believe is behind us at this point in time. We do anticipate a slight increase or about a $20 million increase in terms of general corporate expense, and that's a similar situation to what we had last year. I think we mentioned last year that we expect it to be up a little bit. That's usually representative of the normalization of some of our accruals for things like insurance, health benefits, worker's comp, variable compensation, things of that nature, where we might have had more favorable results than our normal trend line. And hopefully, we're a little bit conservative there. We're estimating that CapEx will be about $180 million in 2012, and the rest of it is pretty straightforward. ","If you flip to Slide #17, just a couple of quick comments before we open up the lines for Q&A. In 2012, we will continue to focus on investing to drive future growth, strengthening our leadership brands, driving supply chain and lean benefits and strengthening our balance sheet. We've got some debt due in July of this year. And as we've mentioned before, our intent is to refi about $400 million of that and pay down the rest with internal cash, and executing on new product launches along with our Cabinet and Installation profit improvement initiatives.","As I mentioned, we're off to a solid start in 2012. January sales were up mid-single-digits. As I mentioned, that's continued into February. Housing activity seems to be picking up, and that's certainly very encouraging. And we're very focused on improving our execution in 2012, and we expect improving results as we work our way through the year. ","And with that, we'll open up the lines for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll have our first question from Peter Lisnic with Robert W. Baird.","Peter Lisnic - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Tim, I just wanted to get a feel for -- if we look for -- at Plumbing and Paint for 2012, can you give us an idea of what price and growth spending might do to the incremental profitability outlook there for '12?","Timothy Wadhams","Yes. In terms of -- let's start with the Decorative Architectural segment, where Paint is. Yes, I would guess there, Pete, that we'll -- definitely see some pressure in terms of price\/commodity relationships in the first quarter. As I mentioned, we're in the process of implementing price increases at this point in time, and TiO2's been very volatile. But as we get those prices in place, we should be in good shape as we work our way through the rest of the year. In terms of incremental growth spend, we do not anticipate any incremental growth spend in 2012 compared to 2011. So we shouldn't see anything incremental there. In Plumbing, we finished the year with a positive price\/commodity relationship in the fourth quarter. On a full year basis, we were down in that segment about $15 million, and that really relates to the hedge. So in the second half the year, we started to see some improvement minus the hedge in terms of price\/commodity, and I would expect it to carry forward into 2012. The -- copper's gone up a little bit, but our sense is that we'll be working -- we usually have about a 2-quarter lag in terms of significant price volatility there. So my sense is that if things stay where they are, we ought to see a more positive relationship and recapture some of the negative impact from last year. And we don't see any additional growth initiative spend in that segment either as we go into this year. I mean, there'll be -- there are programs that we're supporting. We probably spent about $25 million in that segment last year, I think, but don't anticipate anything incremental as we get into 2012.","Peter Lisnic - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. Perfect. And then just as the follow-up question. In Cabinets, in terms of the forecast or hypothetical that you laid out, how subject is that to the pricing environment improving or remaining stable with kind of where it's at currently?","Timothy Wadhams","Yes. There -- I don't think we are anticipating any significant price increases going into 2012, Pete. We had some in the latter part of last year. One of the bigger issues in our Cabinet group is really international. I talked a little bit about top line risk, certainly given some of the economic issues that we face in the markets that we serve over there. The other issue that's been a big deal for us there has been the particleboard issue with our Danish ready-to-assemble manufacturer. We had some negative price\/commodity impact throughout the year. My sense is they have been able to get some price, so we'll be able to offset part of that.  But that would be a little bit of a potential headwind as well. Pete?","Operator","We'll go next to Nishu Sood, Deutsche Bank.","Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I wanted to ask a first question about the Milgard segment and the goodwill write-down that you took there. The energy tax credits have obviously pulled forward some sales and then depressed sales this year. So I was just wondering, as you evaluated the business, was that something that was taken into account? I mean, obviously, you would expect some rebound in sales as the effect of that kind of begins to comp into the past.","Timothy Wadhams","Well, I think, Pete, that's really -- or excuse me, Nishu, that's really a longer-term situation. You might remember when we discussed that segment in the third quarter, we mentioned that we closed 3 of our manufacturing facilities. And the real driver for that was really our perception -- and hopefully, we're wrong -- our perception that the recovery in housing in the Western markets, given some of the problems that they have, would be a little slower than it would be in other areas of the country. Now as we all know, that can change pretty dramatically, but that was really part of our logic, along with some improvements we've made in logistics and supply chain where we feel like we could certainly absorb the top line opportunities from those plants. So it's really more of a reduction in terms of what we think the longer-term dynamics are in the Western markets more than anything else.","Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Got it. Great. And also, I wanted to ask about Liberty Hardware. I mean, when we talk about Decorative Architectural, most of the time, we're talking about Behr, which obviously dominates that division. But especially in light of the goodwill markdown on Liberty as well, I wanted to ask how trends have been there and how that's contributed to volatility in that division's results.","Timothy Wadhams","Yes. We were down in terms of top line, Nishu, at Liberty over the past year, but there's -- that tends to be driven a lot by very large programs. You win some, and then sometimes you lose a few. And we have been very active. I think we probably spent close to $5 million or $6 million related to new displays for Liberty as we go into 2012. We've got new bath hardware as well as kitchen hardware, cabinet hardware, if you will, that will be launching in that. We're using the Delta brand in a couple of situations in terms of bath. And we've got some really good programs going into this year, and in fact, they're off to a very good start in January, a very good start. So we should see some improvement in that segment as both Liberty and Behr are off to a very good start in the early part of this year.","Operator","We'll go next to Michael Rehaut, JPMorgan.","Michael Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","First question has to do with your projections or estimates regarding starts and how that translates into sales for both Installation and Cabinets. My question is around the composition of that starts, because certainly, single-family is a different type of start versus multifamily when you talk about larger 2,000-square-foot homes versus apartments. So I mean, how should we think about -- when you talked about the general increase in starts, a lot of the increase recently has been more driven by multifamily. Should we think of that more that -- I mean, is there a difference in revenue component? Is it -- the 50,000, I mean, should we think of that more as -- if it's a normal single-family-driven type start? Or maybe you can kind of discuss for both segments what the overall exposure is to single versus multi and if there are differences in revenue exposure.","Timothy Wadhams","Yes. There are differences, Mike, and we did try to factor that into our revenue increase assumption. For example, from an Installation standpoint, typically, single-family is about $2,000 a job. A multifamily job is about $800. So there's a fairly significant change there, if you will. And you can imagine, in terms of cabinets, less bathrooms, et cetera, certainly much less content. So we try to factor that in. And I believe our assumptions are based on a mix of about 70-30 in terms of single-family versus multifamily. Our sense is that multifamily in the fourth quarter was probably closer to maybe 35% in terms of mix. I think on the full year basis, it was in the high 20s, but we've used roughly 30%. So we could be off there a little bit, but I wouldn't think that, that would be that dramatic. So we did try to factor that in when we estimated what we thought incremental revenue might look like as a deduct.","Michael Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. The second question on the Cabinet breakdown -- and the breakdown of the international within that in terms of 2011 was extremely helpful. But I noticed that you focused on North America in terms of the potential opportunities for improvements, and I was wondering if you could comment on the international segment, Europe. Certainly, things are slowing there. Do you -- what are you expecting for the operating profit? I mean, if sales continue to drift south, would that operating profit or operating loss increase? Or are there initiatives that you have in that region as well?","Timothy Wadhams","No. There are definitely initiatives, Mike. You might remember that we, probably about 14 months ago, replaced the leadership at both of those businesses: one in the United Kingdom; one in the -- our Danish facility. And so we've got new leadership in place. We've got, in effect, some new leadership team members, but again, in very demanding circumstances relative to the top line there. As we mentioned, we lost about $40 million on an adjusted basis last year. We've taken a lot of actions in the latter part of the year, particularly related to our Danish facility. We closed the plants in the fourth quarter, so that should give us some benefit going into the next year. And I did identify or mention about $7 million of cost reductions that we've identified at this point in time. That is not to suggest that we don't think that we can improve those beyond that point. I just don't want to get out ahead of ourselves at this point in time given some of the uncertainty around the top line and get any more direct, if you will, in terms of what we think is possible there. We certainly recognize that that's a big knot in terms of the loss, and we'll be working really hard to make that -- decrease that as much as we possibly can. I think I also mentioned that we got some pricing in the latter part of the year. We've done some things to rationalize our product group with the Danish facility. We've got some new technology in there from a ramping standpoint. So we think there are some opportunities, but still a very unsettled, very uncertain kind of environment.","Michael Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And to that, can you just describe the sales progression in terms of growth in the international Cabinets throughout the year? I mean, I would assume that perhaps in the first half of '11, it was maybe year-over-year positive, and it turned to year-over-year negative into the fourth quarter. Is that correct? Maybe you can give us a degree of magnitude.","Timothy Wadhams","I don't know. John, maybe you've got that detail?","John G. Sznewajs","No, I mean -- but looking at first half, second half, Mike, we did see a little bit of deceleration into the second half of the year as things in Europe got a little bit more unsettled. But as you might think, as Tim mentioned, we've got one unit in the U.K. That economy has been relatively stable. I mean, it's not -- it's like the U.S., nothing real dramatic either one way or the other. It's more our Danish operation that experienced the fall-off in the back half of the year.","Michael Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. One more question, if I could. The Paint increase, do you expect that to kind of roughly offset the incremental TiO2 costs in 2012? Or would you expect it to result in a net positive by the time we get to the second half?","Timothy Wadhams","We would anticipate it would be offset, Mike.","Operator","We'll go next to Dennis McGill, Zelman & Associates.","Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, Research Division","The question -- first question, just around the comments you made about January and February being up mid-single. It sounded like -- well, we know international is a drag in general in the fourth quarter. What would the domestic numbers look like against that single? And can you also talk product categories, maybe what you're seeing at the extremes?","Timothy Wadhams","Well, I can tell you, Dennis -- I can go back and break it down, but you're right. International is basically kind of flat to down in terms of what we saw in January. But I can tell you, when we look at our Decorative segment, that is up double-digits. I can tell you that in Plumbing, that's up nicely going into the first part of the year. So most of the strength is at retail in some of our remodel activity but also some very good numbers related to the installation-related business. So we're pretty much across the board. I'd say windows was probably a little bit slower in terms of what we're seeing in the other categories, but some pretty good momentum as we move into February.","Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, Research Division","Okay. The second question would be around the Decorative Architectural segment and I guess, sort of 2 parts, one's a quick one.  On the Paints and stains business, what's the split between paints and stains? And then separately, as you think about the margin in the quarter being pretty disappointing, I would think the inventory cost would have been known going into the quarter. And rather than pursue price increases retroactively, how can we think about the ability to offset commodity inflation ahead of time, as opposed to trying to get it after the fact? And along those lines, was the margin performance in the quarter what you would have expected going into the quarter? Or were there any puts and takes relative to those expectations?","Timothy Wadhams","Yes. I would say that the margin was somewhat consistent with what we anticipated, Dennis. One of the things that's kind of important when you think about the fourth quarter in that segment is that typically, sales -- second and third quarter's where we see the significant sales and tend to have a big drop in the fourth quarter. And because labor is a very, very small part of their cost structure, you don't get a lot of leverage in terms of the decline. So we tend to end up in what you might kind of consider under-absorbed overhead from that perspective. So -- and that's been pretty traditional if you go back over time, I mean, and look at margin sequence. We did have, as I mentioned, unfavorable price\/commodity relationship in the fourth quarter in that segment. And so from that standpoint, I'd say we probably came in about what we anticipated when we went into the quarter, given what we anticipated demand was going to be. But having said that, we did get some really good traction, as I mentioned, coming out of the blocks and in terms of early 2012. Your question on paints and stains in terms of the composition there, this is more off the top of my head, but I'm going to guess that stains are probably less than 20% easy, maybe 15%.","John G. Sznewajs","Yes. I think about the 20% range.","Timothy Wadhams","Yes, mid-20%, Dennis.","John G. Sznewajs","Yes. And I guess kind of one thing to add to Tim's comments about the quarter, we did incur some incremental advertising in the quarter to the tune of about $4 million or $5 million that we probably didn't anticipate going into the quarter.","Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. And then just to clarify a comment you made earlier on the market share gains. If you exclude the Walmart business, did you gain share in Paints and stains for the year?","Timothy Wadhams","We would estimate, Dennis, that we held our own. I think that we may have seen a little dip early midyear just in terms of some of the new product introductions that came out, but we estimate in the fourth quarter, we gained. And as we look at it overall from a full year standpoint, we think we were basically about flat in terms of share. But having said that, as I mentioned, we've got some new products coming out as we go into 2012, and there should be some opportunity there. The weather, obviously, has been a little bit helpful. So we're in a real strong spot.","Operator","We'll move on to Keith Hughes, SunTrust.","Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Question in installed products. There was an attempt at a pretty substantial increase in Installation prices midyear last year. Did you take that price increase to your customers? And were you successful in getting it through?","Timothy Wadhams","Yes. In terms of price increases, Keith, we have been able, historically, to offset price increases, either through working with our suppliers or passing them along. So for us, that's generally been the way we've handled that and haven't had a lot of negative impact in terms of price\/commodities.","Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","And so I mean, we're talking double-digits they were talking about last year. Was that something you were able to push through?","Timothy Wadhams","Well, as I mentioned, we -- one way or another, we were able to offset price, yes.","Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And you gained share in that business in the fourth quarter. Is that -- what was the driver of the share gain?","Timothy Wadhams","Well, we actually -- the way we look at it, Keith, from a -- and again, we can get a pretty good feel for residential Installation. Some of the diversified products are a little bit tougher, but we believe that we were up in share in all 4 quarters last year. And the fourth quarter, we had the benefit of both share gains as well as the increase in lag starts. But we mentioned a year ago or so that when -- we had some challenges in terms of 2010 with share. We talked a little bit about that. As we worked our way through the year, talked a little bit about adding some resources. The guys have done a tremendous job in terms of organizational alignment, training programs for salespeople, discipline in terms of accountability, and we're starting to see the benefits of that. We simplified the business. We've gotten out of a lot of the diversified products that were a little bit more of a distraction. And retrofit's going well. The commercial side is going well, so we're very encouraged, even at these kind of levels, in terms of what might be possible going forward.","Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","And final question on this. The year-over-year gain and the operating or loss or improvement in operating loss. Was Installation the primary driver for that, the negative 6% versus negative 19% in prior year?","Timothy Wadhams","Yes. I wouldn't necessarily say totally Installation. I mean, I think we got distribution in that segment. We've got retrofit. We've got commercial. So when you look at all 4 of those together, I think all 4 of those were hitting very well in the fourth quarter. The Installation would have been a bigger piece of it because of the increase in lag starts and the fact that we've increased share.","Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","And it's just a bigger piece of the business, too. That's kind of...","Timothy Wadhams","Yes, exactly.","Operator","We'll go next to David Goldberg, UBS.","Unknown Analyst","This is actually Michael Clark [ph] on for David Goldberg. You mention increased competition in Paint during the quarter. Was there any signs of that easing towards the latter part or even recently? Given that you plan to increase price, how are you thinking this is going to translate, especially in terms of market share?","Timothy Wadhams","Well, in terms of increased competition, what I did mention is that midyear, we started to see some products come out that were comparable to our Paint and Primer in One. We launched that about what? 2 years ago?","John G. Sznewajs","2010.","Timothy Wadhams","Yes, 2 years ago. And obviously, that has been a very positive impact on the marketplace. We saw some competitive product that claimed to have similar properties. And so there was a little bit of activity there and a little bit -- a fair amount of promotional activity. So that really took place more -- earlier in the year. And as I mentioned, we felt like -- that we might have been down a little bit in share but got that back in the fourth quarter and ended the year basically flat from that standpoint. And so from that position, we continue to be the #1 paint in the do-it-yourself market. In terms of pricing, going forward, I don't see that putting any -- putting us at a competitive disadvantage. Almost all of the competitors in that channel have raised prices over time. And that -- we don't control the retail side of that. I mean, we basically are implementing price increases to our channel partners, and that's across all customers and all products.","Unknown Analyst","Okay. Also, I'm trying to understand the effect of the unfavorable mix in Plumbing, kind of what's driving that. Is it due more to increasing multifamily starts versus single-family? And kind of what efforts you're making to respond to this trend and what you think needs to happen to kind of reverse this unfavorable mix that's going on.","Timothy Wadhams","Yes. Michael, that's really related to -- primarily related to our Hansgrohe operation, which is headquartered in Germany and which is international in scope. And there's a couple of things that transpired there. One is that as they -- they originally were a shower systems manufacturer, and they have moved more into faucets over time. And so there is -- there's a lower margin on faucets than there are in shower systems. So as we continue to see more faucets as part of the mix, we have a little bit of mix-related impact. The other thing that they do is they have done a very nice job of penetrating new markets, typically in foreign locations, other countries, and oftentimes go in with what I'd kind of describe as entry-level products, which often are more of an opening-price-point type of situation. And from that standpoint, what we typically see is as we enter those markets -- and they've been very active there.  As those markets mature and develop, we're able to place additional products in terms of -- and move up the scale a little bit, if you will, in terms of price points. So from that standpoint, it's really a little bit like a cost for future growth. And that's been going on now for some time. Having said that, Hansgrohe had a tremendous year last year. They had record sales. They also had very strong profitability, but most of that mix-related issue is in that particular business.","Operator","We'll have that from Josh Wilson, Raymond James.","Joshua Wilson","Filling in for Sam Darkatsh this morning. Most of my questions have been answered, but I wanted to dig into the Paint business a little bit more. You said commodity inflation was the big issue, and we talked some about these price increases offsetting your commodity expectations. But does that mean you expect margins in 2012 for that segment to recover to 2010 levels? Or what will it -- how long will it take for that to happen?","Timothy Wadhams","I wouldn't necessarily want to predict margins in that segment. Obviously, as we get back to higher volumes, we've got high contribution margins. That will help us in that segment. But one of the things that is evident there is as we continue to grow in terms of our Paint initiatives, that tends to have a little lower margin. And so from our standpoint, our real focus has been on growth. We want to try to grow that segment. We're investing internationally. We're investing in the Pro. Both of those will probably have lower margins as we continue to develop those opportunities, but we think very, very attractive returns in terms of return on asset. So we may see, over time, some decline in absolute margin. But our thought would be that if we can grow our absolute profit dollars, get a good return on the assets, we'll continue to create value for our shareholders.","Joshua Wilson","Okay. That's helpful. And then just to get an update on -- last I heard, I believe it was not your intent to hire a new COO. Is that still the case?","Timothy Wadhams","Yes. Yes, we did not replace that position.","Okay, thank you. And thank all of you for joining us today. We appreciate your attendance. Thank you.","Operator","That concludes today's conference.

My name is Twanda and I will be your operator for today's call. As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded for replay purposes only. [Operator Instructions]","I will now turn the call over to David Chaika, Vice President, Treasurer and Investor Relations. You may begin.","David Chaika","Thank you, Twanda Amy, and good morning. Welcome to Masco Corporation's 2019 third quarter conference call. With me today are Keith Allman, President and CEO of Masco; and John Sznewajs, Masco's Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Our third quarter earnings release and the presentation slides that we will refer to today are available on our website under Investor Relations. Following our remarks, we will open the call for analyst questions. Please limit yourself to one question with one followup. If we can't take your question now, please call me directly at 313-792-5500.","Statements today will include our views about our future performance, which constitute forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. We've described these risks and uncertainties in our risk factors and other disclosures in our Form 10-K and our Form 10-Q that we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","Our statements will also include non-GAAP financial metrics. Our references to operating profit and earnings per share will be as adjusted, unless otherwise noted. We reconcile these adjusted metrics to GAAP in our earnings release and presentation slides, which are available on our website under Investor Relations.","Finally, please note that we have accounted for our Windows businesses as discontinued operations for all periods presented.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to Keith.","Keith Allman","Thank you, Dave. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us today. Please turn to Slide 4. In the third quarter our topline increased 3% excluding the impact of currency, driven by growth in Plumbing, and strong performance in our Paint business. Operating profit grew 8% and operating margins expanded 80 basis points to 16.7% in the quarter due to higher volume, pricing actions, and disciplined cost control. Our EPS grew 11% to $0.68 per share.","Turning to our segment performance, our Plumbing segment grew 1% or 3% in local currency. Delta had a record sales quarter led by growth in paving and sanitary ware products, Brizo, our showroom brand and pricing actions. Additionally, I am proud that for the fifth time Delta Faucet Company achieved the WaterSense Sustained Excellence Award. This is the highest partner recognition from the U.S. EPA awarded for Delta's continued outstanding efforts to advance the WaterSense program and promote water efficiency.","Watkins also had another record sales quarter, as it continued to gain share in the spa market with its broad assortment of price points, programs and innovative products. International Plumbing grew 5% in local currency due to strong growth in Germany, China, and France, as Hansgrohe launched new products into the market as we discussed last quarter.","In our Decorative Architectural segment, sales grew 5%. This growth was led by low double-digit growth in our paint business, including high single-digit growth in DIY Paint and double-digit growth in Pro Paint.","We capitalized on pent-up demand and gained share in the paint market with our industry leading brands, quality and service, along with great execution by our Behr team and our partner the Home Depot. During the fourth quarter, we will continue to work with the Home Depot to enhance the shopping experience with new color centers, new color selection tools, and new products.","Moving onto Cabinetry, our cabinets sales declined 3% in the quarter. This decline was largely due to mix as our lower price point Merillat, Quality and Cardell brands performed very well in the quarter. Despite the lower sales, we expanded margins in this segment by 210 basis points in the quarter, and achieved operating margins of 11.7% due to pricing actions and cost control.","Turning to capital allocation, we continued our share repurchase activity in the quarter by repurchasing 3.8 million shares for approximately $151 million, bringing our year-to-date share repurchase total to $440 million. As it relates to our divestitures, we completed the divestiture of our UK Window business in early September and are very pleased to have signed an agreement to divest Milgard for $725 million. We anticipate closing this transaction in the fourth quarter and expect net proceeds after tax and expenses to be approximately $560 million.","We will likely deploy $200 million of these proceeds towards retiring our March 2020 notes and the remainder towards share repurchases during the fourth quarter. In addition, we're making good progress on the sale of Cabinetry and we remain on track with that process. Lastly, due to the treatment of our Windows businesses as discontinued operations and our continued performance as expected we are narrowing and updating our anticipated earnings per share for 2019 to be in the range of $2.52 to $2.56 from our previous range of $2.62 to $2.72.","Now, I'd like to turn the call over to John, who will go over our operational and financial performance in detail. John?","John Sznewajs","Thank you, Keith and good morning everyone. As Dave mentioned, most of my comments will focus on adjusted performance from continuing operations excluding the impact of rationalization and other one-time items.","Turning to Slide 6, sales increased 2% and grew 3% in local currency. Foreign currency translation unfavorably impacted our third quarter revenue by approximately $15 million. In local currency, North American sales increased 3% in the quarter. This performance was driven by volume growth in our Paint business and disciplined pricing actions across all segments. This was partially offset by lower volumes in our Lighting and Hardware businesses and mix impact in our Cabinetry business. In local currency International sales increased 5% in the quarter with strong growth in Central Europe and China. Gross margins were 34.4%, up 80 basis points.","Our SG&A as a percent of sales matched prior year at 17.7% as we remained focused on cost control. We delivered solid bottom line performance as operating income increased 8% to $326 million with operating margins expanding 80 [ph] basis points to 16.7%. Our EPS was $0.68 in the quarter, an increase of 11% compared to the third quarter of 2018.","We are narrowing and updating our annual EPS estimate range to $2.52 to $2.56 per share to reflect discontinued operations accounting for our Windows set. This compared to a full-year 2018 adjusted EPS of $2.39 per share with Windows in discontinued operations. Refer to Slide 18 in the appendix of our earnings call deck, for historical quarterly information restated for the Windows segment in discontinued operations.","This EPS estimate range also assumed the last three tariffs remain at 25% and the four tariffs remain at 15%, a portion of which was effective on September 1. Any changes to announce tariffs at this point in the year will have minimal effects on our fourth quarter results.","Turning to Slide 7, Plumbing segment sales increased 1%. Excluding the impact of currency, sales increased to 3%. Foreign currency translation unfavorably impacted this segment's sales by approximately $15 million in the quarter. North American sales increased to 2% in local currency in the third quarter against a tough 9% comp in the third quarter of 2018. Growth was helped by our Spa business which delivered another record sales quarter. Delta also achieved another record sales quarter due to pricing actions and growth in our showroom oriented Brizo products and the Delta branded bathing and sanitary ware products.","International Plumbing sales increased 5% in local currency. This performance was driven by Hansgrohe's growth in Central Europe and China as it experienced strong demand for two recently introduced products. The segment's operating profit growth of 5% was driven by higher volume and pricing actions.","For full-year 2019 we continue to expect plumbing sales growth to be the 1% to 3% range and margins similar to 2018, as we feel more of the cost impact of tariffs in the fourth quarter. As a reminder, our 2018 fourth quarter results benefited from approximately $10 million on sales pulled forward.","Turning to Slide 8, Decorative Architectural Products grew 5%. This performance was driven by low double-digit growth in our Paint business with high single-digit growth in DIY and double-digit growth in Pro. Exterior paints and deck stains experienced strong growth in the quarter due to pent up demand from earlier in the year and solid execution by our Behr team and our channel partner.","Paint sales were partially offset by lower sales in our lighting and builder hardware businesses as disciplined pricing actions impacted volumes in the quarter. Operating income in the third quarter grew compared to prior year due to increased volume, selling price increases, and continued focus on cost control and productivity initiatives, partially offset by higher year-over-year commodity costs in Paint, Lighting and builders hardware.","For full-year 2019 we continue to expect Decorative Architectural Products sales growth will be in the 1% to 3% range including the benefit of the Kichler acquisition and operating margins will be in the higher end of the 17% to 18% range driven by our strong performance and cost control year-to-date.","For the fourth quarter, recall that we faced a difficult 8% sales comp as we experienced approximately $20 million in sales pulled forward in Q4 2018, and we will feel more of the impact of tariffs on material costs in the fourth quarter of this year.","Turning to Slide 9, in the Cabinetry segment, sales decreased 3% in the quarter. This performance was driven by a software market, mix, and a difficult 11% sales comp against the third quarter of 2018 when excluding the Moores divestiture. This decline was partially offset by pricing actions and growth in our lower price point offerings.","Segment profitability increased in the quarter by $4 million with margins of 11.7%, an increase of 210 basis points driven by pricing actions and cost control partially offset by mix. We continue to expect full-year 2019 sales growth between zero and 3%. However, based on our year-to-date performance and continued cost control, we now expect full-year margins to be approximately 10.5% and an improvement of approximately 150 basis points from our prior guidance.","Turning to Slide 10, our balance sheet remains strong with net debt to EBITDA at 1.8 times and we ended the quarter with approximately $1.5 billion dollars of balance sheet and liquidity. Working capital as a percent of sales improved 20 basis points versus the prior year to 16%. As a result of moving our Windows business to discontinued operations, we now expect full-year working capital as a percent of sales will be approximately 15.5%.","During the third quarter we continued our focus on shareholder value creation by repurchasing 3.8 million shares for approximately $151 million. Lastly, as Keith mentioned, we were pleased to enter into an agreement to sell Milgard Windows in September which will likely close in the fourth quarter. We expect proceeds after tax and expenses to be approximately $560 million from this transaction. At this time, we anticipate using the proceeds to paydown our $200 million debt maturity and for proximally $400 million of share repurchases.","With that, I'll now turn the call back over to Keith.","Keith Allman","Thank you, John. I'm pleased with our performance so far in 2019 and the second half of the year is progressing as expected. Our teams have done a tremendous job to position us to offset the impact of tariffs, while delivering on our commitments. Our markets are largely performing as planned with modest improvement expected in the second half of 2019.","Furthermore, the fundamentals of our markets remained solid and supportive of long-term growth. Existing home sales have improved to nearly 5.4 million units for the past three months, up about 3% from last quarter. Home prices, which are highly correlated with repair and remodel spending, continue to appreciate and the consumer remains healthy, with wages continuing to grow and unemployment at a 50-year low.","As many of you know, we recently held an Investor Day where we outlined our strategy and the initiatives that will drive growth over the next two to three years. In addition, we further detailed the next chapter of Masco as a focused and more resilient plumbing and decorative products company.","We have already begun to execute on these strategies with the completed the divestiture of our UK Window business, a signed agreement to divest Milgard for $725 million and very good progress with the Cabinetry sale process. Against solid fundamentals and focused execution on our strategies, strong cash flow and balanced capital allocation, we will continue to create value for our shareholders.","With that, we will now open up the call for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Stephen Kim with Everscore. Your line is open.","Stephen Kim","Thanks very much guys. Congratulations on a good quarter. I wanted to ask if I could about your Plumbing business, in particular the International business which it seemed like it performed well. You attributed that to Germany, China, and France. Last quarter I think you called out some weakness in LatAm, Italy, and Turkey, but what I'm trying to understand is, you attributed a lot of the strength to introducing new products into the market, and I was wondering if you could help us understand how much of the strength we saw there in the Plumbing International was due to like a load-in kind of a process, how much of it do you see as underlying growth which can continue, and whether the market you called out last quarter which were soft have improved or if Germany, China and France has simply offset that through the new products?","Keith Allman","I'll take that one Stephen, good morning. The overall growth was more from the good sell-through of those products and it was load-in and there was always a little bit of load-in in the channel, but fundamentally those products were taking off well and they are well received. In Italy and Turkey, haven't seen anything that's remarkable with regards to how those are performing. In other words, really not much of a change there from how they have performed.","It has really been a case of solid performance and good traction with our new products as we look across Central Europe and China. Our brands, the Hansgrohe and the high end actual brand is very well regarded in that space when you look at both through distribution and particularly when you look at the international projects, hotels, cruise ships, and the like. So we have strong brands and the new products are doing well, more from the sales of those products. And in some of the challenged markets, they kind of remained stable, where they were when we talked last quarter.","John Sznewajs","Yes and Stephen, the only the one thing I would probably add to Keith's comments, would be that if you look at our performance in the third quarter of 2018, I think we're up against relatively easy comp here in the third quarter of 2019, so I think that also aided in the top line growth that you saw.","Stephen Kim","Okay, got it. That's helpful, thank you guys. Second question relates to cabinet business which put up a very strong margin in this quarter, stronger than we were expecting and I know you took your guide for the year. I was curious as to, as we think about the fourth quarter though, it seems based on our numbers that we're looking for a pretty noticed, or you're looking for a noticeable decline in momentum in the margin there.","And so, I was just curious if you could comment on if there was any change in the margin trajectory in cabinets that is tied to actions that are worth calling out? And has there been any shifting of overhead out of cabinets that are also worth calling out?","Keith Allman","No real change in the margins trajectory. There hasn't been a shift of overhead if you will out of the business Stephen. With regards to the top line, we are lapping a pretty soft Q4 from 2018. If you recall the activity and this part of our business really slowed down late last year and we don't anticipate that happening.","And we are also launching some significant new products in the quarter, few new doors, more of the focus is on finishes and paint and the like, and we've you may recall put in some new technology in Paint and we think that has us in a very competitive position where we can do color changeovers almost in a batch of one type scenario with very minimal loss of productivity.","So we're able now to launch more frequently new colors and do it in an efficient way. And I think you see that when you look at the very competitive margin that we have against some of the broader industries and at relatively low volume when you look at where we stand. So we're working hard to leverage those investments. We're up against a little bit of a soft comp, but no real change in terms of any kind of overhead.","Stephen Kim","Great, thanks Keith.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Lovallo with Bank of America. Your line is open.","John Lovallo","Hey guys, thank you for taking my questions. The first one is, you gave us the EPS guide which is helpful, I'm just curious if there's any other moving pieces for comparable EBITDA forecast for the full-year? It looks like D&A is and interest, it looks like it is unchanged, but are there any other pieces or maybe could you just provide us with a 2019 EBITDA guide?","John Sznewajs","Yes, and John maybe, maybe I'll approach it in a different way with the discontinued ops and maybe give everyone a little bit better color as to how this impacted, is in pulling the Windows business out of continuing ops and into discontinued ops affected more of the bottom line. And maybe had an EBITDA that helped maybe obviously get you there and I don\u2019t get your question just by me now.","So if you think about, well as we exited the second quarter, but when \u2013 because right now consensus estimate [indiscernible] because people, some people have already pulled Windows out, but if you think about it, at the end of the second quarter before anyone started pulling it out, our consensus for Q3 at that time was $0.71 per share. Consensus at the time for the Windows segment was about $21 million. Now the one thing you have to add to that, when you pull Windows from continuing ops into discontinued ops, you have to add back about $1 million in corporate expense against, that was allocated to the Windows segment. So call it $22 million.","That $22 million is roughly $0.06 a share. So that $0.71 consensus for Q3 should have been about $0.65 once for Q3 once you pull the Windows business out. And then if you take a look at that, that same kind of math for the full-year John, full-year guide at the time was $2.62 to $2.72 again as we exited the second quarter. So the midpoint of that range was $2.66. Now when you remove the Windows from continuing ops and put it into discontinued ops, you pull about $40 million of operating profit, add to that I should say, about $5 million of corporate cost will come back to Masco, so about $45 million in aggregate, $45 million in aggregate with $45 million in aggregate adds up to about $0.12 in EPS.","So if you think about $2.66 midpoint less that $0.12 is about $2.54 a share, which is right in the heart of our current revised range of $2.52, right in the spot where we thought we would be as we exited the second quarter. So I'm hopeful that's helpful and hopefully that answers your question. If it didn't, let me know.","John Lovallo","Yes. No, that's very helpful. Thank you. And then as a follow-up, the debt paydown that you guys are talking about, now that seems like maybe a slight change of plan for the sale proceeds. Am I thinking about that right or was this kind of contemplated all along?","John Snewajs","Contemplated all along, John. Recall that at March 2020 maturity is only $200 million of [indiscernible] index eligible. So to refinance that we had always contemplated paying that down, and we did also get that out and mentioned that at the Investor Day. So I don't think there is anything, -- no, there is no new news there on that one.","John Lovallo","Okay. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Wood with Nomura Instinet. Your line is open.","Michael Wood","Hi. Good morning. Just a follow-up on the guidance, that reiteration at the midpoint excluding the discontinued ops, I see the Cabinetry and Decorative look like they were increased in terms of the profitability from the prior guidance. So can you just talk about what the offsets to that were?","John Snewajs","So, I think John or Mike, sorry, the offset to that would be perhaps a little bit lower volume that we experienced here in a little bit in Q3 in the Plumbing segment and a little bit in the Cabinetry segment, as well as some of the -- that particularly might continue as we go into the fourth quarter. As we've been putting in pricing some of that may add to a little bit with pricing elasticity there.","Michael Wood","Okay. And did the exterior paint and stain boost that you talk about, have more of an impact in either PRO or DIY. So could you just talk about what you saw I guess in growth for those two sub segments in Interior?","Keith Allman","If you look, Mike, paint volume was probably the largest contributor in this segment in terms of growth. We did have some price, but we're pleased with the low double-digit growth that we saw in the segment. It feels like we gained a bit of share, both in PRO and DIY. Our investments continued to pay off in the PRO and we continue to expand our capabilities. Pleased with the rollout of the new color center along with the Home Depot that's going well, that really enhances the shop -- shopping experience and leverages our leading quality position, the great value.","So we think we outperformed the market a little bit. Understandably, it is hard to pin the exact size of the market and quarter, from quarter-to-quarter, but with our low double-digit growth, we think we had a good quarter.","John Snewajs","Yes, Mike, and maybe to be more specific to the question, we don't think we saw real distinction between performance in exterior and deck stains in PRO versus DIY, we think it was pretty consistent with across both of those end customers.","Michael Wood","Okay, I appreciate it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Dahl with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Michael Dahl","Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. And John thanks for the clarity on the moving pieces around the guide. Follow-up to your response to one of Mike's questions on Plumbing and the elasticity comment, I think that was an area that you focused on that at the Investor Day as well. So just hoping if you could give us a little more color on how the environment has evolved over the past couple of months as you've looked to implement additional pricing to cover tariffs and just how you're thinking about the price volume trade off right now in Plumbing specifically?","Keith Allman","Mike this is Keith. We really haven't seen a change in terms of the elasticity or the dynamic of volume as it relates to pricing. We continued to see that the lower price point products tend to be more sensitive to price movement. Understandably there still is a lot of pricing activity occurring in the market. So it remains a challenge frankly to understand the specific SKU level elasticity competition around that particular price point in the assortment is so dynamic. So we've -- we feel we have a good handle on the elasticity and we have factored that in as it relates to how we go out with subsequent price increases to try to hit that sweet spot and lessen the volume impact.","With regards specifically to where we stand in the tariffs, we've largely implemented price and other measures to offset the 25% list three tariffs. And we continue to work -- you know it's a very dynamic and we'll see what happens ultimately, with the second part of list four, and whether or not there is any changes to list three.","So it's a dynamic environment, but fundamentally, not a lot has changed with regards to what we're driving. We're going to continue to work with our customers and with our supply chains. We're driving internal productivity teams to mitigate existing and any potential future tariffs.","Michael Dahl","That's helpful. Thanks Keith. A follow-up question, just shifting gears to Paint and the environment there, obviously is strong volumes and margins in the quarter. One of the areas that I think has been point of concern for some of the investment community is really just the promotional environment and what we're seeing more at a retail level between the big box customers, can you talk about just how the promotional environment has evolved in Paint and whether you expect and include any change in that dynamic within your fourth quarter commentary?","Keith Allman","Yes. Mike, the promotional environment has picked up a little bit so far this year, I'd say. I would add that our partner has been disciplined with their promotional activity, and we think that makes a lot of sense. We have selectively promoted certain products and have held certain events and we'll do that if we think it will drive profitable sales, but ultimately we're choosing to compete on the quality of our products, the selection, the service, the store environment, rather than just simply price and I think our Q3 results reflect that.","John Snewajs","And Mike, I'd like to -- one thing I'd like to reinforce that Keith said, is really the promotional cadence and amount is really determined by the retailers. It's not determined by the manufacturers. So it's really in their hands to determine those actions.","Michael Dahl","Okay. Thank you both.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Phil Ng with Jefferies. Your line is open.","Philip Ng","Hey guys. A competitor of yours mentioned a slower start to 3Q in general, but activity picked up in September and October. So curious if you've seen any directional change in the activity intra-quarter and if that's leading into fourth quarter, given your comment on the macro front on a pretty positive?","Keith Allman","Phil, we really don't like to talk about short-term trends in a -- very short-term trends in our business. So, we posted a good Q3 and there is always month-to-month changes in our business. So, I don't want to take too much away from any short-term performance in the company.","Philip Ng","Got it. And can you give us an update on where you are with the Cabinetry divestiture and given what you were able to get from a proceed standpoint on Windows, it seems like there could be some upside to what you guided at the Investor Day?","Keith Allman","If the process is going well it's a competitive process that speaks well to the quality of the business. We will talk more in detail as we get a signed agreement. For now, we'll just say that the process is going as planned.","Philip Ng","Okay. All right. Thanks for the color.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Justin Speer with Zelman & Associates. Your line is open.","Justin Speer","Hi, good morning. Thank you, guys. I was curious on your comment of raw material headwinds in the fourth quarter in Decorative. I would have expected tailwind, so I just wanted to get some context there?","Keith Allman","Justin, I would - I think it's important to note that raw materials and our cost basket are still up year-over-year. We are seeing some moderation for resins and TIO2. Long term, I'd remind you that when we look at our relationship between price and commodities, we tend to be flush over time. So we\u2019re not expecting significant material benefits to our margins and there is other costs at play here as well including labor and freight to name a couple. But fundamentally, we are seeing some moderation, but our basket is still up year-over-year.","Justin Speer","And does that cost basket you mentioned, does that also include - I think last quarter you mentioned in-store display spend increasing year-over-year in the second half, and particularly in the fourth quarter. Is that still the case? Maybe if you can give some context on how much that headwind is to profitability incrementally this year versus last year?","John Snewajs","Yes. Justin, that would be relatively small and not worth really calling out. The other thing that will have an impact on the fourth quarter is the fact that we'll feel more of the fuller effect of the tariffs in the fourth quarter, in that - particularly in that segment, because recall both Liberty Hardware and Kichler faced more of an import \u2013 are more of an import model, I should say. So that rolls into the cost basket as well.","Justin Speer","Okay. And then, just following up on that one last question, just if you can give us a sense for how you're preparing for the step-up in tariffs as you look to next year, maybe elaborate on how you feel about pricing and productivity, I know you touched it on a bit, those efforts, whether or not you can - you think you could fully offset as you see it today tariffs as you look to next year?","Keith Allman","Really no change from what we commented at the Investor Day. We think we've done a good job through a combination of levers, both productivity, working with our supply base to drive cost down. Some value engineering work that we've been really has been ongoing and then of course some pricing actions to cover list three. We have a go get out there for list four and we are working on doing that with regards to what might happen if list three goes up or the second phase of list four goes in, we'll have to see when that - if and when that comes.","In terms of how we're approaching it, again really no change. We're working hard on cost out. We're working hard on value engineering and we're going to continue to drive price factoring in what we're learning and this has been a learning process as it relates to the dynamics of the various assortments and all the moving parts and the price elasticity. So we're going to continue to be strategic in all aspects particularly in how we apply price.","Justin Speer","Thank you for the color. I appreciate it guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Rehaut with JP Morgan. Your line is open.","Michael Rehaut","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. First, just wanted to hit on and go back to the Windows proceeds and apologies if I didn't hear this right in the prepared remarks, but just wanted to get a sense number one, relative to your proceeds guidance back at the Analyst Day, roughly, what was the delta given the proceeds did appear to be a bit more than we were expecting?","I was just curious, based on your original proceeds guidance if there were some delta that you'd like to share with us? And as a result of that, does that change at all the timing and split of proceeds as it relates to share repurchase? I know that initially you guys have talked about maybe half upfront and half over the next nine months, given the change in what appears to be the higher than expected proceeds for Windows, dDoes that change any of your thoughts in terms of the capital allocation?","John Snewajs","Yes, Mike. So a couple of questions have been in there and the first one with respect to our total anticipated proceeds from the transactions and we said at Investor Day that we would expect at least $1 billion after-tax from these transactions. And I think we're definitely on pace to achieve that though as Keith mentioned we are working hard on the Cabinetry business and while we like the progress, it's not - there's not much to talk about at this point on that one.","With respect to our thoughts on allocating the capital or the proceeds that we receive from the Windows sale and if you think about that and how our cadence of cash flow comes in with the business. So we expect about $560 million of after-tax proceeds from that transaction and you consider that we've been roughly putting out about - in line with our $600 million initial guidance of share repurchases a year, and we're about $450 million year-to-date, so that would imply we've got $150 million to go plus the $560 million, so we'll call it roughly $700 million of capital allocate based on the proceeds from the Milgard transaction.","Well, if you think about the $200 million of debt retirement plus approximately $400 million to maybe a little bit more than that of share repurchase in the fourth quarter of this year, you get pretty close to that $700 million that we look to allocate. So I think our capital allocation is very much in line with what we communicated at the Investor Day. So we feel confident, we like where we are at, we like how transactions have evolved and so we feel good and confident about how we're allocating the capital.","Michael Rehaut","Now, that's great, John, I appreciate the detailed answer there. That was helpful. I guess, secondly, just going back to an earlier question around cabinet margins, I know you don't like to get too bogged down on these calls on segment margins by quarter, but the implied guidance, unless I'm doing the math wrong and I'd love your thoughts here, but the implied guidance were roughly 10.5% margins for cabinets for the full year, does imply a pretty steep fall off in the fourth quarter something around even 7% to 8%, if I'm doing the math right, which would be a nice year-over-year decline.","So I was just curious if there's anything that I'm doing wrong there, any items driving 4Q to have such a down year-over-year quarter after you've had such strong results for the first three quarters of the year?","John Snewajs","Yes, Mike, no, I don't think there's anything significant that's driving that down. I do - would remind you that seasonally the fourth quarter tends to be one of our slower quarters and so maybe it is more of the natural seasonal slowdown in that business that is driving the lower margin in the fourth quarter. Other than that, there is no one-off or unique items that we anticipate flowing through in Q4.","Michael Rehaut","All right, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ken Zener with KeyBanc. Your line is open.","Kenneth Zener","Good morning, gentlemen.","Keith Allman","Good morning, Ken.","John Snewajs","Good morning, Ken.","Kenneth Zener","I want to make sure I have you guys. What if I could ask a question a little differently about Plumbing trends? The strength that you guys have seen and stability, is there given how last year in the second half of '18 demand kind of deteriorated in some housing dynamics. Can you comment regionally to the extent you feel comfortable about any insights you might have, I mean, because for example the west which had contracted slowdown has improved. I mean can you discuss maybe a little bit how regional cadences flow through your business just to give us any insight?","Keith Allman","There is - there hasn't been a significant material difference as we look at the different regions, from what we typically expect. There is different things that happen from weather, we tend that to talk about that very much, but certainly there is some regional impact as storms and weather roll through. We have some ebbs and flows in different regions as it relates to new construction activity, but remember that we're about 90% repair and remodeling. So that tends to have a less of an effect on us.","We have different inventory and volume flows through channels that can affect us. So if you step back and really look at it, we haven't experienced a significant variability in terms of regional trends other than what we all talk about is as I said in terms of some weather patterns, really not a lot of difference.","Kenneth Zener","Okay. I appreciate that. I just thought I might ask you. Now Keith, I heard your comments on - earlier on price elasticity. Let me ask it this way, is the lower price point impacted by tariffs more, simply because tariffs are greater percent of the actual price versus the higher ended smaller percentage? Is that part of the dynamic that we would expect to see there is the lower price point impact from tariff price increases for increased...","Keith Allman","Sorry of that Ken, I stepped on it a little bit. Not really as it relates to the percentages per se, because the tariffs are basically a percent applied to the purchase cost, so that tends to be relatively the same. Where it tends to effect really is more of the sensitivity at that low price point and the fact that not always, but by and large when you look at goods that are procured from China, they tend to be more on that lower price point, part of the assortment.","So it's not so much percentage that, when you look at make versus buy, the buy tends to be a little bit heavier, skewed on the opening price points. And then you combine that with the more sensitivity to that price point that's where the elasticity comes to play.","Kenneth Zener","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Truman Patterson with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Truman Patterson","Hi. Good morning guys. Nice results. First I wanted to circle back on cabinets a little bit in the sale. The cabinets is having a very solid year, I think third quarter our profit was up almost 20%, so a nice results. At the same time when you look at the outlook, it appears more favorable. We've got some antidumping duties on the Chinese importers, et cetera. Is there a possibility that the sale maybe gets pushed back a little bit and doesn't close in the first quarter as you adjust your sales proceeds target and is that sales proceeds target higher today than maybe it was two or three quarters ago?","Keith Allman","We haven't changed our target. We talked at Investor Day about being more than a $1 billion and we're not moving off of that target. We feel good obviously about the transaction that came through with Windows. You mentioned antidumping, that really is not an impact on our sales process. On the cost side, we've been working through mitigating actions for quite some time now, we saw this coming and have moved the majority, far way the majority of our sourcing China for cabinets. So that's already been factored into it. It's been a competitive process. The process is going well and we have not changed our expectations in terms of timing.","Truman Patterson","Okay. And then on the PRO paint business, I believe at your Investor Day, you said that it was maybe 7% or so of market share nationwide around those levels. I know that there is kind of a multi-year run rate - runway to really grow this business, but is there a certain share or could you just discuss some of the share gains that you're targeting over the next several years?","Keith Allman","Our PRO sales now are approximately 25% of our coatings revenue. So we have seen good growth and good market share over the past, call it five years, that we've been strategically driving this initiative and this program. Very pleased with the double-digit growth that we saw, and understanding that the bigger this business gets, the more challenge it is to grow off that big base, that is a factor. But fundamentally, we believe in what we're doing and we think we have a very strong value proposition for the type of PRO that we're targeting.","And with the Behr paint, our product assortment, the brand, the service proposition that our partner, the Home Depot has worked so hard to develop, I think we have a strong value proposition for those PRO painters that we're going after. So our intent is to continue outgrow the market and we have every reason to believe that we're going to be able to continue to do that.","Truman Patterson","All right. Thank you all.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Megan McGrath with Buckingham Research. Your line is open.","Megan McGrath","Good morning. I just wanted to think a little bit longer term and put the third quarter results in the context of some of your commentary around the Analyst Day. If I take out cabinets your revenue growth in the third quarter is above your expectations for the next couple of years in terms of the top line.","And I know some of your forecasts were based off industry forecasts about repair and remodel maybe slowing, but you did talk about seeing modest improvement. So putting that altogether, are you feeling - I realized we are only quarter in and not so far off your Analyst Day, but are you feeling any more constructive about those end markets in that longer term context?","John Sznewajs","Megan, it's John. I would say we were not going to adjust our thinking about the long-term based on one quarter's results. Yes, and again we did have a very good quarter. We have - in some instances, we are up against a tough comp, which makes us feel good, but, long-term the fundamentals of the markets are what they are, and we do think that low single-digit growth in the overall markets is going to be what we experience in the next - in the coming several years and so really no change to our long-term view on the markets relative to our performance during in Q3.","Megan McGrath","Okay, thanks. And then just quickly on - in the quarter on Kichler, you did say that it was down again in the quarter, but was there any kind of incremental movement there, was it down less than last quarter, same as it has been, any detail there?","Keith Allman","As we've talked in the past, this category is going to be challenged throughout the year for us with increased costs. And as you know the tariffs hit this in our hardware business particularly hard. And we made the strategic choice to be very disciplined in terms of our pricing actions and that has effect on the top line.","We are performing well and the team is performing well, as it relates to realizing savings and improving our business processes and integrating the company, cost savings like ocean freight and continuous improvement projects to reduce labor in a variety of other sourcing, savings that we're driving. So, there is going to be some challenge in the top line for this business in 2019, as I've talked about in the past, but long-term, we like the prospects of the business and are confident that we're going to achieve our long-term return expectations on this acquisition.","Megan McGrath","Great, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research. Your line is open.","Eric Bosshard","Thank you. The Paint segment, Keith, I appreciate your comments that the color center and the product quality is dragging this more than the promotions. I'm curious around the sustainability of the double-digit growth this quarter, how we should thinking about that performing moving forward?","Keith Allman","When - in terms of the total Paint market?","Eric Bosshard","No, you're Paint business, specifically.","Keith Allman","We've got a good proposition as I've talked about in detail in the past and I believe in it and we're continuing to invest in it, both in terms of the customer experience in the isle for DIY as well as the PROs experience and our channel partners investing and continue to drive that. Our commitment is to continue to outperform the market. And we think that this market is a good market for us going forward and we intend to continue to take share both in DIY and in the PRO.","John Sznewajs","And Eric, we're not moving off of our Investor Day from five weeks ago, when we said that DIY should grow low single-digit over the next several years and PRO should grow in the mid-single digit range over the course of the next several years. So I look back to that discussion that we had to think about our long-term view on the growth of our Paint business.","Eric Bosshard","Okay, and then within this quarter's performance is the upside relative to those targets, faster markets. I'm just trying to understand what drove the magnitude of growth in the business this quarter, the upside?","Keith Allman","It's, it's always a combination of volume and price this quarter. Volume was the larger contributor and we're pleased with that result. So we think we gained a little bit of share. So to answer your question directly, it was more volume driven than anything in the quarter.","Our investments in the PRO are paying off. As I mentioned, we're rolling out the new Color Solution Center along with the Home Depot. That really helps the shopping experience. And I think we're well positioned to continue to outperform.","Eric Bosshard","And then the follow-up on Kichler, can you frame at all for us just what the year-over-year numbers look like in the business at this point?","John Sznewajs","No, Eric, we don't break out the performance of individual businesses. Once they lap the acquisition period, no, we just don't break those out.","Eric Bosshard","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Bouley with Barclays. Your line is open.","Matthew Bouley","Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. Just to clarify on the share repurchase post the divestitures, at the Analyst Day, you guys talked about deploying half of the proceeds immediately to buyback, give or take. So should we expect that $400 million from Windows sort of as an ASR maybe in Q4 and then perhaps there would be a second accelerated repurchase after the sale of cabinets, is that how we should model that?","John Sznewajs","Yes, Matthew. We'll take a look at the market conditions and decide on the form of transaction. It could be an ASR. It could be open market or repurchase or a combination thereof and so it all depends on how we see the market and we'll make a decision based on that.","Matthew Bouley","Okay, got it. And then just back to the elasticity question in Plumbing. Obviously you guys talk about the volume impact there, but as you raise prices across kind of the spectrum of price points, I mean to what extent do you guys think you actually see volumes go away versus perhaps customers simply trading down to lower price points? So are you suspecting that there's possibly more of a mix impact rather than a volume impact?","Keith Allman","It varies Matthew by category and if you think about the repair component of it as well. So in some cases, let's say, particularly in Plumbing where there is a repair component there, there really is a much of a delay. So if there was a price sensitive consumer in that realm, then that would represent a down trading. In other areas there is more of an ability to postpone. I think we're seeing some of that in lighting and hardware where they can postpone a purchase.","So it's - I think it's a combination, and it varies. And in some cases, there is less price sensitivity. We mentioned having a record quarter in our spa business, that's a discretionary very expensive purchase, well worth the money, but cost a few dollars to get that, and we had a record quarter. So it really does vary by type of product.","Matthew Bouley","All right. I appreciate all the detail. Thanks again.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Keith Hughes with SunTrust. Your line is open.","Keith Hughes","Thank you. On the PRO paint business, it had started of a little slower in the year and you had a \u2013 you are back to kind of your double-digit growth we've seen for the last couple of years. I guess the question is, what's happened this year, we've seen a little bit more uneven performance and there was a question earlier about promotions, now, that's really more for DIY, have you seen promotional activity in the PRO paint business as well this year?","Keith Allman","I think one of the impacts in terms of choppiness in PRO this year was that we don't like to talk about weather, but undoubtedly there was some unfavorable weather in the first half. So in the prepared remarks John talked a little bit about pent-up demand. That's really what we were referring to there. So I think there was a lift there.","I talked about the size of our PRO business and the bigger you get the harder it is to get bigger. And we are seeing some of that, but again we believe in our investments, and we believe in the value proposition for the type of PRO that we're going after and we're continuing together with Home Depot to continue to invest in that.","So there will be quarter-to-quarter choppiness, there is no question about it, but fundamentally, we're committed to outgrowing the market and we've demonstrated that.","John Sznewajs","In terms of promotional activity on the PRO, Keith, not a lot news there. There is relatively consistent promotional activity on the PRO side.","Keith Hughes","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen that concludes today's call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect. Everyone have a wonderful day."],"13824":["Masco Corporation (NYSE:MAS) Q3 2014 Earnings Conference Call October 28, 2014  8:00 AM ET","Executives","Irene Tasi - Director, Investor Relations","Keith Allman - President and Chief Executive Officer","John Sznewajs - VP, Treasurer and Chief Financial Officer","Analysts","Garik Shmois - Longbow Research","Stephen East - ISI Group","Michael Dahl - Credit Suisse","Keith Hughes - SunTrust","Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates","Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research","Michael Rehaut - JPMorgan","Bob Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets","George Staphos - Bank of America","Phil Ng - Jefferies","Tim Wojs - Robert W.

Welcome to Masco Corporation's Third Quarter 2014 Conference Call. My name is Steve and I will be your operator for today's call. As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded for replay purposes. (Operator Instructions)","I will now turn the call over to Director of Investor Relations, Irene Tasi. Irene, you may begin.","Irene Tasi","Thank you, Steve, and good morning to everyone. Welcome to Masco Corporation's third quarter 2014 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Keith Allman, President and CEO of Masco; and John Sznewajs, Masco's Vice President, Treasurer and Chief Financial Officer.","Our third quarter earnings release and the presentation slides that we will refer to during the call are available on the Investor Relations portion on our website. Following our prepared remarks, the call will be open for analysts' questions. As a reminder, we would appreciate it if you could limit yourself to one question with one follow-up. If we are unable to take your question during the call, please feel free to contact me directly at 313-792-5500.","I'd like to remind you that statements in today's presentation will include our views about Masco's future performance, which constitute forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. We've described these risks and uncertainties in our risk factors and other disclosures in our Form 10-K and Form 10-Q that we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","Today's presentation also includes non-GAAP financial measures. Any references to operating profit, earnings per share or cash flow on today's call will be as adjusted, unless otherwise noted, with a reconciliation of these adjusted measurements to GAAP in our quarterly press release and presentation slides, which can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website, masco.com.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Keith Allman.","Keith Allman","Thank you, Irene, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 4. Consistent with our performance throughout the year, Masco delivered another quarter of revenue and margin growth. I'm pleased with this performance, particularly when you consider the tough comparisons we faced. Recall that in the third quarter of 2013, our topline increased by 12% and our operating profit margin expanded by 260 basis points. Despite this tough comparison, we increased our topline in this quarter by 4% and expanded our profit margin by 60 basis points. This represents the best third quarter we've had since 2007.","As a result of this performance, we achieved 15% growth in EPS to $0.31 per common share. I would note that unfortunate higher medical costs and other expenses cost us $0.01 per share in the quarter. Our performance was primarily driven by Plumbing Products, Other Specialty, and Installation and Services segments. Similar to last quarter, our plumbing and windows businesses experienced strong sales and favorable mix primarily in the trade and showroom channel.","In North America, the investments we've made in new products and programs continue to pay off. Delta achieved a record sales quarter in Q3. We are very pleased with our Delta toilet program, which has sold over 0.5 million units in less than two years. This is just one example of how our consumer-focused innovations and strong brands continue to drive growth.","Despite a softening Eurozone, our international businesses fared well. Hansgrohe, for example, continued their strong execution and achieved yet another record sales quarter. In total, our international sales were up 5% in the quarter, 3% in local currency. I'm extremely proud of both teams and congratulate them on their exceptional execution.","Our Installation business delivered another quarter of solid growth by capitalizing on new home construction trends and executing on their strategy to diversify their business into the commercial and retrofit channels. As we announced last month, our teams are working on the spin-off transaction of this business and it remains on track to be completed by mid-year 2015.","As I previously communicated, our Cabinets segment's turnaround is the top priority. In the quarter, we took additional actions to improve the future performance of this business. Our industry-leading lead times are a hallmark of our Merillat brand and we have made the necessary investments to meet that brand promise. We also announced the closure of two idle facilities in the business as we're confident that we can meet our growth plans without this capacity.","Despite our near-term challenges in cabinetry, our overall company performance reinforces that our strategies are working. We'll continue to execute and invest in innovation, customer-focused programs and brand to drive our business.","Let me give you some examples of how we continue to lead the industry with innovation. The Home Depot awarded Behr its Innovation of the Year Award for Marquee interior. And the EPA named Delta its 2014 WaterSense Partner of the Year for the third time in four years.","Before I turn the call over to John, I'd like to leave you with three key takeaways. Number one, we have taken important action at Cabinets to make the business more competitive in the long term. These actions have resulted in cost variances that were higher than expected, but necessary for the turnaround of the business. We have restored our lead times in Q3 and are positioning this business for growth in 2015.","Number two, I'm pleased with the overall performance in the third quarter. We posted our strongest third quarter for the company since 2007 and I feel very good about that. ","Number three, our focus on our strategic initiatives is paying off. We are being recognized as industry leaders in innovation by our customers and we are executing successfully despite fluid macroeconomic environments in both Europe and North America.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to John who will take you through our segments from a financial and operational perspective.","John Sznewajs","Thank you, Keith, and good morning, everyone. As Irene mentioned, my comments will focus on adjusted performance, excluding the impact of rationalization and other one-time charges. Looking at the third quarter, you can see our consistent execution resulted in our 12th consecutive quarter of year-over-year sales and profit growth. Sales increased 4% as we recorded strong sales growth in three of our five segments and we're up against very good performance in the third quarter of the last year.","Sales in North America were up 4% for the quarter. As the US economy improves, we are experiencing growing demand for our repair and remodeling and new home construction products. As a reminder, repair\/remodel activity represents approximately 70% of our total sales. International sales increased 3% in local currency in the quarter, driven by core market growth of our international plumbing business and our UK businesses.","Our focus on cost control continues to pay off as SG&A as a percent of sales decreased 50 basis points to 17.7% as compared to the third quarter of last year. And we delivered strong bottomline performance as operating income increased 9% in the quarter to $243 million with operating margins expanding 60 basis points to 10.9%. We continue to be pleased with the growth in our operating margins. This is one of our best quarters in several years and it reflects the benefits of our brand strength, innovation pipeline, operating leverage and efforts to reduce costs. Our strong operating leverage resulted in 26% incremental margins in the quarter and our EPS was $0.31, an improvement of $0.04 or 15% compared to the third quarter of last year.","Turning to Slide 7, we see the components of our operating income improvement in the quarter. The $7 million increase in net volume mix was principally driven by increased volume in our decorative architectural, plumbing and installation segments largely due to increased repair\/remodel activity and continued recovery in new home construction. This strength was partially offset by negative mix in our decorative architectural segment due to stronger Pro paint sales.","Net price commodity improved approximately $11 million for the third quarter, largely driven by our Cabinets, Installation, Other Specialty and Plumbing segments. This improvement was partially offset by an unfavorable relationship in the Decorative Architectural segment.","We captured $42 million of profit improvements gross in the quarter. These improvements were partially offset by program support, growth initiative spend and inefficiencies in our cabinet operation. For 2014, we expect to generate $150 million of profit improvements gross, similar to what we have delivered on average for each of the last five years, largely coming from continuous improvement in supply chain work.","We are reducing our estimate of the annual benefit from $10 million to approximately flat due to the growth investments and incremental cost we incurred in our cabinet business and other expenses.","Turn to Slide 8, you can see we delivered another quarter of solid performance in our Plumbing segment, with sales increasing 4%, driven by growth in our faucets and showers, rough plumbing and spas. We saw the greatest strength in our wholesale, showroom and dealer customers. This reflects our continued investments in the showroom and commercial segments of this channel. And as a result, we are benefiting from a richer mix of products. For example, our Hansgrohe Select line, our showroom-focused Brizo faucets and our Highlife spas, all continued to outperform in the quarter.","Our European business experienced modest gains with sales increasing 2% in local currency despite soft economic conditions. And we delivered strong operating leverage with nearly 50% incremental margins in the quarter with a substantial portion of this coming from increased volume and productivity improvements.","Turning to Slide 9, you can see that we are flat in the Decorative Architectural segment in the third quarter. As a reminder, we were up against tough comparisons. Our Q3 2013 performance in the segment was extremely strong with revenue up over 9% over 2012 when we successfully launched Marquee exterior and DECKOVER. In Q3 of this year, we successfully completed the rollout of Behr Marquee interior product, which was awarded Home Depot's innovation of the year. Segment sales were favorably impacted by $6 million of load in sales of this product. In addition, our focused approach on speeding our Pro business continues to gain momentum.","And Liberty Hardware had another strong quarter, achieving solid top and bottomline growth through continued share gains from successful new product introductions and program expansions in the retail channel. Offsetting this growth was the timing of replenishment orders for Behr products at the end of Q3, which we believe reduced Q3 sales by $10 million to $15 million. Behr is now seeing strong replenishment orders here in October.","Operating margins contracted slightly in the quarter, primarily due to unfavorable price commodity relationship, driven by increased material cost and unfavorable mix driven by our Pro initiative. We also incurred approximately $3 million of expense relating to the rollout of Behr's new color center displays at The Home Depot in select markets in North America. As we continue this rollout in Q4 and in 2015, we expect additional color center expense of approximately $3 million in the fourth quarter, approximately $11 million in 2015, the majority of which will be realized in the first half of the year. Also, the incremental advertising expense of $5 million was delayed from Q3 and we will now incur this expense in the fourth quarter of this year.","Turning to our Cabinets segment on Slide 10, you can see our Cabinet segment sales grew 2% in the third quarter. Sales increased due to a favorable mix and strong international performance. Within North America, we saw improved sales in the dealer channel as our recently introduced [ph] Kraft Advantage program gained traction. It is critical that we restart our lead times and to do so effectively and quickly. As Keith mentioned a few minutes ago, our lead times are back to industry-leading standards. In doing so, we incurred additional costs that impacted our profitability in the quarter.","We estimate that total charges due to the plant closure, ERP implementation and the associated inefficiencies of these initiatives in this segment will aggregate approximately $35 million in 2014, $10 million each in Q1 and Q2, $8 million in Q3 and approximately $7 million in the fourth quarter.","Furthermore, we took action this quarter to sell our two builder-focused mothballed chemistry plants that make Merillat product. As we reviewed our capacity, we determined that we did not need these facilities. This resulted in a one-time rationalization charge of $28 million. We expect annual savings from this action of approximately $3 million.","Turning to Installation on Slide 11, the segment sales growth of 8% was driven by solid results in our residential new construction, commercial and distribution channels. Multi-family activity remains strong and we're seeing improved mix with increased activity from custom builders.","Our operating profit improved $1 million of 5% compared to the third quarter of last year as a result of increased volume and our favorable price commodity relationship that was offset by wage inflation and approximately $4 million and one-time increased medical and other insurance-related expenses.","Turning to Slide 12, our Other Specialty Products segment sales increased 8%, driven by North American window business as we experienced continued favorable mix shift towards our premium window into our product lines. Our European window business also positively contributed to this segment's top and bottomline due to continued improvement in the UK remodeling market. The segment's operating profit rose 25% due to favorable mix and increased volume as a result of the stronger remodeling environment.","And turning to Slide 13, our balance sheet strengthened in the quarter as a result of the reversal of our deferred tax asset valuation allowance. We were able to reverse the valuation allowance because of our continued profitable growth and our improving outlook for our business. Working capital as a percent of sales came in at 12.7%, a 20 basis sequential improvement from the second quarter of this year. I want to thank our supply chain, operations and finance teams for driving this great outcome. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.6 billion of balance sheet liquidity and our credit metrics continue to improve.","Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Keith.","Keith Allman","Thank you, John. Moving to Slide 15, before going to Q&A, I'd like to highlight what we're doing to drive our business going forward. We are continuing to focus on strengthening our brands through customer-driven innovation. This is not only driving share gains for us, but it's also strengthening our strategic relationships with key customers.","Cost control continues to be a critical part of our strategy going forward. This enables us to expand margins as we convert increased volume with strong operating leverage. Fixing Cabinets is the top priority. We have taken the necessary actions to position the business for improved performance. With regards to our capital allocation strategy, we will continue to execute going forward as we're confident in the long-term prospect of our business and our ability to drive shareholder value.","Our strong performance this quarter reflects our continued execution against our strategic priorities to drive the full potential of our businesses, to leverage opportunities across our businesses and to actively manage our portfolio. We are confident that this will lead to increased shareholder value and position Masco for even greater growth.","With that, I'd like to open up the call for questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Garik Shmois from Longbow Research.","Garik Shmois - Longbow Research","Just wondering, first off, if you could just talk high level with respect to the cadence of R&R over the course of the quarter? I think coming out of the second quarter, you're still seeing stronger growth in the lower ticket items, seeing better mix on the higher ticket items. Most of the growth has come from low ticket. Is that still the case in the third quarter? If you could just talk about some of the variances, that'll be great.","Keith Allman","We continue to see our R&R growth fairly steady from what we've seen in the last quarter. And going forward, we look at it approximately GDP plus 2, in that range. With regards to the demand as it relates to smaller ticket versus bigger ticket, again very similar to last quarter. We're seeing good volume on the opening price points in our retail channel on the higher end. Bigger ticket items, we're seeing good wholesale and showroom volume. So I would characterize our R&R volume as being constant with what we saw last quarter.","Garik Shmois - Longbow Research","Now that we have several weeks since you've announced the results of your strategic review, I just wonder if you can maybe provide a little bit more color around the $30 million to $40 million worth of cost savings that you previously announced and what the timing of the rollout of the cost savings program is going to look like in the P&L?","Keith Allman","As we implement that, we expect our run rate post-spend to be in terms of corporate SG&A in the range of $100 million.","John Sznewajs","Our general corporate expense has been running in the range of $30 million to $35 million a quarter. Maybe you saw here in the third quarter that on adjusted basis that came down to $22 million. It's probably a little light just given the rationalization charges and the severance charges that we incurred in the third quarter, because all the action was taken on September 30th. So as Keith mentioned just a minute ago, going forward, I think what you should expect to see from us is a general corporate expense number in the circa $100 million range on an annual basis with a little bit of ups and downs on an individual quarter basis. Now that said, we really won\u2019t get to that run rate until this spin is executed.","So between now and then, we will continue to experience some additional severance cost each quarter as we have some people staying through to help us with the spin. And secondly, we will be incurring $10 million a quarter in spin related costs that will be running through general corporate expense as well. So I think in the near term, it'll stay in that $30 million to $35 million. We'll see the benefits starting in the third quarter of next year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Stephen East from ISI Group.","Stephen East - ISI Group","Looking at your Plumbing, the sustainability of your out margin as you move forward, you've turned in some great results. And I know in the past, you've talked about expecting those to come down. As you look out over the next year or two years, what would you expect the trajectory to be? How quickly do you think that's coming down, because it stayed up much better than what we thought?","Keith Allman","A big determinant of that is our mix and where the growth in the global market comes. As we've seen higher growth in emerging markets, that mix tends to be a little bit more dilutive. Also a significant contributor would be the growth rate of our adjacent products as we expand into other areas of the bath in North America. That bath is also a lower margin play for us, but good return on our investments. So the key determiner on our sustainability, if you will, on those margins in that space is the growth rate around category expansion and the growth rate in emerging markets, both of which is our focus and both tend to be a little bit lower margin.","Stephen East - ISI Group","And then looking at Cabinets, I know coming into this quarter you thought you'd have about $5 million in incremental costs and then be done with it. You're now looking at between this quarter and next quarter about $15 million. Could you just talk a bit more expansively about what you're doing now versus what you thought you would do a quarter ago? And watched your mixes with your dealer profitability we would have expected that to give you a bit of a bump and that didn't occur either. So maybe just give us some color on what's actually happening there.","Keith Allman","We made a decision to more aggressively get back to our industry-leading lead times in the Merillat brand. Again, we're talking on the builder side of the business mainly. We put an extreme focus on that as we listened to our customer base and understood the value of that. And in doing so, we put mainly labor inefficiencies in play as we made those improvements.","Stephen East - ISI Group","Will that just quickly evaporate then as you get past the fourth quarter or is that something that we've got to anniversary in the third quarter of next year?","Keith Allman","We think we'll see in the range of $5 million to $10 million of inefficiencies associated with this that bleed into next year and then after that will be clean.","John Sznewajs","We expect that to be wrapped up by the middle of the year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Dahl from Credit Suisse.","Michael Dahl - Credit Suisse","I wanted to go back to one of the first questions on the new restructuring program and I guess in the context of you've got $150 million of gross profit improvement this year. Now you're saying with all these other investments, no net benefit. Wondering if you could give some thoughts out as we look into 2015 between additional profit improvement programs and the restructuring? What do you actually expect to see as far as net profit benefit?","John Sznewajs","As we have in the last several years, we've only generated about $150 million of profit improvements on a gross basis. And those profit improvements are driven by lean efficiencies, supply chain work, et cetera. And those are offset by things generally like wage inflation, medical benefit inflation and other things that we incur on a regular basis with our business. And typically, for the last five years, we've been about neutral on our net benefit on price commodity. This year we're anticipating a slight benefit. I think in the beginning of the year, we're hopeful if we could get $15 million to $20 million of a net benefit.","That didn't materialize this year. We ran into some unanticipated inefficiencies at our Cabinet operation that we did not clearly expect at the beginning of the year. And so that quickly ate into our expected net benefit to bring that down to zero here.","So as we look forward into 2015, while we haven't finished our budgeting process yet, I would be hopeful if we could generate some net benefit. Probably we'll give you a little bit more color on that benefit at the Analyst Day in February. And we can layer that number on top of that $30 million to $40 million benefit that we expect to get, and that's going to be a one-time benefit that we expect to get as a result of the headcount reductions that we announced on September 30th. Sorry, I can't give you a little bit more color at this point. We're still working through our budgeting process here.","Michael Dahl - Credit Suisse","My second question is the share price performance has been a bit disappointing post the announcement of all the spin and other initiatives and capital allocation. Have you given thought to some sort of accelerated repurchase, given clearly you've got enough cash on the balance sheet today?","Keith Allman","Mike, there's a number of ways to execute a share repurchase program and we're looking at a variety of options on how to do so.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Keith Hughes with SunTrust.","Keith Hughes - SunTrust","Two questions on specifically your European business. It did very well in the quarter. You read the same headlines I read on Europe. Are you getting any sort of read from your businesses in Europe what they believe the trajectory looks like for the next several quarters? And then question two, if you can give us any kind of commentary on how October trends across the entire business are ruuning?","John Sznewajs","With respect to Europe, I think we're seeing a little bit of two different stories in Europe. Our continental European businesses are seeing the slower growth, as evidenced by the 2% up that I mentioned in local currency in Plumbing. So relatively soft growth, a good growth compared to overall GDP that the Eurozone is putting up. That said, I'd tell you our UK businesses continue to benefit from the strength in housing in the UK. We saw very good strength in the UK both in our window, our plumbing business and our cabinet business from a topline perspective.","Keith Allman","In October, we're seeing good steady growth. I'd characterize it as being consistent with what we've seen in this past quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dennis McGill from Zelman & Associates.","Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates","Keith, my first question just has to do with the inefficiencies on the cabinet side. Are you to the point now where the efficiencies are just your burden as far as the plants that aren't well and you're having to incur additional cost to get the product out the door? I think you said lead times are back to normal, but quality or anything that would impact their business?","Keith Allman","I would say it's more of the former. It's our issue and we're working our way back to our more normalized level of efficiencies and productivities. We've put a bit of focus on getting our lead times back to our customer base. Our quality is good. We're by and large over the issues with the customer. And these are internal issues that we're now focused on currently and then certainly into 2015 with a solid work stream of issues that we're driving to get that productivity back.","Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates","So there's still some issues for customers, but for the most part that's fine?","Keith Allman","We're not perfect with the customer base, but I'd tell you we're back to our industry-leading lead time and significantly improved.","Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates","With respect to the fourth quarter share repurchases, can you walk through what would you need to see to execute the share repurchase now if you're in place and in position to execute the share repurchase for the fourth quarter?","Keith Allman","We're committed to what we've disclosed, which is buying back 50 million shares over the next few years. In terms of our specific cadence, you'll see that as we report our Q.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Eric Bosshard from Cleveland Research.","Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research","First question on Cabinet profitability. You had outlined the plan for what you're going to accomplish in that business over the last three years and you've obviously had some execution issues that you're remedying. I'm curious what you think about the path of recovering Cabinet profit as we look out over the next year once we get through what you dealt with in 2014?","Allman","Fixing Cabinets is a priority for us, there's no question about it. We view that as the best path to shareholder value creation. As we talked earlier with Dennis' question, we're driving productivity and add work streams that we're focused on. We have a solid innovation pipeline and new products where we're listening to our customers and delivering on that. And we'll talk about those as they happen. But we feel good about that. And with regards to the share gain, it will drive. Of course increasing the volume would be helpful for us.","Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research","The improvement in profits that was expected this year, is the recovery next year now off of the base that we'll experience in 2014, or can we have a more significant ramp-up, obviously excluding the charges, and how the profit recovered plays out in the Cabinet business?","Keith Allman","I think it'll be more significant and that we don't expect those costs and the inefficiencies associated with driving from five to two ERP systems and closing down the factories that we've had. So in the range of $20 million to $25 million, we don't expect that to re-occur.","Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research","In the paint business, understand the investments that are being made for Pro and for the color center and the new product. But I'm curious how we should be thinking about the margin opportunity in that business in 2015? Is this another year where margins erode a little bit and you trade some margin for volume, or how should we be thinking about the medium-term future margins of the paint business?","Keith Allman","I think we look at that business consistently. And that is we still think that this business is generally high-teens margins. Absolutely we need to make investments in this business and we'll incur some expense in doing so, yes, but we still think the margin profile of this business is not significantly unchanged.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Rehaut from JPMorgan.","Michael Rehaut - JPMorgan","First question I had also is on Cabinet, and I just want to shift the focus a second to the topline. You actually had a very difficult comp in that quarter as well aside from the difficult comp in decorative. You're actually able to grow roughly 2%. You mentioned some of the drivers and restoring of lead times. But I was wondering if you could get a little more granular in terms of what you're seeing in each of your difference channels? And to the extent that there is perhaps getting back on the horse type of effect in the dealer channel with the lead times, if that's something that you could expect to continue to positively benefit from over the next few quarters?","Keith Allman","As you know, we've had significant new product introductions and programs aimed at providing differentiation of better service and helping our dealers make more money, and that's paying off. So we're seeing some nice consistent growth and share gain in the dealer channel.","On the builder side, we're keeping the business we want to keep. There's some business that didn't make sense for us from a profitability standpoint. There's some business that we moved to more efficiently serve through our dealer network. And we are enjoying the macroeconomics of some 10% gain and starts this year versus last year.","On the retail side, we've got aggressive and made some moves with regards to our pricing and promotion strategies and we're working to find that sweet spot and the elasticity to be more effective.","Michael Rehaut - JPMorgan","And just want to circle back, John, to the question of corporate expense. It had come down. Last quarter it was down $8 million year-on-year, this quarter $9 million, and I think you referred to some timing charges. But just wanted to be certain. I think you had said that you expect 4Q to get back to that $30 million to $35 million run rate, which is actually pretty steep increase. So just wanted to make sure if that's the case or if there be any beginning benefits from those cost saving actions that were announced last month?","John Sznewajs","As I mentioned, we expect to incur $8 million to $10 million of transaction or spin related costs as we move forward for the next several quarters. That $30 million to $35 million drops to kind of circa $25 million on an adjusted basis absent the one-time spin related cost.","Michael Rehaut - JPMorgan","And so that $8 million to $10 million per quarter?","John Sznewajs","Per quarter. That's right, Mike.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bob Wetenhall from RBC Capital Markets.","Bob Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets","Just wanted to understand if you took out the ERP cost and the impact of the polar vortex, would you guys be running breakeven in the Cabinets year-to-date? And on a longer-term basis, once you finish rationalization, what's the normal way to thinking about profitability in terms of EBIT margin for this business?","Keith Allman","I think it's fair to put back that $30 million to $35 million of incremental inefficiency cost that we have incurred. And then when you look at our growth rate, you could see our drop-down margin in the range of 40%. We're focused on attaining share and growing with the market. So I think that's a good way to look at it.","Bob Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets","What kind of normalized EBIT margin do you think that implies just for modeling this out?","Keith Allman","I think we'll get into more detail on February as we lay out our margin going forward into, Bob.","John Sznewajs","You factor out the $35 million, but you look at our normal drop-down margin on this business. We should be in the 30%, 35% range on growth. So you see that going forward. As we make our way back from housing starts of circa 1 million this year to 1.5 million, you can kind of factor that drop-down incremental margin into your model.","Bob Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets","On the paint business, I thought revenues would be a little bit higher. It looks like you're investing into business. Can you give us an idea of what you're seeing in terms of ebb and flow? It sounds like October was a stronger. You were weaker last quarter because of inventory replenishment. What are you seeing in the channel and how are the competitive dynamics playing out? I'm aware you guys had a tough comp last year. How do we think about growth going forward and reinvesting behind the business?","Keith Allman","We feel good about paint and we are continuing to reinvest behind it, no question about it. We had a tough comp in the range of 9% last quarter. We had some inventory timing issues in the channel. We're seeing good replenishment orders coming back. So we continue to be positive on the growth prospects of paint.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of George Staphos from Bank of America.","George Staphos - Bank of America","I guess the question I had related to Cabinets again. The closing of the mothballed plant, I'm assuming that didn't have much, if any, ongoing expense until the closures, but if there was any expense, what could we perhaps build into our forecast longer term in terms of some margin benefit from that? And in turn, you were keeping these facilities mothballed presumably for some time on your expectations demand would come back and need that capacity. What has changed other than your outlook or your supply chain where these facilities can now be closed?","John Sznewajs","On the expense or the benefit side, we were not incurring significant cost to keep these facilities around. So we were simply continuing to secure them. So the benefit now by primarily closing those will be approximately $3 million per year.","Keith Allman","There were a couple of factors in deciding to take these plants completely offline. One is our efficiencies that we're seeing in our component plants. As you recall, we closed two component plants and moved that volume into one and we wanted to be sure of our capacity capability in that plant. What we're seeing is encouraging. So we have good capacity improvements versus our initial plan as we've ramped that factory.","Secondly, as John alluded to, there was a whole lot of cost to keeping these plants online, and we chose to keep that for a while as a buffer to see if we were to going to see a significant spike in new home construction mainly as this is focused on the Merillat and our builder business. Good growth, we're seeing 10% uptick, but we wanted to make sure that we are prepared should we see something significantly greater. And we're not seeing that. So that's why we made the decision to take them completely offline.","George Staphos - Bank of America","A quick question on decorative work, to the extent that you can comment and perhaps you can, you mentioned orders are good, replenishment is good. Do you have any sense on what retail growth is for your brands early into the fourth quarter?","Keith Allman","George, we don't have that number here in the early fourth quarter at this time. We haven't closed out the month of October just yet.","George Staphos - Bank of America","Do you have a view on what third quarter looked like from a retail standpoint? POS?","Keith Allman","No, I am not in a position to share that with you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Phil Ng from Jefferies.","Phil Ng - Jefferies","Your Cabinets business has lagged the market in 2014. Now that your cycle is through some ERP issues, how do you expect your growth to shift or stack up against the market?","Keith Allman","Our objective is to take share. We're doing that with our products and our programs. We're going to do that with more consistent delivery on our lead times. It was a tough year for us in '14. We made some fundamental improvements to the business, taken our ERP systems from five to two, shutting down two significant component plants, taken these mothballed plants offline. We've reinvigorated our product development process and we're focused on the customer needs, and it's paying off. But it was a tough year with regards to our performance. We understand more about the elasticity in our pricing and program schemes in retail, which we'd like to continue to refine, which we think will drive share as well. So we plan on outperforming the market in '15.","Phil Ng - Jefferies","Do you think most of the share gains going forward would be driven more on the retail side, as you price your products a little more competitive, are you a little more upbeat on the dealer side?","Keith Allman","I'm upbeat on both sides for different reasons that we've talked about. Certainly the dealer segment in this industry is significantly bigger than the retail, and we intend to gain share in both segments.","Phil Ng - Jefferies","And just looking forward towards your cost take-out initiatives on corporate expense, can you give us some comfort around execution, because the ERP rollout has been a little bit tough for this year? So what's different and what have you learned that's going to help smooth out the process next year?","Keith Allman","I think they're completely different initiatives when you're talking about information system that manages the complicated supply chain versus a corporate office staff reduction. I would not characterize our corporate office staff reduction as risky. We've worked with our business units. We understand the business processes that we need to change. We've made those changes and we're moving forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tim Wojs from Baird.","Tim Wojs - Robert W. Baird","Just turning back to Cabinets again, I think Home Center sales there, you mentioned, were down and it sounds like maybe there's some inefficiencies in pricing and marketing. But I guess more broadly, are you seeing any change in how the Home Center think about the Cabinets business just in terms of floor space with competing alternative products like appliances?","Keith Allman","I don't see any big difference in our Home Center partners' view on the Cabinet business. It's a good business for them. Certainly there's tweaks that different customers make to their plan and to their layouts as they work to optimize their model. But there's no question that Cabinets is an important part of the Home Center channel and that's going to continue to be that way from my perspective.","Tim Wojs - Robert W. Baird","Just looking into 2015, John, any specifics we should think about just around raw materials and the price cost relationship there?","John Sznewajs","Nothing in particular at this time, as you think about the commodity conflicts that impact our business. We have been experiencing from time to time installation inflation from the manufacturers and we'll see some more of that going forward into 2015. And then in terms of inputs, propylene has been running a little high. And so that has continued to have some cost pressures on our inputs. And actually wood and finishing materials have been elevated over the course of the year. And so we expect that will probably continue into 2015 as well.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Eli Hackel from Goldman Sachs.","Eli Hackel - Goldman Sachs","Just wanted to talk about how you're positioning yourself for growth in multi-family, which has been a lot stronger than single-family in the coming years. Do you have any idea what percentage of that 30% that is new construction is multi-family versus single-family?","Keith Allman","Our share of multi-family and single-family is about equivalent as the overall market. Our Cabinet business, our installation business all participate in the multi-family segment of the builder channel. And our share there is consistent with our share in the single-family side.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Nishu Sood from Deutsche Bank.","Rob Hansen - Deutsche Bank","This is Rob Hansen on for Nishu. Just wanted to ask about the other specialty segment. You mentioned that there's been some mix shift that's been helping there. Is this just slower new construction growth, or are you repositioning yourselves more to R&R there? How does that look?","Keith Allman","As you may be aware, we're going to be repositioning this business through the downturn. Prior to the financial crisis, this business was heavily focused on residential new construction. And through the course of about six to seven years, we have delivered strides to reposition the business to be a much repair\/remodel oriented business. And we are seeing the benefits of that repositioning now over the last multiple quarters, as they deliver strong topline growth in each of the last six or seven quarters here largely from the remodeling efforts they put forth. So we feel really good about how that business is positioned in the marketplace.","Rob Hansen - Deutsche Bank","And what do you look at as stabilized operating margins in this segment?","Keith Allman","We saw some very nice double-digit operating margins in the segment in the quarter. This has experienced good drop-downs historically in the 30% range. And so as we continue to grow this business, we expect to continue to experience the 30% drop-downs on this segment as well.","Rob Hansen - Deutsche Bank","Just one last quick question on that is just how much of price increase has been a factor? Obviously seeing a lot of window manufacturers increasing prices recently. So has that been just enough to cover rising input costs, or have you been able to capture a little bit more on prices as well?","Keith Allman","Pricing has done a good job of offsetting some of our input costs. The bigger benefit has been the mix shift. We have seen upgrading of our products to a higher price point products in both windows and doors. And so we're pleased with the consumers' reaction to our new products in the marketplace.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Kim from Barclays.","Stephen Kim - Barclays","I was wondering if you could comment a little bit about the cadence of sales through the quarter, specifically in cabinets, but also interested in what you've seen in Plumbing as well.","Keith Allman","When you say cadence of sales, Stephen, can you help me out?","Stephen Kim - Barclays","Basically month by month, did you see steady improvement? Was it sort of choppy? And also, I forgot to mention, anything on the pricing environment that we saw in the quarter?","Keith Allman","It is pretty steady. I'm thinking from a month-to-month basis here in my head. It was pretty steady. We had some replenishment orders in paint where that volume, as we talked about, and our channel tends to fluctuate and we're seeing that coming back in October. So there is a little bit of timing there. But by and large from an overall demand perspective, it's been pretty smooth for the quarter.","Stephen Kim - Barclays","What about pricing actions? Did you see anything there that you can speak to?","Keith Allman","It's been nothing that really stands out. It's been pretty calm, pretty stable throughout the quarter.","Stephen Kim - Barclays","You had mentioned, Keith, I believe in your remarks earlier that in plumbing the gap down to your long-term margins guidance that is really attributable to emerging markets growth in adjacent products in North America. And I guess I was curious as to how you see that growth playing out? Is this something that you expect to sort of be of a bit of a breakout year for either of those initiatives in 2015, or is that something that you think is going to be sort of a gradual spooling up of the velocity in those businesses?","Keith Allman","I think we're going to talk about that more in detail at the Investor Day. But I would characterize it more on the spooling upside.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Wood from Macquarie.","Mike Wood - Macquarie","Just some clarification on the net profit improvement, flat for the full year. If I add the numbers up, it looks like you were negative $15 million for the first three quarters. Should we expect a positive $15 million year-over-year in the fourth quarter?","Keith Allman","We are expecting some benefit in the fourth quarter, Mike.","Mike Wood - Macquarie","I mean that would benefit the segment margins, potentially 600 basis points. Is there any offsets to that that we should be thinking about from initial modeling for the fourth quarter?","Keith Allman","Which segment are you talking about that should be benefiting 600 basis points?","Mike Wood - Macquarie","I'm just adding up the full-year numbers to the flat net profit improvement and you've tracked negative $15 million for the first three quarters. So in order to reach that goal, you'd need to be up $15 million for the fourth quarter, which if I just add the total segments, that's a 600 basis point year-on-year operating margin tailwind in the fourth quarter.","Keith Allman","Let me follow up with you offline on that one, Mike.","Mike Wood - Macquarie","Just in terms of the ERP, can you talk to us about what the service benefits are and how you benchmark, not just the initial lead time, but the response time to any quality issues? And how you compare yourselves against your large competitors and other smaller manufacturers that you compete against?","Keith Allman","First of all, the lead time, we measure it just as at the time from when we receive the order until the time when that order is shipped. From a fill rate perspective, we hold ourselves high to a line item fill rate metrics. So it's extremely difficult versus looking at it from an order basis.","Mike Wood - Macquarie","How you compare against your primary competitors at that independent dealer on those service metrics now?","Keith Allman","We have the industry lead time in the Merillat side of the business. We've had that for a long time, and that's extremely important to our dealer base. And when you look at where we are with KraftMaid with our four-week lead time, that's very competitive in the dealer base overall.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Megan McGrath from MKM Partners.","Megan McGrath - MKM Partners","Just wanted to follow up a little on the paint segment. You talked about your tough compare for the Marquee Exterior and Deckover last year. But then you had the Behr Marquee Interior launch this quarter. Could you talk about, maybe, if there's any timing differences there? What are your expectations for what those businesses could reach? Is Behr Marquee Interior have the potential to be as good as the exterior? And is it tracking as well as those launches did last year from a same timing perspective?","Keith Allman","We are about 400 or 500 stores at the end of the second quarter. We completed the rollout by 1,800 stores in the third quarter. So we're still seeing some of the sell-through and it just gained some traction now. It is a slightly higher price point. This is in a $40 to $45 gallon range. And we do anticipate very good response. The initial reaction has been positive. We'll keep you updated as the quarters roll out, because we'll have more data here in 90 days, et cetera, et cetera.","Megan McGrath - MKM Partners","And just final question on Cabinets. I guess, just looking overall at the $35 million in costs this year and a little bit more, so maybe $40 million to $45 million in total costs, is all of that related to this ERP implementation, which seems, obviously, pretty high for an ERP implementation? Or was there other stuff that you uncovered at the same time that was costing you money, in excess of the ERP?","Keith Allman","That was not all related to the ERP. If you look back to the beginning of the year, we had two significant component plants that we've taken offline. And there's efficiencies associated with that as we move business from one plant to another. As I said, one of the drivers of why we decided to take our mothballed plants offline was that we were seeing our performance in the remaining component plants. So it was a combination of plant closures as well as some significant ERP implementations.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."]}}
