At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we'll conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Jessica Holscott, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Mrs. Holscott, you may now begin.","Jessica L. Holscott - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations, Time Warner, Inc.","Thanks, Rob, and good morning everyone. Welcome to Time Warner's second quarter earnings conference call. This morning we issued three press releases; one detailing our results for the second quarter, one updating our 2016 full year business outlook, and the third announcing Time Warner's agreements with Hulu, including making an equity investment.","Before we begin, there are two items I need to cover. First, we refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Schedules setting out reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our earnings release and trending schedules. These reconciliations are available on our website at timewarner.com. Reconciliations of expected future financial performance are also included in the business outlook release that is available on our website.","Second, today's announcement includes certain forward-looking statements which are based on management's current expectations. Actual results may vary materially from those expressed or implied by these statements due to various factors. These factors are discussed in detail in Time Warner's SEC filings including its most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent quarterly reports on the 10-Q.","Time Warner is under no obligation and is in fact expressly disclaims any obligation to update or alter its forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.","I'll now turn the call over to Jeff Bewkes, Time Warner's Chairman and CEO, who will be followed by Howard Averill, Time Warner's CFO. After the prepared remarks, our divisional CEOs, John Martin, Richard Plepler and Kevin Tsujihara will join us for our Q&A session.","With that, I'd like to turn it over to Jeff.","Jeffrey L. Bewkes - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Jessica. Thanks everybody for listing in this morning. We're about halfway through the year and we're well on our way to exceeding our original 2016 goals. At the same time, we've been making the necessary investments in the very best video content and the development of new and exciting distribution opportunities in order to continue driving industry-leading growth over the long term. In the quarter, we generated revenues of $7 billion and adjusted operating income of $1.8 billion. And adjusted earnings per share grew to $1.29 per share. We also returned over $1 billion to shareholders in share repurchases and dividends. Our financial results continue to be fueled by creative excellence across our divisions.","Since we last spoke with you, we received 148 Primetime Emmy nominations, that's more than any other company, with HBO's 94 again setting the pace for the industry. TNT and TBS finished the second quarter as the two highest graded cable networks in primetime. With TNT airing cables most viewed NBA telecast of all time and Warners once again came out of the upfront as the leading supplier to the broadcast network. We expect that momentum to continue this weekend with the opening of Suicide Squad, one of the summer's most anticipated movies.","Our results also reflect the consistent execution of a strategy that we've been discussing with you for years. A core part of that strategy is to ensure that our networks, our shows and our brands are available to consumers on a wide range of platforms and devices and in all-important bundles, both within the traditional ecosystem and outside of it. With state-of-the-art user interfaces and more and more on-demand functionality. Now in many cases, we'll simply extend our traditional wholesale model of licensing our content and networks to third parties, but we are also investing in new services, both wholly-owned and with partners that have a more direct relationship with consumers. In doing that, we're positioning ourselves to develop new revenue streams for our industry-leading brands.","Among our initiatives is to-date, HBO NOW is the most significant and the second quarter was its strongest yet. But even HBO NOW is just one of many investments and initiatives in this area. HBO has launched similar services in the Nordic region and in parts of Latin America with additional launches scheduled for later this year. At Turner, we're in the process of launching an arthouse film SVOD service called FilmStruck which follows the recent launches of SVOD services by Adult Swim in Canada and Esporte Interativo in Brazil. And those join short form digital content initiatives like Great Big Story and Super Deluxe. And over at Warner's, the SVOD service we partnered on in China with Tencent video VIP recently passed 10 million subscribers. We've also enhanced our broadband distribution capabilities with acquisitions like iStreamPlanet and DramaFever.","This morning, we announced another exciting next step in that strategy, and that's our investment in Hulu. This investment fits our strategy like a glove. It will increase our company's exposure to the secular growth in over-the-top services, and it will give Hulu more resources to offer consumers more shows and more choices, fostering competition and innovation amongst both SVOD services and among MVPD services. We also announced that the virtual MVPD service Hulu expects to launch early next year will include live and on-demand access to the full suite of Turner networks. Consumers clearly want innovative interfaces. They want more robust on-demand capabilities, and they expect a greater variety of content packages. And we want to support services that do just that.","So consistent with our strategy, our investment in Hulu leaves us free to continue to support fully, as we always have, other traditional and broadband delivered distribution platforms. We look forward to working closely with our existing MVPD partners and with existing and new over-the-top partners in bringing consumers more choice in how to access our best-in-class shows and networks. We expect there will be a number of additional virtual MVPDs that launch over the coming year, and we think that the increase in choices available as a result of these new services will be great both for consumers and for our industry-leading brands.","Speaking of brands, let me share a few more highlights from the past quarter that show how our investments in Turner's core brands are helping transform its business by driving increased engagement with audiences across both traditional and new platforms. Here in the US, Turner had three of the top five ad-supported cable networks in prime time among adults 18 to 49. That's TNT, TBS, and Adult Swim. And Adult Swim, which continues to be far and away the most watched by millennials. It attracts 60% more 18- to 34-year-olds than its nearest competitor, 60% more.","Now we've talked before about the bold programming refresh underway at both TBS and TNT, and we couldn't be happier with the initial results. We've launched five marquee originals across TBS and TNT in this year, and we've already renewed all of them. Together, Wrecked, Angie Tribeca, The Detour, Full Frontal with Samantha Bee, and Animal Kingdom are great examples of where we're taking the TBS and TNT brands, and they've all surpassed our expectations for our initial slate of new shows.","We're particularly pleased with the audience growth we've seen from Samantha Bee and Animal Kingdom since their launches, and we're also gratified by the strong positive response that we've had from the gaming community to the launch of ELEAGUE. That's our eSports initiative.","The strong demand we saw in the upfront clearly demonstrated the belief advertisers have in the direction we're moving in and in the value of our brands, and that translated into double-digit CPM increases for Turner's entertainment networks. We also benefited from Turner's continued innovation in advertising products, with our targeting analytics capability setting the pace for the industry.","Demand in the upfront was particularly strong for CNN, which has undergone nothing short of a renaissance over the past few years. To date, 2016 is the most-watched year in CNN's history and as the US presidential election draws closer, CNN continues to gain momentum and take share from its peers. CNN was the number one news \u2013 let me say this very clearly, CNN was the number one news network among adults 18 to 49 in prime time for the third consecutive quarter, and CNN Digital becomes the number one news service in multi-platform and mobile uniques.","During the conventions of the past two weeks, both conventions, CNN led all networks, broadcast and cable alike, in viewership. And while CNN's in-depth news coverage continues to lead the industry, it's also building its next generation of viewers with a strong lineup of originals and leading digital products.","We're just excited about the momentum at HBO, which once again proved it's without peer when it comes to premium content. It's 94 Emmy nominations led the industry for the 16th straight year and included nominations for Game of Thrones for outstanding drama and both Veep and Silicon Valley for outstanding comedy, as well as John Oliver and Bill Maher for outstanding variety talk show.","HBO's status as the gold standard for premium content was also reinforced by the response to the most recent season of Game of Thrones, which averaged over 25 million viewers per episode. That's more than 25% higher than last year's record, and it's nothing less than astounding if you consider HBO's sub base. Much of that growth was driven by its digital platforms, where viewership nearly doubled from a year ago. Our digital platforms also contributed to double-digit growth for Veep and Silicon Valley, both of which reached series highs.","We've been thrilled with the overwhelming critical and consumer response to the limited crime series The Knight Of, which will be followed up this fall by the much-anticipated sci-fi series, Westworld, from Warner Bros. and the return of Sarah Jessica Parker to HBO in Divorce.","So we couldn't feel better about HBO's content lineup. The strength of the HBO content and brand have been evident in the growth of HBO NOW, and we're looking to super serve that audience by introducing new content geared for our digital and on-demand platforms. That started with the debut of Bill Simmons' Any Given Wednesday that happened in June, and we're going to follow that with the VICE News Tonight and John Stewart's highly original and much-anticipated new project later this year.","Now let me turn to Warner Bros., which remains on track for another record year as it continues to take advantage of its iconic IP with a franchise-driven strategy that spans television, film, and games. The strength of our great IP at Warners was evident this quarter in the performance of Warners television, which is once again leading the industry.","For the 2016 to 2017 season, Warner TV is set to be the number one producer of broadcast shows for the thirteenth time in the last 14 seasons. With 31 series, 22 of which are returning. That's the highest returning series number in the company's history.","Across all networks and services, Warner Bros. will produce 65 series for the upcoming year. That includes 10 shows originating in the DC Comics universe, underscoring the importance of the DC franchise to our television business, but DC is also critical component for video games business, which coming off a record performance last year just had its being biggest LEGO launch ever.","We're going to follow that up next month with Batman: The Telltale Series from our publisher at Telltale Games. Batman is also the star of Batman Arkham VR. That's our first virtual reality game. Arkham VR will be one of the launch titles for PlayStation VR, and it's Batman like you have never seen him before because you basically are him. It's a great example of how great IP translates across many different platforms and experiences, and it underscores the strength of our competitive position as new platforms continue to emerge.","On the Theatrical side, we are starting to build some real momentum with the recent string of highly profitable performers in Me Before You, Central Intelligence and Conjuring 2. Conjuring 2 has already past $300 million at the global box office, and it's become one of the most successful horror franchises in history. And we're thrilled with the recent opening of Lights Out. That's another micro-budget horror hit from New Line. Looking forward, Suicide Squad is tracking to be the biggest opening ever for an August release.","So we're already well on our way to what we think will be a blockbuster second half performance for our theatrical business. We follow Suicide Squad with War Dogs, a raucous comedy from Todd Phillips starring Jonah Hill and Bradley Cooper that will debut later this month. And next month, we'll have the inspiring story of Sully from Clint Eastwood starring Tom Hanks and Storks, a charming movie from Warner Animation.","Later this year, we will all have a chance to return to the Wizarding World created by J.K. Rowling when Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them hits theaters. Months ahead of its release, excitement about the franchise is already building. Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, which is J.K. Rowling's first stage production, recently opened, and it's already sold out through next May. The book version of the play script was released last week, and it had the most preorders of any title at Barnes & Noble since the last Harry Potter book was released in 2007. And the opening of the Harry Potter \u2013 Hogsmeade attraction at Universal Hollywood has been really well received, driving significant increases in audience.","That all sets the stage for the November release of Fantastic Beasts, a stunning new chapter in J.K.'s continuing saga. We couldn't be more excited, and as Warner announced earlier today, the second installment of the series is already set for release in November 16, 2018.","So we're in the midst of a very vibrant content cycle here across our businesses, and that puts us in a great position to benefit as global demand for the best video content continues to rise. We're making a lot of progress, both in strengthening our position within the traditional ecosystem and building new revenue streams and capabilities outside. And our investment in and Turner's agreement with Hulu is just another example of how we're taking advantage of new platforms to serve consumers, increase competition and further grow our business.","We're seeing increased value accrue to the very strongest brands and to the very best video content, and along with that come new opportunities that arise from digital distribution all around the world. And that's why we're very confident about the rest of 2016 and well beyond. Thanks for listening. Let me turn it over to Howard who has the fantastic financial details to give you.","Howard M. Averill - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Jeff, and good morning. I'll begin by referring to the first side of our presentation which is now available our website. Starting with consolidated results, we're pleased with our operating and financial performance to date and we're on track to exceed the outlook we provided at the start of the year.","Through the first half of the year adjusted operating income was up 3% and adjusted EPS was up 14%, and we delivered that while making significant investments not only in our traditional businesses but also in new capabilities and revenue streams that will drive future growth.","We knew coming into the second quarter that we faced difficult comparisons from the timing of content licensing revenue across our divisions, last year's record gains performance at Warner's and the timing of programming investments at both Turner and HBO. So as we expected, both revenues and adjusted operating income were down in the quarter.","Even so, we were able to keep adjusted operating income margins for the quarter steady year-over-year at 25%. That reflected our mix of revenue, a positive swing in eliminations, and our continued company-wide focus on limiting growth in overhead costs, which were roughly flat in the quarter.","Adjusted EPS was up 3%. That's primarily due to a lower effective tax rate and the benefit of our ongoing share repurchase program. During the second quarter, we bought back around $700 million of our shares and paid close to $320 million in dividends. And year-to-date, we returned about $2.3 billion to shareholders.","So we had a strong first half and we feel great about how this year is shaping up. As a result, we raised our outlook for 2016 adjusted EPS which we now expect to be in the range of $5.35 to $5.45. I'll touch on more of the details of our outlook later in the presentation.","Now turning to the segment highlights, I'll start at Turner where the investments we've been making in the transformation of our core brands contributed to another quarter of very strong revenue growth. Subscription revenues once again grew 11% in the quarter, and that included approximately 150 basis points of headwinds from FX. Domestic subscription revenues were up in the low-teens as we continued to benefit from the rate increases we achieved during our affiliate renewal cycle. And excluding a close to 10 percentage point drag from FX, international subscription revenue growth would have been in the high-single digits.","Advertising revenues increased a solid 6% despite approximately 100 basis points of headwinds from FX. Domestic advertising grew in the high-single digits, marking the third consecutive quarter of healthy growth. That reflected another quarter of double-digit growth in both news and sports, which included the benefit from airing the NCAA National Championship game for the first time this year. International advertising would have been up mid-single digits excluding a close to 10 percentage point drag from FX.","Looking ahead to the third quarter, we expect total advertising revenue growth to be in the low-single digits. The scatter market remains healthy with pricing at our domestic entertainment networks pacing up well into the double-digits over last year's upfront. At the same time, we're going to air significantly fewer hours of original programming across our domestic entertainment networks, and that's partially an effort to stay out of the way of this year's Summer Olympics. The third quarter is also our lightest quarter for sports inventory, and FX remains a headwind.","Moving on, content and other revenues declined 15% in the quarter. That reflects lower licensing revenues due to the comparison of last year's deal with Hulu. Adjusted operating income was flat in the quarter as healthy revenue growth was balanced by continued investments in programming and marketing. Programming expenses increased 11% mainly due to higher sports costs, including the NCAA National Championship game I mentioned earlier and our continued investment in bold, new original programming as part of the rebrand at TBS and TNT. Marketing costs were up mid-teens to support those new original series.","Overall, Turner has great operating momentum and is well-positioned to maintain its strong revenue trends in the second half of the year, putting it on track for another year of solid growth. We're doing that while continuing to make important investments in new initiatives like iStreamPlanet, expanding Bleacher Report and CNN's digital products. And together, we think the investments we're making across the business will allow Turner to deliver attractive results over the long-term as well.","Turning to HBO, where we're pleased with the progress we're making as we continue to invest in the significant global opportunity in subscription video services. Domestic subscription revenue growth was in the mid-single digits in the quarter, and that included a continued sequential increase in the contribution from HBO NOW, where we remain encouraged with our progress.","Content and other revenues decreased 17% in the quarter, mainly due to lower revenues from our licensing deal with Amazon. That was balanced by solid growth in international licensing revenues, highlighting our ability to effectively monetize our original programming around the world.","Across HBO's international networks, including unconsolidated JVs, revenues were up double-digits, and that's a reflection of continued positive international subscriber trends, especially in Latin America and the Nordics.","Adjusted operating income fell 5% in the quarter, and that reflects higher programming expenses, including programming charges and restructuring and severance costs. The programming charges and restructuring and severance costs totaled approximately $100 million, and that's largely related to a change in leadership on the programming front.","Separately, after considering consumer viewing patterns, including increased on-demand access to HBO's content across a wide range of devices and services, we have updated our estimates of the period over which our original programming is used. As a result, most of HBO's original programming will now be amortized over a somewhat longer time period. That reduced amortization this quarter by approximately $95 million. So the combination of reduced amortization, programming charges and restructuring and severance costs did not have a material effect on adjusted operating income in the quarter.","While there will be some impact from reduced amortization in the second half of 2016, most of this benefit was recognized in the second quarter. Excluding the programming charges and benefit from the reduced amortization, programming costs increased in the teens in the quarter, and that was driven primarily by increased investments in original programming.","Looking forward, we're excited about our upcoming programming lineup and combined with the continued investments we're making in the brand and product, we think HBO is very well-positioned to drive substantial growth in the years to come.","Moving on to Warner Bros., where we're also making progress on our multi-year strategy to drive growth across theatrical, television, and games. Coming into the year, we planned for our theatrical business to be the primary driver of profit growth, and that's playing out as we expected through the first half of the year. Looking specifically at the second quarter, we knew we had very difficult comparisons. Last year's quarter was a record for our video games business, led by the successful releases of franchise titles Batman: Arkham Knight and Mortal Kombat X, and we had significant TV licensing revenues from The Big Bang Theory and Seinfeld.","We also had fewer theatrical home video releases and a very difficult comparison against American Sniper and carryover revenues from the final installment of The Hobbit. So as expected, both revenue and adjusted operating income declined in the quarter.","In theatrical, we saw significant benefit from carryover revenue from Batman v Superman. We've also been really pleased with the theatrical performance of more recent releases like The Conjuring 2 and Central Intelligence. And The Legend of Tarzan has already surpassed $300 million in global box office. So while we originally had higher hopes for the film, we do not expect it to have a material impact on profits this year.","Looking ahead, we're very optimistic about the upcoming theatrical releases of Suicide Squad and Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them as we continue to lay the groundwork for our multi-year franchise film slate. Combined with the healthy trends and a leading position in TV production and the opportunities at its games business, Warner's is set up to continue delivering strong growth both this year and well into the future.","Turning to the next slide. Free cash flow totaled about $1.9 billion in the first half. That's up from a year ago, largely due to growth in adjusted operating income. Working capital also benefited from the payment of $280 million associated with the CME refinancing. And that was mostly offset by increased content investments, driven by higher production spending at Warner Bros. Given our performance to date and our expectation for strong growth in adjusted operating income, we're on track for another year of very strong free cash flow in 2016.","Now looking at our balance sheet. Since our last call, we took advantage of favorable market conditions to strengthen our balance sheet by issuing $800 million of long-term debt at an attractive rate. And we ended the second quarter with $22 billion of net debt, up around $350 million compared to the end of 2015. That's mostly a result of our ongoing commitment to direct returns to shareholders, which is a key component of our balanced approach to capital allocation.","Looking at investments, we did a very modest amount of M&A in the first half, and as Jeff noted, yesterday we invested $583 million for a 10% stake in Hulu. That payment will hit in the third quarter. Our net leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was just above our target leverage ratio of around 2.75 times, which we're on track to return to by the end of this year. And we remain committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet and our investment-grade credit ratings.","With that, let's move on to the final slide, which looks at our outlook for 2016. We had a solid first half of the year, and we're really pleased with how we're executing across our businesses. And that's reflected in our updated outlook for 2016. As I mentioned earlier, we raised our outlook for adjusted EPS this year to $5.35 to $5.45. And that incorporates around a $0.06 negative impact related to our equity investment in Hulu, including both our share of the losses and PPA.","Turning to the back half of the year, we expect overall revenue growth to accelerate, and that should help drive a nice acceleration on adjusted operating income growth as well.","Looking specifically at the third quarter, we anticipate elevated programming cost growth at HBO from the rollout of new original programming like The Night Of and Vice Principals and the timing of theatric availabilities and we'll again face challenging comparisons in video games and TV licensing at Warner Bros. As a result, we anticipate growth in adjusted operating income to be weighted heavily to the fourth quarter.","So overall, we're on track for another year of very attractive growth, and we believe the significant operating momentum, positive revenue trends and continued investments we're making across the company position us to continue that growth well into the future.","With that, I'll turn it back to Jessica to start the Q&A.","Jessica L. Holscott - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations, Time Warner, Inc.","Great. Thanks, Howard. Can we open up the line for Q&A, please?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Yes. Thank you. At this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. Thank you. Our first question today is coming from the line of Michael Nathanson with MoffettNathanson. Please proceed with your question.","Michael B. Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC","Thanks. I have one for Jeff and one for Howard. Jeff, following up on the Hulu investment last night and all you said in the past about windowing and the stacking rights and the need to keep those rights out of SVOD until later in the cycle, I wonder, what was the thinking on recent CW deal with Netflix which gave a lot of Netflix the rights right after the broadcast window ended? So what changed in your thinking relative to The CW versus what you said before?","Jeffrey L. Bewkes - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I'm not \u2013 I don't think you've characterized what we said before, right? I'll start and Kevin will pick it up. The CW is in a different situation than many other networks or our cable networks in that it doesn't currently receive material carriage fees. And so we made the decision this year not to have an in-season digital partner, which essentially goes along with what we've been thinking, and we instead put more aggressive VOD rights and stacking rights on The CW for the current season. Let's focus on that first, Kevin, and then let's go to the follow-on.","Kevin Tsujihara - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Warner Bros. Entertainment, Inc.","The CW is the unique asset, because you don't \u2013 not only do you not get material retrans, but we also don't own any. Time Warner doesn't own, but CBS owns some but predominantly don't own the station group that it's being played on. And therefore it has slightly different economics than the other broadcast networks. But what we did was actually give The CW more stacking rights by giving it exclusivity in the year. It has a lot more flexibility in its ability to be able to convey a full season or any number between a full season and five episodes. So it can do, it has a lot more flexibility than it had in the prior deal when The CW had a Hulu in-season deal and a Netflix out of season deal.","Jeffrey L. Bewkes - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","And let me just add to the philosophical side. Let's all look at the way this actually works and it's working the way it should work. Consumers want, and they expect \u2013 particularly for series, where they pick up the series maybe in its first year, maybe some other place \u2013 they want more on-demand access to the series, particularly series that become serialized plots over a long period of time. So as consumers want that, networks \u2013 and it depends which kind of networks and what kind of shows \u2013 networks increasingly want to offer more VOD rights over more episodes to cover story arcs.","So if you look at, for example, networks like in HBO or Showtime, or lately the Netflix business, Amazon. Those kind of networks with their serialize shows have had for years multiple, many episodes going back over long periods of time so you can catch up with the show. If you go to the ad-supported networks, broadcast, cable networks, et cetera, they have been on a path to try to meet consumer demand, and to the extent consumers want to see their favorite show over longer story arcs of episodes, networks increasingly ask for that.","So if you take, say, some of the broadcast networks \u2013 Kevin, you might want to comment on this \u2013 they've been asking for more on-demand, in current season. What's happened for example in the broadcast networks over the last year?","Kevin Tsujihara - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Warner Bros. Entertainment, Inc.","Well we've been conveying and having very good conversations with all the broadcast networks, and we've had an existing deal with Turner for a long time to convey full season stacking rights to those networks.","Jeffrey L. Bewkes - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","For Turner, but then now you have some broadcast.","Kevin Tsujihara - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Warner Bros. Entertainment, Inc.","We're having conversations with the broadcast networks, and we have a couple of deals already in place for the upcoming broadcast season. We had a deal with FOX last year. And so I think that those \u2013 you're seeing, from Warner Bros. perspective, we've been conveying those rights, and we will continue to convey those rights.","Jeffrey L. Bewkes - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. So I hope that answers your question.","Michael B. Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will be coming from the line of Michael Morris with Guggenheim Securities. Please proceed with your questions.","Michael Morris - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Thank you. Good morning. I have a couple more on Hulu. First, did your equity stake give you a strategic leadership role with respect to Hulu's plans going forward? What does the 10% give you there in terms of shaping the future of the product? And then second, with respect to the OTT product, and the relationship with Turner, should we expect that the agreement is similar to an MVPD arrangement and that a smaller distributor and that you'll be paid at the kind of the high end of the pricing range for the Turner networks with escalators that are consistent with other distributors? Or is there something different given your ownership stake? Thanks.","Jeffrey L. Bewkes - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Why don't you do the affiliate situation first? Then I'll talk about the...","John K. Martin - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Turner Broadcasting System, Inc.","Thanks, Mike. It's John. So with respect to the virtual MVPD component, you should think about the structure and the nature of our arrangement with Hulu being similar with the type of arrangements we have with the virtual MPVDs that we're already in business with, including Sling and Sony Vue. And we're not going to discuss pricing, obviously, but the structure is similar and we're quite pleased with the opportunity to participate in the product when it gets launched.","Jeffrey L. Bewkes - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Now on the governance side, we don't have an active role, and coming in as a 10% investor without a board seat, we think it reduces complications around governance. Now we like the asset, and we like it even more if it has better budgets for programming and more resources for platform capabilities. And we think that's helpful.","And as we said \u2013 Howard said it, I've said it \u2013 we're focused on making investments to capitalize on these opportunities and to help serve consumer demand. They want all kinds of VOD and interface capabilities, and they want more choice of bundles and price points. And we think that this helps it. It's part of a number of other services that, as you know, we either have ourselves, like HBO NOW or other ones overseas, or the partnerships we do with others or the affiliate deals, not just like the one John just described at Hulu but all the ones we've got with Sling and with Sony Vue and with Comcast and Verizon and AT&T and all the other distributors.","So I think what you're seeing here is a resurgence of a kind of investment and health in the entire ecosystem that's going where consumers want, and I think it's going to be a great thing for the diversity of product production and the health of the industry.","Michael Morris - Guggenheim Securities LLC","John, if I could just follow up, are there significant differences between the virtual MVPD arrangements with Sling and Vue and sort of your traditional ones with cable, satellite or telco operators?","John K. Martin - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Turner Broadcasting System, Inc.","No.","Michael Morris - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Okay. That's great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Doug Mitchelson with UBS. These proceed with your question.","Doug Mitchelson - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks so much. I just \u2013 one final Hulu question for John, and then a question for Jeff. John, will the Hulu-Turner deal include mobile rights and have a minimum guarantee similar to what we're hearing AT&T has but Sony Vue did not have?","And then for Jeff, with the guidance range you clearly have a line of sight for 2016, and correct me if I'm wrong, but the year is coming in basically where you had hoped when you gave the $6 EPS guidance at the Analyst Day a couple years ago, just less $0.50 or so of currency headwinds.","So my question is, when you look at the growth outlook for 2017 and 2018 relative to your original $8 EPS guide that you previously had out there, other than the currency headwind impact, which should be the same $0.50 or so carried forward, has anything else changed in your growth outlook when you think about the next couple years for the company? Thank you.","Jeffrey L. Bewkes - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","You start.","John K. Martin - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Turner Broadcasting System, Inc.","Hey, Doug, it's John. Let me start. Look, listen, I hope you can appreciate we're not going to get into the details with respect to deal-by-deal in what's included and what's not included. I think just philosophically, though, and we've been very consistent on this point now for some time, having the single most concentrated portfolio of the highest value networks in the country, we would anticipate having carriage in many if not all of the new potential entrants that come into the ecosystem. At the same time, while we intend to fully support our existing partners who are incredibly important to us. So that \u2013 but with respect to which rights are in which deals, we're just not going to get into that level of detail.","Jeffrey L. Bewkes - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","And Doug, on your question about our general performance and earnings track, I love your question. You're right, you're premise is right. But we're not going to go \u2013 you know how this \u2013 and give formal long-term guidance right now. There's a lot of ins and outs that happen as we've been telling you as we go on year-to-year. But you're right to point out and ask, well, gee, you're on a very good track, very much familiar to those of you who have been following our predictions over the year. So we feel very good about it, and if you look at what we're saying today and our results this year and the raise we just did and some of the strategic moves that we are making and the advances where the industry is now finally to accelerate into a much stronger way of distributing the fantastic content that it already makes, we feel very good about the earnings track for many years.","Doug Mitchelson - UBS Securities LLC","All right. I had to try. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you.","Jessica L. Holscott - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations, Time Warner, Inc.","Operator, next question?","Operator","Yes, our next question is coming from the line of John Janedis with Jefferies. Please proceed with the question.","John Janedis - Jefferies LLC","Hi. Thanks. Maybe I will stick with the Hulu theme here. Can you also speak to the potential to market or bundle HBO on any of the Hulu platforms as a way to further accelerate growth? And then, Howard, does the EPS guidance assume maybe somewhere like a mid-single digit EPS impact for the last five months of the year?","Jeffrey L. Bewkes - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","You start on that.","Richard L. Plepler - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Home Box Office, Inc.","John, it's Richard. Obviously we're in conversations. I have nothing really to add at this time, but we're having constructive conversations and we expect they'll continue.","Howard M. Averill - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hey John, can you repeat your question?","John Janedis - Jefferies LLC","I just wanted to confirm with the PPA and the cost at Hulu that it's a mid-single digit EPS impact for the last five months of the year.","Howard M. Averill - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, that's right, John.","John Janedis - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Great. And then maybe Kevin...","Howard M. Averill - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","You know, $0.06 that I mentioned.","John Janedis - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Kevin, I know you recently talked about the plan to reduce ad loads by about 50% on new TNT dramas, and I think there's no question that it improves the viewer experience, but as you add more shows, can you talk about your confidence level in your ability to have maybe at least a revenue-neutral outcome and to what extent that was part of the discussion and negotiation in the upfront?","Kevin Tsujihara - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Warner Bros. Entertainment, Inc.","I can answer for Kevin Reilly but this is Kevin Tsujihara. I think for Kevin Reilly it would be five more Warner shows. But I'm going to let John Martin take that one.","John K. Martin - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Turner Broadcasting System, Inc.","Thanks, John. So just, that's a hard act to follow. So for everybody's benefit, we have announced that beginning in the fourth quarter, we're going to essentially reduce the ad loads on Tru TV in half. But I think what you're referring to is that for the new original shows that are going on to TNT and right now it's really just been Animal Kingdom, but we've made certain commitments to new originals that will be coming on later this year, we are going with those shows with more content and less advertising.","And let me say that the early results are quite encouraging. And I would repeat that it's early. And we're going to be obviously paying close attention to this, but it's all being driven by the fact that we know that we have to have a network that has an experience that can compete with the very best consumer experiences in the world.","So we've reduced the number of ads. We've been engaged with in discussions with our agencies, with our advertisers and what we've been seeing is smaller drop off during ad pods, meaning that we're retaining higher audience levels during advertising commercials, which means higher ratings to the network. We believe the early results indicate that there's even higher recall for the ads that are there.","We're working very, very hard to make the ads more relevant with our native product and our own internal production capabilities to make sure that the advertising is more relevant and contextual with respect to the content itself, and that was very, very helpful during the upfront and extremely, extremely well-received, one of the reasons why we were able to garner double-digit CPM increases and we think we're leading the industry here.","John Janedis - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Jessica L. Holscott - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations, Time Warner, Inc.","Next question?","Operator","And the next question comes from the line of Rich Greenfield with BTIG. Please proceed with your question.","Richard Greenfield - BTIG LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. So you launched on Sling. I think you surprised a lot of people by being one of the early partners when Sling launched their single stream product and you've been a part of their multi stream product. And it's been call it more than 18 months now since Sling has been out. But Sling is still charging the same kind of $20 for their core service. I'm curious, are you getting annual increases that are \u2013 I know you're getting double-digits on your legacy MVPDs. Are you getting double-digit increases annually from Sling while they don't raise retail price? How does that work or how are you thinking about virtual MVPDs and the ability to get annual affiliate fee increases, especially with today's news vis-\u00e0-vis Hulu?","And then just two, you made an announcement I think last week or the week before about Chuck Lorre from Warner Bros., and I'd love \u2013 you've been kind of hesitant before to sell multi-cam comedies, especially Chuck Lorre comedies to Netflix because those are the huge win opportunities that you've gotten on the syndication side, such as Big Bang. And I'm curious why this was the right deal to do to sell something like that and potentially limit your upside versus the massive syndication values you can get off of those type of comedies?","Jeffrey L. Bewkes - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","John, you do.","John K. Martin - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Turner Broadcasting System, Inc.","Thanks, Rich. It's John. I'll start. Listen, I think philosophically the way we're looking at the potential new entrants, the virtual MVPDs, the Slings, whatever you want to call them, is we're looking at them in the exact same way as we're looking at our traditional facilities-based partners. And we have a highly concentrated portfolio of very valuable networks that we intend to get full value for over time, and one of the reasons why we've been able to garner significant pricing increases is we've been starting from a lower base. But you should assume that the deals that we're striking with respect to everyone carries with it similar rate card assumptions and accelerants.","Jeffrey L. Bewkes - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Kevin?","Kevin Tsujihara - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Warner Bros. Entertainment, Inc.","Hi, Rich. It's Kevin. As it relates to the Chuck Lorre show that we announced going to Netflix, that was really a matter of the subject matter really lent itself to SVOD. Being related to marijuana usage and a marijuana kind of background, it really didn't really lend itself to advertiser-friendly broadcast networks.","Richard Greenfield - BTIG LLC","Fair enough.","Jessica L. Holscott - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations, Time Warner, Inc.","Great. I think we're ready for the next question.","Operator","Yes, the next question is coming from the line of Omar Sheikh with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Omar Sheikh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Morning, everyone. Thank you. Just a couple of questions. First of all, for Jeff on Hulu again, I wonder if you could just clarify whether or not you will be licensing any of your content to Hulu's SVOD products. I think I read somewhere that you won't be, but some clarity on that would be useful. And then also, on the live streaming product, could you maybe give us a sense of what it might look like in terms of price points, content offering and sort of availability of stacking rights and so on? That would be very helpful.","And then second question is just on for Richard maybe on HBO, I know Jeff said that now it had the strongest quarter yet. I wonder whether you could \u2013 I could tempt you into updating us on some numbers there. And then maybe if you could just let us know which international markets you are planning to launch that, the NOW product in, in the second half. Thanks.","Jeffrey L. Bewkes - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Richard, why don't you?","Richard L. Plepler - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Home Box Office, Inc.","Sure. Omar, I'll start. Obviously, I can't get into numbers other than to say we've had substantial growth in the quarter. We see an enormous amount of momentum. We've lapped our marketing, and the data we're getting is improving all the time. Churn is going down all the time, and we couldn't be more pleased as more and more content suited to digital arrives. Jon Stewart is coming, Vice News is coming, Bill Simmons obviously very conducive to it. We like the momentum we're seeing and I think it's reflected in the progress and in the numbers.","Internationally, early days in Latin America, as you know, with our launch so far in Colombia and in Mexico, and we've announced later in the year launches in Argentina, in Spain, in Brazil. We're very excited about the opportunity there. So again, this just reflects our ability to go multilaterally around the world, our networks business, OTT business, our licensing business, wherever we think we have the best long-term monetization, that's what we're going to pursue. Nordics is a case study in how fast we can improve momentum because the rate of growth in Nordics over the last year has just been tremendous OTT.","Jeffrey L. Bewkes - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Omar, if I understood your question, I think it was whether as part of our investment in Hulu we had any individual or content licensing obligations or deals, and the answer is no. There's nothing in there specifically, any particular content license. And so, that's the SVOD service. Now that means that of course we are and we will continue to look at shows, or well and I guess you're asking about individual shows, where SVOD providers or traditional providers come and want to license, whether it's Hulu, Netflix, et cetera, and we will do that on a standalone arm's-length basis. If you go then, I think you asked this, to the MVPD, that we have an affiliation of our networks into the bundle service, but that one, we can't really outline what their strategy and business plan is yet. I think they will be responsible for that.","Omar Sheikh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. That make sense. So just as a follow-up maybe, Jeff, if you think about what you've said before about licensing content potentially direct-to-consumer for the Turner networks, or more broadly across the content that you control, how should we think about where Hulu fits into that? Is this now going to be central to your strategy or you're going to continue to look at other ways to monetize your content, perhaps direct?","Jeffrey L. Bewkes - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I don't understand the \u2013 would you \u2013 so the Turner networks, which for example now are available in a number \u2013 but they're all, you can get them and the shows-on-demand on every traditional distributor. You can get them on every new virtual distributor of every single package size and price point. If you go to HBO, you can get that through on-demand fully through every distributor basically in the world of any kind, and increasingly, you can get it as a broadband delivered thing. So what is your question in relation to that?","Omar Sheikh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","So if you look at Hulu's service today, given your investment, do you see that as being central to your strategy for distributing content to consumers? Or when you're looking at the over-the-top strategy? Or do you see alternatives or other ways of distributing direct-to-consumer as well?","Jeffrey L. Bewkes - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, we just spent the day here talking about how we think our networks, our brands and our shows should be available in essentially as many places and ways for consumers to get them with VOD, et cetera, as we can. And this is an additional way to do that. I don't -that's what we've been saying. So it adjoins all the other distribution methods and that's a good thing.","Omar Sheikh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Okay.","Jessica L. Holscott - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations, Time Warner, Inc.","Thanks","Omar Sheikh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. That's clear. Thanks a lot.","Jessica L. Holscott - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations, Time Warner, Inc.","Next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jessica Reif Cohen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.","Jessica Jean Reif Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hello. Thanks. I have a Turner question and maybe one more after Hulu. On Turner, could you give us a little color on what you're doing in eSports, and how you think that business will grow over time? And actually, one more on Turner. You mentioned that there was a sub decline, but it wasn't specified. Can you say what it is?","John K. Martin - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Turner Broadcasting System, Inc.","Sure, Jessica. It's John. On the sub decline, we're seeing continued subscriber declines in the US at a similar rate as we've experienced in the most recent quarter. So call it approaching about 2%. Some networks a little bit less, but no more really than, more than 2%. And all of the guidance that we've provided in terms of subscriber revenue growth continues to assume the continuous level of those types of declines. Although, as I've been saying, hopefully over time as these new virtual MVPDs get to the market with better, smaller packages of better networks we'll be offering consumers different bundles at better price points and could and should result in the stabilization of the subscriber overall levels.","With regard to eSports, which we just concluded the championship of the tournament, we couldn't be more pleased and excited about how we hosted the first-ever eSports tournament on television. We call it ELEAGUE, and across the 10-week tournament between Twitch and TBS, there was almost approaching 1 billion minutes of consumption. It's brought millions of new viewers to the network. The age of the viewers of TBS are right down the strike zone of what we were hoping for: young viewers, heavily skewing male.","We just announced an agreement with a new game, Overwatch. We're going to host that tournament beginning in the fall, and we've announced the second tournament with Counter-Strike, which will air after that. So we love the fact that we own this league in connection with WME and IMG. We think it's a huge area of secular growth. We absolutely intend to participate in a big way in this area, and we couldn't be more pleased with how the first season proceeded.","Jessica Jean Reif Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And, John, just a follow-up, which is the Hulu question. It's really for you, and kind of what you said about growing with skinnier bundles. I heard what you said. You was very clear that, you said the affiliates fees structure would be comparable to other deals. Can you talk a little bit about the advertising? In some ways it may actually \u2013 it seems like it may be better because it's more targeted. Could you comment on that?","John K. Martin - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Turner Broadcasting System, Inc.","Exactly. I think you asked the question, but it was more of a statement that I'll validate. Everything that's happening at Hulu is moving in the same direction as to what we're doing on our traditional ad-supported cable networks, which is trying to improve the consumer experience with less overall advertising, but now we've got our Turner Data Cloud built out full capacity. We're going to have hundreds of, millions of records of data by the end of this year, and one of the reasons why, again, we were so successful in the upfront is we think we're leading the industry with products that can sell audiences rather than just demos and dayparts. So I think your statement is completely accurate.","Jessica Jean Reif Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thank you.","Jessica L. Holscott - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations, Time Warner, Inc.","We have time for one more question.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Doug Creutz with Cowen and Company. Please proceed with your question.","Doug Creutz - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hey. Thanks. As you mentioned, you guys are having a pretty good year at Warner Bros. Disney's having a pretty good year as well, but I think most of the rest of your peers are having a very difficult year. Do you think there's been any change in audience behavior around the film industry? If so, how are you reacting to that? And do you think that the studio business in general is in need of consolidation to fix some of these problems? Thanks.","Kevin Tsujihara - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Warner Bros. Entertainment, Inc.","I think what we're seeing is that the big franchises mean more than ever. If you look at the top six films, they represent approximately 35% of the domestic box office. So when you think about what we laid out a couple of years ago as the strategy, we thought that the slate needed to be kind of anchored by the big franchises like Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, the DC movies and the Lego movies, and we're executing on that.","As it relates to whether we think that scale is required in that environment, I think that we're going to \u2013 we are one of the few scale players on the film side, but even more importantly, we're one of the studios, one of the couple of studios that have the big intellectual property that allows us to be able to anchor a slate like that. So if you think about consolidation the way we think about it, I don't think you would need to see consolidation from players that don't have intellectual property merging with other players that don't have intellectual property for scale, per se. What you really need are the big franchises that are going to be able to drive the economics which is what we're seeing and kind of what our strategy is based on.","Doug Creutz - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Jessica L. Holscott - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations, Time Warner, Inc.","So, Jeff, you might want to say a few words to wrap up.","Jeffrey L. Bewkes - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","All right. So just to wrap up, I hope you all feel the way we do. We're very pleased with our performance, we're encouraged by industry developments and we think the company is very well positioned to bring the best content to consumers in the way they want it. So that makes us excited about the future and we'd like to thank everybody for joining.","Operator","Thank you.","Jessica L.

(NYSE:TWX) Q1 2014 Earnings Conference Call April 30, 2014 10:30 AM ET","Executives","Michael Kopelman - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations","Jeffery Bewkes - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Howard Averill - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Analysts","Meghan Durkin - Deutsche Bank","Ben Swinburne - Morgan Stanley","Michael Nathanson - MoffettNathanson","David Bank - RBC Capital Markets","Anthony DiClemente - Nomura Securities","Vasily Karasyov - Sterne, Agee","Michael Morris - Guggenheim","Operator","Hello, and welcome to the Time Warner Inc. first quarter 2014 earnings call. My name is Joe, and I will be your operator for today's call. (Operator Instructions) I will now turn the call over to Mr. Michael Kopelman, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Kopelman, you may begin.","Michael Kopelman","Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Time Warner's first quarter earnings conference call. This morning we issued two press releases, one detailing our results for the first quarter and the other updating our 2014 full year business outlook, which as a reminder excludes Time Inc.","Before we begin, there are two items I need to cover. First, we refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Schedules setting out reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our earnings release and trending schedules. These reconciliations are available on our website at www.timewarner.com\/investors. Reconciliations of our expected future financial performance are also included in the business outlook release that is available on our website.","Second, today's announcement includes certain forward-looking statements, which are based on management's current expectations. Actual results may vary materially from those expressed or implied by these statements due to various factors. These factors are discussed in detail in Time Warner's SEC filings, including its most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q.","Time Warner is under no obligation, and in fact, expressly disclaims any obligation to update or alter its forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Thank you.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Jeff. Jeff?","Jeffery Bewkes","Thanks, Mike, and thanks for listening in this morning. We had an excellent first quarter. Excluding Time Inc., revenues grew 10%, adjusted operating income increased 12% and adjusted earnings per share was up 26%. We also generated over $1.7 billion in free cash flow.","For just one quarter into the year, that provides a pretty good indication of the return we can achieve on our investments in programming and of the growth potential of our businesses. And as a result of our strong start to the year, this morning we raised our outlook for 2014 adjusted EPS to grow in the low-teens. That's not an unusual level of growth for us.","Over the past five years, we have grown adjusted EPS at least in the low-teens every year. Our growth in any given year maybe higher or lower, depending on factors like the timing of new affiliate agreements or investments in program, but on average, we think we can continue to grow adjusted EPS in the low to mid-teens, if not better, over at least the next three to four years.","We have an established track record of turning solid operating growth into even more attractive returns for our shareholders, and we're extremely confident, we can continue to do so for the foreseeable future.","Our confidence is underpinned by the strength of our brands, by industry-leading scale across our businesses and by the increasing value of our engaging and globally relevant content. All of those factors have been evident in our negotiations during Turner's current domestic affiliate renewal cycle.","In fact, based on the deals we've already completed, we anticipate double-digit growth in domestic subscription revenue at Turner will extend another two years beyond the 2013 through 2016 period that we previously discussed with you. That's double-digit growth on average over five years and it provides a lot of visibility into our earnings power over that time period.","Given our confidence in our growth prospects and strong cash generation year-to-date, we have decided to accelerate our share repurchases starting this quarter, and we now expect to reach our target net leverage of 2.75x by the end of this year.","Now, I'd like to spend a few minutes walking through some recent operational highlights. Nowhere was the growing popularity and improving economics of our content more evident this quarter than at Warner Bros.","In the first quarter of 2014, Warner has picked up right where it left off last year, finishing number one at the domestic box office, and collecting more Academy Awards than all the other major studios combined, led by seven for Gravity, including Best Director for Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n. Not bad for a movie that also finished with over $700 million at the global box office.","Warner's performance at the box office in the first quarter was a result of its continued development of franchise films with global appeal, including The LEGO Movie, which was the quarter's number one release at the domestic box office, and 300: Rise of an Empire.","Warner is already working on another LEGO Movie for release in 2017. We think that LEGO has the ability to be an evergreen franchise that along with DC Comics and with J.K. Rowling's new series of films, will underpin the economics of our film business for many, many years.","As you may know, our relationship with LEGO also includes important video game and television properties, underscoring our ability to monetize high-quality intellectual property across the company.","So with a strong start to the year, our promising slate of movies for this summer and a great line up of television shows to be announced at the upfront in a couple of weeks, Warner is in position to have another great year in 2014.","HBO also got off to a red-hot start this year with True Detective garnering the largest ever viewership for a freshman series on the HBO network. The success of True Detective means that HBO's current line up includes four of its top five highest rated shows ever. Of course that includes Game of Thrones, which has become a global phenomenon.","Season 4 premiered to HBO's largest audiences since the Sopranos Finale, and Season 3's home video release had the highest first month sales of any HBO show ever in HBO's history. And if anything, Game of Thrones has taught us a vital lesson, decline any wedding invitation in Westeros.","The success of HBO's groundbreaking original storytelling has always been a testament to visionary creators such as the Game of Thrones' team David Benioff and D.B. Weiss, True Detective's Nick Pizzolatto and Silicon Valley's Mike Judge, and the fantastic actors that they attract as well as the strength of HBO's brand and best-in-class marketing.","But I think HBO's record audiences are also a result of its leadership in making its content available on-demand and across all major platforms. We firmly believe that if you have great content, giving consumers control over where, when and on what platform they watch it, will drive increased consumption and value. That's the promise of TV Everywhere, and there is no better example of that than HBO's success with HBO on-demand and HBO GO.","In keeping with the spirit of taking advantage of new platforms to connect with consumers and improve monetization, HBO announced last week that it would be making a selection of its catalog programming available to Amazon Prime Instant Video.","We are hopeful that availability on Prime Instant Video will introduce additional consumers to the great content that HBO produces and will potentially drive sub-additions over time to the HBO network service. And we plan to use additional revenue from the deal to invest even more in HBO's groundbreaking original programming and to further accelerate the development of next generation of HBO GO.","It's that combination of unrivaled content, including the strongest slate of Hollywood movie hits and the use of the latest technology that has helped HBO to become the world's leading premium TV and subscription video-on-demand service. Given the positive subscriber trends, we've seen both in recent years and so far in 2014, we feel great about HBO's ability to drive continued growth for many years to come.","Turner also had a landmark start to the year, bringing the Elite Eight and the Final Four to cable for the first time ever. The NCAA Tournament continues to be a runaway success and its strong linear TV performance was accentuated by more than 40% growth in digital video streams for March Madness Live.","Like HBO GO, March Madness Live is a great example of how TV Everywhere can enhance the consumer experience and the value of our networks through distributors. And the success of the NCAA Tournament helped TBS maintain its number one position in ad supported cable among adults 18 to 49.","Similarly, Adult Swim continues to lead the industry of attracting younger viewers. Once again finishing the first quarter as the number one ad supported cable network in total day for adults 18 to 34. To better take advantage of the growing demand for its distinctive content, we recently expanded Adult Swim to the 8.00 PM hour.","We also have momentum at CNN, which grew delivery in its key demo over 50% in March, again demonstrating that it's the authoritative voice, viewers turn to when news breaks. Just as important, CNN generated nearly 4 billion page views and 275 million video starts in March. That's its biggest month ever for both metrics.","In a world where consumers increasingly look to digital products for their news, CNN has a substantial lead on its cable news peers in cross platform unique users, and actually has the largest number of monthly unique mobile users of any news service domestically, and we're just getting started.","At its upfront, earlier this month, CNN introduced CNNx, which represents a leap forward in interactive merits, and it's a product that CNN is unique positioned to provide. It's available today on your tablet and you'll start seeing it on set top boxes later this year. We think it will be another real point of differentiation for CNN.","Despite these successes and having three of the top 10 cable networks in adults 18 to 49 in the first quarter, we are not satisfied with the recent ratings and advertising performance at some of the Turner network. At truTV for example, we followed a couple of strong years with a significant drop off in performance.","But we have new leadership in place, who just announced the slate of innovative unscripted programs that will start in May with The Carbonaro Effect, and continue through this fall with shows like MOTOR CITY MASTERS, Way Out West and Hair Jacked. We think it's some of the best and most creative programming the network has ever done, and that give us great confidence in truTV and in our ability to materially improve its monetization over time.","We've also had some challenges at TNT. It was the top five cable network in prime time last year and it had some of the most popular originals on basic cable, but it can and will do better. Over the past few years, we didn't take enough creative risk with its programming, and as a result, TNT has lost ground with younger viewers.","We've already started to address that with the new programming that you'll see this summer, including The Last Ship, Murder in the First and Legends. These shows should also help TNT expand its audience with key male demos.","To be clear, these types of changes take time and we won't get to where we want to be in the quarter or two. But we've all seen that network performance tends to move in cycles. And by virtue of its scale and our position as the world's leading producer of high quality television product, TNT has accessed all the resources it needs.","We're confident and we're determined that we will see improvement as the year progresses and that we can drive growth in its audience and its economics over time. At Time Inc., the new management team has made great progress in preparing for success as an independent public company. We are on track to complete the spin in the next month or so, and you'll hear more about their plans as that date approaches.","So in closing, I am really pleased with how we've started 2014. We're making progress on our strategic initiatives across the company. And at the same time, our investments in great storytelling and journalism are paying off, allowing us to produce very attractive financial results. And with the global growth in demand for our content continuing unabated, we think we're in a great position to grow at these kinds of attractive levels for a very long time.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Howard.","Howard Averill","Thanks, Jeff, and good morning. I'll begin by referring to the first slide of our presentation, which is now available on our website. Given that we expect to complete the spin-off of Time Inc. this quarter and our full year outlook excludes Time Inc., I will focus my remarks on our company results prepared on the same basis.","Excluding Time Inc., revenues were up 10% and we had leverage all the way down the income statement with adjusted operating income increasing 12% and adjusted EPS growing 26%. Turner, HBO and Warner Bros. all posted record first quarter adjusted operating income.","So to reiterate, what Jeff said, we're off to a great start in 2014. Adjusted operating income margins expanded 60 basis points, despite a 9% increase in expenses and net expense growth was largely related to content investments at Warner Bros. and Turner, and the consolidation of HBO Asia and HBO Nordic.","SG&A was flat in the quarter and it would have been down, excluding the consolidations, as we continue to focus on funding aggressive investments in programming by limiting growth in other expenses.","We were able to grow adjusted EPS even faster than adjusted operating income, due mostly to our ongoing share repurchase program and improved results at our equity investments, including HBO Latin America. We also had a benefit of almost $40 million from recognition of interest income on a long-standing note receivable that was collected.","During the quarter, we repurchased close to $1 billion in shares, and combined with our dividend we've returned almost $1.6 billion to shareholders year-to-date. We also had a very strong quarter for free cash flow, generating $1.7 billion, nearly 80% increase from last year's first quarter.","And as Jeff mentioned, in light of our strong first quarter and our confidence in the remainder of the year, we've raised our 2014 outlook for adjusted EPS excluding Time Inc. We now expect growth to be in the low-teens. I'll tough more on the details of our outlook throughout the presentation.","Now, turning to the segment highlights. I'll begin at Turner. The revenues and adjusted operating income continued to grow despite rating and FX headwinds.","Subscription revenues grew 7% in the quarter, which included more than 100 basis point drag from FX. Domestic subscription revenue growth was solidly in the high single-digits, a significant acceleration relative to the past couple of years. And that acceleration was the result of rate increases related to Turner's domestic affiliate renewals.","Excluding the impact of FX, international subscription revenue was also up in the high single-digits with largest gains coming from Latin America, which remains our strongest region and where we continue to see healthy subscriber trends. Looking forward, we'll continue to benefits from Turner's domestic affiliate renewals for the remainder of the year.","And as Jeff noted, we anticipate this will be a sustained lift in our subscription revenue growth rate. Based on deals we already have in place, we expect to grow our domestic subscription revenue at low double-digit rate on average through 2018.","Turning to advertising. Revenues increased 5% in the quarter, which was at the lower end of the range we originally expected, and that included the impact of both soft ratings and moderate demand in the scatter market. Of that growth, about 300 basis points was due to the NCAA Tournament, including the benefit from airing two NCAA Elite Eight games.","Domestic advertising increased similarly to the overall result, and that included mid single-digit increase at domestic entertainment, including kids and young adults and a low single-digit growth at our news networks.","Excluding a drag of approximately 400 basis points from FX, international advertising would have been up high single-digits. That reflected solid underlying growth in Latin America and international news.","Looking ahead to the second quarter, scatter pricing is up high single to low double-digits over the upfront, with volume still relatively modest and we expect ratings to remain a drag on our performance.","Also keep in mind that as a result of airing two Final Four games, the NCAA should provide around a 300 basis point benefit in the quarter. Taking all of that into account, we anticipate total advertising to grow in the low single-digits in the second quarter.","Moving on, adjusted operating income grew 3% in the quarter and that included a 9% increase in programming cost, primarily due to the NCAA Tournament and continued investments in original programming across our networks. Consistent with our focus on costs discipline, we limited non-programming expense growth to just 2% in the quarter.","As we look to the remainder of 2014, we anticipate Turner's adjusted operating income growth to accelerate, starting in the second quarter. And despite ongoing investments in sports and original programming, we expect solid margin expansion for the year. So Turner is on pace for another good year in 2014.","Moving onto HBO, where we saw strong growth in both revenues and adjusted operating income. Subscription revenues were up 8% in the quarter with consolidation of HBO Asia and HBO Nordic, contributing around 400 basis points to that growth.","Building on a strong 2013, our domestic subscriber trends remain positive, and similar to the past few quarters, the majority of recent subscriber additions have been non-revenue generating. So while that's a good barometer of consumer demand for HBO, subscriber growth did not have a material impact on our revenue.","Turning to content revenues, which were up 13% in the quarter, and that was primarily due to very strong home video sales of Season 3 of Game of Thrones, which more than offset softness in library product. Looking ahead, we anticipate a significant bump in content revenues in the second quarter due to the Amazon deal announced last week.","As Jeffery noted, HBO intends to invest the majority of proceeds from the transaction back into programming, marketing and technology. So we don't expect to commensurate increase in profits this year.","Adjusted operating income was up 11% in the quarter and margins expanded almost 100 basis points, and that was despite the drag on margins from the international consolidations. Programming expenses increased 8% with 600 basis points of that growth due to the consolidations.","Underneath that, acquired theatrical expenses increased, while programming write-offs decreased. Absent to programming write-offs, original programming expenses would have increased in the mid single-digits.","Across HBO's international properties, first quarter results were equally impressive. Total international revenue, including unconsolidated JVs, was up double-digits and subscriber trends remain strong, especially in Latin America.","Like the rest of the company, HBO remains focused on containing overheads in order to help fund investments in programming and technology. And adjusting for the international consolidations, SG&A was down in the quarter and total non-programming expenses were up just 2%. So HBO started the year with a lot of momentum from both an operating and a financial perspective and it's on track for another year of solid growth.","Turning now to Warner's, which had a record first quarter, growing revenue by 14% and adjusted operating income by more than 40%. Strong theatrical performance was the biggest driver of growth in the quarter led by the box office success of The LEGO Movie and 300: Rise of an Empire, as well as carryover revenue from the latest Hobbit installment and Gravity.","On the TV side, revenue and associated profits grew due to higher initial telecast revenue related to increased production as well as continued growth from international syndication. We also benefited from double-digit gains and SVOD revenue, mainly due to international growth. We continue to see healthy demand for our product from SVOD services and expect contributions from the SVOD distribution channel to increase this year.","Across theatrical and TV, home entertainment revenue was down in the quarter, largely due to the timing of the release of the latest Hobbit installment on home video, which is in the second quarter this year versus the first quarter of last year. Despite that, digital trends remain positive with Warner electronic sell-through up over 20% in the first quarter.","Consumer spending across the broader home video market was also down in the first quarter due to a softer theatrical slate and the timing of Easter. But digital growth was even stronger for the industry with electronic sell-through up 45%.","So on the whole, we remain very encouraged by the ongoing transition to digital. To help drive that transition, Warner continues to champion industry-wide digital ownership initiative like UltraViolet, which now has over 17 million accounts.","Looking ahead, Warner has very difficult theatrical comparison for the rest of the year. Even so, given a strong start theatrically and positive trends in the TV business, Warner is on pace for another record year in 2014.","Now, onto Time Inc. With the new management team is driving significant changes critical to its success, as an independent public company. Revenues increased 1% in the quarter and benefited from the acquisition of American Express Publishing Corporation.","Excluding this, revenues would have decreased 5% with advertising down 7% and subscription flat. Revenues also benefited from one additional issue each of people and time compared to last year. Adjusted operating loss was $94 million and that was primarily a result of $115 million in restructuring charges in the quarter.","To offset challenging revenue trends, the management team has been extremely focused on cost discipline and changing the way Time Inc. operates, with a goal of stabilizing the business and freeing up resources to invest in growth initiatives. And excluding the acquisition and restructuring charges, expenses fell 3% in the quarter.","Looking forward, Time Inc. remains on track with the outlook we provided in February. Excluding restructuring and severance charges, we expect modest declines in full year adjusted operating income in 2014. And that's largely a function of continuing revenue pressure and incremental public company and stock compensation expenses that Time Inc. will incur this year.","As Jeff noted, we remain on track to complete the spin-off of Time Inc. this quarter. And as part of that process, Time Inc. recently issued senior notes and senior commitments for $1.4 billion in debt and a $500 million revolver. That's consistent with our plan for an initial capital structure that includes approximately $1.3 billion in net debt.","We think this will allow sufficient flexibility to both invest in the business and provide direct returns to shareholders, while also optimizing its cost of capital and delivering attractive levered equity returns to investors. So, Time Inc. has made a lot of progress and is well on its way to executing against its goals for the year and successfully making the transition to a standalone public company.","Moving to free cash flow and including Time Inc., which was very strong in the quarter, the big year-over-year improvement is primarily due to the strong growth in adjusted operating income and a favorable swing in working capital.","The improvement in working capital reflects lower participations and production spend due to title mix at Warner Bros. and the timing of sports programming payments at Turner. Cash interest improved due to the receipt of interest income I noted earlier, but given the additional debt we took on late last year, we expect cash interest to increase for the remainder of the year.","The decline in cash taxes was primarily the result of the timing of audit settlements. As with interest expense, our cash taxes are likely to be higher for the full year due to the expiration of certain favorable tax legislation.","Putting that all together, we do not expect free cash flow to grow at this level for the year. Nonetheless, we're off to a great start from a cash perspective and we fully expect to deliver another year of strong free cash flow in 2014.","Now, onto net debt. We ended the first quarter with $16.7 billion of net debt, down versus the end of 2013 due to the very strong free cash flow generation I just noted, and $1.3 billion in proceeds from the sale of our office space in Time Warner Center. Out net leverage ratio was 2.2x as of March 31.","We returned about $1.3 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases during the quarter, and that's consistent with our continued commitment to provide direct returns to shareholders.","As Jeff mentioned, we intend to move to a target net leverage ratio of 2.75x by the end of 2014, which is faster than our initial plan. Our decision to move more quickly to our target leverage is a reflection of both our confidence in the company's outlook and our view that our stock is very attractive at current level.","In light of that, we'll be accelerating our share repurchase program in the coming quarters. By moving more quickly to our target leverage, we will also move back toward a more efficient cash position following significant inflows from the sale of our office space and the Time Inc. spent.","At the same time, we continue to invest aggressively in our businesses. We've already discussed the investments we are making in great contents across our divisions. We're also investing in strategic M&A to improve our competitive position, add new capabilities and accelerate growth, especially outside the U.S.","While we don't need to do M&A, we're always open to opportunities that complement our existing assets and provide risk-adjusted returns that are more attractive than our alternative uses of capital. And already this year we've committed over $700 million to acquire Eyeworks' international television production operations and to fund an additional round of investment in CME.","This combination of investing in our businesses, opportunistic M&A and significant direct return to shareholders is the same balanced approach to capital allocation we've been employing for a number of years now, and we still believe it's the right approach today.","Now, onto the final slide, which shows our outlook for 2014. We had a great first quarter and feel really good about how we are positioned for the rest of this year. That's given us the confidence to raise our full year 2014 outlook to low-teens adjusted EPS growth.","And keep in mind, that despite our expectation of a negative swing in inter-company eliminations and a higher effective tax rate, between the two, we still anticipate a negative year-over-year impact of approximately $0.15 to $0.20 to adjusted EPS for the year.","Looking more closely at the second quarter, we have somewhat more challenging comparison against what was a very strong quarter a year ago. Even so we anticipate solid growth in both adjusted operating income and adjusted EPS. We're doing all this while investing aggressively for future growth. And as Jeff mentioned, we think we can continue to grow adjusted EPS at attractive levels for the foreseeable future.","With that, I'll turn it back to Mike to start the Q&A.","Michael Kopelman","Thanks, Howard. Joe, can you please open up the lines for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) And it looks like our first question here comes from Mr. Doug Mitchelson from Deutsche Bank.","Meghan Durkin - Deutsche Bank","This is actually Meghan Durkin standing in for Doug. So you talked for a couple of times about the softness in the scatter market. I am curious to hear how the tone is in the sports advertising market and how that compares to the entertainment ad market? And then I have a follow-up.","Jeffery Bewkes","Well, scatter has been relatively steady, but within the sports side it tends to be a little bit softer, we have seen that. And I think what's happened is we are seeing some pull from World Cup coming out of the marketplace just like we saw in the first quarter with the Olympics. So it's a little bit softer than we had anticipated.","Meghan Durkin - Deutsche Bank","The entertainment is just going along similar to how it's been, kind of a little soft?","Jeffery Bewkes","Well, I would say that, if I just stated generally speaking that, we're not seeing quite as much volume. On the entertainment side, we're seeing more of a drag from the ratings side, more so than just the volumes, it's more on -- there's a drag from the ratings.","Meghan Durkin - Deutsche Bank","And then on a completely different topic. I was interested to hear how Jeff would respond to Jeff Katzenberg's recent comments when he was quoted, as saying that movies are not a growth business, but television is.","Jeffery Bewkes","Well, maybe it's for him. He doesn't make very many movies. We've been doing fine in movies. And let's just put some context on. So 2013 for Warner Bros was a record year domestically. We had a very strong slate. We were number one in the box office. I think 2014 was off to a strong start, it's up about 7% in the first quarter.","And we also see continued growth overseas, which has become a bigger driver of our business. International demand on theatrical side is particularly strong for the kinds of the best films that we produce. And we already talked in our -- what we've said already about the films that we had including LEGO and 300 this first quarter, but if you go to the rest of the year, we do have some tough comparisons given how strong we were last year.","But we had a great year last year. For the rest of '14 the slate looks good. We have Godzilla coming, Edge of Tomorrow and the final installment of The Hobbit. So we think we're going to have a record year in 2014. We do think we can grow the business over time and we've been doing it. So we don't agree with that view. And I think it maybe -- the business at their end is quite different.","Operator","Our next question will come from Mr. Ben Swinburne from Morgan Stanley.","Ben Swinburne - Morgan Stanley","Jeff, the extension of your affiliate revenue growth trajectory, the double-digit CAGR into 2018. Trying to get a sense for sort of how much is fully baked already? You have talked about the CAGR through '16, and you had seven of the top 10 deals done. Can you give us some context on the '18 outlook, why did you decide to reveal that to us today and sort of what's the new distribution landscape look like in your decision to go there?","And obviously that lifts the growth of the company and the earnings power of the company over multiple years. Just want to get a little more color on that. And on HBO, the subscriber trends are great. What has to happen to translate the subscriber growth to better revenue growth in the U.S.?","Jeffery Bewkes","Let's do the Turner first. The reason we just wanted to go farther out, we've had the deals that we've been mentioning in place for a while. We had given guidance out three years, we thought that was enough in terms of how our affiliate sales were going. We kept getting questions about our growth after '16, since we have pretty good visibility in it, we thought, we ought to say, since we have deals that go beyond '16, we should provide a little more clarity.","The rate increases we have, we're seeing not just through '16, but also through '18, because the outlook for the three years through '16 hasn't changed. It's still the attractive ramp that we told you about before, but it just continues for a couple of more years. We thought we ought to say that. So that's the Turner stock.","In terms of HBO, there's really strong programming or strong critics and ratings performance, there is strong take-up of GO, there is strong take up of international subscriber growth and there is a pretty robust steady trend in domestic, which I think is where your question is focused. Basically, there is two ways to improve the mix in terms of how we view the deals to provide incentives for affiliate performance.","First, we can focus more resources working with our underperforming affiliates. And that's a combination of incentives and other actions to get out of those markets, the natural HBO subscriber penetration that HBO really earns in terms of its program. And if we're not going to get it through the affiliates that are underperforming, we are going to find ways to make that happen.","Second, we look to sharing the upside of our best performing affiliate and those are the ones who have been really setting a clear benchmark for where HBO can go. And so when we take those deal structures and fit into the more HBO participation in the upside that takes a little bit of time as the renewals come in.","And then finally, if you add on top of that some of the innovations, that certain affiliates have come up with, which are lower-priced packages that you can put HBO in, some broadband-only efforts by facility-based distributors. These are all pretty promising. And I'm not going to give more specifics, but what we have, which is the fundamental underlying good fact is that the viewer's love the HBO program.","The rights and ability of HBO GO to provide it in a very great exciting way is increasing, and the upside that we get from --so that's producing an ability on our part to invest a lot more in programming. We're going to use most of the proceeds from the Amazon transaction to increase our programming going forward. So it's adding up to a very nice platform for future growth, for acceleration of HBO, revenue and earnings growth.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mr. Michael Nathanson from MoffettNathanson.","Michael Nathanson - MoffettNathanson","I have two, one is for Howard, and one is for Jeff. Howard, first on SVOD. You guys have been pretty transparent about SVOD revenues over the past couple of years. I know you won't call it Amazon particularly, but can you give us a sense in '14, how big will SVOD get for the company when you're looking at the entire landscape of SVOD deals? Would you be getting over $500 million or so for '14?","And then for Jeff, I wondered what the move to Amazon represents in terms of what you see for HBO GO in terms of usage trends? Are you seeing pretty much the usage trend is focused on newer product, and therefore the catalog has been pretty much tapped out for HBO GO? And you think there's a chance that, find people who have never seen it before? So what do you have the research on usage by catalog versus new?","Howard Averill","Michael, first on SVOD. So the starting point, we generated about $375 million last year and that was up slightly from 2012 and we think that's near the top of our competitive set. By the way, it doesn't include the revenue that The CW network directly receives from SVOD, which is pretty significant. So we're going to be able to grow that again in 2014. And in terms of where the growth is coming from, a lot of that is coming from international territories"," But again, to keep the overall in the perspective, it is a small portion of our overall revenue. It's about 10% of our TV licensing revenue last year and it's only about 3% of film and TV revenue. More importantly, it's probably the fact that it's clear that there is consumer demand for this content in an on-demand environment and that's particularly true for past seasons of serialized shows. So I'm pretty confident that we're going to be able to continue to monetize that content moving forward.","Jeffery Bewkes","So you were asking about basically the usage in on-demand of HBO viewers between different categories of programming; older, newer and movie series et cetera? Is that what you asked?","Michael Nathanson - MoffettNathanson","Right.","Jeffery Bewkes","Well, so let me try to give me that. That gives me a lot of good news, and which good news outweighs this other good news, so you have all read in the press that the fairly impressive numbers for HBO VOD usage on current episodes of Game of Thrones or True Detective and so on. I mean there's a tremendous usage going on of all current and new series.","There is also, which has not gotten enough attention, a fairly strong usage both in linear programming and in some on-demand usage of the movie slate, let's not forget the movie slate at HBO, it's got by far the strongest line-up of current movie releases. What we're seeing though, when you go and you look at the interest, that viewers have all around the world, included in your question, a lot of people didn't see some of the classic hits at HBO.","And so when you make them available, whether it's the Amazon Prime deal where you can see tremendous shows like Sopranos, but most Amazon Prime subs don't have HBO, so it's a great opportunity to familiarize them with HBO programming, get them interested as prospects for our HBO sub, the affiliates that sell HBO.","So it's a tremendous marketing thing for HBO subscribers over time, in addition to being a very fertile place for people to buy HBO programming, so most of this you do relativity, most of that huge viewing goes to current series. But I think we're going to see some fairly strong viewing and sampling of the HBO classics and the library shows that are coming on Amazon.","Howard Averill","Michael, just to follow-up on the financials of the Amazon deal. We're not going to disclose the specifics, but it is a multi-year deal and we're going to be recognizing revenue reasonably evenly over all years of the contract. So in 2014, we're going to see a pretty -- we're going to recognize pretty much all the revenue related to the transaction in the second quarter.","So when you see a pretty sizeable bump, there's going to be a benefit to HBO season in the second quarter and you're going to see similar lumpy recognition in future years. But in terms of the overall profits, we intend to invest most of those proceeds back into the business including spending on additional programming, marketing and technology spend. So the impact on 2014 is not significant.","Jeffery Bewkes","So the move up, which we're telling you about, the strong year we are having in '14 and the increase in guidance is mostly core trends at Time Warner. It's not in the large part coming out of the Amazon, that's a little part of it, but we're going to invest most of that part.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mr. David Bank from RBC Capital Markets.","David Bank - RBC Capital Markets","Kind of a follow-up on something. I think given your commentary around ratings, it definitely sounds like the softness, x the NCAAs over the past couple of quarters have clearly been driven by content cyclicality as opposed to secular issues. But I wanted to try and drill down a little further, because I think this has been something of a hot topic recently for investors, especially around the upfront.","So I was wondering if you take those sort of core low single-digit growth numbers x the impact of the NCAAs shifting, I mean you have a really enormous portfolio and there are different dayparts, different demo targets, really hard I think for us to track ratings on the outside in a specific way.","Can you give us kind of an aggregate revenue weighted basis GRP decline, so that we could -- how much of this is about pricing versus by impressions, right? I don't mean like scatter pricing over the upfront, but actual kind of blended pricing increases. And then I guess the second part of that is, Jeff, specifically, could you kind of comment on your thoughts right now about the secular strength of national cable advertising dollars versus some of the digital guys fighting for wallet share.","Jeffery Bewkes","I sympathize with that question. You're trying to pull a pattern out.","David Bank - RBC Capital Markets","Thank you for your sympathy.","Jeffery Bewkes","Yes, sometimes when we're talking amongst ourselves, we say, well, let me try to collect your thoughts sort of or my thoughts. So I would simplify, so basically it's about rate, which Howard try to get at and we have stronger and weaker ratings performance. We think that if you really get into under the performance that we're seeing, which we think, it's essentially ratings, a little bit of market, but it's mostly ratings.","And on that issue and it's like anything, follow the money, the big money is TBS, TNT. TNT has been softer than it should have been as we've talked about. Let's get into that from an investment point of view. The way we look at it, we've got the two strongest big reach networks in cable, TBS, TNT and a lot of other networks that are very strong. None of them are flank or weak networks and we need to refresh the original programming and we've got a budget that we talked to you about, that's on our trend line that gives us plenty of money to move towards younger-skewing programming, edgier programming that will fit both brands.","And to the question of how should we view the likelihood of our succeeding, let's remind ourselves that Warner Bros. is Hollywood's leading TV studio; HBO's been more successful with its original program than any other network; Turners had some great success in broad reach, somewhat to old-skewing originals, which we're now going to focus very intently on doing younger ones. There's nothing else to say about Time Warner across those divisions. We know how to create successful TV series. And since Turner has had its share of hits, we're now moving the target towards younger male and female-skewing stuff.","And we have new management that's going to actively pursue this, we think that we'll be able to do this and come up with something -- look, we got to do it and not be complacent, which I'm not saying I tend to be complacent about it, but we're very excited about it and we think that we have all the pieces to have very strong programming strength there over time.","It's going to take a little while, but let's keep a couple of rating things in perspective, and not over focused on current softness at Turner, which is that the Turner domestic advertising is less than 15% of total company revenue. Now, as it turns around that will be a nice lift for us. But just keep that in mind. TBS is still number one in 18 to 49 and 18 to 34 in primetime in the first quarter. Adult Swim remains number one in 18 to 34 and 18 to 49 in total there.","Now, TNT which had the softest was the top five network in '13 and now it's slipped off a little. And CNN is showing great momentum right now. But if you go back to basically TBS and TNT, the answer to your question is the ratings are softer than they are going to be and unless we just can't figure out how to do it, which would be I guess the only downside, this is all going to get a lot better and turn into a fairly strong mid-term and out earnings story at Turner.","Howard Averill","So David, let me just give you a little bit more context about the current trends and it is a combination of factors, so looking at the second quarter for example, scatter pricing for Entertainment Networks is up, it's still up high-single to low double-digits over the upfront. But again, as I mentioned, we're just not seeing much volume overall.","And also just generally speaking to it, but also more for sports, so as I mentioned we saw demand siphoned off in the first quarter and in the second quarter we are seeing it with World Cup, and again, the ratings tend to be a little bit of a drag. Further than that, on the international side, we're also seeing a slight drag from FX and the World Cup.","But going in the other direction we do expect about 300 basis points benefit from NCAA in the second quarter. So as I said in my prepared remarks, that all translates into low single-digit growth in advertising. But from where we sit today that would probably be even on the lower-end of low single-digits. So that gives you a little more color.","Jeffery Bewkes","For that quarter.","Howard Averill","For the quarter, right.","Jeffery Bewkes","Yeah.","Operator","Our next question here comes from Mr. Anthony DiClemente from Nomura.","Anthony DiClemente - Nomura Securities","I have two questions for either Howard or Jeff. You guys mentioned that the Amazon revenue would be recognized evenly over the horizon of the contract. You also said most of this year's revenue will be reinvested in programming and other expenses. So my question is should we think about this year as a one-time step-up in investment in HBO or do you think that the incremental margin on that kind of evenly paced Amazon revenue will expand in 2015?","And then my second question would be in terms of the new guidance or the extension of the double-digit domestic affiliate fee growth, how should we think about how international plays into it over the course of time over that extended five-year period of time? Do you think that international cable will be accretive to that growth rate on the domestic side or not?","Jeffery Bewkes","Let me do the first one and then may ask you about the second. On the HBO, Amazon, what percent of the revenue lift do we decide to take into earnings in a given year? So we said we're going to invest most of it in programming and technical capacity for GO that's because it's expanding so well.","Probably our margin on it would go up over the next few years, but we may decide to invest it as we go in more programming that we find pretty attractive, and that programming, not just supporting the service, subscriber revenue and profit domestically and overseas, those things when we have them and we like them, like with the Game of Thrones, we haven't even sold it yet.","They turn into tremendous sources of content revenue and profit with very large contribution, once you get past hit status, so depending on what we've got, we'll decide later whether we take more of it into earnings or whether we just use it to expand the future earnings basically.","Howard Averill","What was the other question? Can you repeat your second?","Jeffery Bewkes","Could you do it again? We didn't understand.","Anthony DiClemente - Nomura Securities","The other question is as we model Turner going forward, you've got domestic and international, and you guys are providing guidance on the domestic side, and we're just trying to figure out what that equates to on a global basis. So over the next five years, do you expect the international piece to be accretive or dilutive to your double-digit affiliate fee guidance on the domestic side? Is that clear?","Jeffery Bewkes","You are trying to find out if the international is double-digit on its own base, is that what you're saying?","Anthony DiClemente - Nomura Securities","Yes, that'd be great to know.","Jeffery Bewkes","We're trying to figure out if we have thought of it that way. The international trends are really strong. Does anybody have the exact percentage growth of international?","Howard Averill","Ends up high single-digits in the first quarter.","Jeffery Bewkes","It's probably better.","Howard Averill","Well, we think it's going to be that, I mean, there has been a drag on FX particularly this year, but it is growing from an organic standpoint.","Anthony DiClemente - Nomura Securities","Maybe another way to ask the question would be you have these deals in place on the domestic side that are long-term and multi-year. Do you have that kind of visibility internationally that would give you the conviction to put forth kind of a similar type of affiliate guidance for international or not?","Jeffery Bewkes","International's is not one country, it's many. So there's no simple answer, because each territory is different. The sub-growth is different. In Latin America, which is our biggest region, the biggest driver is not the price increase in the affiliates deal, many of which we have going on and there is some decent price increases, most of it is volume increases that are pretty significant. And you can just look at the numbers we have been posting and see extremely strong, secular sub-growth all across Latin America, our biggest region.","You then go into our other regions, Eastern Europe, the Rim of Asia, we're launching new networks, such as HBO in the Netherlands and the Nordic regions and India. CNN in Indonesia, truTV in Brazil, TNT in Chile and some of the other expansion of our South America sourced channels.","So generally we don't see that much of -- more of the increase overseas is in sub-growth than in pricing, because it is similar to the stage of development that the international markets are in. What's good about that is that the international trends are set. And if you don't have FX going against you, you would probably be in a pretty steady double-digit neighborhood. And it's hard to say what the FX trends are going to be.","Operator","Our next question here comes from Vasily Karasyov from Sterne, Agee.","Vasily Karasyov - Sterne, Agee","Jeff, I wanted to follow-up on your comments on the Turner and upcoming turnaround hopefully in ratings and programming. You said that some of the originals ended up skewing-older than -- was that by design or did it just end up doing that? And I wonder if you could tell us, where you think -- I am sure you have very sophisticated research, where the viewers' went and where, assuming the cable total viewership is stable, whom should you take share from with the new programming at Turner?","Jeffery Bewkes","Yes. So I think the first part of your question is the reason, some of our Turner original, particularly on TNT skewed older, is it because we aimed for that and hit the target. And the answer is yes. So that actually gives us a fair amount of confidence that when we move the sighting of what we're aiming at, we'll hit that target too.","The reason we were doing the former aim at big general entertainment audiences is that is come-off the very successful Turner strategy of being the network -- the broadcast network replacement. That was working great for the advertisers and audiences. There were shows like The Closer, Rizzoli & Isles, which have the biggest audiences in cable right next to a broadcast series","But what's happened I think as we all know is that the younger viewership has become more important and the advertisement interest in more younger skewing, a little edgier programming than what they wanted to buy a couple of years ago has become pretty pronounced.","Some of that is probably because there have been some very good series that showed up on some basic networks that were like that, Breaking Bad is a good example. And some of it is because everyone has got a little change in their view advertising included, the viewers too, that came out of subscription via these shows that are serialized and edgier. And so basically the interest of the audience and the growth of the younger audience has meant back the better target and that's where we'll be.","Vasily Karasyov - Sterne, Agee","And would that also translate into higher CPM hopefully?","Jeffery Bewkes","Yes. More ratings, higher CPMs, more money.","Operator","Our last question here will come from Mr. Michael Morris from Guggenheim.","Michael Morris - Guggenheim","Two questions, one, for Jeff. Disney and DISH recently reached a deal that allows them to provide a personal subscription service via broadband, and it requires more participation. So my question is, have you considered that? Are you discussing the topic with DISH and what would it take for you to get involved or participate in a service like that?","And then Howard, just on return of capital, clearly great cash flow and return of capital is primarily focused on the share repurchases. Can you talk a little bit about the thought process of continuing with repurchases versus dividends, just given how strong and stable and growing your affiliate streams are, could support higher dividend growth story?","Jeffery Bewkes","Let me start on the DISH question. So DISH, Sony, Verizon are all expressing interest in virtual MVPDs. There is a lot of discussion about this. Of course, we're talking with all of them as we have been, and are certainly open to opportunities to grow our business. We're not philosophically opposed to that kind of structure, but we have to believe it will be additive and sustainable. And so there are a fair number of questions in terms of the ad model, the quality of service over whichever broadband method they are thinking about and how this would impact investment in the plan that we all need to develop high quality TV.","What you asked about I think specifically, which is the DISH-Disney arrangement could be interesting for us. And it's not so different than the Comcast innovation, selling HBO on a light weight TV package. So, yes, we're talking to DISH about whether there is some applicability of that for us.","It could allow them and other distributors to target a group of consumers, but otherwise might not subscribe to multichannel TV. And to the extent that that is a good entree into the ecosystem for younger consumers, but then either because it serves them well and does not cannibalize what they would otherwise do as a video subscriber or leaves them to become bigger package video subscribers, that's good for everybody. So we are exploring that.","Howard Averill","Michael, on dividend versus buyback, obviously, we think both should play a role in our effort to try to get returns. But it's important to note that we have the highest payout and the highest dividend yield of our peer group. We announced the 10% increase in our dividend back in February, at the same time as we mentioned early, we think the stock is attractive, so we also find repurchasing shares to be a good vehicle for additional returns to shareholders. And this is all really consistent with what we've done in the past few years. And the clock is really not changing. So there is no reason to expect that we're going to deviate from that formula.","Michael Kopelman","Thanks everybody for joining us today. As always we're here for any additional questions. Have a great day.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."],"20353":["Time Warner (NYSE:TWX) Q4 2013 Earnings Call February  5, 2014 10:30 AM ET","Executives","Michael Kopelman - Senior Vice President of Investor Relations","Jeffrey L.

[Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Michael Kopelman, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations at Time Warner. Mr. Kopelman, you may begin.","Michael Kopelman","Thanks, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Time Warner's Fourth Quarter and Full Year Earnings Conference Call.","This morning, we issued 2 press releases, one detailing our results for the fourth quarter and full year and the other providing our 2014 full year business outlook, which excludes Time Inc.","Before we begin, there are 3 items I need to cover. First, we refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Schedules setting out reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our earnings release and trending schedules. These reconciliations are available on our website at www.timewarner.com\/investors. Reconciliations of our expected future financial performance are also included in the business outlook release that is available on our website.","Second, today's announcement includes certain forward-looking statements, which are based on management's current expectations. Actual results may vary materially from those expressed or implied by these statements due to various factors. These factors are discussed in detail in Time Warner's SEC filings, including its most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q.","Time Warner is under no obligation, and in fact, expressly disclaims any obligation to update or alter its forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.","And lastly, in the fourth quarter, the company separated its former network's reportable segment into 2 reportable segments: Turner and Home Box Office.","In addition, during the fourth quarter, the company changed the name of its Film and TV Entertainment reportable segment to Warner Bros., and its publishing reportable segment to Time Inc. The new presentation had no impact on the historical consolidated financial information previously reported by the company.","Thank you, and I'll turn the call over to Jeff. Jeff?","Jeffrey L. Bewkes","Thanks, Mike, and thanks for listening in this morning. 2013 was another very successful year for the company. We grew adjusted operating income 8%, adjusted earnings per share increased 16%, we generated over $3.5 billion in free cash flow, and we returned almost $5 billion to stockholders through buybacks and dividends.","These accomplishments were the result of a strategy that served us very well, not just last year, but for the past 5 years.","Between 2008 and 2013, we grew adjusted operating income at close to a double-digit compound annual growth rate, and we turned that into average annual growth and adjusted EPS of more than 20% a year.","We've achieved that through a combination of solid revenue growth, tight cost control and disciplined capital allocation.","In fact, over that period, we allocated nearly $20 billion to dividends and share repurchases.","As we announced this morning, we anticipate another year of double-digit growth and adjusted EPS, excluding Time Inc., in 2014. And we're committed to continue providing direct returns to stockholders, as evidenced by the new $5 billion share repurchase authorization and 10% increase in our dividend approved by our board. That marks the fifth straight year we've increased our dividend double-digits.","The consistency of our performance over the last few years is a result of our unwavering focus on the same key objectives that we've been talking to you about for quite a while.","First and foremost, we're investing aggressively in the best content. Second, we're focused on harnessing technology and developing new business models to increase the value of our content to consumers and distributors and drive growth for our businesses. Third, we're increasing our presence in the most attractive international territories to take advantage of growing demand for our content outside the United States. And fourth, we're constantly striving to optimize our operating and capital efficiency to drive improved returns.","So let me briefly talk about the progress we made on each of those objectives in 2013 and how we have positioned ourselves for success in 2014 and beyond.","I'll start with our investment in great content and storytelling, the heart of what we do.","At Turner, we're significantly increasing our investments in programming, particularly in originals, to keep our networks at the very top of the industry.","TBS finished 2013 as the #1 cable network in prime time in adults 18 to 49 for the first time in over a decade.","The Big Bang Theory remains a big part of that success and was once again the #1 comedy on ad-supported cable.","But TBS has also been building a strong stable of original hits, with Cougar Town, Ground Floor, Sullivan & Son and Men at Work, all among the top 10 original sitcoms on ad-supported cable this year.","And while TNT has hit a bit of a soft patch the past few months, it still finished 2013 as the #2 cable network among adults 25 to 54 in total day, and #4 in prime time among adults 18 to 49.","Four of TNT's hit shows, Rizzoli & Isles, Major Crimes, Falling Skies and Perception, were among the top 15 originals in prime time on basic cable. That's more top hits than any other basic cable network.","In 2014, TBS and TNT are going to increase their investment in high-quality originals by approximately 20%, including some high-profile new launches from TNT later this year: The Last Ship, Legends and Murder in the First.","Turner is also raising its game in high-profile sports. Our March Madness coverage will include Elite Eight and Final Four games for the first time this year. That bolsters a strong lineup of sports that already includes the NBA and Major League Baseball.","Adult Swim is also on a roll. It had its highest viewership ever in 2013, growing its total day audience double-digits in audience 18 to 34, and finishing as the #1 cable network in that demo for the ninth straight year.","As Adult Swim has grown in popularity, we've continued to expand its programming hours. And in April, we're going to add another, expanding it to the 8 p.m. hour.","In 2013, CNN overtook MSNBC as the #2 cable news network in total day viewership.","But we still have a lot of work to do. In 2014, CNN is focused on remaining the place where viewers turn for breaking news, revamping prime time, broadening the programming schedule to better hold audiences during slower news cycles, and extending its leadership in multi-platform news.","truTV had a dip in its performance in 2013, but it remained a top 20 basic cable network among men, and we have a lot of confidence in the direction new leadership is taking it. We think there's significant opportunity to both grow audience and better monetize its position as we refresh tru's programming in the second half of this year.","The strength of Turner's brands and success of our programming strategy have been reflected in our recent affiliate negotiations.","Since we last reported earnings, we've signed 3 additional top 10 U.S. distributors to long-term affiliate agreements. That means that during this negotiating cycle, we have now signed 7 of the top 10 distributors including 2 of the top 5.","All these deals have been consistent with our expectation that Turner will average double-digit growth in domestic subscription revenue over the next 3 years. You will start to see the impact of many of those deals in the first quarter, and given our progress to date, we now have even more confidence in that multi-year outlook.","Now speaking of high-quality, high-impact programming, HBO remains in a league of its own. This year, HBO won 27 Primetime Emmy Awards, the most of any network for the 12th year in a row, and tied for the most Golden Globes of any network.","HBO's value to its viewers and distribution partners was evident in the continued growth in its subscriber base.","Last year, HBO added almost 2 million subscribers in the U.S., its highest increase in 17 years. That included solid growth across both HBO and Cinemax.","HBO is going to up the ante again in 2014, increasing its original series hours and investment in original programming. That includes returning hits like Game of Thrones, Boardwalk Empire, True Blood and Girls, as well as 5 new series. One of those, True Detective, is already looking like it will be one of HBO's biggest hits. It premiered to critical acclaim last month, and the cumulative audience for its first episode has already passed 10 million [ph] viewers.","We're also excited about The Leftovers, a Warner Bros. show from Damon Lindelof, which debuts in June and could be the next big hit for HBO.","Now let's turn to Warner Bros. It had a banner year creatively and commercially in film and television production, leading the industry by practically any measure and recording the highest profits in its history.","Theatrically, Warner Bros. led both domestic and international box offices, crossing $5 billion in global box office for the first time in its history. That included 7 movies with more than $300 million in global box office, led by hits such as the second installment of The Hobbit, Gravity and Man of Steel.","Warner Bros. films also received an industry-leading 21 Oscar nominations, including Best Picture nominations for Gravity and for Her.","In 2014, we had another strong slate, led by titles like the Lego Movie, which opens this Friday; Edge of Tomorrow, starring Tom Cruise; Jupiter Ascending, from the Wachowskis; Godzilla; Christopher Nolan's Interstellar; and the final installment of The Hobbit.","In television production, Warner Bros. was also unrivaled in 2013. Over the course of this TV season, Warner's will have produced 32 shows for broadcast networks, again more than any other studio.","Among adults 18 to 49, these shows include the #1 comedy in The Big Bang Theory, the #1 unscripted show in The Voice, and the #3 drama in The Following. And including our production for cable networks, Warner TV is producing over 60 shows in total this season.","Let me turn to our second area of strategic focus, digital. Our goal is to give consumers more ways to access our content on more platforms. That will increase the value of our content to consumers, bolster our existing businesses and open up additional opportunities for monetization.","For example, Turner continues to lead in providing TV Everywhere rights to its distribution partners. This last year, Turner expanded its TV Everywhere offering to include live streaming of its networks in and out of the home. And Turner is now working to provide modem-based authentication for TV Everywhere, reducing the need for people to sign in.","As we've said in the past, we think distributors need to accelerate the deployment of TV Everywhere capabilities, invest in better consumer interfaces and simplify authentication. Those will be key areas of focus for us in this year, 2014.","Turner's digital efforts aren't limited to TV Everywhere. For instance, Bleacher Report grew its monthly unique visitors by almost 40% in 2013 and ended the year as a top 3 digital sports destination.","And CNN remained the #1 multi-platform provider of news in the U.S., significantly outstripping its cable news peers and leading the industry, the news industry, in mobile users.","HBO continues to set the standard for the industry with its TV Everywhere apps, HBO GO and MAX GO.","In 2013, active users of HBO GO grew over 30% and average monthly usage increased by double digits. HBO GO is now available in 23 countries outside the U.S. as well. And HBO will be investing even more this year to make the HBO GO user experience even better.","In home entertainment, Warner Bros. is also making progress in improving the user experience for its digital products. One of the most important initiatives on that front is UltraViolet, the industry standard designed to make it easier for consumers to access their content on multiple platforms.","UltraViolet ended 2013 with more than 15 million accounts. That's a 65% increase from the end of 2012. Awareness still needs to improve, but the consumers who use UltraViolet love it. And we think more and more consumers will enjoy its benefits as retail support continues to increase.","You can see the impact that improving experience is having on consumer behavior in almost 50% growth in electronic sales for the industry last year. That helped drive an increase in domestic consumer spending on home entertainment for the first time in 8 years.","With UltraViolet now available in 9 countries outside the U.S. and plans to expand further, we're hopeful we'll also see stabilization in international home video revenue over the next few years. That's a perfect segue to our third strategic objective, which is international growth.","Including HBO's unconsolidated ventures, we generated nearly $10 billion in revenue outside the U.S. in 2013. That's 1\/3 of our revenue. We think there is a big opportunity to grow this over time, given the increase in multi-channel TV penetration, the expansion of premium and SVOD services into new territories and growth in theatrical screens in emerging markets.","And our biggest international business is at Warner Bros., which generates nearly half its revenue from outside the U.S.","In 2013, Warner's grossed over $3 billion at the international box office, with 10 movies grossing more than $100 million.","Warner's also continues to expand its international TV business, with revenue approaching $1.5 billion in 2013.","Perhaps our biggest international opportunity is at our international networks. Including HBO's unconsolidated joint ventures, our international networks generated more than $3 billion in revenues and over $750 million in adjusted operating income in 2013.","Despite a continued drag from foreign exchange, we're on track to take that to $1 billion in the next couple of years.","We're seeing particularly strong growth in Latin America, where Turner grew its revenues double-digits and grew its profits by over 25%.","Latin America is also a source of strong growth for HBO, which helped drive its international subscriber base up over 15% in 2013 to end the year with 84 million HBO subs outside the United States. That means HBO ended the year with almost 130 million subs globally.","As we make these investments in content, technology and international expansion, our fourth objective is to improve our efficiency to help fund them.","To that end, we announced last month the sale of our office space at Columbus Circle in New York. Our intention is to relocate our headquarters and all our New York City-based operations to a new tower in the Hudson Yards development on the West Side of Manhattan, beginning in late 2018.","That would include approximately 5,000 employees from across Time Warner Corporate, HBO, Turner and Warner Bros. Moving into a dynamic new complex will foster even more collaboration and creativity across our businesses. And by consolidating space from 7 buildings throughout the Metro area, we'll be able to reallocate substantial savings to our primary business of creating valuable and engaging content for audiences around the world.","We're also pleased with the progress Time Inc.'s new management team is making in its preparations to become an independent publicly traded company, and we remain on track to complete the spinoff in the second quarter of this year.","In closing, we had a tremendous year in 2013. We posted record financial results while investing aggressively for the future. We also put in place the next generation of leaders, with new CEOs at each of our divisions. And with the decision to spin off Time Inc., we set ourselves on a path to being a pure-play content company, with an emphasis on video and television in particular.","So we're embarked on an exciting new phase for the company, and with our strong brands, leading scale and focused strategy, I'm more confident than ever in our prospects to drive attractive growth in 2014 and for many years to come.","With that, I want to turn it over to Howard for his first earnings call as our Chief Financial Officer. Take it away, Howard.","Howard M. Averill","Thanks, Jeff, and good morning. I'll begin by referring to the first slide of our presentation, which is now available on our website.","As Mike noted, we're breaking out HBO and Turner for the first time with these results. As we become a smaller, more TV-focused company, we hope you will find the new presentation helpful.","Starting with consolidated results. As Jeff discussed, we had another great year in 2013, with revenues up 4%, adjusted operating income up 8%, and adjusted EPS up 16%.","Turner, HBO and Warner Bros. all posted record adjusted operating income. And if you exclude Time Inc., adjusted OI grew over 9%, and adjusted EPS grew 19%.","We were able to achieve all that despite a slight dip in adjusted OI in the fourth quarter. And that was largely related to the impairment of programming at Turner, as well as the timing of programming and related marketing spending at Turner and HBO.","Even so, we limited expense growth to 3% this year and drove margins up almost 100 basis points, our fifth straight year of margin expansion.","Over those 5 years, margins have increased over 600 basis points. We remain intensely focused on managing our cost structure in order to free up resources to invest even more in our businesses. And we expect that focus will allow us to continue to grow margins over the next several years.","Adjusted EPS was up slightly in the quarter and 16% for the year, our fifth straight year of double-digit adjusted EPS growth. And that was despite a drag on this year's earnings due to equity losses from CME.","Along with our strong full year operating performance, growth benefited from a lower effective tax rate and $3.7 billion in share repurchases.","So combining our repurchases with $1.1 billion in dividends, we returned almost $5 billion to stockholders in 2013. This is an increase of more than 10% year-over-year and exceeded our free cash flow by more than 35%.","And as evidenced by the dividend increase and new repurchase authorization we announced this morning, we remain committed to delivering significant direct returns to shareholders.","So we're really pleased with our performance in 2013, and we feel great about how we are positioned going into 2014 and beyond.","As you saw this morning, for the first time, we are providing a full year outlook for the company, excluding Time Inc. Following a spinoff, which we expect will occur in the second quarter, Time Inc. will be reflected as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements and will no longer be reflected in our adjusted EPS.","Excluding Time Inc., we anticipate another year of double-digit growth in adjusted EPS. I'll provide additional context around our outlook as we go through the presentation.","Now turning to the segment highlights. I'll begin at Turner, where we achieved record adjusted operating income for the year despite a slight decline in the fourth quarter. Advertising revenues grew 5% for the year and a modest 1% in the quarter, a little lighter than we had originally expected. And that was due to a combination of softer-than-expected ratings and a weak scatter market in November.","Domestic advertising was flat in the quarter. That included mid-single-digit growth at the entertainment networks, including kids and young adults. Domestic news declined double-digits in the quarter, owing to the comparison against the 2012 U.S. presidential election and ongoing softness in the news advertising marketplace.","International advertising was up modestly in the quarter. That reflected healthy growth in Latin America, while performance was softer elsewhere, particularly in Asia and international news.","Looking ahead to the first quarter of 2014, we anticipate total advertising to grow in the mid- to high-single-digits. Scatter pricing is up high-single to low double-digits over the upfront, though ratings will likely remain somewhat of a drag on our performance.","Also keep in mind that we will be airing 2 NCAA Elite Eight games, which we expect to provide a boost of around 200 to 300 basis points to total ad growth in the quarter.","Similarly, second quarter ad growth will benefit by around 300 to 400 basis points from the airing of 2 Final Four games. That revenue will come with additional expenses, such that the net impact will probably be a slight drag on adjusted OI.","Moving on. Subscription revenues were up 6% in the quarter and 5% for the year, and that included an FX drag of approximately 100 basis points for both periods.","Excluding the impact of FX, international Subscription revenue grew double-digits in both the fourth quarter and for the year, and Latin America was once again our strongest region.","As we look forward, we should start to see the benefits of Turner's domestic affiliate renewals in the first quarter. We also continue to see healthy subscriber dynamics in international territories, though FX headwinds remain a drag there.","Taken together, we anticipate an acceleration in our Subscription revenue growth into the high single-digits.","Adjusted operating income was up 6% for the year, but down 3% in the quarter. The decline in the fourth quarter was a result of a significant increase in programming expenses, which grew 12%. That growth included around $70 million of programming impairments related to our decision to stop airing certain programming due to its poor performance. We also significantly increased our investment in original programming and related marketing spend at our domestic networks in the quarter.","Even with the ramp-up in programming and marketing spend in the fourth quarter, for the year, programming expenses were up just 6%, and we limited total expense growth to 4%. And we were able to do that by keeping SG&A essentially flat, reflecting our continued commitment to tightly managing overhead costs.","So all in all, we had another good year at Turner. Excluding programming impairments, adjusted operating income would have grown about 8% for the year and margins would have expanded over 100 basis points. And we think we're in great position to grow at attractive levels in 2014 and beyond.","Moving on to HBO. We had another year of healthy margin expansion and strong growth in adjusted operating income. Subscription revenues were up 8% in the quarter and 6% for the year. And the consolidation of HBO Asia and HBO Nordic contributed around 400 basis points to the growth in the quarter, and approximately 100 basis points for the year.","Domestically, we had relatively steady Subscription revenue growth throughout the year. And as Jeff mentioned, HBO and Cinemax, together, added almost 2 million domestic subscribers in 2013.","Keep in mind, the majority of these subscriber additions are non-revenue-generating. Still, the subscriber gains reflect very healthy demand for HBO. So as we look ahead, we feel good about the trajectory of Subscription revenues.","Turning to content revenues. We saw a 9% drop in the quarter, and that was mostly due to soft demand for home video library product. However, we continue to see very healthy demand for the licensing of our content internationally, and these revenues were up solidly for the year.","HBO has been investing significant resources in its international operations in recent years, and including HBO's unconsolidated joint ventures, international accounted for approximately 1\/4 of HBO's total revenue in 2013. That was helped by solid double-digit growth in subscribers, with particularly strong growth in Latin America.","Given positive trends, we anticipate that international will be an even larger portion of HBO's future -- business in the future.","Adjusted operating income was down 4% in the quarter, but would have been flat without the consolidation of HBO's international properties I noted earlier.","On the cost side, programming expenses grew 12%, with HBO Asia and HBO Nordic contributing nearly 800 basis points to that growth.","Increased spending on originals also contributed to programming expense growth, and we ramped up marketing spend in the quarter to support our original programming lineup, including high-profile first quarter launches, such as True Detective.","Despite the drop in the fourth quarter, adjusted operating income grew 8% for the year, and margins expanded 130 basis points. So we had another good year financially while growing our subscribers significantly, both in the U.S. and internationally. And that gives us a lot of confidence about the opportunity for continued attractive growth in the years ahead.","Turning now to Warner's, where the studio ended a record year with a record quarter. Adjusted operating income grew 4% in the quarter and 7% for the year to over $1.3 billion. Theatrically, we had a tremendous year, ending #1 at both the domestic and international box office. Our fourth quarter theatrical results were highlighted by the strong performances of Gravity and the second installment of The Hobbit.","On the TV side, revenue and associated profits were down for the year, in part due to the comparisons against the syndication of The Mentalist in 2012. But Warner's remained the industry leader in shows produced for broadcast networks, and we continue to see healthy demand for our content, both domestically and internationally.","So TV production remained the largest contributor to the segment, and we feel good about the trends here.","The performance of our video games slate was also a meaningful contributor to growth this year, led by the fourth quarter release of Batman: Arkham Origins and continued strong results of the LEGO franchise.","This is an area where we have been able to leverage our brands and IP to develop new franchises and where we see the opportunity for further growth in the coming years.","Across theatrical and TV, home entertainment revenue declined 6% in the quarter and 3% for the year. Both of those included a pretty tough comparison to the release of The Dark Knight Rises in the fourth quarter of 2012.","In addition, we have seen some softness in catalog. However, we're seeing very positive trends in digital across both theatrical and television product, with electronic sell-through up over 50% in the quarter and over 40% for the year. That mirrors trends in the broader industry, as initiatives like UV that we have championed are starting to have a significant impact. After 8 years of declines in total consumer spending, the industry grew 1% in 2013. That's a reflection of digital revenue growing fast enough to make up for physical declines. For context, Warner Bros. digital revenue for theatrical and TV product grew double-digits to almost $1 billion in 2013, and we expect it to grow double-digits again in 2014.","Putting it altogether, Warner's had another great year and once again set a high bar for itself. In what is often referred to as a mature business, Warner's has managed to grow its adjusted operating income at a 10% CAGR over the past 5 years. And while that won't be achievable every year, we have great confidence in our ability to continue to grow the business over time.","Now on to Time Inc., where challenging conditions continued to weigh on results for both the quarter and the year.","Revenue in the quarter included the positive impact of the inclusion of American Express Publishing Corporation, which we acquired in October, and the negative impact from the shift of an issue of both People and Sports Illustrated into the third quarter.","Excluding these items, revenues would have declined 6% in the quarter, with advertising down 5%, subscription down 8%, and other down 4%.","The underlying drop in advertising revenue reflected softness in print advertising, both domestically and internationally. Digital advertising revenue was up modestly for both the quarter and the year.","Similarly, subscription revenues included the impact of declines across both domestic and international titles, with newsstand remaining an area of particular softness.","Adjusted operating income declined 14% in the quarter, despite a drop in expenses when excluding the American Express Publishing titles.","Looking ahead to 2014, the operating environment remains challenging. So excluding the impact of our acquisition of American Express Publishing Corporation, we anticipate continued declines in advertising and circulation revenues.","Within that context, the new management team announced yesterday that they are beginning a process to make significant changes to the way Time Inc. operates, with a goal of stabilizing the business and freeing up resources to invest in growth initiatives.","As part of their efforts to reengineer the company, Time Inc. will dissolve their operating clusters to help make them flatter, more nimble, and better able to respond to a rapidly changing landscape. To that end, we anticipate taking restructuring charges of around $150 million in the first half, around 2\/3 of which we expect to hit in the first quarter.","Excluding restructuring charges, we expect modest declines in adjusted operating income, both in the first quarter and for the full year. And that's largely a function of continuing revenue pressure and incremental public company and stock compensation expenses that Time Inc. will incur this year. They'll have more to say about their plans as we get closer to the spinoff.","One important decision we made is Time Inc.'s capital structure. While there could be some minor adjustments for working capital, we intend to spin off Time Inc. with a net debt of around $1.3 billion. We think that level will allow sufficient flexibility to both invest in the business and provide direct returns to stockholders, while also optimizing its cost of capital and delivering attractive levered equity returns to investors.","Moving on to the next slide, which shows our outlook, excluding Time Inc., for 2014. As I noted before, we had another great year in 2013, and we feel very good about how we are positioned for this year.","At Turner, we'll benefit from the domestic affiliate renewal cycle, which should drive a nice improvement in Subscription revenue growth. At the same time, we're expecting an increase in programming expense growth, primarily due to the airing of the NCAA Final Four, the first year of our new Major League Baseball contract, and increased investments in originals. And while international growth remains a positive driver, at this point, FX appears likely to remain a drag.","Taken all together, we anticipate Turner's adjusted OI growth will accelerate significantly in 2014.","At HBO, we're encouraged by the continued strength and demand for our services, and that should help Subscription revenue growth. That will be balanced against an increase in programming expense growth related to continued investment in originals and the addition of a full slate of Summit films to our theatrical line up.","We'll also be investing even more in technology as we develop the next generation of HBO GO. Even with these investments, we're anticipating another year of solid growth in adjusted operating income.","At Warner Bros., we obviously have very challenging comparisons coming off a record year. So it could be difficult to grow. But we think we have a great film slate, and we anticipate an improvement in TV performance given strong global demand and the syndication of Mike & Molly. That all gives us confidence that 2014 will be another great year for the studio.","So looking across all 3 segments, we're set up for a very good year from an operating perspective. One thing to keep in mind is that intercompany eliminations are likely to be somewhat of a drag this year due to increased sales of product from Warner Bros. to both Turner and HBO. That's a pretty big shift from 2013 when we benefited from a positive swing in this line.","We also anticipate a higher effective tax rate, as our 2013 rate included several favorable audit settlements and the recognition of additional foreign tax credit carryovers. So between a swing in eliminations and the higher effective tax rate, we estimate the impact on 2014 adjusted EPS to be $0.15 to $0.20.","Despite that, we expect another very good year in 2014. We see a tremendous amount of opportunity across our businesses, and we're investing aggressively in our industry-leading brands to drive increased scale and long-term growth.","At the same time, we're tightly managing our non-revenue-generating expenses in order to provide attractive near- to medium-term financial results. All of that is reflected in our outlook for low double-digit growth in adjusted EPS.","Turning to the next slide, which looks at our free cash flow. We generated very strong free cash flow of $3.5 billion in 2013. That's up almost 20% versus 2012, and that was mostly due to strong growth in adjusted operating income.","Also, cash taxes, cash interest and capital expenditures were all lower year-over-year.","The decline in cash taxes was primarily a result of tax law extenders that were passed by Congress in January of 2013. That's been a positive driver all year. And the decline in cash interest was largely due to slightly lower cost of debt and debt balances as we paid off higher cost maturities early in the year and eventually replaced them with longer-term maturities in the fourth quarter.","Our use of working capital increased slightly as a result of higher participations at Warner Bros.","Excluding Time Inc., we generated around $3.1 billion of free cash flow in 2013.","For 2014, keep in mind that as a result of the expiration of certain favorable tax legislation and lower foreign tax credits, our cash taxes are likely to be higher.","In addition, we're now carrying additional debt, which will result in increased cash interest expense. Still, we should have another year of very strong free cash flow.","Turning to the final slide, which looks at our net debt. We ended 2013 with $18.3 billion of net debt, and our leverage ratio was 2.4x.","During the year, we took advantage of continued favorable market conditions to strengthen our balance sheet by extending the maturity of our $5 billion credit facilities to 2018 and issuing $1 billion of new long-term debt.","In addition to investing in our businesses, we deployed just under $500 million in strategic M&A transactions.","Also, as I previously mentioned, we returned almost $5 billion of capital to our stockholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases.","And as Jeff discussed earlier, we recently sold our office space in Time Warner Center and intend to relocate our corporate headquarters to the Hudson Yards development at the end of 2018. That will result in a net inflow of around $1.1 billion in 2014.","Over time, we will essentially reinvest the proceeds into our new building. And until we move, we will lease space in Time Warner Center. The transaction will have a negligible impact on our earnings over the next few years, but we expect significant savings when we ultimately consolidate our New York City footprint at our new headquarters.","So I am pleased with how we executed in our capital plan in 2013, and we're off to a good start in 2014. As part of our planning for 2014 and beyond, we have decided to increase our net leverage ratio target from 2.5x to up to 2.75x, with the expectation that we will get there over the next 2 years.","In part, this decision is a reflection that after the Time Inc. spinoff, we will have a less cyclical business mix with better secular trends. We think modestly increasing our leverage will lower our blended cost of capital while affording us additional flexibility that we can use to make investments in our businesses and to continue providing a significant level of direct returns to our stockholders.","At the same time, we believe it will allow us to maintain favorable access to the capital markets across a variety of potential macroeconomic scenarios. We do not anticipate the change will have an impact on our credit ratings, and we remain committed to maintaining solid investment-grade credit ratings moving forward.","In that context, I want to take a moment to discuss our capital allocation priorities, which are not changing. Our first priority is always to maintain a strong balance sheet so that we can fully invest in our businesses. Next, we always look at M&A opportunities that present themselves, but we have sufficient scale, so we don't need to do anything.","Potential transactions need to provide strategic benefits with reasonable execution risk and adequate financial return. That means risk-adjusted returns need to be more attractive than other uses of capital, including share repurchases.","Beyond that, we are committed to providing meaningful direct returns to stockholders, with a significant and growing dividend and continued share repurchases.","If you look back over the last 5 years, you'll see what that approach has yielded. Since 2008, we have generated close to $15 billion in free cash flow, and we paid out close to $5 billion in dividends, repurchased close to $15 billion of our shares or 32% of our base. And we spent around $3 billion on acquisitions. And we've been able to do that while maintaining our credit ratings and retaining the ability to access capital markets on attractive terms.","So we feel good about our approach and intend to continue on a similar path moving forward.","With that, I'll turn it back to Mike to start the Q&A.","Michael Kopelman","Thanks, Howard. Joe, can you please open up the queue for Q&A? [Operator Instructions] Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question here is from Mr. Michael Nathanson from MoffettNathanson.","Michael Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC","I have one for Howard and one for Jeff. And Howard, welcome to the job. Before John left, John had signaled that programming costs in '14 at the networks would run, I think, in the high single-digit range. And now that you have separated out HBO and Turner, I wonder if you could help fine-tune that growth rate by division for '14?","Howard M. Averill","Michael, thank you. Yes, you're right. For context, we had actually set expectations for mid- to high-single-digit in programming costs in the network segment level. And that hasn't actually changed. But when you translate it to our current segments, it's going to translate to more like high single-digit growth at Turner and mid single-digit growth at HBO. And the faster growth at Turner is really basically driven by sports. So for example, if you took a look this year, we're going to have the first year of our baseball deal and the first year we're going to be airing Elite Eight games and Final Four games. So if you look ahead, also to 2016 and 2017, we're going to anticipate an increase based on the NBA package. But all of this is consistent with what we've talked about in the past. And Mike, we think by continuing to drive the revenue growth and tightly managing the rest of our costs, we're going to be in a position to continue to drive margins at both Turner and HBO.","Michael Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC","Okay. And then let me ask one for Jeff. This is a bit about TNT strategy. In the past couple of weeks, we've seen 3 off-network procedural dramas, Person of Interest, Elementary, Blue Bloods, that may have worked in the past on TNT, go someplace else in cable. And I wondered, the decision not to acquire those shows. What does that say about either procedurals, your pipeline or kind of -- or the value of the shows? So typically, you guys have acquired procedurals and this time, you didn't. And so what's behind that strategy?","Jeffrey L. Bewkes","Okay. Thanks. We still think that the mix of sports, originals and acquired shows is the right strategy. And just to your question, if you look at the data out there, 5 of the top 10 scripted shows on broadcast in the '13 to '14 season are procedurals. And 2 of the top 5 cable networks in prime time last year had significant numbers of procedurals. So the evidence suggests that consumers still have a strong appetite for procedurals. And remember, they are still quite important to filling the programming day and to helping build a schedule on which you can then launch originals. But we're expanding TNT into more serialized and unscripted series. So you can expect the mix to shift a little bit on procedurals, but the value of procedurals and their place, whether on broadcast or cable, continues to be there. And you could certainly see hit procedurals coming that are going up instead of down in terms of the audience and interest that they drive. We'll probably be a little more selective on them going forward for TNT. But, in general, it's really an evolution of the mix, and the basics pretty much -- well, as a strong point for TNT, pretty much remain.","Operator","The next question comes from Mr. Richard Greenfield from BTIG.","Richard Greenfield - BTIG, LLC, Research Division","On Netflix's earnings interview, Reed Hastings stated that the addressable market for Netflix was somewhere in the range of 60 million to 90 million subscribers domestically, well above the 33 million subs they're currently at. I'm curious. You talked about total subscribers, I think that includes HBO and Cinemax. Where did HBO end the year specifically in terms of domestic subscribers? And how do you think about growth as you look out over the next several years between subscriber growth and affiliate fee increases? And then just a tack-on question because I think it relates to the margin. You've been investing pretty heavily in Cinemax. I know you don't break out profitability, but is there any way to think about, as you're investing in shows like Banshee and new projects, how much is that 37% EBITDA margin on the HBO division weighed down by that ramp-up in Cinemax?","Jeffrey L. Bewkes","Okay. Thanks, Rich. Let's go to the first one on HBO and Cinemax. Well, first of all, both of them were up. HBO subs are about 2\/3 of the total. In total, HBO and Cinemax together, we added 2 million subs last year. We ended the year with over 43 million domestic subs. And remember, we also have 85 million-or-so overseas, up quite a bit last year, so 130 million worldwide. If you look at the investments in programming, and I'll take Cinemax in a second, I like to start a little bit at HBO. We definitely think, and we're doing it, that we can grow the sub base on both of them, both domestically and overseas. You can see the result of those investments in programming in the sub growth we've had in the last couple of years. HBO still commands very attractive rate increases, a very important part of what cable, telco, satellite companies offer every month. And we have a pretty controllable cost base, and I'll get to the Cinemax question. So we do expect continued healthy growth in adjusted operating income as we've been doing. That's -- and that's if you add international to that, with really fast sub growth, it gets even better. International's over 15% in 2013, and that was after an increase of more than 35% in '12 and 25% in '11. As we've been saying, we've been launching new territories like the Netherlands for HBO Nordic, and India, and we do think those provide additional growth opportunities for the brand overseas. We also, and you shouldn't forget this, license our HBO content in about 150 countries. That's on top of all the international subs. And the demand there for HBO programs is really helping. So -- and if you put that all together, a pretty healthy opportunity for HBO going forward. To your Cinemax question, this is, what are we doing on programming? We think Cinemax is an underappreciated asset. In 2013, we actually had more viewing at Cinemax than at Starz and basically, the same viewing at Cinemax as at Showtime. It's very profitable for us, but it's even more important for our distribution partners as a companion brand to HBO. We think there's an opportunity to make Cinemax, with all that reach and viewership, stronger. And original programming clearly becomes more important to premium customers as VOD gets more used both on TV and on Internet devices. So we are going to invest in original programming. It's quite economical with Cinemax. We had a big success with the third season of Strike Back. It averaged over 2.75 million viewers. The second season of Banshee did over 2.5 million viewers. That's on a base of -- well, I'm not going to give you that one, but this year, we're going to be launching The Knick. Stay tuned, everybody, for that. We're going to add more series in the future. But to your margin question, we really run HBO and Cinemax together. And on that basis, we have been and we will be growing margins over time. And we think the Cinemax investment in programming is a pretty good leverage point for revenue growth at Cinemax and at HBO.","Richard Greenfield - BTIG, LLC, Research Division","And just as a point of clarification, when you said international up over 15% in HBO subscribers, does that exclude the consolidations, like is that an organic growth rate for international subscribers?","Jeffrey L. Bewkes","Yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mr. Ben Swinburne from Morgan Stanley.","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","You guys talked a couple of times in the prepared remarks about feeling good about the trajectory of Subscription revenue growth at HBO, and that's at the same time you noted the 2 million subs were not revenue drivers last year. So can you just help us understand those 2 comments? And maybe what's happening in the business from your distribution partner front that makes you feel good about an accelerating revenue outlook at HBO, which seems to be what you're hinting at. I don't want put words in your mouth, but I was wondering if you could add some more color there.","Jeffrey L. Bewkes","Yes, you're right in what you're thinking. We think in -- for outlook and for '14, we're in a great position from a content position on both of them, and we think that's going to yield to sub growth, rate increase growth and international growth. So in the U.S., we grew 8% in the fourth quarter and 6% in the -- for the year 2013. That did include a benefit of around 400 basis points -- sorry, overall, I'm saying. That included a benefit about 400 basis points from the consolidation of HBO Asia and Nordic in the quarter. And it did -- it added about 100 basis points for the year. So think of it as we ended up around 5%. We did see the rates were pretty steady and increasing domestically in the mid single-digit range. There were healthy sub gains, up 2 million subs in the U.S., more overseas. As we said on the call, those did not translate into as much revenue growth due to the mix of sub additions. A lot of the sub growth was in the highest-performing affiliates. The sub trends outside the U.S. have been strong, big opportunities we just said. And including the unconsolidated JVs, international subs increased by double digits in 2013. So does that give you the color that you were looking for? I do want to emphasize that we expect improvement, but we're not looking for a dramatic step-up domestically, but we think it will be up in terms of revenue growth along with the sub growth.","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Got it. And if I could just follow up with a quick Warner Bros. question. You guys have talked about the licensing business, your SVOD revenues in the past. I want to say $350 million-or-so a year, maybe a little more. How did that shake out in '13? And given your Netflix output deal, which is pretty unique at Warner Bros., what's the outlook look like for '14 and for the backlog? Or any expectations directionally on how that business is trending?","Jeffrey L. Bewkes","All right. So as a starting point, we generated around $375 million in '13. That was up slightly from '12. We think it's at the top of our competitive set, and I do want to point out, that does not include the revenue -- SVOD revenue for the CW Network, which is pretty significant. So we do remain in active negotiations with all the major players. We think we can grow on -- above that in '14, pretty healthy plans we have for that. And a fair amount of that is probably going to come from international territories. Everyone, I think, should keep it in perspective. This is a -- it's a good, growing, but small portion of our revenue. It's only around 10% of our TV syndication revenue last year. That would be equal to about 3% of total film and TV revenue. And maybe more important, what's very clear is that there is a consumer demand for this content in an on-demand environment. So all particularly true for past seasons of serialized shows, which had been less effective as we all know in syndication on linear schedule. So we think that we're going to be able to monetize effectively and have increases in this category going forward.","Operator","The next question comes from Mr. Doug Mitchelson from Deutsche Bank.","Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I wanted to focus on affiliate fees as well. A couple of questions for Jeff. First, Jeff, did you see a noticeable impact from bundling HBO on a video-light tier. I know it's early days. I think Comcast had a broadband\/broadcast HBO sort of video-light offer. And to the extent it is helping, should we expect a meaningful expansion in the number of distributors that might launch that type of offer?","Jeffrey L. Bewkes","All right, on the Comcast Internet offer, it's a relatively new offer, it's pretty targeted, but we're very supportive of it. We've been saying for a while that it makes sense to work with distributors to increase penetration of HBO on a mutually beneficial way. Broadband-only is a good thing for people to try. It could be an effective way to reach the 8 million to 10 million homes that have broadband without multichannel. We don't think, and we'll see, that it's going to have a material effect on the demand for the basic package. People that want that full TV\/video package with broadband and all that are probably going to continue to do that. But to the extent that either some of them move this other way, that's fine with us.","Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","The -- and I guess the second area is, in the past, you talked about sort of an over-the-top virtual MVPD, that you didn't see a viable business model and you didn't want to license your networks unless you did see a viable business model. And there's been more progress this year. I think Intel was reportedly close to some deals before they sold, and DISH is close to doing something pretty interesting with Disney on this front, and Sony is talking about launching something over-the-top this year. Has your view about the viability of a virtual MVPD business model changed at all? And do you think there could be activity even in the Time Warner front in 2014?","Jeffrey L. Bewkes","Well, we were -- yes. I mean, it hasn't changed much. There's been more talk than action. Specifically, if you look at Sony, Verizon, and we talk to all of them all the time. Fine, we'll evaluate each of those as they come. We are absolutely open to opportunistically grow our business. We're not philosophically opposed to it. If there's an offering, a virtual one, that serves consumers and that they want, and if it is something that we think is sustainable economically for us and not something where you get a little money there and you cannibalize bigger money somewhere else, then yes, that would be something we would consider or maybe do. We just haven't seen anybody come forward with a viable powerful consumer offering yet.","Operator","The next question comes from Jessica Reif Cohen from Bank of America.","Jessica Reif Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I have 2 topics. The first is capital allocation. I'm not sure how the timing of the $5 billion, when you would utilize that. And I guess, as part of capital allocation, I know Howard touched on M&A. But -- and I guess, Jeff, what's your view on -- are you strategically complete? And if not, what parts of the business do you think you're missing? I mean, you've gotten so much smaller over the last few years, would you like to get bigger?","Jeffrey L. Bewkes","[indiscernible] The first one, what's the first one?","Michael Kopelman","It's capital, the pace of the buyback.","Jeffrey L. Bewkes","The pace of the buyback...","Howard M. Averill","Yes, so Jessica, thank you. The pace of the buyback is going to really be driven by a couple of different factors. It's going to be driven based on the cash flow generation, which as I pointed out in my earlier remarks, we think it's going to be strong next year. And it's also going to be dependent upon what comes along in terms of M&A and how much we spend in terms of M&A activity. We just raised the leverage target, as we just announced, and we're not going to give specific guidance on the buyback itself, but all of those things together are going to be factors that drive it. And I would say, sitting here today, you should expect to see probably the same, pretty much pace as we had last year.","Jeffrey L. Bewkes","On M&A, we pretty much have said what our philosophy is. We've tried to be disciplined, spent close to $0.5 billion on acquisitions in '13, a little under $700 million in 2012, and about $400 million in 2011. So we've done things where we think that they both have returns and strengthen our position competitively, strategically. We do have as both, I think -- well, Howard said it, we do have sufficient scale in all the things we're doing now, so we don't have to do anything. That -- but since we do have scale, we're a pretty effective buyer if something comes up where we could combine it with what we're doing and increase the profitability or sustainability of whatever we buy. We basically look through the filters of execution, strategic fit, competitive augmentation and the risk of whether we know how to manage the thing and whether it's really going to work out. We've been mostly focused on the deals we have done on international opportunities, particularly in the network side, local television production and games. Those that have tended to be smaller in nature, but that's -- we don't have an inability to consider the larger things if they fit the criteria that I was talking about.","Jessica Reif Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then the second -- can I just ask one more that's on -- with a second subject? If that's okay? I just want to ask one more question. So you said that Warner Bros. will produce 60 shows this year, and obviously, there are others producing -- sorry?","Jeffrey L. Bewkes","61.","Jessica Reif Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Oh, sorry, sorry. So roughly 60, while others are producing and there are clearly new startups. So the question is, given the increase in original TV production supply, are you concerned at all about either how the market will absorb all these shows, how the market will digest all of this output?","Jeffrey L. Bewkes","Well, thank you for that question. The reason we're at 61 shows is the market is coming to our door and asking us to make the shows and sell it to them. So we've had a very vigorous demand and increase in basically what we've been doing on all 4 broadcast networks. On pretty much all the different cable, basic cable networks, all of them are doing more shows. So on your 60, we have 32 shows on broadcast. That's the most -- we have, of those, the most returning shows we've had in over 30 years. We are -- W -- Warner Bros. TV is the leading supplier of prime time programming to broadcasters again this year. So as the TV networks, the broadcast ones, solidify their economics with retrans and so forth, it has worked -- I mean, they'd certainly want to produce shows that they themselves make, but they also want a healthy supply of quality shows to strengthen their networks. And as the, basically, second supplier to all of them, it's been a good position for us. The cable network business, whether -- not just TNT, TBS, but FX, USA, A&E, AMC, a pretty good set of demands coming from them, too. So it is -- at this point, TV production and the revenue support for those shows that you can make, if you're the producer, overseas from international licensing and from SVOD is going up, so it's a very strong business with very good returns.","Operator","And it looks like our next question comes from Alexia Quadrani from JPMorgan.","Alexia S. Quadrani - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just a follow-up on all your commentary on HBO, and then a quick one on Turner. On HBO, how much do you think the pricing strategy of other premium channels or SVOD providers like Netflix influence your ability to sort of push for higher rates, if at all? And then on Turner, just any more color, Howard, maybe you can give us on the advertising revenue in the quarter. I know you cited a dip in the industry demand and then, of course, the CNN challenge is a tough comp. But the ratings at TBS, do they -- I guess how much did they influence the number? And you seem more optimistic about the outlook. Is that also -- does that assume some further improvement at TBS?","Jeffrey L. Bewkes","All right. So on HBO, first, obviously, it's been sitting in a package with pay TV like Starz, Showtime, basic cable for many years. So that's always been competitive and it hasn't -- there's no change in the pricing environment for HBO in that regard. If you ask about, as you did, the new subscription entries, whether it's Netflix, Amazon, Hulu Plus, et cetera, most of those subs are complementary, and doing something, where in fact, the highest -- if you look at -- I think Netflix viewing, for one, is higher in HBO homes. HBO viewing is higher in Netflix homes. So those are add-ons. Those are homes that want both the demand for -- not just pay TV but basic TV. So far, whether it's cord-cutting or cord-shaving, not apparently affected by the additional online offerings, which are good and offer more library than current. So all that's fitting together pretty well. And, no, we don't see any discernible effect on subs or pricing in HBO from SVOD.","Howard M. Averill","And Alexia, it's Howard. So as we did say in the call, advertising was up 1%, and that included mid single-digit growth in domestic entertainment including kids and young adults. It was domestic news that was down. It was down in the mid-teens, and that's due to the political comp. As far as ratings, there was a ratings impact from TNT and to a lesser extent, TBS. It contributed a bit against our expected growth. And as we mentioned, there was a slow patch in scatter, kind of in November. If you just look ahead to the first quarter, though, we are seeing scatter pricing for the entertainment's up in the high-single to low-double-digits over the upfront. And we're seeing strength across a pretty broad array of categories, so food, packages goods, fast food, auto, and demand for sports continues to look really strong. And additionally, we mentioned that we're going to be airing the Elite Eight games in the first quarter. We didn't have that last year. And we're also going -- it could be a 200, 300, 400 [ph] basis-point impact in the quarter. And at CNN, the comparisons do get easier in the first quarter, but we are still seeing relatively soft demand. Overall, the one place where we're going to see some improvement is international due to easier news comps. And in terms of the Olympics, we do see some impact including on sports, but we think it's going to be pretty modest. I think if you take it all the way, though, what we're going to end up with and we're counting -- expecting kind of an acceleration in that growth to the mid- to high-single-digits, as I mentioned.","Michael Kopelman","Thank you.

My name is Christine, and I will be your operator for today's conference. [Operator Instructions] Please note today's conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Doug Shapiro, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin the call.","Douglas Shapiro","Thanks. This morning, we issued 2 press releases, one detailing our results in the fourth quarter and full year, and the other providing our 2012 business outlook. ","Before we begin, there are 2 items I need to cover. First, we refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Schedules setting out reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our earnings release and trending schedules. These reconciliations are available on our website at timewarner.com\/investors. Reconciliations of our expected future financial performance are also included in the business outlook release that's available on our site. ","And second, today's announcement includes certain forward-looking statements, which are based on management's current expectations. Actual results may vary materially from those expressed or implied by these statements due to various factors. ","These factors are discussed in detail in Time Warner's SEC filings, including its most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. Time Warner is under no obligation and, in fact, expressly disclaims any obligation to update or alter its forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. ","Thank you, and I'll turn the call over to Jeff.","Jeffrey L. Bewkes","Good morning, and thanks for listening in. We had a great fourth quarter, capping another great year. In 2011, we grew revenue 8%. That's our highest rate since 2003. We grew adjusted operating income 9%, and we grew adjusted earnings per share 20%, exceeding our guidance. In fact, we've more than doubled our adjusted EPS over the last 3 years. ","We had a strong year operationally, too. We not only maintained our leading position across almost all of our businesses, in most cases we took share. We're at the vanguard of the industry in advancing the next generation of digital business models, and we expanded our international presence. ","At the same time, we significantly increased our returns to shareholders. We directed $5.6 billion to dividends and to stock repurchases, buying back 12% of our shares in just one year. And in 2012, we plan to keep the momentum going. We'll drive to deliver double-digit growth in adjusted EPS again, and we also just raised our dividend by 11% and announced a new $4-billion repurchase authorization. ","We intend to achieve our financial goals while remaining as focused as ever on our key strategic priorities: first, invest aggressively to create and acquire the best content; second, accelerate new business models that harness technology to improve the consumer experience, but in a way that supports our economics; third, expand internationally in key territories; and fourth, continuously work to improve both our operating and our capital efficiency. ","Let me tell you how we're pursuing these objectives at each of our divisions in 2012, starting with Networks. At Turner, we'll keep ratcheting up our investment in content as we seek the optimal mix of sports, originals and acquired programming. For instance, 2011 was the first year of our 14-year agreement to air the NCAA men's basketball tournament with CBS. It outperformed our expectations on every count in 2011: viewership, digital metrics, sponsorships and ad revenue. The 2012 tournament is just around the corner, and we are very pleased with advertiser demand as we head into the tournament. ","We're also excited to have the NBA back on TNT. We've seen extremely strong ratings so far, and every indication is that the lockout did not diminish fans' enthusiasm at all. For 2012, we'll increase investment in original programming again. At TNT, we'll bring back some of the biggest shows on ad-supported cable, like the final season of the of The Closer; the next season of Rizzoli & Isles; and the #1 new drama on cable last year, Falling Skies. ","Starting this summer, we'll debut several new shows, including our highly anticipated reboot of Dallas, as well as Major Crimes, Perception and The Great Escape. You'll also see more original programming on the TBS prime time lineup later this year. And in 2012, we'll build on the momentum of our original programming at truTV and on Adult Swim. Both of these networks are coming off record years for viewership. ","And last but not least, we expect another strong year at CNN. In 2011, CNN was up more than 20% in its key demo, driven by the news cycle and by our programming moves over the past year. That momentum should serve CNN very well as we head into an election year. ","We're refreshing our acquired programming on TBS and TNT in 2012 also, particularly in the key prime time period. Prime time in sports is where our entertainment networks generate the highest volumes and the highest pricing. ","In October, we put The Big Bang Theory into its regular spot on the TBS prime time schedule, and it has been a runaway hit. It drove a big ratings improvement across the whole network in the fourth quarter, and that momentum is continuing. In January, TBS was up 30% in prime time, posting its highest ratings ever and making it the #1 entertainment network on cable.","At HBO in 2012, we'll bring back the biggest hits on premium TV. In their most recent season, True Blood attracted 13 million viewers per episode, Game of Thrones attracted 9 million and Boardwalk Empire attracted 8 million. Considering HBO is in 28 million homes, that kind of share is unmatched anywhere on television. In HBO homes, those are 30s and 40s. We're also excited about several new shows on HBO. Two weeks ago, we premiered Luck, a new show from David Milch and Michael Mann, starring Dustin Hoffman, which has received fantastic critical reviews. And later this year, we'll debut the Newsroom from Aaron Sorkin and a host of other new shows. We also will expand the slate of original shows on Cinemax this year.","In 2012, our networks will continue to be at the forefront of TV Everywhere. Two years ago, TV Everywhere, what many call authentication, was only an idea, with no technology underlying it and no industry support. It's come a long way. Today, authenticated TV has been embraced by every major distributor and program. Until now, we've been chiefly focused on availability of TV Everywhere. Now it's time for the whole industry to drive consumer awareness and consumer usage. ","To really excite consumers, we think TV Everywhere needs to be easy: easy to access and easy to use. It needs to offer a robust amount of content for every network, and it needs to be on multiple devices, including connected televisions. HBO GO is a great example. It has millions of active users. Consumer satisfaction scores are through the roof, and we're seeing a big increase in the monthly viewing. And that's before we have a meaningful presence for these apps on everybody's television set, and that will happen soon. ","During the fourth quarter, we signed agreements at HBO with both Time Warner Cable and Cablevision that will bring availability of HBO GO and MAX GO to essentially all of HBO's domestic sub base. And the HBO GO app will soon be available on the Xbox, and we'll continue to roll out apps for more connected devices throughout the year. ","At Turner, we're now making almost 1,000 hours of on-demand TV Everywhere content and live feeds of CNN and Headline News available to almost 80 million homes. We've rolled out apps for all our major networks. And in 2012, we'll add more content and support more devices, including connected TVs. ","Our networks are also growing at a rapid clip internationally. At Turner, our international operations grew to 20% of revenue in 2011. That's up from 18% in 2010. We saw a very strong performance in Latin America, in particular, where we're now the largest provider of multi-channel TV networks. We experienced very strong growth internationally at HBO, too. Including our joint ventures in Latin America and Asia, both subscribers and revenue increased well over 20% in 2011. ","In 2012, HBO will launch new premium networks in several territories, including HBO Netherlands this week. We'll increase international local production and roll out new features at our international networks like high-def and on-demand. ","We've now launched HBO GO as an authenticated service in 8 countries. And this year, we're shooting to complete our rollout across Central Europe and across Latin America. When including HBO Latin America and HBO Asia, our combined international network businesses at Turner and HBO generated over $3 billion of revenue and over $650 million of adjusted operating income in 2011. And as we told you last year, our goal is to reach $1 billion in operating profits at our international networks by 2014. ","I'll turn next to Warner Bros., where we will also be investing to press our competitive advantages. Our film division had another great year in 2011, surpassing $4 billion at the global box office for the third consecutive time thanks to successful event films like The Hangover 2; Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows, which is currently tracking for $0.5 billion in global box; and of course, the last Harry Potter. ","As I mentioned to you last quarter, we expect the Harry Potter franchise to endure long after the last movie release. In December, we reached agreements with Universal Studios to expand The Wizarding World of Harry Potter in Orlando and to bring a new attraction to Los Angeles. These deals call for a significant increase in license fees starting in 2014. ","We're excited about our event film slate in 2012, too. Just like you, we're eagerly awaiting the premiere of The Dark Knight Rises, which is already selling out midnight IMAX shows in July; and the first installment of The Hobbit coming this year; as well as Dark Shadows from Tim Burton and Johnny Depp; and a movie called Gravity, with George Clooney and Sandra Bullock. ","At Warners' television production arm, after a terrific 2011, we are ramping up investment again in 2012. We're continuing to see very favorable demand trends. The broadcast and cable networks are increasing investment in original scripted TV. There's strong demand for the biggest hits coming off broadcast into syndication. We're still seeing international license fees climb, even in Europe. And of course, there's new demand from SVOD providers, both here and overseas. ","On top of those secular trends, Warners has had a really strong first half in the 2011-2012 season. We're seeing fantastic performance from a number of our returning shows, including Two and a Half Men, The Big Bang Theory and Mike & Molly. And we have several freshmen hits, such as 2 Broke Girls, Suburgatory, Person of Interest and Alcatraz. These shows will pay dividends for years to come as they enter the syndication market. ","Last year, Warner Home Entertainment had another standout year in a very challenging environment. We were #1 again across every home entertainment category and once again grew our share. This performance reflects the advantages of our scale, the demand for our event films even as consumers have become more selective, and it reflects the benefits of some of the steps we've taken to establish new windows. ","In particular, in 2010, we instituted a 28-day window for kiosk and DVD-by-mail services. That enabled our titles last year to significantly outperform comparable titles released by other studios without a window. In 2012, we'll keep pushing to define the next generation of business models for home entertainment. As part of that, we're using windows to advantage our higher contribution distribution channels. ","Last month, we announced an agreement with Netflix to extend the 28-day window for DVD-by-mail to 56 days. We'll keep working to extend the window for kiosk providers and for brick-and-mortar retailers, too. We're also trying to make digital ownership much more compelling for consumers. That's why we've been a big supporter of UltraViolet. Warners was the first studio to release UV titles, and Flixster was the first service to allow consumers to access them. All of our new releases on DVD and Blu-ray are now UV compatible. We're looking forward to more studios releasing more UV titles and more retailers supporting the standard over the course of the year. It's certainly early, but the consumer response we've seen so far reinforces how much pent-up demand exists for an easy way to manage and access digital movie collections. ","Turning to Publishing. Time Inc. continues to be the clear leader in its industry despite a tough environment. In 2011, it took share for the third consecutive year, creating the widest gap over #2 competitor in 5 years. In 2012, we'll remain focused on continuing to grow our share and tightly manage our cost structure. ","Like our other divisions, Time Inc. is pushing the digital evolution of its businesses more aggressively than any of its competitors. For instance, we've now launched tablet editions for all of our domestic titles. We're convinced that the tablet will offer more value to both our readers and our advertisers. And if the model develops properly, it should enhance traditional magazine economics. ","That's one reason why I'm thrilled that we were able to bring on Laura Lang as the new Time Inc. CEO. Laura's leadership experience and her knowledge of the intersection of marketing and digital make her the perfect executive to lead that charge.  ","Next, John will discuss our financial results, including the fourth objective I mentioned earlier: improving our operating and capital efficiency. ","Before I hand it off, I want to take a step back. We're only 2 years into our life as a smaller content-focused company. They've been 2 really good years, but I think our best years are ahead of us. The digital transition is driving higher usage across our businesses, and it's increasing the value of the high-quality content that we specialize in. New opportunities are opening up for us, technologically and geographically. We are focused on being able to capitalize on those opportunities, and we are in a better position than ever to do that. ","And with that, I'll turn it over to John.","John K. Martin","Thanks, Jeff, and good morning. I'm going to begin by referring to the first slide, which is now available on our website. ","As we headed into 2011, we discussed with you our plans to be more aggressive in pursuing our goals of investment, growth and returns. We achieved or exceeded our targets on all counts here. We grew revenues 8%, the highest growth rate since 2003, and we grew adjusted operating income 9% to a record $5.9 billion. That translated to 20% growth in adjusted EPS to $2.89, also the highest amount in the company's history. And as Jeff mentioned, over the past 3 years, adjusted EPS has now more than doubled. And we achieved these results while investing even more in our businesses to strengthen their competitive position and drive long-term growth. ","In 2011, we increased investment in programming and production and marketing in the high single digits while reallocating resources away from less productive areas like G&A. Notwithstanding these significant investments, we were able to maintain very high levels of returns on invested capital. And as the way we look at it, which exclude certain purchase price adjustments, our return on invested capital was at about 20% in 2011. ","And at the same time, we accelerated our direct returns to shareholders. And between dividends and share repurchases, we returned $5.6 billion. In 2012, our goal of once again delivering double-digit adjusted EPS growth reflects confidence in continued growth despite the uncertain economic environment, current volatility and some difficult growth comparisons. And we remain committed to direct returns to shareholders, as evidenced by our board's decision to both increase the dividend by 11% and to authorize a new $4-billion share repurchase program. ","Turning to the next slide, I'll quickly take you through the quarter, where we had the highest levels of revenue, adjusted operating income and adjusted EPS in the company's history. As we expected, the fourth quarter was our strongest in terms of year-over-year growth in both adjusted operating income and adjusted EPS. It was the ninth straight quarter of year-over-year revenue growth, including growth across all sources of revenue. ","Adjusted operating income was up 20%, with margins expanding nearly 300 basis points, and adjusted EPS grew 40% year-over-year in the quarter. In addition to the strong growth in adjusted operating income, the EPS growth was helped by having fewer shares outstanding due to our ongoing repurchases, as well as a lower tax rate. ","So let me turn now to our divisional results, and let me begin with the Networks group, where the fourth quarter was very strong and it was a strong end to what was a really, really good year. For the year, we grew revenues 9%, with solid revenue growth at both HBO and Turner, and we grew adjusted operating income mid-single digits, and that's despite the effect of the first year of the NCAA basketball tournament. ","In the fourth quarter, we posted the highest growth in adjusted operating income of any quarter in the year. Advertising revenues grew a modest 2% in the quarter, and that growth was negatively impacted by the NBA lockout, lower scatter demand and lower ratings at TNT, as well as foreign currency translation. At our international networks, advertising revenue growth was up in the high single digits, and that included about a 400-basis-point drag from currency translation. We continue to see strong growth in our European and Latin American entertainment businesses. ","In 2012, advertising growth is tracking somewhere around the mid-single digits. That reflects positive rating trends at most of our networks, particularly TBS. Scatter pricing is up solidly over upfront levels, although volume remains relatively behind recent years. Advertising growth also reflects the ratings challenges that I just mentioned at TNT, as well as the lingering effect of the NBA work stoppage. While the fan and the viewer response to the return of the NBA has been very strong and very encouraging, some of the advertising dollars that are usually spent there were committed elsewhere during the lockout period. And we fully expect that to be a temporary effect that will be resolved by returning to a normal selling cycle. ","Moving over to subscription revenues at the Networks, which grew 5% in the quarter and 6% for the year. Similar to what we discussed with you last quarter, certain affiliate fee adjustments in the fourth quarter and the prior year reduced growth by about 1 percentage point in the fourth quarter. ","Looking over at the content revenue, sales of HBO original programming drove another year of strong growth in 2011. That included the second cycle syndication of Sex and the City and the international licensing of Boardwalk Empire and Game of Thrones. ","Looking at HBO subscriber base for a moment, domestic subscribers increased nearly 200,000 for the year, and that was despite flat multi-channel households, as well as continued losses at a couple of major domestic affiliates. This year, in 2012, we're optimistic that we'll see improved trends at each of these distributors. As Jeff mentioned, we're also really pleased that HBO GO and MAX GO will now be available to nearly all domestic subscribers. And we believe that this will both extend the life cycle of existing subscribers, as well as help attract new subscribers. HBO also grew its international subscriber base by over 25% to end the year at about 53 million, so the global subscriber base now at HBO is around 93 million subs. ","Adjusted operating income at the Networks group segment increased 27% in the fourth quarter, with margins expanding nearly 600 basis points year-over-year. Growth here was boosted by the timing of programming and marketing expenses, which were down from the fourth quarter of 2010. And for the year, programming expenses increased 12%, and we've discussed that with you in the past. Excluding the impact of the NCAA basketball tournament, underlying programming expenses would have been up in the mid-single digits, which is right on expectations. ","For 2012, we're looking forward to another great year at the Networks group. We expect healthy subscription revenue growth despite the likelihood that currency is going to be a headwind, particularly in the first half of the year. And while we don't have a crystal ball on advertising, we are cautiously optimistic here. We had a very, very strong 2011, 2012 upfront, and advertisers continue to focus their spending on national television. ","On the cost side, this will be the second year of the NCAA men's basketball tournament on our network, so we don't have the same challenging cost growth comparisons that we did a year ago. And while we'll keep increasing investment in programming in a controlled way, we'll fund that in part by limiting growth in non-revenue-generating expenses. So putting that all together, we anticipate the Networks group, the profit will grow faster this year in 2012 than it did in 2011. ","Let me turn now to film, where Warner Bros. had its best year ever in 2011. Revenues were up 9%. Adjusted operating income grew 16% to a record of nearly $1.3 billion. Warner Bros. had the biggest box office hit and the most successful home video release of the year with Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. It also had the biggest syndicated hit on television with Big Bang Theory, which is now the #1 comedy in television syndication. And it also had one of the most successful video game releases of the year with Batman: Arkham City. So 2012 will obviously have difficult comparisons to the record 2011 performance, which may result in lower profits this year compared to last year. ","Industry home video trends remain challenging. However, we still believe that it's going to be a very strong year at this division. At the end of 2011, for example, backlog reached around $5.5 billion, and that's the highest year-end level ever. And it's up close to 35% from just 3 years ago. Backlog is the amount of unrecognized cash licensing revenue for television and theatrical product. And although all of that won't be recognized in 2012, it's an important indicator of future revenue pipeline. ","We're also optimistic about our film slate this year, as Jeff described, and we should also have another strong year at the TV studio as well. We're continuing to see strong demand across all end markets: broadcast, cable, domestic and international syndication, and SVOD. And we'll benefit from another solid lineup of the syndication pipeline, which this year includes The Mentalist. So tough comps aside, it should be a great year at Warner Bros. ","Over at Publishing. In 2011, Time Inc. posted double-digit profit growth in the quarter and the year. Advertising revenues were flat in the quarter and slightly down for the year. Subscription revenues were also down 2% for both the quarter and the full year, and most of that was due to continued softness at the newsstand, particularly in the celebrity category. ","Looking into the first quarter, we're seeing continued softness in both advertising revenues and newsstand sales. Adjusted operating income was up 23% in the quarter, with margins up 400 basis points, though much of that growth was due to lower restructuring and severance costs. For the year, margins grew 150 basis points, and that's the highest level since 2007. ","2012, we continue to expect a challenging revenue environment, and we'll be making investments in tablet initiatives, as well as experiencing increased physical costs like postage and paper. All of that could make profit growth here at this division difficult. ","Turning to the next slide. 2012, let me provide some context for the outlook this year. We fully expect to see longer-term secular strength in most of our businesses. Demand for high-quality content is increasing. TV advertising is taking share, and international opportunities are expanding. So we're investing aggressively against these significant opportunities, particularly in original programming and our company-wide Content Everywhere strategy. ","We'll also invest in our enterprise efficiency initiatives, which are focused principally in the areas of real estate and information technology. As part of that drive, we anticipate corporate expenses will actually trend somewhat higher this year. We're doing that, though, with an aim to generate material recurring annual savings over time once these initiatives are fully implemented. ","We're also doing all that against a backdrop of what is the uncertain macroeconomic environment, and we expect that there could be some volatility in exchange rate changes. And in fact, at current rates, FX translation could be a drag of about 200 basis points on growth in adjusted operating income in 2012. ","We have a lot riding on the success of our film slate this year, although we've said we're very optimistic. And all of this that I just described perhaps makes forecasting a little harder this year than it has been over the past several years. But nevertheless, we're setting a goal for ourselves, and we expect to post double-digit adjusted EPS growth again this year. ","One housekeeping note. As you think about the progression of the quarter, similar to what happened in 2011, keep in mind that we have difficult content comps at Networks in the first quarter. And our film profitability will likely be heavily weighted towards the back half of the year as it was, as I mentioned, in 2011 due to the timing of theatrical and home video releases. ","Turning now to the next slide, which details free cash flow. 2011, we delivered approximately $2.7 billion, and that was higher than we anticipated when we came into the year. And that was the result of very strong free cash flow generation in the fourth quarter. In 2012, we expect the conversion ratio of free cash to be in the same range as it was in 2011. Our use of working capital should be somewhat lower than it was in 2011, but we expect that to be somewhat offset by higher cash taxes and higher cash interest. And that's due to the debt that we issued last year. ","So let me end with the final slide, which shows a reconciliation of our net debt balance. We ended 2011 with $16 billion in net debt, and that was up about $3.2 billion compared to the end of 2010, and it was up about $750 million compared to the third quarter. Our leverage ratio is now close to our target of 2.5x. That's up from around 2x at the end of 2010, and it was the result of an effort to improve our capital structure. We achieved that by spending $5.6 billion on share repurchases and dividends, and that's up 80% from 2010 levels and was more than double our free cash flow generation in 2011. We also spent a little under $400 million on M&A actions. In addition, we took advantage of market conditions last year to strengthen our balance sheet by raising long-term debt and amending our $5-billion revolving bank credit facility, which reduced annual cost and extended terms. ","So if you look back over the past 3 years, the approach that we've taken has really been one of balance and consistency. And since 2008, we have generated around $8 billion in free cash flow. We've paid out close to $3 billion in dividends. We've repurchased almost $8 billion of our shares or 20% of the base, and we've made $2-billion worth of acquisitions. At the same time, we remained very, very focused on maintaining our balance sheet strength and retaining flexibility. ","This year, our philosophy of capital deployment will not change. We're going to continue to look for the right balance between maintaining a strong and flexible balance sheet, while actively deploying our capital to invest in our businesses, make acquisitions and deliver returns to shareholders. We continue to believe that a target leverage of 2.5x is the level that best balances all of these aims and goals. ","So you could see from our continued commitment to direct returns in the board's decision to increase the dividend and authorize the new share repurchase program. But now that we have reached the target leverage, the excess capital that we're going to deploy will be primarily determined by the growth in our businesses and our free cash flow generation. So as of now, we expect buyback levels in 2012 to be lower than they were in 2011. ","Now let me turn the call back over to Doug to begin the Q&A portion of this phone call. Thank you very much.","Douglas Shapiro","All right. Thanks, John. Christine, can we get the Q&A started? [Operator Instructions] Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Spencer Wang from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Spencer Wang - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I have one for Jeff and one for John. Jeff, on some of the new technology initiatives, I was wondering if -- with HBO GO, if you've seen that help the churn numbers. And if so, if you could maybe quantify that. And on UltraViolet, would you consider an earlier UltraViolet window to stimulate UV sales? And then secondly, for John, I know at cable networks, you said the margin sounds like they'll be up year-over-year. Should we expect programming cost growth then to be around mid-single digits?","Jeffrey L. Bewkes","I think your first question was HBO churn?","Spencer Wang - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Right, from HBO GO.","Jeffrey L. Bewkes","We're really happy with the user data and the satisfaction letters -- levels that we're getting. The subs really like it. Viewership is up a fair amount in the homes that are using GO. It's pretty early to tell exactly what that will do mathematically to the churn across the base. So we expect it will be sometime before we start to get a real sense of that. But GO basically, it obviously makes it easier to watch HBO. It brings new subs in and extends the life of existing subs. So it's going to be an increasing net positive. Think of it really as what we've already seen at HBO over the years on Video on Demand, which raised the viewing and helped stabilize the sub base. Same thing with GO. And then what should make that even more powerful is when more and more affiliates put HBO GO across all devices. There's been a little friction and not as much speed as we would like in having all of our subscribers to HBO get GO on every kind of device. On the early window for electronic sell-through, we're evolving the windows all the time. And as you know, we've had some efforts on rental which are more like tests. The powerful thing would be to have that electronic sell-through start earlier. And one of the issues for that is really the security of the television. And as the ability to secure the early release gets more -- when we get more confident in that, I think that the whole industry will move towards earlier sell-through. But not -- we don't see any reason that, that has or will cannibalize theatrical. And we think it can fit in correctly with the current retail distribution system that you have for physical.","John K. Martin","Spencer, it's John. Your question regarding programming cost and network margins. For 2012, I think it's going to be pretty consistent with what we've done over the past 3 to 5 years. Think about programming cost increases going up in a controlled way, mid to high single digits. Remember, it's an election year. We'll spend a little bit more at CNN for news gathering costs. There'll be an increased investment in original programming to try to take advantage of our lead positions. And like we've done in the past, we're going to continue to shoot for all other costs at the Networks division, including marketing, SG&A, overhead, other back-office-related costs -- those are going to grow at a much slower rate. So those will grow sort of low to mid. So that on a combined basis, overall expense growth should be mid-single digits, and we would anticipate margin improvement.","Operator","The next question comes from Richard Greenfield from BTIG Research.","Richard Greenfield - BTIG, LLC, Research Division","I wanted to follow up on the last question because I think it's important. When you look at the goal of getting TV Everywhere to the television, some of your biggest distributors like Comcast, Time Warner Cable and DirecTV have all decided that HBO GO isn't going to be accessible for right now on devices like the Roku. And it's unclear what they will or won't allow in the future. They seem to cite customer data retention or viewership information as an issue here. Just wondering if you could give us your sense of kind of how this gets worked out and how the industry is going to get comfortable with this, because it seems like getting into the television is what has made Netflix so successful, and it seems like what it will really drive HBO GO's success, as well as other of your TV Everywhere platforms. And then just a quick follow-up. In the press release, you cite licensing profits from Turner for both Q4 and 2011 drivers. Can you just give us a little sense on what was in there?","Jeffrey L. Bewkes","I'm glad you asked us both of those. So let's go to the first one. Frankly, I don't understand the reticence of distributors to authenticate on third-party sites like Roku and get HBO and TNT and all of those channels to television. As a general principle, we, as an industry, should be making viewers have availability with on-demand TV of all of their favorite networks on any platform, any device that they want to use. And what's kind of powerful about it, and I think it's in your question, is that by authenticating TV Everywhere, basically that whatever network you like on all devices and platforms, cable operators would be making the video subscription they sell to consumers enormously more valuable. They would, therefore, make it much less likely that a consumer would cut the cord. They would basically bring on stream all those younger people that are wondering whether they're ever going to subscribe to cable. And so by providing ubiquitous access to TV channels on demand, they would diminish the relative value of over-the-top services or SVOD services that are really nothing more than the same programming offered on demand in a later window. So as an industry, and I'm speaking now for all our networks, we've got great, fresh, really popular programs. We ought to make it available to our viewers on all their devices on demand, as easily as we can at no extra charge. All the -- that's how you fulfill the promise of your brands and of television to viewers. And I'm hopeful that the industry will move pretty quickly past some of its -- I think their more minor concerns that they have, and they ought to speed up.","John K. Martin","Rich, it's John. On your licensing revenue question, I think that the press release highlights the content revenues from HBO and licensing from Turner. It's really \"normal course of business\" type of stuff. There's nothing notable in there. It's the type of licensing revenues that we generated on an annual recurring basis from Cartoon Network, merchandising and licensing of our properties there, as well as some NCAA stuff.","Operator","The next question comes from Jessica Reif-Cohen from Bank of America.","Jessica Reif Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I have 2 questions. One, John, I just wanted to review what's in the guidance really quickly. I think you said you were cautiously optimistic regarding advertising, and I was wondering if you could just maybe size it. Does that mean mid-single digits or high single digits affiliate fees? It kind of sounded like mid to high. And then what is in -- would you encompass, like SVOD deals for -- well, SVOD deals for Warner Bros. in that guidance? And the second question -- Jeff, I'm sorry -- Jeff said that there would be a meaningful increase in Harry Potter license fee beginning in 2014. So I'm just wondering if you could size that. How meaningful of an increase and what is your share or what is your split with J.K. Rowling?","John K. Martin","I'll start, Jessica. Look, on the guidance, we're not going to give specific forward-looking guidance on a line-by-line basis. And my cautious optimism, I think, is a reflection of the fact that we are planning to see an acceleration from Q4 to Q1 as it relates to ad revenue. We are seeing scatter pricing up nicely over upfront pricing levels. In the upfront, as I mentioned, we were up low double digits in pricing. The volume has been a little bit light. And certain categories, such as packaged goods, have been a little bit light. So I mean, there's some mixed signals there. But we've got ratings momentum at most of our networks, which we're actually quite pleased about, and it's not just TBS. It's Cartoon Network, which has been up nicely. It's CNN. It's truTV. And we're optimistic that TNT's ratings are going to improve as we progress through this year. On the subscription revenue side, which has been an amazingly consistent revenue line for us, the networks where we've got about $8.2 billion of annual revenues, I think what we've said in the past continues to hold true, which is that we're experiencing about mid-single-digit pricing increases across the board. In part, the subscriber revenue levels will depend on whether we get unit growth, particularly in the U.S., because we anticipate getting unit growth outside of the U.S. And then FX, which -- FX, over the last several months, has moved around quite a bit. Right now, it looks like it's a drag, but who knows what happens going forward? But the fundamentals of the subscription revenue growth is still very strong, and we did experience the high single-digit growth at Turner a year ago that we predicted. And we think for the sustainable future, it's going to be a strong revenue generation source for us. And remember, all of this is before we'd see a meaningful acceleration from the NCAA. As it relates to SVOD deals, I'm not going to be specific. We had -- in 2011, I think I might have mentioned on the last quarter's call, we had revenues recognized in the fourth quarter that were -- that was a little north of $100 million. And from the deals we've announced, we expect at least that same level in 2012, but we've got numerous discussions occurring with multiple SVOD providers. And what's very clear is there's a fair bit of demand out there. And frankly, Warner Bros. has the deepest, richest and broadest library of both films and TV shows. So we're quite confident in our ability to monetize that in a value-accretive way going forward.","Jeffrey L. Bewkes","Let me just add -- John just said it. Warners has 6,000 films and over 75,000 TV episodes, so we're feeling pretty good about that situation. I think you asked about Harry Potter parks, if I understood the question. And we're really excited about the new agreement that we have with Universal. It's a great example of how Harry Potter is going to live on and be vibrant in coming years. It's going to include taking the Wizarding World of Harry Potter to Universal Los Angeles, and we're going to expand the widely successful gate in Orlando. We think it really is promising. It highlights the power of Harry Potter and really of any great franchise. And we will start, and I think this goes to your question, to recognize the revenue from that once the parks open. So that's a few years off. I shouldn't forget, we're also opening up The Making of Harry Potter this March at our studio outside of London. And there are many other international theme park locations you're all well aware of, all of which represent big opportunities for Harry Potter, but we don't -- we're not ready to announce those yet.","Operator","The next question comes from Michael Nathanson from Nomura Securities.","Michael Nathanson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","I have a couple of housekeeping questions for John. So, John, on affiliate fees in Networks, can you give us the detail between, in this quarter, domestic affiliate fee growth and international fees? You gave it for advertising. I want to get it for affiliate fee growth.","John K. Martin","Sure, Michael. Let's start with the bigger picture, and then we'll drill down. So affiliate fees in the fourth quarter grew about 5% at the Networks. And that was, I think as I had mentioned in my proactive remarks, held back about 100 basis points or so from some, what I'd call ordinary types of adjustments that would have occurred in HBO. And FX as well. Thanks, Doug. In addition, so if you look at the breakout between domestic and international, we saw domestic affiliate fee growth of around 4%, and international was about 3x that. If you look, though, more broadly over the year, which I think is a more relevant barometer than any one particular quarter, basically, our international growth is growing at about twice the level as our domestic growth. And I think it pretty much holds true that if you look at -- we grew affiliate revenue about 6.5% at the Networks and that was about 5% -- a little more -- around 5% domestic, and then international was high teens. And then averaged out overall, as I said, on the ad side, international growing much faster than domestic and around twice the level.","Michael Nathanson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay. And then, John, on cash flow, you gave us a lot of detail. If you look at your Slide 11, something that jumped out at us was the difference between cash interest and P&L interest and the cash taxes and P&L taxes. And the question would be is, at what point do those 2 things narrow, do you start booking cash at the P&L rates for taxes and interest? So what's going on there?","John K. Martin","It's really timing, Michael. I wouldn't look too much -- that much into it. One of the reasons why we think cash taxes are going to up in 2012 as compared to 2011 is because of the timing of when the payments occur. So it benefited us a little bit in '11. We'll have to deal with higher levels in '12, but we're also going to grow the underlying free cash flow from operations in '12. So -- but it's one of the reasons why, as we talk about 2012 free cash flow, we're anticipating our conversion rate of operating income and EBITDA to be roughly constant as compared to '11. And some of you may remember that we had been projecting that free cash flow conversion levels would accelerate in '12 versus '11. I would just remind you that our free cash flow actually came in higher in '11 than we were anticipating. So as a result of that, flat conversion is still at very strong levels, but it's basically growth in operating income being somewhat offset by growth in interest because of higher net debt levels and growth in taxes.","Operator","The next question comes from Alexia Quadrani from JPMorgan.","Alexia S. Quadrani - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I know you're in the early stages of monetizing your NCAA affiliate deals. Can you give us an update on how the conversations are going? And do you think these conversations imply that you could see an acceleration in affiliate fee growth beginning in 2013?","Jeffrey L. Bewkes","Well, we're really confident in what is going to happen on affiliate side because of that deal. We've already signed some deals, and we're getting more than the -- well, we're getting the value we sought. I'm also -- we're also having pretty constructive conversations with other affiliates beyond the ones we've already done. Basically, we are above the levels that we want and aim to be at in order to go and make this programming investment. So we're even more confident now than when we signed that this is going to be very profitable for us. I'm not -- we're not going to get into the exact timing of when the effects of this hit affiliate rates. It won't be as much in '12 and '13 as it will be in later years, and it's going to be very significant.","Alexia S. Quadrani - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And you mentioned some softness in the volume and the overall advertising market in the first quarter, even though scatters are obviously up nicely over the upfront levels. Have -- those verticals that have sort of pulled back are staying out a little bit. Are you seeing any abnormal activity in terms of cancellation of commitments for the June quarter maybe from those verticals or just in general?","John K. Martin","Alexia, it's John. The answer is no, in terms of abnormality. We're seeing cancellation levels in Q2 at or about the same level as we've seen in each of the last 3 years. And in terms of verticals, I think, as I mentioned in, I think, an answer to an earlier question, we have seen some pullback from global packaged goods companies. We've also seen a little bit of softness in some other categories that you wouldn't ordinarily think of, and we think it may be more due to timing than anything else. But there has been some softness in media spending and some softness in movie studio spending, but that could be more product specific as opposed to anything secular or cyclical there rather. So we're not setting off the alarm bells here in any way. I don't want to misguide you in terms of -- but it's just early days, and we're in the middle of February. And so we just feel like being cautiously optimistic at this point is a prudent way to approach the year.","Operator","The next question comes from Doug Mitchelson from Deutsche Bank.","Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So for Jeff, you mentioned expansion in key international territories as a core goal this year. So I was just hoping if you'd provide more specifics around which territories would be considered key territories and what expansion could entail. I mean -- well, I guess, where we're trying to go here is trying to understand the potential size of acquisitions looking forward and whether the $1-billion guidance for international 2014 EBIT includes -- is organic from here or includes likely acquisitions.","Jeffrey L. Bewkes","We think we can hit those goals with organic growth of what we've already got. Just to give you a little more flavor, we grew revenues double digits around 14% in 2011. And that's despite the exposure to more mature businesses, such as home entertainment and Publishing. And we're seeing even better growth than that at the Networks. As you know, and John said this, we grew the revenue there more than 25%. The secular trends overseas for Networks are stronger than the U.S. We're seeing particularly strong growth in Latin America. We did well over $1 billion across the company there this year. And as we go to the cable network side, we think it's going to be a very key, steady and reasonably fast-growing part of the business. I think we just -- we said it already on the call, the $650 million of adjusted OI [ph] that you just referred to. And we think that, that's going to hit $1 billion in the next few years just on organic growth. The areas where we've been focused, to answer, I think you asked it geographically, are Latin America, Eastern Europe. We put some effort into India. It hasn't worked very well so far. But we continue to look at that pretty hard. And that's where we're going, and we're going to build on our positions. Our margins, just to go to that part, are reasonably strong in Latin America. They're not as high as the U.S. domestic levels. But it shows you, as you go through the world in our Network business, that you can have strong margins heading towards U.S. levels as the markets in which we're operating develop, so Latin America first, Eastern Europe next and then South Asia after that.","Operator","The next question comes from Anthony DiClemente from Barclays.","Anthony J. DiClemente - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I was enjoying the narrative from Jeff on more strategically on content and distribution. I'm just wondering where Apple fits in. I think, I mean, it's hard to deny Apple has just become a tremendous force in terms of media consumption. Is Apple good for Time Warner and the content companies? Where do you see them fitting in terms of distribution of your content?","Jeffrey L. Bewkes","Yes, Apple's great for Time Warner. It's great for films. It's great for networks. It's great for magazines. Remember, all are -- basically what happens when you have great interface devices like Apple, and you could say the same thing for Facebook, is that you have better opportunities for consumers to read or watch our TV, our movies and our magazines. And what you've seen -- and there's, I think, been confusion out there over the last couple of years, is when you look at strong brands, hit titles, movies, TV shows, magazines like People, all the viewing when you give people choice goes to the hit titles, the newest things. And what we're doing, which we've said it over and over -- I'm sorry, I'll have to say it again. We're making our hit shows, movies and magazines available to our engaged readers and viewers exactly how they want it, for no extra cost, in a way that's really even more engaging than how they used to get what they read or what they watched. So what you have, not just Apple, but all these technological advances just makes the programming and the magazines more valuable. And we think we have a model that appeals greatly to consumers. It's really a proven model. There's no reason it can't succeed wildly, and I think you're really seeing that happen now.","Anthony J. DiClemente - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And does that stay true as Apple -- there's been talk that Apple television and Apple television will be introduced. So if the consumer increasingly actually uses Apple as the primary interface for content consumption, does that change, that create risk to the affiliate model? Or do you hold by your comments here? I'm just trying to figure that out in my mind.","Jeffrey L. Bewkes","An Apple screen is a television. So if you like your Sony TV at home or your Samsung TV on the wall or your Apple iPad sitting in your lap, they're all televisions, and our shows are all on them. And you can get them all whenever you want for no extra charge.","Operator","The next question comes from Jason Bazinet from Citi.","Jason B. Bazinet - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I just had 2 quick ones. I think there was a difference between net income and adjusted net income of about $173 million in the quarter reflecting the write-down of CETV, which I assume is just a mark-to-market gain. Has anything changed in terms of your view of the strategic value of the assets, sort of holding aside the vagaries of the market? And then my second question is, and I may be reading something into this that's meaningless, but your definition of adjusted EPS seem to include some incremental items related to pension plan curtailments. Is that meaningful at all?","Jeffrey L. Bewkes","So the good news is I can give the pension plan accounting. That's just an accounting. It hasn't changed in our view. We're very optimistic about CME in that market. And it's essentially just the stock market there for all companies there. And we have the mark-to-market on that.","Jason B. Bazinet - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","But you still like the asset?","Jeffrey L. Bewkes","Yes.","John K. Martin","And, Jason, it's John. Regarding the change in the definition, there's really nothing there other than periodically, we go and review the definition and try to figure out whether there are other potential things that could happen that really aren't indicative of our ordinary course of business or our normal business actions. So -- but it's not significant at all. In fact, if you look back, there's nothing really in history that would have captured or fallen into this definition. So if you -- so it doesn't change the base of EPS with which we're going to compare our future performance against for 2011. So that's the first point I'd make. And the second point I'd make, and I just want to be clear on this, we're not considering doing anything at this point either. So I don't want to foreshadow something that we're going to do and we're trying to get ahead of it by changing the definition. That's not the case at all. It's just that periodically, we evaluate the benefit plans that we have, and we could make adjustments if we determine that they're in the best interest of the company. So that's all. It's immaterial. There's virtually nothing going backwards.","Douglas Shapiro","Thanks a lot. And Christine, I think with that, we're just about on the hour. It's probably time to cut it off, but thank you, everybody, for listening in."],"20397":["Time Warner, Inc.

My name is Ashley and I'll be your operator for today's call. At this time all participants are in listen-only mode. Later we'll conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Michael Kopelman, Senior Vice President-Investor Relations. Mr. Kopelman, you may begin.","Michael Kopelman - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Time Warner's third quarter earnings conference call. This morning we issued two press releases, one detailing our results for the third quarter and the other reaffirming our 2015 full year business outlook.","Before we begin, there are two items I need to cover. First, we refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Schedules setting out reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our earnings release and trending schedules. These reconciliations are available on our website at www.timewarner.com\/investors. Reconciliations of our expected future financial performance are also included in the business outlook release that's available on our website. Second, today's announcements include certain forward-looking statements, which are based on management's current expectations. Actual results may vary materially from those expressed or implied by these statements due to various factors. These factors are discussed in detail in Time Warner's SEC filings, including its most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. Time Warner is under no obligation, and in fact expressly disclaims any obligation to update or alter its forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.","I will now turn the call over to Jeff Bewkes, Time Warner's Chairman and CEO, who will be followed by Howard Averill, Time Warner's CFO. After their prepared remarks, our divisional CEOs, John Martin, Richard Plepler and Kevin Tsujihara will join us for our Q&A session. Jeff?","Jeff L. Bewkes - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks Mike, and thanks everyone for listening in this morning. As you can see from our results, we had another very good quarter. Revenues increased 5%, $6.6 billion. We posted strong growth in adjusted operating income, which totaled $1.8 billion. That translated into adjusted EPS of $1.25 per share. That's a record third quarter for the company. And we returned over $1.5 billion to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.","This continues our track record of delivering industry-leading performance while also positioning the company for a world where viewers consume an increasing amount of content on demand and on multiple platforms and devices. And that's a world in which brands need to thrive, both inside and outside the traditional TV ecosystem. We've been doing that by leveraging our strong brands, global scale and distinctive IP to produce content that resonates deeply with consumers and will become even more valuable on this environment. We've also been a leader in enhancing the value of the traditional TV bundle for consumers, making more content available on demand and on a growing array of devices.","More recently, we've been strategically expanding outside the traditional TV ecosystem to tap into new growth opportunities, and we're executing these strategies across the globe, while at the same time remaining laser-focused on operational and capital efficiency. The result has been a total shareholder return of 180% since the beginning of 2008, well above our peer average and more than double the S&P 500. To continue performing at those levels in the future, however, it's critical that we push on the accelerator, because every day it becomes clearer that the trends we anticipated are happening, and in some ways, they're happening even faster than we expected.","These changes create challenges for our business but they also produce many opportunities for us. And our goal is to use our unmatched combination of scale, brands and distinctive IP to capitalize on these trends so that our businesses are even more relevant, more competitive and profitable five to 10 years from now than they are today.","That means moving even more aggressively to execute our strategy by making investments for the long run. This is a formative time in media; a time when industry leaders for the next decade and beyond are being established. And I believe those companies with the resources and will to invest will thrive, and those that don't will falter. So it's important our primary focus be on long-term competitive position and growth rather than near-term profitability. So with that as a background, I'd like to provide an update on our 2016 financial targets.","We have not yet finished our budget and long range planning process but we're far enough along that we can identify and size some changes to our expectations that together suggest adjusted EPS is more likely to be around $5.25 next year. I'll give you some context on those changes and Howard will provide more detail in his remarks. But at current rates, we estimate the impact of foreign exchange on next year would be similar to this year. That's around $0.50 per share, accounting for the significant majority of the change in our expectations.","Beyond FX movements, there are areas where we've outperformed our expectation, and other areas that have been more challenging. More important, we have also identified additional investments and other key decisions that will weigh on earnings in the near term, but that we think will drive long-term growth.","Programming remains by far the most significant area of investment for the company. As you all know, we have plans to invest aggressively in content in 2016 and beyond.","And an increasing part of that investment will be directed towards brands and IP that we think will resonate with consumers on new platforms. HBO's investments in John Stewart, Bill Simmons, Sesame Street and its expanded VICE relationship are all great examples.","Turner's partnership with WME | IMG to form an e-sports league that will air on TBS is another example and there are many more to come. But having great content is no longer enough. Content has become just one element of the broader consumer experience. And while we are living in the golden age of television programming, for many consumers, the television viewing experience is stuck in the Bronze Age. So we're stepping up our investment and providing the best possible consumer experiences. For instance, we plan to increase our investments in new digital products and infrastructure so that we can meet consumer demand for video outside traditional TV and compete effectively across platforms.","That includes new broadband delivered initiatives targeted at millennials such as HBO NOW, CNN's start up Great Big Story, and TBS's new digital studio, Super Deluxe.","It also includes investments like Turner's majority stake in iStreamPlanet, a leading platform for live streaming. And we'll continue to build out data and analytics capabilities, both as the engine of our industry leading advanced advertising product and to inform our marketing, our digital products and even some of our content development itself.","It also means delivering even more value to consumers, especially those who subscribe to the traditional bundle. As you know, our company has led the industry in making our content available to consumers on an on-demand basis. Given ongoing shifts in consumer behavior, we think it's important to provide even more on-demand content as part of our network offerings. As a result, we're evaluating whether to retain our rights for a longer period of time and forego or delay certain content licensing. This would effectively push the SVOD window for content on our networks to a multiyear period more consistent with traditional syndication. In our efforts to improve the consumer experience on our networks, we're also looking for opportunities to reduce our ad loads. Just last week, we announced that truTV will cut its ad load in half for prime time original shows starting late next year. Over time, we think a better viewing experience will help drive higher viewership and enhance the value proposition of our networks. Now, as I've said before, I think now is the time for us to press our advantages and I'm confident these investments in content, capabilities and the consumer experience will position us for continued strong growth in the years to come. And I'm confident because we're operating from a position of strength, which was evident once again in this quarter's results.","So let's look at this quarter, turning first to Warner Brothers, which increased its revenues by 15%, led by continued strength in television and video games. Already the top supplier of broadcast television programming, Warners has the two biggest new shows on broadcast this fall with Blindspot and Supergirl. Supergirl launched last week and represents one of eight Warner shows on television this season based on our DC Entertainment library, joining already established hits such as The Flash, Arrow and Gotham.","DC's IP was also a significant contributor to our video games business, which through the end of the third quarter, is the number one U.S. publisher this year. And at the end of the third quarter, we launched LEGO Dimensions, which counts Lego, Batman and many of its DC counterparts among its cast of characters. We think it's going to be a big hit this holiday season and the next big game franchise for Warners.","On the movie side, the countdown has started for March's blockbuster Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, which will be followed by the buzz-generating screen version of DC's Suicide Squad. DC is a key part of Warner's growth strategy and in recent years has had tremendous success in both television and games. The next stage of growth for DC will be in film, which is also a critical driver in our plans to further expand our consumer products business.","At Turner, TBS's coverage of Major League Baseball playoffs was the most watched postseason ever for the network, growing close to 50% over last year's coverage. And the NBA on TNT, one of our other key sports properties, got off to a great start last week with viewership of its opening night doubleheader growing almost 25% over a year ago. The continued strength of our sports lineup has helped make TBS and TNT the number one and number four cable networks in primetime year-to-date, respectively, and that's a great position to have ahead of the rebrands we'll be rolling out for each of those networks next year.","We're optimistic these rebrands will have a similar impact over time as the changes we made at CNN and Cartoon Network. In the third quarter, CNN continued to grow prime time ratings across all key demographics, up 39% and 35% for adults 18 to 49 and 25 to 54, respectively. CNN's reach has never been more apparent than during its recent record setting coverage of the Republican and Democratic presidential debates, and CNN continued to build its digital presence with the recently launched Great Big Story. That's a distinctive independent mobile focused news brand aimed at millennial audiences. It's one of the many examples of how we're innovating outside the traditional TV ecosystem.","Cartoon also continued to gain share, ending the third quarter as the number one ad-supported cable network with kids 6 to 11 for the second consecutive quarter. Even more impressive, it was the number one network in VODacross broadcast and cable in July and August. Adult swim also shined brightly, finishing as ad-supported cable's number one total day network among adults 18 to 34 for the 30th consecutive quarter. That's an impressive run.","Turning to HBO, it was another strong quarter for the global leader in print and subscription video. In September, HBO received a record 43 primetime Emmy awards. That's the most of any network for the 14th consecutive year. That included best drama for Game of Thrones and best comedy for Veep. In total, Game of Thrones was the recipient of 12 awards, and that's a record for a series in one year.","So with HBO NOW, HBO is at the forefront of marrying the very best content with a next generation consumer experience. While it's very early and we have a lot of work ahead of us, the early results for HBO NOW point to a significant long-term opportunity. To take full advantage of that opportunity, we'll continue to expand our line-up of both distribution partners and supported devices for the HBO service. On that front, HBO NOW recently added Roku to its lineup of distributors and we added support for Google's Chromecast and Amazon's Fire TV. HBO is also expanding its content lineup to leverage its growing multi-platform presence. And yesterday we announced that John Stewart will be joining the HBO family with a particular focus on providing content for our broadband platforms.","Over time, we expect to expand the distribution of standalone HBO streaming services to many more territories around the world. For example, HBO Latin America recently announced plans to offer a standalone streaming version of HBO to Latin American and Caribbean broadband consumers. The service will launch in Columbia before the end of the year and subsequently expand to other territories in the region.","So we're just getting started, and I think you can see that we continue to execute at a very high level across the company. We're moving quickly and decisively to take advantage of changes in technology and consumer behavior and I'm confident the investments we're making in content, capabilities and in the consumer experience will further strengthen our competitive position, solidify our long-term growth prospects and enable us to continue providing industry-leading returns to our shareholders for many years to come.","Now let me turn it over to Howard so he can take you through the financials in greater detail. Howard?","Howard M. Averill - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks Jeff, and good morning. I'd like to start by providing some additional context for the comments Jeff made on our 2016 targets. As Jeff noted, and I want to emphasize, we're still working through our budget process and we plan to provide our 2016 outlook when we report 4Q earnings. Thanks. (15:56) But as we stand today, we have visibility on, and want to share a number of items affecting 2016 including investment decisions we're in the process of making.","By far the most significant factor is FX, which at current rates, we expect to have a similar impact at this year or a drag of approximately $0.50 on adjusted EPS compared to our expectations when we put our plan in place last year. Beyond that there are some parts of the business where we're tracking below and other areas we're outperforming our expectations compared to the plan we presented at our investor day.","In terms of operational headwinds, similar to the rest of the industry, ratings at our key domestic entertainment networks have declined to a greater degree than we anticipated a year ago and that will negatively affect ad revenue next year. In addition, since the end of 2014, subscribers at Turner's domestic networks have declined approximately 1% beyond what our outlook had assumed and we're assuming declines continue at a similar rate in 2016. On the positive side, our cost savings efforts are running ahead of plan and we remain focused on executing our efficiency initiatives and constraining overhead expenses.","At CNN and Cartoon Network, ratings continue to be very strong and that's driving upside to our advertising expectations for those businesses. At Warner Brothers, our video games business is having a record year in 2015 and we see opportunities to continue to grow this business. So despite difficult year-over-year comparisons, we expect to outperform our initial video games expectations for next year.","And finally, excluding FX, growth across our international businesses remains strong. Overall, the impact from operational headwinds not including FX and the benefit from improved performance in the areas I just walked through are roughly similar in size, each running several hundred million dollars. Beyond those changes, we have also identified some additional investments we believe are critical to our long-term success. We recognize the video eco-system is rapidly evolving and strongly believe this is the time to press our advantage. So as Jeff noted, we've decided to invest even more aggressively in our businesses with a focus on content, capabilities and enhancing the consumer experience. And while we're still evaluating the size, those investments could run into the hundreds of millions of dollars.","Taking into account those additional investments, we think 2016 adjusted EPS is more likely to be around $5.25, but as I mentioned we're still working through our budget process. So other factors could influence our outlook to either the upside or downside. Looking beyond 2016, we're in the very early stages of updating our long-range plan. But I would point out the FX drag I noted earlier will carry through into future years and that means we don't expect to be over $8 in adjusted EPS in 2018 at this point. Even so, we're excited about the progress we are making on some of the upside opportunities we discussed with you previously and we think the investments we're making to enhance the consumer experience will be a critical point of differentiation for the company. So we're very confident we can grow these businesses at industry leading levels in the years to come.","Now let me turn to the third quarter results. I'll begin by referring to the first slide of our presentation, which is now available on our website. As you'll recall, last year's third quarter results were affected by significant restructuring and severance charges across the company and programming charges at Turner. Given the nature and size of these items, my comments today related to expenses, margins and adjusted operating income for the third quarter and year-to-date periods will exclude these charges from all periods.","Starting with consolidated results, we had another strong quarter and were really pleased with our performance year to date. Through the first three quarters of the year, revenues increased 6% and adjusted operating income grew 13% and we've achieved that while continuing to execute on our strategic objectives and laying the groundwork for future growth.","In the third quarter, revenues grew 5% or 10% excluding a drag of almost 500 basis points from FX. Adjusted operating income increased 13% with margins expanding about 200 basis points. That reflects our continued cost discipline as we held total expense growth at 2% in the quarter. That included a 6% reduction in SG&A due to savings from the restructuring actions taken last year and ongoing cost controls as well as a decline in equity compensation resulting from the movement in our stock price.","Moving down the income statement, adjusted EPS was $1.25 compared to $1.22 in the prior year quarter, and increased almost 30% when excluding last year's charges and benefit from a tax settlement. During the quarter, we repurchased over $1.2 billion in shares and paid $285 million in dividends. In year to date, we've returned almost $4.2 billion to shareholders. This morning, we reaffirmed our guidance for 2015 adjusted EPS to be in the range of $4.60 to $4.70 and that's despite a foreign currency drag of approximately $0.45 to $0.50 which is above our previous estimate due primarily to the recent weakening of certain currencies in Latin America. So we feel really good about how we're operating and we remain on track for another year of very attractive adjusted EPS growth.","Now turning to the segment highlights. I'll start at Turner where we are encouraged by the improvement in advertising trends and we posted another quarter of profit growth despite significant FX headwinds. Year-to-date, Turner has grown adjusted operating income a very strong 16%. Subscription revenues declined 1% in the quarter but increased around 4% when looking through the impact of foreign exchange and last year's benefit from certain domestic contractual settlements.","Domestic subscription revenues grew low single digits. Subscriber losses were a modest headwind to growth in the quarter and were consistent with what we saw in the first half of the year, declining around 1.5% on average. Absent a drag of more than 20 percentage points from FX, international subscription revenue was up low double digits with the biggest gains again coming from Latin America.","Looking to the fourth quarter, we expect a net negative impact of approximately 300 basis points on total subscription revenue growth from the combination of continued FX headwinds and the benefit from the comparisons to last year's carriage dispute with Dish. And with higher pricing set at nine of our top 10 distributors, we remain on track for domestic subscription revenue growth to accelerate into the low teens in 2016 and to grow at a similar rate in 2017.","Moving on, advertising declined 1% but was up 3% when excluding FX and the impact from the absence of NASCAR programming. Domestic advertising was flat in the quarter. International advertising grew in the low double digits absent an FX drag of over 20 percentage points and the benefit from the consolidation of our sports network in Brazil.","Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect a net drag of close to 250 basis points as a result of the impact of FX headwinds partially offset by the positive comparison to last year's carriage dispute with Dish and the benefit from airing three additional major league baseball playoff games this year. At the same time, scatter pricing has been very healthy, pacing up strong double digits versus the upfront. And putting those factors together, we anticipate total advertising revenue to be up low single digits in the quarter.","Looking at our costs, we reduced expenses by 7% and margins expanded over 250 basis points, helped by lower programming costs and SG&A. Programming expenses were down 9% primarily due to the absence of NASCAR. SG&A declined 6% reflecting our continued focus on cost efficiencies as well as savings from last year's restructuring actions.","In the fourth quarter, excluding the charges from last year, we anticipate programming cost growth to be up about 20% due to major league baseball and the timing of original programming on TNT. A significant portion of the increase from higher MLB stems from the additional games and the significant growth in ratings and advertising during the playoffs, which pulled additional rights amortization into the quarter. We also expect higher marketing expenses associated with our originals.","As a result, adjusted operating income excluding charges should be down significantly in the fourth quarter. As we approach the rebrands of TBS and TNT, we're also evaluating the fit of certain programming we currently air. To the extent we decide not to use the programming in the future, that could result in charges during the fourth quarter, though nothing close to the magnitude we saw in 2014. Even so, Turner remains on track for another year of solid growth in adjusted operating income. At the same time we're continuing to make the investments necessary to position us for long-term success.","Turning now to HBO, where we continue to see very strong demand for the product in the form of both subscriber growth and content licensing. Domestic subscription revenue growth was in the mid-single digits and consistent with the last several quarters, a shift toward non-revenue-generating subs was a constraint on revenue growth. As we expected, HBO NOW's contribution to sub revenue increased from last quarter; however, it's still very much in its infancy as both a product and a business. Over time, we expect NOW to be a more significant revenue contributor as we launch on additional platforms and continue to invest in the product.","Moving on, content and other revenues grew 13%. That was mainly from the domestic licensing of a library series. Adjusted operating income was up 21%. That was helped by a 3% decline in total expenses despite investments in marketing and technology related to HBO NOW.","Programming costs fell 6% due to lower theatrical expenses. So HBO is on track for another year of good growth in adjusted operating income, and given the strong global demand for our content and the investments we're making in programming and with HBO NOW, we feel HBO is well positioned to deliver attractive financial results over the long term.","Moving on to Warner Brothers, where we continue to benefit from the diversity of Warner's businesses. In the quarter, revenue increased 15% and adjusted operating income was up a strong 36%. And that's despite a material drag from FX. Television revenues increased over 20% due to strong growth in licensing fees and that was mainly due to the domestic licensing of 2 Broke Girls and Person of Interest. Meanwhile, Warners continued its record year in video games with revenues more than tripling for the second consecutive quarter. That was led by the releases of LEGO Dimensions and Mad Max as well as continued strong sales from our franchise titles, Mortal Kombat X and Batman: Arkham Knight. These are a few examples of how we can leverage the great IP and franchises at Warners and games and why we see a very attractive long-term opportunity for this business.","Across theatrical and TV, home video revenues were down 7% in the quarter, in line with industry trends. At the same time, digital trends remain healthy with EST up double digits for Warners and the industry.","Overall, Warner Brothers had a great quarter and remains on pace for a record year of adjusted operating income in 2015. And with the healthy trends in our TV business, a growing video games presence and an ambitious theatrical slate that kicks off next year, we're confident Warners can continue to grow at attractive levels in the years to come.","Turning to the next slide, free cash flow totaled $2.9 billion in the first nine months of the year. That's up from a year ago due to growth in adjusted operating income as well as lower cash taxes, partially offset by a significant swing in working capital. The growth in working capital reflects higher receivables from increased TV licensing revenues, severance payments related to last year's restructuring initiatives and increased content investments across our divisions. Our cash taxes declined primarily due to the timing of favorable tax legislation and related payments. And given healthy conversions so far this year, we're on track for another year of very strong free cash flow generation.","Now looking at our balance sheet, we ended the third quarter with $21.2 billion of net debt, up almost $1.4 billion from the end of 2014. That's mostly due to the approximately $3.9 billion we returned to shareholders in the first nine months through share repurchases and dividends. Since our last earnings call, we redeemed the over $300 million in debt that remained outstanding on our 2016 notes after our tender offer earlier this year. And on the M&A front, we've invested $344 million so far this year. That includes Turner's investment in iStreamPlanet in the third quarter, and that's a great example of the kind of tuck-in acquisition we have prioritized in recent years and that remains our focus.","Our net leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was approximately 2.7 times; however, excluding programming, restructuring and severance charges from the fourth quarter of 2014, our leverage ratio would have been 2.64 times, slightly below our target leverage of 2.75 times. As we look forward, we do not anticipate a change in either our target leverage or our capital allocation philosophy, which will remain focused on investments back into our businesses, targeted M&A and consistent direct returns to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.","With that, let's move on to the final slide, which looks at our outlook for 2015. We're really pleased with how we're executing across our business and with our strong financial results through the first nine months of the year. Given our strong year-to-date results, I want to provide some additional context on our 2015 outlook for adjusted EPS, which we continue to expect to be in the range of $4.60 to $4.70. As I mentioned earlier, that includes an FX headwind of approximately $0.45 to $0.50 based on current rates. Looking through that FX headwind, our outlook implies over 20% growth off last year's base of $4.15.","Midpoint of our outlook suggests adjusted EPS will be down slightly in the fourth quarter when compared to the $0.98 we reported in the fourth quarter of last year. That's mainly due to investments across our networks' businesses that we've previously discussed with you, including further technology and marketing investments related to HBO NOW and significantly higher programming and marketing costs at Turner.","Meanwhile, at Warner Brothers, we have difficult theatrical release comparisons, an unfavorable mix of costs related to investments in content at video games and TV, and we continue to face material FX headwinds, but overall we're very pleased with our performance this year and we're on track for our seventh consecutive year of double-digit growth in adjusted EPS. And we believe the investments we're making will both strengthen our position inside the traditional TV ecosystem and allow us to take advantage of the growing opportunities outside of it.","With that I'll turn it over to Mike to start the Q&A.","Michael Kopelman - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, Howard. Ashley, can you please open up the queue for Q&A?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from Michael Nathanson of MoffettNathanson. Your line is open.","Michael B. Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC","Thank you. I have one for Jeff and one for Richard. Jeff, in your comments, you talked about pushing out your SVOD windows on cable network content to longer syndication time frames. So can you talk about how you expect them to monetize that content? Will it be through heavier advertising or license fees? And then for Richard, given Jeff's comments on that, how do you think about the HBO Amazon relationship where you've sold a lot of library content and do you want to bring that back onto the HBO NOW platform because that's where your brand is? So those are my questions.","Jeff L. Bewkes - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Michael. It's Jeff. I'll start. First, I think all of us know that for shows that premier on either broadcast or cable channels, the biggest monetization support by far is the carriage fee plus the advertising for \u2013 that supports either a big bundle or a streamlined bundle. If you then go to the aftermarkets, syndication, SVOD, et cetera, if we're talking about SVOD, which we also all know drives a much smaller subscription revenue and it has limited or no ad revenue, it's pretty clear that that offers less monetization support in general for the quality and diversity of programming that we've all gotten used to seeing on the dial.","So we think a lot about how to enhance the value of the traditional pay TV bundle and it's something we're obviously looking at at our networks. Historically, the syndication window was four years after the original air date. And that, whether it went to syndication over the air, whether it went to cable basics, that was supported by subscription revenue, it was supported by advertising. More recently we've seen most serialized content move towards one-year windows.","Let's just take our HBO deal and Richard's going to speak to it given your question, the Amazon deal has a three-year window. So we'll continue to evaluate and see what window works best for different types of content: the pay TV originals, the broadcast premiers, the cable premiers. And we'll look very carefully at the health of our networks and all of Warner's network partners to make sure that we optimize the value of content to provide support for the diversity of what you're seeing today. And we all need to consider that the shift in viewing to digital platform suggests that consumers often don't mind waiting a year for certain content if that's the way that it's offered.","So you look at the basic cable networks and they compete with services like HBO, Netflix, et cetera, all of which, the HBOs, the Netflixes, they have long-term exclusivity for their shows. So we're still evaluating what it would look like, but it could mean adjusting the window somewhat as I said in my prepared remarks today.","Also let's go to international. It's a big source of support for programming. It's a very interesting example of how it could work. And if you take the example, like Netflix is doing some smart things, entering a number of territories. It's aggressively bidding for syndicated content and what you see is that in those territories, we see incumbent distributors bid for second window rights, not just first window rights. They're, of course, supported by subscription fees, advertising, et cetera.","So this increased competition is driving demand for great TV content, it's benefiting Warner Brothers, it's a rapidly evolving ecosystem, not just here but overseas and we expect change and innovation to continue. So that's why we're thinking about this. I do want to emphasize that what you're hearing today from us is, hopefully you'll hear a very confident position and we're quite resolved to deal and benefit in the long term because we think the focus of our basic and pay TV networks is an advantage. We think we're going to be in whichever bundles are out there, streamlined or launched, and we think these moves are very important to secure the long term growth and we think it's all going to work.","Richard L. Plepler - Chief Executive Officer, Home Box Office, Inc.","Michael, it's Richard. Look, as you know, a large percentage of Amazon Prime subs were not HBO subs. And we thought it was a terrific way -it's a three-year-old window, it's just made clear. We thought it was just a great way for people to have a chance to sample our programming, to have the HBO experience and we think that was a catalyst to driving people to subscribing. It's been a terrific relationship. We're now, as you know, expanding our relationship, have expanded our relationship with Amazon on the Amazon Fire and we like it because we think it exposes HBO to more people and drives them to the network. So we think it's been a positive thing.","Michael B. Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC","Okay. Thanks, Jeff. Thanks, Richard.","Michael Kopelman - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, Michael. Ashley, can we have the next question please?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from John Janedis of Jefferies. Your line is open.","John Janedis - Jefferies LLC","Hi. Thank you. I just wanted to clarify your comments on programming investment. Does this mean you're investing beyond the original guidance? And understanding it's early in the budgeting process, if it is, can you size it? And is the increase largely at HBO or across all of your properties? And then maybe more broadly, has the cost to monetize a viewer increased meaningfully for the industry?","Howard M. Averill - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks. This is Howard. First of all, I would note that the investments, they aren't primarily programming. So I'm not going to drill into the details of the individual items, but most of the investments we're making are in those capabilities around digital, technology, infrastructure. Now there is some incremental spend that's related to programming and that's been done at HBO and that's in line with those areas that we discussed earlier, which are Sesame Street, VICE, Bill Simmons and Jon Stewart. But again, clearly mostly on a consumer experience and capability side.","John Janedis - Jefferies LLC","Okay.","Richard L. Plepler - Chief Executive Officer, Home Box Office, Inc.","Yeah, John, it's Richard. Look, all the investments in programming that you've read about in the last six months, obviously we think are not only additive to HBO NOW and HBO GO, but to the brand itself. And we're very excited about what that portends for the future and for new subs and for new millennial subs particularly. So, these investments were incremental, but they're incremental obviously to drive revenue in the future.","John K. Martin - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Turner Broadcasting System, Inc.","And John, it's John Martin. Just to add a quick point from Turner's perspective, the investments that we're considering are really mostly outside of the programming arena as we already have a lot of scale in programming, but we're investing in new businesses, building new brands, and as Howard said, new capabilities. We acquired iStreamPlanet, a premier live streaming company. We just launched out of CNN Great Big Story. We announced recently that we're spanning up the league in partnership with WME and IMG in e-sports, which is a hugely exciting area. We just launched an internal comedy focused digital business called Super Deluxe. We've got Bleacher that we want to expand. We've got the number one OTT sports service in Brazil called Esporte Interativo which we're also investing in and Cartoon Network and Adult Swim building new businesses outside of the ecosystem. So...","John Janedis - Jefferies LLC","Thanks. And maybe one quick related question, just on the potential programming write-downs, Howard. I think there was a bit of a shift to younger skewing programming on a going-forward basis. As so as you look at what may not be working, is that the program you've already purchased in syndication or maybe yet to be a programming that may not find an audience?","Howard M. Averill - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Look, overall the rebrands for TNT and TBS are making that move to the more distinctive younger skewing programs, but we're evaluating programs, but I would say that what we're talking about is around the edges and it's not anywhere near the magnitude of what we talked about in the past.","John Janedis - Jefferies LLC","Thank you.","Michael Kopelman - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, John. Ashley, next question, please?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Alexia Quadrani of JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Alexia S. Quadrani - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you. My question's on Turner. You highlighted the sub declines as one of the headwinds in the business. Now having completed the majority of your renewals, and I know you're not going to talk specifically about any one renewal, but can you maybe talk generally if protections or minimums are part of those renewal discussions? And then just sort of staying on Turner, my second part of my question is on your commentary on the reduced ad load, I guess where are we in terms of what has been announced or done so far and where do you think we need to be? Maybe you can elaborate on the puts and takes in that decision, how much of it, pricing, what do you get, assuming it's enough to offset the ad line declines over time?","John K. Martin - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Turner Broadcasting System, Inc.","Thank you, Alexia. Two pretty broad questions. Let me see if I can get through them quickly. On the subscription revenue side, we are quite pleased with the position that we're in right now and quite confident in our ability to continue to drive very, very strong subscription revenue growth. I think you were probably referring to the domestic side. We've now completed nine of ten deals where we have absolutely 100% achieved the rate increases that we were seeking. We're confident that we will complete the remaining deal in reasonably short order. All of our contracts have certain penetration protections that give us additional confidence, but I do want to just comment for one second with respect to the declines in the subscribers in the United States. In the prior quarters and in other forms we've said that we've been planning for declines to continue. We don't anticipate that they're going to be material. We continue to still believe that. What we're doing now is we're starting to just, as we're planning for next year, we're going to assume that the rate of decline is similar to this year, although in an encouraging way, the traditional distributors who have reported third quarter earnings, most of them, if not all of them, have reported improvements year-over-year and some distributors, the best third quarters that they had in years. In addition, we are in talks with numerous interested parties to potentially launch OTT services. And as Jeff said, we would fully anticipate participating in those bundles with the portfolio of networks that we have. So I think as you look out on the horizon, there's reason to be really confident and optimistic that we could even stem losses altogether and maybe even get back to a position of growth in the United States.","On the ad load side, we announced recently, which was a first for us, that we were going to take truTV and provide an enhanced viewing experience beginning next year that will essentially provide for 21% more programming. And in some respects, we're starting with truTV, we're going to learn a lot. I think, as Jeff said, the consumer experience is increasingly important. We're transforming Turner to focus solely, first and foremost, on the consumer, where the consumer's going and what that experience is going to be. When we think about the ad clutter that we have on our networks, I'm comfortable with where we are for the most part, but I think tru is going to be a very, very interesting experiment to see whether it actually will make a difference with respect to the viewing experience. And we don't anticipate it will have really any revenue impact with respect to that network. So we're going to continue to pay very close attention to this. We care deeply about the experiences that we provide our consumers with our brands and we'll be providing more updates as we get into next year.","Alexia S. Quadrani - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you.","Michael Kopelman - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, Alexia. Ashley, next question please?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Doug Mitchelson of UBS. Your line is open.","Doug Mitchelson - UBS Securities LLC","Oh, thanks so much. So one for Howard and one for Jeff. Just doing the math, Howard, guidance of almost $6.00, call it $5.90, $0.50 of currency takes you to $5.40. You're saying preliminarily $5.25, so that incremental $0.15 of investment's about $150 million to $200 million of EBITDA investment versus what you might have thought at the Analyst Day. So do I have that math right?","And then, Jeff, I guess it's sort of interesting, right? Perhaps the issue around SVOD rights demonstrates that Warner Brothers and HBO have different profit maximization strategic priorities than Turner. Are the synergies among these three still sufficient, or does it make more sense to have Turner and Warner's HBO separate at this point, given the dynamics you guys were talking about today? Thank you.","Howard M. Averill - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, Doug. Yes, in terms of the outlook that we talked about, it is, as you point out, mostly FX and it is mostly investments, but keep in mind, it is early in the process. There are things that we need to work through. But we do expect it to be in that range and we're confident about that.","Jeff L. Bewkes - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, on your question for \u2013 I don't think it's true, and maybe you could ask a follow-up as to whether the profit maximization aims or needs of Warner or Turner or HBO are different. That's basic cable premium and then producers of shows that are sold both to broadcast cable and pay TV. So I don't think there's any benefit to what you're saying in any kind of separation. In fact, I think because we've now gotten our businesses, with those three, into the ones that we think work best together, both in strategic planning, in global distribution, in global sourcing of leading projects, meaning attracting creators, whether film, TV shows, et cetera, these are huge advantages for Time Warner. And what we're all talking about, including all of your questions, are how to take the obviously successful history of bundles which have very high penetration, not just in the United States but everywhere, and have a significant amount of ad support and how to evolve all of them into more VOD, better guide and interface. And the programming, some of which goes for premium, not ad supported, some of which belongs in an ad supported environment, but in a evolved ad environment, all of that still holds true. And I think what you're seeing now in the evolution of streamlined bundles and new distributors, is more opportunity on a global basis to make all this program production and network branding more engaged and more relevant. So we wouldn't split any of this up. We think it belongs together and it gives us an advantage relative to our competitors.","Doug Mitchelson - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you, that's helpful. If I could just ask one -yep, thanks.","Howard M. Averill - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I was just going to clarify, Doug. As I talked about, there's still a lot of moving pieces, including stuff that's below the line, but your math does make sense; with respect to the investments could be in that range.","Doug Mitchelson - UBS Securities LLC","It would be helpful, just a clarification, thank you for all that, from John. Are sub declines, this 1% below budgets, are sub declines accelerating during this year or is this just reflective, the change in guidance reflective of the trends that have been in place the last few quarters?","Jeff L. Bewkes - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, we're not seeing an acceleration. It's just the trends are continuing.","Doug Mitchelson - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you so much.","Michael Kopelman - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, Doug. Ashley, can we have the next question, please?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Rich Greenfield of BTIG Financial Services. Your line is open.","Rich S. Greenfield - BTIG LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Really, I'd love to get Jeff's view. You gave your manifesto on looking at the whole world of media several years ago, and I guess as you think about direct to consumer businesses, you've led a path with HBO, but you really haven't done it for Turner. And I'm just wondering, one, what's stopping you from literally launching your own everything Time Warner? Forget even about just Turner, but everything Time Warner direct to consumer at X price, and keeping SVOD rights? And then, if that's not attractive, or that's not something you're going to do, as you think about \u2013 you chose earlier this year to sell content to Hulu. Why is Hulu better? Because I was surprised that you all allowed in your contracts Hulu to be ad free, given that I thought Hulu, the benefit was it protected the ad model. And so, why is Hulu better choice versus any of the other SVOD platforms?","Jeff L. Bewkes - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Thanks, Rich. That's a good and complicated question. I'll start with the HBO, then Turner and basic cable, which tends to go in a bundle. If you take the point, let's start with premium branded services like an HBO, Showtime, Netflix. For a long time, at HBO, I think more than 15 years, has had a VOD service. And therefore, all of the programming, the original programming, et cetera that's on HBO, is all there, and it's quite successful just as it is at Netflix or Showtime. Now it is true, if you stay with HBO, to your question, that when we sold, or licensed, some syndicated window product three years old to Amazon, all of which is still on HBO, what we're giving is consumers more choice and doing a sampling reach for HBO with Amazon and Amazon Fire subscribers that allows HBO to get a trial so they can see older programming and then sign on to the current service.","Those kinds of things make sense for premium networks. And then go to your question on basic networks like Turner or pick a broadcast network. Those are typically premieres, often once-a-week shows across the dial whether it's broadcast or cable, and most consumers are used to getting those in a bundle, whether the bundle has to be 100 networks, whether it's the 30, 50, or 10 that a consumer chooses, which I think over time, they'll have more choice to be able to do. If we took the course you're suggesting, and it's worth thinking about of course. Take, say, the Turner networks and put them on their own, you do have some questions of distribution, of coverage, of ad support, which it may not be the best way to premiere a range of basic cable networks. And remember, most of the distributors out there don't have the really strong ability to support an offering like that. That could emerge, but it's not here now.","Rich S. Greenfield - BTIG LLC","And then specifically on Hulu? On why Hulu would be better than any of the others since it now has ad-free or why you allowed an ad-free?","Jeff L. Bewkes - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I'll start. Kevin may want to \u2013 no matter who we license to, it's important that we focus on maximizing the value of our content across all distribution platforms and key point, across all windows in time. That includes continuing to evaluate what window works best for different types of content. Half hour comedies are different than serialized dramas. And when considering the best partner, there are many different considerations beyond just the price.","For example, I think as you referenced, Hulu established advertising has value by charging additionally or two levels depending whether a consumer has ads or not. The question of whether it's a sufficient charge for the ads remains to be seen. But we think competition on ad spot providers, not just the ones like Amazon, Netflix, Hulu, but as you go around the world, you have a combination of pure SVOD guys, you have SVOD services from incumbent broadcasters.","It's becoming a fairly rich competition. It's good for consumers, it's good for content value, and we think, we'll arrive at the right mix. I think if your underlying point is that it doesn't make a lot of sense to sell programming to a given distribution model, let's call it a bundle with a fair amount of subscription support and advertising support, and then you sell it to a method of distribution that has less realistic ad and subscription support, that would clearly not be a sustainable thing for either content, production or networks over the long term.","Kevin Tsujihara - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Warner Bros. Entertainment, Inc.","This is Kevin. I think from a Warner Brothers perspective, it's clear that maintaining the integrity and health of the ecosystem is critical to maximizing the long-term value of the content. And therefore, I think as Jeff said, we're constantly evaluating the right methods, the right distributors, the right partners first to monetize our content, both domestically and globally.","Michael Kopelman - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, Rich.","Rich S. Greenfield - BTIG LLC","Thank you.","Michael Kopelman - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Ashley, could we have our next question, please?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ben Swinburne of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Benjamin Daniel Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you. Howard, is the new earnings outlook, which I know is preliminary for 2016, inclusive of this SVOD delay or forego decision or is that further out? And then, Richard, can the HBO revenue growth accelerate as you laid out last fall, if we continue to have this kind of DirecTV satellite mixed sift headwind that seems to have bitten premiums a bit in the last quarter? Thank you.","Howard M. Averill - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hey, thanks, Ben. This is Howard. So yes, the answer is the SVOD is in those investments. That represents part of the consumer experience improvement that we're talking about.","Richard L. Plepler - Chief Executive Officer, Home Box Office, Inc.","Yeah, look, we're very, actually excited about the deals that are coming up for renewal. And we think, as we've said before, that while there's a disproportionate amount of our sub growth that is not revenue generating, that also presents us with a huge opportunity, because as our brand continues to grow and as we continue to add value to the brand, which we think we've done in droves in the last years, that gives us a terrific position as we go into these negotiations. And we are going to recapture some of that revenue from our better performing affiliates. And as we go in to renegotiate, we think there's a lot of upside for us, and certainly in the worst performing affiliates and in the better performing affiliates as well.","Benjamin Daniel Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you, both.","Michael Kopelman - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, Ben.Ashley, we have time for one more question.","Operator","Okay, our final question comes from Anthony DiClemente of Nomura. Your line is open.","Anthony DiClemente - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Thanks a lot and good morning. Rich, on the HBO side, is there anything you can give us more specifically on HBO NOW as far as the subscriber trajectory, consumption patterns? It must be giving you some confidence in informing your investments in content at HBO. So anything you can give us on engagement or revenue I think would help us and investors further our understanding of your content investments there. And then John \u2013 go ahead.","Richard L. Plepler - Chief Executive Officer, Home Box Office, Inc.","Sorry. No, no. Sorry.","Anthony DiClemente - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","No, I was just going to add a quick one for John Martin, just at Turner. It seems as though NBA on TNT and MLB on TBS continue to be big anchors for Turner. Could you just touch on your interest in sports content or incremental sports rights from here? I'm thinking of the Thursday night football package for next year. Thanks.","Richard L. Plepler - Chief Executive Officer, Home Box Office, Inc.","Let me start with NOW quickly. Look, it's early days still. We're basically within the first six months. Roku just joined Apple, Android and Amazon. We still have PlayStation and Xbox to come. It's worth noting that 40% of GO usage for example comes on Roku, PlayStation, and Xbox. We just went on Roku. So there's a lot of opportunity out there for us. We're very pleased with what we're seeing. We love the programming that we're adding. We're going to begin next year marketing even more aggressively as we're out on all platforms. But the subscriber satisfaction, the trends we're seeing, we're very pleased. It's early days. We have more to do and we're going to make the necessary investments, not only in content but in marketing. Just continue to show people the value proposition inside the brand and inside not only HBO NOW but also HBO GO and the linear network as well.","John K. Martin - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Turner Broadcasting System, Inc.","Hey, Anthony it's John. So if you're asking if we'd be interested in an NFL Thursday night package, the answer's yes. The NFL is a premium sports property. We think it would be a great fit within the Turner brand. We think we'd be fantastic partners with them to help build their brand. So if and when the Thursday night package becomes available, it's something that we would look at. But I want to be very clear here that our intention would be to remain very fiscally responsible. And we feel really good about our current sports portfolio. I would agree with what you said that what we have already provides a real anchor to the value of our networks and we've got the NBA partnership into 2025, March Madness through 2024, and Major League Baseball through 2021. So I think we're in great shape now. We would look at the NFL opportunistically, and either way we'll be fine.","Anthony DiClemente - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Thanks very much.","Michael Kopelman - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, Anthony.","Michael Kopelman - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks Anthony. Thank you everybody for joining us today. If you have any follow-up questions, please let us know.

Second Quarter 2014 Earnings Call. My name is Joe, and I will be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is also being recorded.","I will now turn the call over to Mr. Michael Kopelman, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Kopelman, you may begin.","Michael Kopelman","Thanks, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Time Warner's Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call.","This morning, we issued 2 press releases. One detailing our results for the second quarter and the other reaffirming our 2014 full year business outlook.","Before we begin, there are 2 items I need to cover. First, we refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Schedules setting out reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our earnings release and trending schedules. These reconciliations are available on our website at www.timewarner.com\/investors. Reconciliations of our expected future financial performance are also included in the business outlook release that's available on our website.","Second, today's announcement includes certain forward-looking statements, which are based on management's current expectations. Actual results may vary materially from those expressed or implied by these statements due to various factors. These factors are discussed in detail in Time Warner's SEC filings, including its most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q.","Time Warner is under no obligation and, in fact, expressly disclaims any obligation to update or alter its forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Thank you. And I'll turn the call over to Jeff. Jeff?","Jeffrey L. Bewkes","Thanks, Mike, and thanks for listening in this morning. We had another great quarter. Revenues grew 3%. Adjusted operating income increased 17%, and adjusted earnings per share was up 29%.","We also generated $2 billion in free cash flow in the first half of the year. That's up 16% from a year earlier.","The other highlight in the quarter was the completion of the spinoff of Time Inc. into an independent publicly-traded company on June 6.","This really marked the beginning of a new and a very promising era for Time Warner. As you know, we started a process several years ago that focused the company on video content, emphasizing the very best storytelling. We've strived to make that content available to consumers all over the world and across every technology platform and device. We've also maintained an intense focus on our operational and capital efficiency with an unwavering commitment to maximize value for Time Warner shareholders.","Our strong results both this quarter and the last several years are evidence that our strategy is working. By focusing on the right set of leading brands and assets, on operational excellence and on disciplined capital allocation, we've been able to achieve the highest total shareholder returns of any company in our peer group over the last 6 years.","And we think the future of the company is even brighter. We've only just begun to reap the benefits of being a nimbler and more focused video content company with iconic assets, including the world's leading premium television brand, the world's strongest ad-supported cable network group and the world's largest film and television studio. The combination of those assets and a management team that I think is the strongest in the industry, positions us for continued attractive growth in the years to come.","Today's call is about our operating results and performance. We're not going to comment on the proposal from 21st Century Fox or its withdraw except to say that the board and our senior management team appreciate, very much, the continued support of our shareholders. We're committed to continued delivering substantial and sustainable returns into the future, and we saw ample evidence of what we can accomplish during the second quarter. And that's just the beginning.","So let me start with HBO, which in a world with so much great content and so many ways to access that content, continues to define the word premium.","HBO remains at the top of its game. Recently receiving 99 Primetime Emmy nominations, which is the most of any network for the 14th year in a row. It's also more than double the nominations of its closest competitor for the second straight year.","Nominations included Outstanding Comedy Series for Veep and Silicon Valley, as well as Outstanding Drama Series for True Detective and Game of Thrones.","Both Silicon Valley and True Detective are freshman hits for HBO. That underscores HBO's unrivaled ability to incubate and provide a platform for groundbreaking storytelling.","Now speaking of groundbreaking, the fourth season of Game of Thrones, which concluded in June, averaged 19 million cumulative viewers, making it the most watched season of an original series in HBO's history, surpassing even The Sopranos.","What are you going to do? With all this, HBO is not easing up on the gas. It introduced 2 more shows this quarter that are off to solid starts. John Oliver's Last Week Tonight; and our new drama, The Leftovers from showrunner and writer, Damon Lindelof.","The Leftovers is the first show Warner Bros. has produced for HBO, and Leftovers is averaging 8 million viewers per episode to date.","And 2 days from today, The Knick, from executive producer Steven Soderbergh, will premiere on Cinemax, which has been steadily building a slate of original hits.","We think The Knick could be a signature show for the network, and we've already renewed it for a second season.","I mentioned using technology to enhance the user experience. And HBO GO continues to set the standard for how audiences enjoy the content they love across devices and platforms.","HBO GO active users grew 35% year-over-year in June and is now available in 24 territories around the world. And as we've told you before, we're making investments in the next-generation HBO GO that will be even more powerful and will put us in a strong position to take advantage of consumer demand for multiplatform viewing options here and around the world.","HBO's investments in programming and technology continue to translate into solid subscriber growth. In the first half, we added more than twice as many domestic subs as we did in the same period a year ago and we're confident that, that will translate into even stronger subscription revenue growth over time.","Of course, HBO's success has not been limited to its domestic business. HBO's international subscriber base, including unconsolidated joint ventures, grew almost 15% in the past 12 months. And we think there is substantial additional opportunities to grow internationally in the years to come.","Now let's look at Turner, which has the strongest portfolio of ad-supported cable networks in the industry. That includes 2 of the top 5 networks in the U.S. and the highest percentage of its U.S. networks in the top 30 of any operator.","And Turner's 4 most important networks, TNT, TBS, CNN and Cartoon Network accounts for 85% of its domestic affiliate fees. That concentration is the result of a deliberate strategy of focusing our investment on a small group of top-tier networks to ensure that they are must haves for both consumers and distributors.","In a world where consumers are becoming more discriminating in what they watch and where distributors are looking to create smaller bundles of networks, we think that's the right strategy, and it puts us in a great position to increase share over time. We saw that play out in this year's [indiscernible], where we once again garnered price increases at the very top of the industry.","To stay on top, Turner's investing even more in content, building on a strong platform that's already home to more top-rated original programs than any of its peers and a portfolio of top-tier sports that includes the NBA, Major League Baseball and March Madness.","Those investments are paying dividends. During the quarter, TNT ranked as ad-supported cable's #1 prime time network among total viewers and adults 18 to 34, adults 18 to 49 and adults 25 to 54. We've told you about TNT's efforts to refresh and take more creative risks with its programming, and we're already seeing positive results.","The Last Ship and Murder in the First, which both launched during the quarter, are the 2 most watched new series on ad-supported cable this year so far. We expect that momentum to continue with the August rollout of Legends, which stars Sean Bean and comes from Howard Gordon. He's the creative force behind 24 and Homeland.","TBS was close on TNT's heels, finishing the quarter as the #3 ad-supported network in primetime among adults 18 to 49 and adults 25 to 54, with The Big Bang Theory on TBS remaining the #1 comedy on ad-supported cable among total viewers for the 10th consecutive quarter.","And we're excited about the launch of all new episodes of American Dad on TBS this fall.","We also continue to see strength at Adult Swim, which was, again, ad-supported cable's #1 network in total day among adults 18 to 34 during the quarter, and it won the day in adults 18 to 24 and 18 to 49 as well.","At CNN, we're making significant progress on our original programming strategy with current seasons of Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown; and Morgan Spurlock: Inside Man, both registering solid double-digit gains over the prior season.","The Sixties was tripling CNN's time period average from a year ago and The Hunt with John Walsh, another new show, won its time period among cable news networks.","Outside the U.S., Turner is also a leader, particularly in Latin America. The strength of Turner's international position was evident this quarter as international revenue was up around 10% and adjusted operating income grew 25% on a constant currency basis with growth across all of our major regions.","Our kids business remains a cornerstone of our international operations. In fact, Cartoon Network is the #1 kids network in many areas outside the U.S.","While already a very good business for us, we've got plans to significantly increase the size of our kids business as we focus on global franchise management and growing consumer products revenue.","Turner is also investing to expand its lead in multiplatform with properties like Bleacher Report, which was the #2 stand-alone sports site in the second quarter and CNN Digital, which is significantly ahead of its peers, leading all news outlets with over 30 million monthly mobile uniques.","CNN recently extended its multiplatform capabilities with a national rollout of its next-generation TV Everywhere product, which is now available to subscribers in over 85 million households domestically. So go check it out.","Now I'd like to turn to Warner Bros., which is on track for another great year, underscoring its continued industry leadership. In what is widely considered a volatile and mature business, Warner has grown its adjusted operating income at a double-digit CAGR over the past 5 years by leveraging its industry-leading distribution capabilities, its unique IP and its very strong relationships in the creative community to produce content with global appeal.","The strength and diversity of its revenue streams was evident again this quarter. On the theatrical side of the business, we anticipated a softer summer compared to last year, which remember, included Man of Steel, The Hangover Part III and The Great Gatsby.","But despite those comparisons, we're #2 in the domestic box office year-to-date, benefiting from the strong performances of The LEGO Movie and Godzilla. And along with the release of with the second Hobbit installment, The LEGO Movie also helped us to maintain our #1 position in home video in the quarter.","It's just the latest example of Warner's unequaled ability to create franchises with 2 additional LEGO titles already in development.","That adds to an already strong pipeline of franchises built around DC Entertainment and the new series of films from J.K. Rowling based in the world of Harry Potter. Our franchise pipeline gives us great confidence Warner Bros. will continue to lead the film industry, building on a track record that includes the #1 position at the domestic box office 7 out of the last 10 years and the #1 spot in home video for 13 straight years.","But that's not all. Warner Bros. Television group is also leading the industry. Heading into the 2014 to '15 TV season, Warner's is, again, the #1 producer of shows for broadcast. That's a position we've held for 11 of the past 12 seasons.","Starting this fall, Warner will have 31 shows on broadcast networks, including at least 2 primetime series on each network and 60 shows overall across broadcast and cable.","Now what's also really notable and unprecedented is that 5 of those shows are based on IP from DC Entertainment, including the highly anticipated Gotham on Fox, The Flash on the CW and Constantine on NBC.","That's early evidence of Warner's ambitious plans to further mine the DC catalog across our television, film, video game and consumer products businesses.","Warner's is also leveraging its lead skill position in broadcast television by significantly expanding production for cable networks and SVOD services, growing its non-scripted output and widening its international local production footprint.","During the quarter, for example, we completed the acquisition of Eyeworks' international television production operations, and we've now built out a global network of wholly-owned international production companies.","A key part of our strategy for Warner's to expand in cable TV production is working more closely with both Turner and HBO. That collaboration is one of the many benefits of having a smaller, more focused company with commonalities across all the businesses and a management team that's worked together for years. And we continue to augment our strong operating performance with disciplined capital allocation. So far, this year, we've repurchased $3.5 billion of our stock and including dividends, we've returned over $4 billion to shareholders.","Even at recent highs, we believe share repurchases were a very attractive use of capital. And today, we announced that the board has authorized an additional $5 billion in share repurchases. That decision is a strong indication of the confidence we have in our growth prospects. Over the next several years, we have great opportunities across our businesses.","At Turner, we'll benefit from our domestic affiliate renewal cycle and strong international growth while investing to reinvigorate our key brands and take advantage of under-monetized opportunities like the global kids business.","At HBO, we'll capitalize on the growing demand for our industry-leading content both here and around the world while investing in technology to provide the very best next-generation experience to our consumers.","At Warner Bros., we'll roll out an even stronger slate of franchise films with global appeal and leverage our leading position in broadcast TV to drive growth in cable, SVOD, unscripted and international sales.","And across the company, we'll remain laser-focused on operating and allocating capital as efficiently as possible to maximize shareholder returns. We know that many of you are interested in hearing more about our long-term growth plans, and we look forward to sharing additional details about those plans at an investor event this fall.","With that, let me turn it over to Howard.","Howard M. Averill","Thanks, Jeff, and good morning. As a reminder, we completed the Time Inc. spin at the beginning of June, and it's now continued in discontinued operations.","I'll begin by referring to the first slide of our presentation, which is now available on our website. We're thrilled with our financial performance in the first half of the year. We delivered strong growth in the first quarter and even better results this one.","So through the first half, our adjusted operating income is up 14%, and adjusted EPS is up 27%, and we think that growth is both indicative of the strength of our industry-leading businesses and the validation of the strategy we've been executing the last several years.","In the second quarter, we posted double-digit increases and adjusted operating income at all 3 divisions and total AOI increased 17%, boosted by an acceleration in subscription revenue at both HBO and Turner.","Margins expanded nearly 300 basis points in the quarter, and that's the 11th time in the last 12 quarters that margins have increased year-over-year.","Total operating expenses were down 1% in the quarter, and that's despite higher content investments that Turner and HBO and increased expenses associated with the consolidation of HBO Asia and HBO Nordic.","SG&A was down 3% in the quarter. This is a great example of how our disciplined approach to expense management allows us to balance aggressive content investments with continued margin expansion and profit growth.","We continue to leverage growth and adjusted operating income into even faster growth in adjusted EPS, which increased 29%. And that was mostly due to our ongoing share repurchase program and improved results at our equity investments, including CME.","During the quarter, we repurchased almost $2 billion in shares, a significant acceleration from the first quarter and paid over $280 million in dividends.","So year-to-date, we've returned over $4 billion to shareholders, including over $3.5 billion in share repurchases and well over $500 million in dividends.","And as evidenced by the authorization of an additional $5 billion in share repurchases, we remain committed to delivering significant direct returns to shareholders.","This morning, we also reaffirmed our 2014 guidance for low teens growth and adjusted EPS. So with a very strong first half, we remain on track for our sixth consecutive year of double-digit growth and adjusted EPS.","Now turning to the segment highlights. I'll begin at Turner, which had record second quarter revenues and adjusted operating income.","Subscription revenues were up 8% in the quarter despite a 70-basis point drag from FX. Domestic Subscription revenues once again grew high single-digits as Turner continue to benefit from the rate increases associated with its domestic affiliate renewals.","International Subscription revenues increased double-digits with the largest gains coming from Latin America.","Looking forward, we'll continue to benefit from Turner's domestic affiliate renewals for the remainder of the year, and we expect domestic sub revenue growth to remain in the high single-digit range. Longer term, we remain confident in our ability to grow domestic sub revenue double-digits annually on average through 2018.","Moving on. Advertising revenues increased 1% in the quarter, in line with the range we expected coming into the quarter, and that included the benefit of approximately 300 basis points from the airing of 2 final 4 games.","While our new original programs at TNT are off to a good start, ratings at our domestic networks remain a headwind. In addition, scatter demand remained moderate, particularly for sports. And as we've discussed with you previously, we think that was at least partially due to the impact of the World Cup.","Domestic advertising growth was up slightly in the quarter with very modest growth at both our domestic entertainment networks, including kids and young adults, and news networks. Excluding the drag of approximately 400 basis points from FX, international advertising would have been up in the high single-digits, led by solid underlying growth in Latin America.","Looking ahead to the third quarter, scatter pricing is healthy, pacing up high single-digits over the upfront, however, volume remains relatively modest, and we expect ratings to remain a near-term drag on our performance.","Taking those factors into account, we anticipate total advertising to be flat to down low single-digits in the third quarter.","Adjusted operating income grew a really strong 15% in the quarter and margins increased over 300 basis points. That reflects both revenue growth and our continued focus on limiting non-programming expenses, which were down in the quarter.","Programming expenses increased 5% due to higher sports cost, primarily associated with the NCAA Tournament. And that was balanced by lower original programming cost at our domestic entertainment networks due to the timing of series premieres.","Looking ahead, we expect cost related to the new Major League Baseball deal and continued aggressive investments in original programming to result in somewhat higher programming cost growth in the second half of the year. So we expect full year programming cost growth to be in the high single-digits.","To free up resources to invest even more in programming, as well as technology and international expansion, earlier this year, Turner kicked off a global initiative called Turner 2020.","Turner 2020 is designed to improve efficiency and maximize performance across the organization and will likely result in restructuring charges in the second half of this year. This is all consistent with our company-wide strategy to limit non-programming expense growth in order to fund investments and drive continued margin expansion.","Turner will also be evaluating whether to dispose of certain licensed programming in connection with these restructuring activities.","To the extent it decides to, we could also incur programming impairments. We'll provide more details on both those fronts in the coming months.","Excluding those potential impacts, we're on track for another year of margin expansion and solid growth at Turner. And looking beyond 2014, we expect revenue and adjusted operating income growth to accelerate over the next several years as we continue to benefit from attractive domestic affiliate rate increases, strong international growth, efficiency initiatives and upside from under monetized opportunities like our global kids business, Adult Swim and truTV.","Turning now to HBO, where we had another very strong quarter with revenues up 17% and adjusted operating income up 23%. Subscription revenues increased 10% in the quarter with the consolidation of HBO Asia and HBO Nordic contributing around 500 basis points to that growth.","Domestically, our subscriber trends remain healthy, and we're starting to see some improvement in the subscriber mix, which contributed to a modest acceleration in our domestic Subscription revenue growth.","Content revenues grew over 50% in the quarter. That increase was due to revenue from our licensing deal with Amazon, balanced by lower domestic syndication.","Adjusted operating income was up 23% in the second quarter with margins expanding nearly 200 basis points, and that obviously benefited from the Amazon deal. Also, keep in mind that prior year's quarter benefited from an adjustment to a receivable allowance. Absent that, adjusted operating income would've been up over 30%.","Programming expenses increased 11% with 600 basis points of that growth coming from the international consolidations. Excluding the consolidations, programming expenses increased 5% with double-digit growth and original programming, tempered by lower acquired theatrical expenses due to the timing of film availabilities. In addition, marketing spend increased to support our original programming and due to the consolidations.","Across HBO's international properties, we've posted another quarter of solid growth. Total international revenue, including unconsolidated JVs, was up double-digits. And that was driven by continued subscriber growth with international subs up around 15% year-over-year.","Looking ahead, we expect total expense growth, excluding the consolidations, to accelerate somewhat in the back half of the year. This is due in part to the timing of programming, the reinvestment of the Amazon proceeds and higher distribution expenses.","As we've previously discussed, we intend to invest the majority of the Amazon proceeds back into the business in programming, marketing and technology. As a result, we expect adjusted operating income to be relatively flat year-over-year in the second half of the year. Despite that, with our strong first half results and healthy underlying trends, HBO remains on track for solid growth in 2014.","And given the strength of its brand and content and the significant global opportunities we see in front of it, we think that HBO is poised to accelerate its growth over the next several years.","Moving onto Warner Bros., which reached its highest second quarter profits in a decade. Despite tough theatrical comparisons, Warner's had another very strong quarter, underscoring its diverse earn extremes [ph].","Adjusted operating income grew 28% and margins expanded around 200 basis points. That included strong growth in TV and home entertainment, combined with lower film and distribution costs.","Adjusted operating income growth this quarter also benefited from the reversal of bad debt reserves and lower restructuring charges.","On the TV side, revenues grew mid single-digits. That was related to higher license fees from television production and international syndication. And as Jeff described earlier, Warner's completed another very successful upfront season, so the outlook for our TV business continues to be very strong.","Across theatrical and TV, home entertainment was up 14%, largely due to the timing of the release of the second Hobbit film and the strong performance of The LEGO Movie.","Digital trends also remained positive with electronic sell-through up close to 70% in the quarter.","Consumer spending across the broader home video market was down modestly in the second quarter due to the declines in rentals and sales of catalog product. However, total sell-through was up in the quarter, led by 32% growth in electronic sell-through. So we remain encouraged with the continued digital transition in home entertainment.","Looking ahead to the second half of the year, theatrical comparisons remain challenging, but we expect continued momentum in TV. We're really well positioned for the new TV season and expect continued growth in TV license fees. We also expect demand for our content outside the U.S. to remain healthy.","So given the strong start to the year and positive outlook in the TV business, Warner's remains on pace for another great year in 2014.","And looking beyond 2014, we remain confident in our ability to grow both our TV and theatrical businesses at very attractive levels as global demand for high-quality video content continues to grow.","Moving to free cash flow, where we're also having a great year. We generated nearly $2 billion in free cash flow in the first half, a 16% increase compared to last year. The year-over-year improvement is primarily due to the strong growth and adjusted operating income and a favorable swing in working capital. And that was despite increases in cash taxes, capital expenditures and cash interest.","The improvement in working capital primarily reflects lower participations at Warner Bros. And cash taxes increased largely due to higher pretax income and the expiration of certain favorable tax legislation.","Meanwhile, the increase in cash interest was due to higher debt balances and given the $2 billion of debt we raised during the second quarter, we expect cash interest to be higher in the second half of the year.","So with our solid performance in the first half of the year, we're on track for another very strong year of free cash flow generation in 2014.","Next, I want to talk about our balance sheet and capital allocation philosophy. We're strong believers that effective capital allocation can be as important to shareholder returns as strong operating performance, and we've been steadfast in our commitment to maintaining an efficient balance sheet and to prudent capital allocation in order to provide superior shareholder returns.","That strategy has been working, and we have no intention of changing it. Our capital allocation priorities remain first and foremost to maintain a strong balance sheet so that we can fully invest to drive growth in our businesses. Even so, we generate substantial free cash flow. We have committed a significant portion of that cash flow to our dividend with the highest payout ratio in the industry. We've grown our dividend double digits each of the past 5 years and intend to continue to grow it along with our businesses.","Next, we always look at M&A opportunities as they present themselves. Potential transactions need to provide strategic benefits with reasonable execution risk and risk-adjusted returns that are more attractive than our alternative uses of capital. But we have leading scale in our businesses, so we don't need to do anything.","Finally, we believe share repurchases remain a very attractive use of capital and intend to continue using them to complement our dividend. You can see that philosophy at work so far this year.","We ended the second quarter with $18.1 billion of net debt, down about $230 million from the end of 2013. That's largely due to our strong free cash flow generation, the $1.4 billion in proceeds we received from Time Inc. in connection with the spinoff, and the $1.3 billion in proceeds from the sale of our space in Time Warner Center. Our net leverage ratio was 2.5x as of June 30.","On the M&A front, we've invested over $850 million year-to-date. The majority of this came in the second quarter as we closed our acquisition of Eyeworks' international television operations and completed financing arrangements with CME. We're optimistic about the long-term opportunities for both and they fit in perfectly with our strategy of investing selectively in attractive international territories.","We also returned close to $3.5 billion to shareholders during the first half of the year, including almost $3 billion of share repurchases. And we believe our stock remains very attractive at current levels.","Now onto the final slide, which shows our 2014 outlook. We had a terrific first half of the year with all of our divisions delivering strong results. And looking to the back half of the year, we expect our underlying revenue trends to remain solid, led by strong affiliate revenue growth at Turner and HBO. At the same time, we'll be making significant programming investments at both Turner and HBO, face difficult theatrical comparisons at Warner's and anticipate a negative swing in intersegment eliminations.","So as implied by our outlook, that will cause a deceleration and adjusted EPS growth in the back half of the year.","A few minutes ago, I mentioned that we anticipate incurring restructuring charges and programming impairments in the second half. In addition, we anticipate a favorable tax settlement over this period. While these items aren't currently reflected in our outlook, on balance, we expect they will have a net positive impact on adjusted EPS. We'll share more details on those items as the year progresses. Putting all that together, we're on track for another year of solid double-digit growth and adjusted EPS. As Jeff discussed, we're confident that we can grow adjusted EPS even faster in the years to come.","Demand for the type of high-quality video content that we produced is only increasing, and we expect to convert that into continued healthy revenue growth. At the same time, our efficiency initiatives and strict discipline managing non-programming expenses should result in further margin expansion driving strong growth and adjusted operating income. And when you factor in our capital allocation strategy, we believe we can deliver very attractive adjusted EPS growth for the foreseeable future.","As Jeff noted, we look forward to sharing more of our plans with you at an investor event this fall.","With that, I'll turn it back to Mike to start the Q&A.","Michael Kopelman","Thanks, Howard. [Operator Instructions]","I'll also remind you that will be not commenting on 21st Century Fox's proposal or its withdrawal.","Joe, can you please open up the call for Q&A?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question here comes from Mr. Michael Nathanson from MoffettNathanson.","Michael Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC","I have 2 for Jeff. Jeff, I think over the past few weeks, it was clear that you guys and the board have a strong conviction in the internal plan of Time Warner. So you've helped us in the past talk about Turner's affiliate fee growth outlook, but I wonder from where you sit as an insider, what are the drivers of Time Warner's financials do you think are underappreciated from the outside world?","Jeffrey L. Bewkes","Thanks, Mike. Well, I'm glad you asked. Look, it's a pretty long list. So let me just tick it off. First of all, I think that global growth in multichannel TV and in connected devices is fairly strongly increasing the value of high-quality video content, and that's true all around the world. And we think that if you look at Time Warner -- HBO, Warner, Turner, all of our brands are very strong global brands. We have global scale that gives us an advantage in creating the content and also distributing the content. If you go to each company, at Turner, we've got very good visibility the next few years from the domestic affiliate renewal cycle, and so that's a pretty significant contributor to growth. We also expect to complement that with strong growth internationally, particularly in Latin America. That's true across Turner and HBO. And I think people underestimate the opportunity we have in terms of reinvigorating our key Turner networks and in capitalizing on the under-monetized opportunities that exist there. I'll just cite one, you're going to hear more about it, global kids, Turner and Warner's. HBO, we're seeing really strong increased demand for the services and the content. So both HBO subscription demand, wherever we take it; and HBO content, wherever we take that. That's true all over the world. I think people underestimate that. Warner's is also very well positioned for continued growth with both the film side -- huge pipeline of franchise films, and there are very strong secular trends in the TV series business, which Warner is the leader in producing. So I don't think that there's full appreciation of what we can do there. And this is both film and TV. And if you take just an example like DC, which is pumping out so many new shows at Warner this year, and then add to that, as you look at more and more realized power from DC, consumer products is an area, where, frankly, we've underperformed what we can do, and we think that, that's going to be a real driver going forward. So if you take all those together, we're pretty confident that we can deliver very attractive revenue growth, and we can turn that into even faster growth and adjusted OI. And of course -- and I think our record speaks to this, our approach to capital allocation, if you take increased operating income growth levels, we complement that with a fairly clear plan for capital allocation. And so we feel comfortable that we can take increased OI growth and turn it into increased EPS growth. And remember last quarter, we said publicly that we expected to deliver EPS growth in the low- to mid-teens, if not better. You probably noticed, I'm emphasizing the phrase if not better. I'd also like to note that over the years, we've consistently over-delivered, and we look forward to sharing more about that in our -- of our long-term plans in the fall.","Michael Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC","Okay. Jeff, can I ask you just a quick follow-up on SVOD? There's a rumor or a report over a couple of weeks ago that Seinfeld could actually be sold into SVOD, and given the library of content you own in all the comedies, does this suggest that you and Warner's are rethinking maybe your previous positions on SVOD? Or will you be a bit more aggressive about some of your library content in comedies, especially?","Jeffrey L. Bewkes","Well, we've had a lot of SVOD rev, and I'm going to come back to that, but I think the crux of your question is that the emergence of new players is increasing the value of great content, and we have more of that than everybody. That's true on the film side; it's true on the TV series side. It was quite obvious this quarter that even without the Amazon agreement, our SVOD revenue would've been up double-digits. As we look to the full year, we expect SVOD to grow solid double-digits even without the HBO-Amazon deal. And that growth is obviously even stronger if you include the HBO-Amazon agreement. I'd like to point out, since we mentioned the HBO deal, that Amazon deal doesn't include some of HBO's most valuable content like Game of Thrones and True Detective. Now there's nothing preventing us from monetizing kids shows like those in the future if we think it makes sense, but the same thing is true for Warner Bros. We have the biggest library of TV series and films in the world. If you look at our SVOD revenue, which was quite healthy. Last year, we had a base of -- in 2013, of about $400 million. We're going to be up solid double-digits. And by that I don't mean 10 to 20, I mean more. And I think the opportunity is very, very large in international territories. So it's very clear there's big consuming [ph] amount for this content. We think there is a increasingly competitive and strong set of buyers out there, including Netflix, but including Amazon and some others. And so we're very confident we'll be able to effectively monetize our content, and we're actually pretty happy with the way we've timed or sequenced the release of our library, and you're going to be seeing more about that as the years go on.","Operator","Our next question here comes from John Janedis from Jefferies.","John Janedis - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Howard, can you talk a little bit more about third quarter guidance for advertising? Now, obviously, Jeff talked about the success of some of your originals. How much of the weakness is ratings versus the ad market? And to what extent are you seeing signs of improvement in underlying demand?","Jeffrey L. Bewkes","Your question is third quarter advertisers?","John Janedis - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Yes, Jeff.","Howard M. Averill","Okay. So scatter pricing for entertainment nets is pacing up high single-digits over the upfront, but we're just not seeing the volume overall. And that's been true generally speaking. Additionally, the ratings at our networks do remain a drag. Internationally we're [indiscernible] to see continued drag from FX and a modest slowdown in organic growth due to a tough comp. So as I said in my prepared remarks, we think, overall, advertising is going to be flat to down low single-digits.","John Janedis - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay. And maybe on a related topic, Jeff, can you talk more ratings at Turner? Is the weakness from new or returning shows, and how much of the programming expense maybe skews to originals versus licensed relative to a few years ago?","Jeffrey L. Bewkes","Yes, okay. So you got to deconstruct Turner through a different networks. Let me kind of break it down. You're asking about all of them, right? I mean, in general?","John Janedis - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Yes.","Jeffrey L. Bewkes","Okay. So let's start with TNT, which we mentioned on the call was #1 and a number of age groups in prime. TBS was basically #3 in prime. Adult swim was still #1 18 to 34. CNN is still the destination [ph] for breaking news and leader in mobile. If you really go from that in the ratings performance, it's been a little weaker in the acquired programming, not just at Turner but, really, in all basic cable networks. The originals are doing well. We mentioned on the call that the new originals we've launched this year are up 20% or more over the season -- all the originals are up 20%. So it's coming around. In 2014, we're ramping up the original programming. I think we've said this publicly. We've been around 20% of the air [ph] time original. We're heading to 40% in the next year. So we're going to still have very strong acquired programming, but it will be a smaller piece of the schedule. I think I've said on numerous calls in the past that our access to acquired programming is an advantage, even though acquired programming as a general category is going a little weaker in basically all GE cable networks.","Operator","Our next question here will come from Ben Swinburne from Morgan Stanley.","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Jeff, since you've taken over as CEO, you've gone through shrinking the company down and clearly, based on your prepared remarks, you see a strategic advantage in being a more nimble, focused company. Does that reflect a view that there is a disadvantage or dis-synergy in size and complexity? And I'm wondering, when you look at M&A and consolidation in the space either as a seller or a buyer, are you -- is there a general reluctance at Time Warner on the board level to sort of take on large-scale M&A because of just the view that it actually hurts the business outlook?","Jeffrey L. Bewkes","No, I think you got to -- you can't make a general statement. I think we've said and I think it's pretty clear, we have leading scale in all of our businesses. So we're not subscale. We're not lacking something that we need. And the next question, it's not that it's ever a bad thing, necessarily, to add something that would bring either complementary fill-ins and maybe more scale in a given case, maybe more efficiency and elimination of redundancy. Those things are all fine. But when you're looking at any particular case, you have to look at what kind of scale are you adding? Let's take Time Warner. On the studio side, we're the biggest movie producer and distributor in the world. We're the biggest producer and distributor of series in the world. We have the biggest supply relations with the American 4 broadcast networks of anybody in the world. So if you take that and you consider combining any number of other companies that do the same thing, you'd have to ask, just on that thought, we'll get to networks, is it a good idea? Does it add operating benefits, or doesn't it? So that's on that. If you go to the network side, we've got the biggest network group. We're second to nobody in the world. And if you think -- and we've got very strong networks. If you look at the Turner networks, 4 of them are 85% of our business. Basically, the Turner networks don't have any weak sisters in the group. If you look at HBO, together with Turner, it's an extremely strong network group. If you then say, \"All right. Well, let's look at other networks around the world,\" which ones would improve the operating capabilities or the leverage or the programming capability or the distribution and marketing capability of that already strong group of networks? You can make cases depending on the hypothetical of which networks would help. You can also look at networks that aren't so strong that would not help. So you basically look at it that way. When anybody is -- and if you take a big combination, and I'm not speaking of any particular one, there are always a number of issues. There are benefits and there are risks to making any kind of combination like that. There's also the factor of business interruption, regulatory scrutiny and timings that comes into play. So I would just encourage everybody, because you're all looking at these kinds of things in more than one case, to look at all sides of the issue when you're contemplating the benefits and the risks of putting very large companies together.","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","If I could just ask a follow-up. You talked about at least low to mid or better. One tool you have is the balance sheet. And maybe Howard, you'd want to comment. Like, I know it's an imperative to keep a strong balance sheet. Do you -- are you committed to investment grade? I think the answer is yes. And how high could you go and keep that kind of rating? Any comments on whether you guys would be more aggressive. And I realize you've raised it in the past?","Howard M. Averill","Yes. In setting our target, we've had a very consistent and very balanced approach. We've been very straightforward. First of all, we want to maintain a strong balance sheet that provides us stability to fully invest in our business. We want to make sure we do have flexibility to engage in strategic M&A that presents itself. And it's really important that we continue to have access to capital markets across whatever is happening in the economy. At the same time, we really are trying to optimize our cost of capital to drive equity returns. So as you know, we incorporate a number of factors into that analysis, including in our discussions -- on-going discussions with the rating agencies. You know we raised our leverage to 2.75x earlier this year. And that was to reflect an increased stability of our cash flow based on the timing [ph] spend. We're always evaluating these factors. But right now, we feel like 2.75x does strike the right balance among all of those.","Operator","Our next question will come from Vasily Karasyov from Sterne Agee.","Vasily Karasyov - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","I have a couple on HBO. Jeff, I wonder if you could share the feedback from HBO's distributors and their reaction to the Amazon deal. The reason I'm asking is several years ago, Starz damaged its relationship severely with distributors when it -- they were relicensing to Netflix. I was wondering what made the difference for you?","Jeffrey L. Bewkes","Okay, look. Thank you. That's a great point. I think the difference, a few years ago, what Starz did was they sold their service as a subscription service at a lower price direct undercutting their own affiliates who were their partners. It was literally the same service. The HBO deal is selling programming that's very -- classic HBO hits that are about 3 years old to Amazon where Amazon is distributing that to a lot of viewers and households that don't have HBO. So from the point of view of Amazon, it's a fantastic product offering. From the point of view of our cable and satellite and telco distributors, it's a fantastic thing because you have the resources and marketing of Amazon to a subbase that, frankly, our distributors didn't have as much penetration as they would like. So that's a great kind of partnership for our cable and sat distributors from the Amazon -- which, Amazon's a very powerful retailer. It's great to bring them into harmony with our cable and electronic distributors. Therefore, the distributors have really approved of the deal. It's actually given everybody a new enthusiasm, and particularly our underperforming affiliates, on marketing more HBO and realizing that they can do much better -- huge profit for them if they add variable subs, there's no real costs on their side. And so, what we're seeing is essentially, a regeneration of really the upside of what distributors realize they can do with HBO. Remember that one of the things that is intended [ph] to the Amazon offer, which our distributors do have, and it tends to get overlooked by everyone because it's \"not new.\" HBO's got the strongest lineup of Hollywood movies of any subscription VOD service in the world. They're current, they're new, they're powerful. That's where you get them. HBO also has a very well-recognized original programming slate that's at the top of its game. Both of those are important. And that's going to mean a big marketing push in our cable, sat, telco distributors this fall to regenerate subscriber growth all over the HBO footprint. So what you really have is Amazon and the retail industry working together with the cable, electronics, satco industry, to bring subscription premium TV in its best form to all people in the United States. You can see us doing similar things overseas. Scandinavia is the current vibrant case. And of course, HBO, with its VOD offerings in U.K., Germany, Italy, Australia, in partnership with Sky in a number of those territories, another powerful offering for consumers. I think it's really a period of tremendous upside for HBO.","Vasily Karasyov - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","A quick follow-up. So clearly, HBO is at the very height of the creative cycle. Can you help us understand or map out what would be the sequence of events that would allow to translate that into possibly acceleration in subscription revenue in the U.S.? Is it renegotiating contracts? Or how does it work?","Jeffrey L. Bewkes","Yes, thank you. It's a good question. I think what you're really saying is, what can we do to improve the mix? Because you see some vibrant HBO sub growth domestically, 2 million subs that we just reported, even stronger overseas. But on the domestic side, we're constantly working with affiliates to figure out how can be better market and position the networks among our better performing affiliates. Because some of them are up in the penetration areas that are quite inspiring for everybody. But we've given them incentives to do that. And we need to work together with them to share the economics of that. If you then go to the less penetrated affiliates who are, frankly, missing a very important net operating contribution that they should have, and it should provide sufficient incentive -- we're working hard to market with them in order to get them to be more effective in their distribution of our product. That's all part of the renewal cycle. Over the next couple of years, we're going to turn over all the deals or most of the deals at HBO. We think that we've got the right mix of incentives and consequences to drive better net performance, and I don't say that in a way that would leave out profit gains for all our affiliates, including the less performing ones, but it certainly includes increased contribution to us.","Operator","Our next question here comes from Richard Greenfield from BTIG.","Richard Greenfield - BTIG, LLC, Research Division","A couple of questions. First off, just in light of the A&E and Disney OTT linear deals, we saw A&E yesterday, curious how you think about single- and multi-stream offerings. Disney and A&E seemed to have taken pretty different approaches in terms of single versus multi and wanted your perspective on either.","Jeffrey L. Bewkes","Thanks, Rich. Well, we're certainly open to opportunities to grow our business, and we're not philosophically opposed to an over-the-top virtual MVPD model. We've said that before. We just have to believe that it will be additive to the total situation that we've got, rather than subtract it. And so in the 2 that you mentioned, there's still a lot of questions in terms of the ad model, the quality of service, how it would impact investment in the plant. But take the DISH streaming service. It's a concept we're interested in, because of the way that it is designed very much targets incremental subs and at a price point that would be attractive to younger people, particularly. A similar one would be Comcast selling HBO on a lightweight TV package, which allows you to target a group of consumers that might otherwise not subscribe to the multichannel TV package. And that could be a great entr\u00e9e into the ecosystem for the younger consumers, who would then trade up over time. To your point on the Disney and A&E approaches, the parameters of the offering are important to make sure that it's incremental. So the number of streams, as you're, I think, asking is an important consideration. So we can't -- we're not going to set a rule on a 5-amps call about how we're doing it, but I think that the Disney approach is kind of directionally the right philosophical approach.","Richard Greenfield - BTIG, LLC, Research Division","Just following up on that, we believe that part of why Rupert was so interested in acquiring Time Warner was he saw this as a way to launch an everything Fox. I mean, basically, an everything Fox including Warner Bros. and Time Warner's consumer offering. Could you do the same on your own? Do you look at Turner and HBO as something that you could offer directly to consumers as a package? I guess, why or why not?","Jeffrey L. Bewkes","Well, yes we could. And let me just say what we are doing. At HBO, we're investing in top talent, including a large team of software developers in Seattle that are working on HBO. And as I think you've been among several reviewers groups have said, I think, you're right. That's a very good product. It's a very good consumer experience. So what we're doing there is we're trying to be best in class to have a platform that could not only deliver HBO networks but also Turner networks and frankly, other networks. It doesn't have to be just be ones that we own. I think it's important for everybody, in thinking about that, to ask themselves, should offerings be determined for consumers based on what a company owns? That's not how consumers would program their dial. And I think one should always look at what consumers want to do and harness those platforms that keep in mind exactly the range of products that consumers want. We think that we can have that for our HBO Turner or Warner product, but we're anticipating that people will want more than that.","Operator","Our next question here will come from Doug Creutz from Cowen and Company.","Douglas Creutz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","You guys have talked about some of the ratings challenges you faced recently, but more broadly, it seems like ratings in the second quarter were pretty weak across the board. Do you think there's anything bigger going on there? Or is this just kind of normal variability in TV viewing?","Jeffrey L. Bewkes","Thanks, Doug. Well, let me note, I think you're generally right. Ratings were kind of weak across the dial -- the TV dial. Broadcast finished out 3%. Ad-supported cable was down 4%. There's some -- some did a little better, some did a lot worse. But essentially, viewing was stable but a little on the weak side across the TV dial. That, however, is before online viewing is fully captured. And it isn't really being measured. And it's not that big. But it's significant to some extent at the margin. And even though it's not being measured, a decent amount of it is being monetized. So the issue's a little overblown. If you're asking, \"Do we think there's a secular trend in lower audience viewing across the TV dial?\" we would say no.","Michael Kopelman","Thank, Doug, and thanks, everybody, for joining us today. If you have any questions, please follow-up. We'll be around. Thank you.","Operator","And thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference.

My name is Donna, and I will be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that the conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to your host for today, Mr. Doug Shapiro, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations for Time Warner. Please proceed.","Douglas Shapiro","Thanks, and good morning. This morning we issued 2 press releases, one detailing our results for the second quarter and the other reaffirming our 2012 business outlook. Before we begin, there are 2 items I need to cover. First, we refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Schedules setting out reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our earnings release and trending schedules. These reconciliations are available on our website at timewarner.com\/investors. Reconciliations of our expected future financial performance are also included in the business outlook release that's available on our website.","And second, today's announcement includes certain forward-looking statements, which are based on management's current expectations. Actual results may vary materially from those expressed or implied by these statements due to various factors. These factors are discussed in detail in Time Warner's SEC filings, including its most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. Time Warner is under no obligation and, in fact, expressly disclaims any obligation to update or alter its forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.","Thank you. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff.","Jeffrey L. Bewkes","Before we begin, on behalf of everyone across Time Warner, I want to express our profound sadness about the terrible events at a screening of The Dark Knight Rises in Colorado 2 weeks ago. Our deepest sympathies go out to the victims of this appalling crime, to their families and their loved ones.","We're here today to discuss our quarterly earnings, so let me turn to that, and thanks for -- everybody, for listening in.","Coming into the quarter, we knew we had very difficult comparisons in some of our businesses, and overall, our results came in just about where we expected. John will go through all of that with you in a few minutes, but at the same time, we've seen some very important signs of underlying strength in our businesses over the last few months, particularly at the networks.","At Turner, for example, we're continuing to show a strong ratings momentum across almost all of our networks. This quarter, TNT was the #1 network on cable, driven by another record-setting NBA season and by our new slate of originals. Our regular season NBA coverage was up for the fifth straight year, making it the most viewed season in our 28-year history with the league. And we had great performance from our original programming. On average, our original series attracted over 40% more viewers this summer than last year. Our new shows perception and Dallas are the #1 and #2 series on cable this year. In fact, including The Closer and Rizzoli & Isles, the top 4 scripted shows currently on ad-supported cable are all on TNT.","TBS also had a great quarter. It was up 30% in prime time in its key demo. The Big Bang Theory keeps dominating the charts and was again the #1 sitcom on cable. Importantly, it's continuing to lift other shows on the network, and it provides a great platform on which to launch new programming.","During the last few months, we debuted 2 new shows on TBS, Men at Work and Sullivan & Son, to great success, with Men at Work becoming TBS' most popular original series ever. And rounding out our entertainment networks, truTV was again a top 15 network among men in prime time. It posted its best second quarter ever from men 18 to 49, driven by hits like Hardcore Pawn and Impractical Jokers.","We also had another strong quarter at our animation networks. Adult Swim remained the #1 network among adults 18 to 49. And like last quarter, Cartoon was the only major kids' network to grow in the quarter, up 12% for kids 6 to 11. Let's just look at the delivery of Cartoon compared to Nickelodeon in that demo. In last year's second quarter, Nickelodeon had almost twice the delivery of Cartoon. This quarter, that gap had shrunk to less than 20%.","The exception this quarter was CNN. Although CNN's ratings declined in part due to very difficult comparisons with last year, to be clear, we are not satisfied with CNN's ratings performance and we're focused on fixing it. Within the last few weeks, Turner wrapped up a very successful upfront. Once again, we negotiated CPM and volume increases at the top end of the entire television business among both broadcast and cable networks. That's a powerful testament to the appeal of our branded environments, our content and our ability to offer integrated buys  across platforms. So our programming and brands are resonating with viewers and advertisers.","Our third major constituency, course of, is our affiliates. As we've discussed with you before, between 2013 and 2016, we'll enter negotiations with just about every distributor for just about all our basic cable networks, making it our biggest affiliate renewal cycle in years.","Turner has some of the most watched and broadest reach networks in cable and some of the strongest brands. And over the last few years, we've made significant investments in our brands and in our programming, and we've granted substantial additional rights to our distributors. So we believe that the value we're delivering to our affiliates exceeds the value we're receiving. We're focused on correcting that in this next cycle. In fact, based in part on the deals we've already struck, we have every confidence that Turner will grow domestic subscription revenue at a double-digit pace annually between 2013 and 2016.","I'll turn now to HBO, which is also enjoying strong momentum across its businesses. The volume of great shows on HBO right now is without precedent. Game of Thrones has evolved into a bona fide cultural phenomenon, recently finished its second season with over 11 million viewers per episode. And we just debuted the fifth season of True Blood, which keeps going strong as the network's most-watched show. It's on track for more than 12 million viewers per episode this season. And we have a string of new hits, too. The Newsroom is now attracting more than 7 million viewers per episode and viewership is increasing as the season progresses. And both Girls and VEEP have enjoyed solid ratings and great critical acclaim.","Underscoring the quality of HBO's content, a couple of weeks ago, HBO received 81 prime time Emmy nominations. That's the most of any network for the 12th year in a row, and that included outstanding drama nominations for both Boardwalk Empire and Game of Thrones, and outstanding comedy nominations for Curb Your Enthusiasm, Girls and VEEP.","HBO's experiencing some of the most favorable subscriber dynamics it's seen in several years, too. We've already surpassed 100 million subscribers globally this year, faster than we expected. That's been driven primarily by continued rapid growth overseas. But we're also seeing encouraging trends in the U.S., putting us on pace to add more domestic subs this year than we did in 2011.","We've also been very pleased with the rollout of HBO GO. As you know, HBO GO is now available to our entire U.S. subscriber base. And over the last few months, we've extended support to many new devices such as Xbox, Samsung TVs, the Kindle Fire and Android tablets. Although GO has only been available on TVs for a few months, we're already seeing average monthly usage increase. And as we've mentioned before, over 90% of GO users say they're now more likely to keep their HBO subscription. So as penetration and usage climb, we're confident that GO will benefit subscriber growth and increase the subscriber life cycle.","I'll move next to Warner Bros. This was another outstanding quarter for Warner Bros. Television production. During the upfront, we secured orders from the broadcast networks for 16 returning series and 9 new shows, making us the top producer of network TV programming yet again, and the only studio with at least one show on each of the broadcast networks. In addition, we successfully brought both 2 Broke Girls and Mike & Molly to the off-network market, bolstering our syndication pipeline in 2014 and 2015.","During the quarter, we also announced a deal to license Pretty Little Liars and The Lying Game to Netflix. And recently, we struck a deal to syndicate several shows to Amazon Prime, including Fringe and The West Wing.","In our theatrical business, some of our film releases earlier this quarter fell short of our expectations, such as Rock of Ages and Dark Shadows. However, Magic Mike has substantially outperformed our expectations, and The Dark Knight Rises is on pace to surpass $1 billion at the global box office. Batman is now on track to be the second or third highest-grossing franchise of all time. It's another example of Warner's unparalleled ability to manage broad appeal global film franchises. You'll see more evidence of that ability with the first installment of The Hobbit, which we will release in December. The film is already generating tremendous buzz. And earlier this week, we announced that Peter Jackson, in concert with Warner Bros. and MGM, has decided to make The Hobbit as a trilogy rather than 2 films as originally planned.","I'll turn next to Time Inc. As John will describe, even though the environment for print magazines is very challenging, Time Inc. has been increasing its share by capitalizing on its scale, its brands and the quality of its editorial. At the same time, we remain focused on continuing to evolve the model for digital magazines. For instance, during the quarter, Time Inc. struck a deal with Apple to enable sales of digital subscriptions on iOS devices. Although it's still early, so far, over half of the subscribers to our digital editions have never subscribed to our titles before, so that's a very encouraging sign.","Wrapping up, it's been a very productive few months for us. I'm excited about our progress. And with each quarter that passes, I'm even more confident about how we're positioning ourselves.","With that, I'll hand it off to John.","John K. Martin","Thanks, Jeff, and good morning. During my remarks, I'll refer to a presentation that is now available on our website, and the first slide shows the highlights.","The quarter shaped up pretty much as we had expected. Year-over-year growth was held back by very challenging comparisons at Film and TV Entertainment, as well as Publishing, as well as substantial intersegment eliminations. And while the second quarter's financial results were somewhat mixed, we are seeing some healthy underlying trends which I will discuss. And we had a pretty terrific quarter at the Networks group, which posted its highest revenue and adjusted operating income ever for a  second quarter. We were also able to maintain consolidated margins at about 18%. That's a reflection of our continued focus on cost efficiency across the company, so that's good.","Moving down the P&L, adjusted earnings per share was almost flat year-over-year despite the decline in adjusted operating income, and that's primarily due to the benefit from our ongoing share repurchase program, which is a significant part of our commitment to provide direct returns to shareholders. And during the quarter, we repurchased $565 million of our shares and we paid more than $250 million in dividends. So that means during the first half of the year, we've returned $1.8 billion to shareholders.","As we look out to the second half of the year, we're in good shape to meet our financial objectives. As a result, we are reaffirming our full year outlook for low-double-digit growth in adjusted EPS.","Turning to the segment highlights, and I'll begin at the Networks, where healthy revenue and adjusted operating income growth were evidenced at both Turner and HBO, and that's what's drove the record second quarter there. Subscription revenues grew 6% and year-over-year growth accelerated from the past couple of quarters, and that's despite a drag of about 100 basis points from FX.","Looking at advertising, revenues were up 2% year-over-year. Now there were a number of moving pieces here. And as we've discussed with you in the past, growth was hurt this quarter by the timing of NCAA games and Easter, as well as the shift of management of our digital sports properties, SI.com and Golf.com, back to Time Inc. Looking through these, domestic growth was very similar to the 6% growth that we had in the first quarter and that was despite a decline at our news operations due to lower ratings.","International advertising revenues were down high-single digits in the quarter, and growth here was hurt by the shutdown of Imagine in India, as well as unfavorable foreign exchange movements.","Let me look ahead now to advertising revenue growth expectations for the rest of this year, and I want to talk a little bit about Q3 versus Q4. As of now, we're currently not expecting to report positive growth in ad revenues in Q3, but we expect a much, much stronger Q4. And there's a number of different factors, and let me just walk through each of those.","The first thing is, please keep in mind that the internal shift of our digital sports properties and the 2 international closures at Turner, Imagine, which I just mentioned, and TNT Turkey, will weigh on ad growth overall for the next few quarters. In addition, in the third quarter, scatter demand is a little slow right now and that's due to money being diverted to the Summer Olympics. And the third quarter is also going to be affected by the timing of the Major League Baseball playoffs, as well as our NASCAR lineup. So we expect to have fewer Major League Baseball playoff games in the third quarter and, due to the schedule, there'll be more MLB playoff games in the fourth quarter. That will help Q4 versus Q3. And also, we have the ALCS this year versus the NLCS, which we had last year. And historically, the ALCS has rated higher than the NLCS.","We also expect growth to be stronger in the fourth quarter as we'll benefit from additional NBA games on TNT, the 2012 presidential election, expectations of improved overall ratings at our other networks in general, some easier comparisons and the expectation of a much stronger scatter market once the Olympics are over.","Moving over to adjusted operating income, where it was up a pretty strong 9% in the quarter at the Networks group, with margins up around 100 basis points. In addition to revenue growth, the margin expansion reflected continued expense control. Non-programming expenses were essentially flat year-over-year, and programming expenses were up just 3%, and that's despite increased investments in original programming. So overall expenses were up low-single digits in the quarter. And as we look ahead, we anticipate that overall expense growth will remain under tight control. While we'll continue to aggressively increase our investment in original programming, we expect other components of our programming spending to rise more modestly and will continue to work hard to constrain growth in all non-programming expenses.","Before I move on, let me just take a moment to discuss the recently announced shutdown of TNT's TV operations in Turkey. This was a result of the same investment discipline that we demonstrated last quarter with respect to Imagine in India. But together, they accounted for approximately $160 million in charges on an unadjusted basis this quarter or $0.14 a share net of tax. In each case, when it became clear that we were not on a path to succeed, we moved quickly to shut our operations to enable management to focus even more on our strongest properties. And we've had great success in many international territories, and we continue to expect international networks to be a key driver of our long-term growth.","Let me turn now to our Film and TV segment. We knew, coming into the second quarter, that year-over-year comparisons here would be extremely challenging. Last year's second quarter benefited from the theatrical release of The Hangover 2 and the home entertainment release of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1. We also had 2 very successful video game title releases without comparable titles this year. In addition, 2 of this year's releases, Rock of Ages and Dark Shadows, performed well below our expectations.","Having said that, we had a very strong quarter in our television business. TV revenue was up more than 20% year-over-year to more than $1 billion, and operating income was up double digits. And that's the seventh time in the last 8 quarters where we had double-digit growth in TV. So that continues to be a very, very strong business for us, and this quarter's results were driven by the cable syndication sale of The Mentalist and mid-teens growth in revenue from initial telecasts on broadcast and cable. And as Jeff mentioned, our future syndication pipeline got even stronger with the sales of 2 Broke Girls and Mike & Molly. We're also seeing strong demand from SVOD services and that's evidenced by recent new agreements with Netflix and Amazon Prime. So we've now signed deals that bring in almost $250 million in revenue this year alone, and we remain in active discussions with all major SVOD services about additional content packages.","All of that helped our backlog reach a record $5.9 billion this quarter. Backlog, as a reminder, is the unrecognized cash licensing revenue for television and theatrical product that will be recognized in the future. So given that we've reached record levels, that obviously gives us great confidence about the long-term growth prospects for the TV business.","Looking ahead at Warner's to the second half of 2012, we're off to a really great start with the performance of Dark Knight Rises, and we remain optimistic about the performance of our theatrical slate, including releases such as Argo in October and The Hobbit in December. It will also benefit from the continued strong theatrical performance of Magic Mike, which recently crossed the $100 million market at the domestic box office. Just keep in mind that in the third quarter of last year, we had both the theatrical release of the final Harry Potter movie and the syndication of The Big Bang Theory. So as we mentioned to you last quarter, the profit comparisons are more difficult here at the studio in the third quarter versus the fourth. We expect a very strong fourth quarter.","Moving over to Publishing, where difficult industry conditions were joined by tough comparisons this quarter. Last year's second quarter was the only quarter of the year where revenues were actually up, and that was due in part to some strong special issues. Operating income declined over 40% in the quarter, as a 2% reduction expenses were not sufficient to offset the revenue declines. And looking ahead, the environment here remains challenging, both in advertising and at the newsstand. However, as a result of additional cost measures that have already started to be implemented, expenses should continue to decline year-over-year in both the third and fourth quarters, and the comparisons also get easier here in the second half. So we fully expect to see an improvement in adjusted operating income trends beginning in the third quarter.","Let me move on now to talk about free cash flow. Year-to-date, we generated about $520 million in free cash, which is similar to the year-ago period, as higher cash taxes and higher interest expenses were offset in part by lower working capital uses. Let me provide a little bit more context around those figures. As we've discussed with you before, our conversion levels of OIBDA, or operating income before depreciation and amortization, into free cash flow last year and this year are somewhat below historical levels. But we fully expect those conversion percentages to begin to increase next year.","And it's important to look at the key drivers. Over the last few years, our cash taxes have moved to become closer to what the book tax numbers represent, and that's because we've utilized most of our tax attributes. In addition, cash interest costs have risen, in part to fund our share repurchases. Our working capital usage has also risen in the last few years. But unlike cash taxes and interest costs, this should reverse in time. Most of the working capital usage has occurred at Warner Bros. and it's tied to the timing of theatrical production spending and syndication availabilities.","For example, in certain instances, we have been funding the entire production of less than wholly owned films such as The Hobbit and the Pacific Rim, and we recognized the initial sale of The Big Bang Theory in syndication. As those films are released, and as our syndication partners make cash payments over the life of the contract, these working capital figures will turn around and the cash will flow back to us. And as a result, we expect our working capital needs to decline in future years and our conversion should improve.","So let me look at the final slide now, which focuses on our net debt. We ended the second quarter with a little less than $17.5 billion in net debt. That's up about $1.4 billion compared to the end of last year. And that's due to our continued returns to shareholders. During the first half of the year, we returned $1.8 billion, which included around $1.3 billion in share repurchases. Year-to-date, we've also spent a little bit less than $300 million on M&A activities. This was primarily related to a transaction through which we've recently increased our stake in Central European Media Enterprises, or CME, to nearly 50%.","So to help maintain strong liquidity and balance sheet flexibility, we also recently issued $1 billion in long-term debt, and we were able to do that at very, very attractive interest rates. Our leverage ratio increased at the end of the quarter to around 2.6x, which is essentially right in line with our long-term target of 2.5x. So we remain pleased with the progress that we're making on our capital plan and our capital allocation so far this year.","And with that, now let me turn the call back over to Doug and we can begin the Q&A portion of the call. Thanks. Doug?","Douglas Shapiro","All right. Thanks, John. Donna, let's get the Q&A started. [Operator Instructions].","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Michael Nathanson from Nomura.","Michael Nathanson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","I have 2 quick ones, Doug. One is, just following up on Jeff's comments on the double-digit affiliate growth at Turner, is that on a contract-by-contract basis? Or are you seeing that's going to be the reported growth on the P&L? So just a clarity on what you meant by that.","John K. Martin","Michael, it's John. Let me take that. The comment was meant to indicate that -- well, just to take a half step back. Jeff just wanted to remind everybody that our affiliate renewal rate cycle really is about to begin in force sometime mid-next year. And so to try to clarify and provide a little bit more concreteness with respect to expectations from the beginning of the affiliate rate renewal cycle till the end of the affiliate rate renewal cycle, which is the end of '16, our expectations are to achieve double-digit domestic affiliate revenue increases, subscription revenue increases. And so just to give you a sense, if you look at the cable networks line, which is Turner and HBO, that the comments that Jeff made were specific to Turner. So double-digit at Turner. HBO, continue to have expectations of rate going up mid-single digits. As Jeff said, hopefully, we're going to get some unit increases there as well. And then -- and just to give you a sense, at Turner, domestic affiliate revenues are about 80% of the total, so 20% of that is international. So hopefully, that provides a little more clarity.","Michael Nathanson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay, cool. And then the other is a follow-up question, I'll be quick, is just you gave us the $250 million of SVOD money this year. Any sense of where that was last year? So what's the year-over-year change for you guys' SVOD money versus the $250 million this year?","Jeffrey L. Bewkes","I don't know.","John K. Martin","Yes, I don't -- so the $250 million of this year is essentially a full year figure of those deals that we've already got inked. So we'd be hopeful that, that number is actually even going up from those levels, but just wanted to at least give you a sense of where we were to date. We booked year-to-date this year approximately $100 million of that, and last year's full year figure for SVOD was less than $250 million, somewhere around $225 million. Those are the consolidated revenue figures for SVOD. Those do not include the revenues recorded by the CW. We expect revenues recorded by the CW to be somewhere around $80 million, $85 million this year. So just as a reminder, we own 50% of that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Spencer Wang from Credit Suisse.","Spencer Wang - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","A 2-part question on cable networks, one for Jeff and one for John. First, for Jeff, you mentioned that the ratings softness at CNN and news, I know there was some management changes that have been going on there. Can you just talk a little bit about what the strategy is to reinvigorate ratings at CNN? And secondly, for John, in terms of the ad growth in the fourth quarter from an acceleration standpoint, if you had high-single-digit CPM increases in the upfront, plus the benefit from the NBA coming back, is it possible that ad growth is double digits in the fourth quarter?","Jeffrey L. Bewkes","Spencer, I'll start with CNN. I think, as we all know, it's a great brand. It's got the biggest reach in the news category, and it's very strong overseas. The biggest reach is domestic. And very strong in online. Having said that, obviously, we're not satisfied with the ratings. They do fluctuate with the news cycle, but we're going to do a better job putting on programming that will hold viewers. We've got more people coming. They're not staying as long as we would like. And so we think there's very strong demand. If you ask where we're aiming, how do we plan to do that: strong demand for objective, comprehensive, nonpartisan coverage, really covering all the partisan views as well. But we need to do it in a very compelling, more engaging way than we've been doing of late. And so that's really what we're going to focus on next.","John K. Martin","Spence, it's John. So let me talk about fourth quarter. I think I would say it's too early to tell right now. And let me just give you a few of the things. I mean, I went through them in my proactive remarks. We clearly expect to benefit from the strong upfront results that we had. We're going to benefit from some of the sports timing shifts. We expect to have improved ratings overall, and we have some easier comparisons. And all of that should really drive much, much better advertising revenue growth. Some things to just bear in mind from a reported standpoint though is just, obviously, we're in a situation now where FX translation is a headwind for us. It was a couple hundred basis points of -- well is was actually, for international, it was about 500 basis points of negative growth there in the quarter. And again, that can be fairly volatile and move around, so we don't know exactly where that's going to shake out. And we also have the -- because of the shutdown in Turkey and Imagine, that was -- in terms of advertising revenue, that was about $30 million in the second half of last year that we're going have to comp against. So that's -- again, that's -- we don't have the ad revenues, but we're going to have improved profitability by virtue of not having those networks operating. So yes, I think it's a little too early to predict with a certainty level of specificity, but we feel much better about the advertising trends going into the fourth quarter and, frankly, as we progress into 2013.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Morris from Davenport.","Michael C. Morris - Davenport & Company, LLC, Research Division","I just wanted to follow up maybe a little more detail, first of all, on the double-digit outlook for your affiliate growth from 2014 and beyond. Can you maybe split for us a little bit? You have historically talked about the profitability of the NCAA contract and so I'm assuming, and we've analyzed this, that most of those affiliate fee increases will come at TBS, TNT and tru, and that those could be in the mid- to high-teens range. Can you help -- number one, is that where those affiliate increases are primarily coming through? And second of all, how does news factor in? I mean, there is some concern, given the ratings, that maybe you're in a weaker position there as you go into those negotiations. How do you view the potential for news affiliate fee increases?","Jeffrey L. Bewkes","I'll start, Mike. The affiliate subscriber revenue increases will come across all the networks. I think that the premise of what you were just saying about news isn't right. I think there's tremendous upside on the news side. We think, because of the strength of all of our networks and the fact that we are the company that has more networks in the top 10, the top 40 than any other network company, we don't really have any weak networks. But that supports the ability of the networks to increase subscriber revenues the way that we've said. On your specific point on the NCAA, which is carried on the 3 networks, TBS, TNT and tru, yes, there's -- that will support pretty strong revenue increases on those, and I think the -- what you were putting -- I don't want to really be too specific about it, but the increase you were talking about is too low.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ben Swinburne from Morgan Stanley.","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just sticking on the Networks business. John, could you help us just size up HBO versus Turner? And you mentioned international and domestic, but it seems like if the businesses are relatively similar in size on a subscription front, if you get double digits on Turner, you're going to be pretty close to double digits overall since international, I think, is a pretty nice growth story for you guys as well. Maybe you're very high single sort of '14, '15 and '16. I just wanted to see if you could give us a little more help on the base on that front.","John K. Martin","I'm going to apologize in advance. I think I've given you guys enough help and you can size the specific pieces of the business. And just to repeat, I mean, we clearly expect affiliate fee growth domestically to be faster at Turner over time than HBO. But HBO, we would expect -- because of the characteristics that Jeff described a little bit earlier, we would be hopeful and we would anticipate somewhat of an acceleration of subscription revenue growth there as well once we start seeing the full impact of the improvements that we've made to the service and we start getting some domestic uplift.","Jeffrey L. Bewkes","In terms of volume, domestically and international on top of the rate increase.","John K. Martin","Yes. Remember, HBO's international operations, which in aggregate represent about the same percentage as Turner's, it's about 20% of the revenues. But it's a little bit different in the sense that a portion of HBO's less than wholly owned JVs are in their consolidated figures, while a portion of them are accounted for below operating income, but are in pretax income. Suffice to say, that the HBO international operations have been growing much more quickly than the domestic operations, and we would anticipate that to continue as well.","Operator","Our next question comes from Doug Mitchelson from Deutsche Bank.","Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","A few questions as well. The first, sort of a clarification on the clarification. So I just want to make sure on the language. Between 2013 and 2016, really means 2014, '15, '16 we'd see double digit. And as part of that, what percentage of distribution do you already have sort of under your belt that gives you that kind of visibility on price? That's sort of the first area of questions.","John K. Martin","Just from a -- I'll just take the mechanics of it. The answer is yes to your question. Our -- since the renewal cycle doesn't begin until next year, our rates for next year are essentially locked from a pricing standpoint. So it would mean '14, '15 and '16. And we're not going to go into any detail as to percentage of who we've done deals with and so on and so forth. We have an NDA surrounding all of those agreements.","Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And then second question, on international, given the shutdown of Turkey and previously India, has your outlook for international profitability at Turner changed at all? And if you could remind us where 2011 came out for international EBIT and where you had said that would go over time, that would be helpful.","Jeffrey L. Bewkes","You want to get that?","John K. Martin","Yes, the numbers -- our outlook really hasn't changed all that much for a few reasons. The first is, we had anticipated, coming into this year, a pretty dramatic improvement in the results in each of India and Turkey. And part of the reason why we made the decision that we did is, it was pretty clear early on this year that we weren't going to be anywhere close to what we thought we could achieve. The other thing which is weighing down, again, the reported figures is FX, where we've definitely got a more negative situation in terms of currency translation as compared to what we had thought coming into the year. In terms of international operations in general, let me broaden it out and just repeat what we've said in the past because we still think we're very much on track. Two years ago, we had EBIT, or operating income, of about $500 million internationally in total in our networks. Last year, that grew to $650 million. And we would anticipate that growing to about $1 billion by the end of '14, and we still feel like we're very much on track.","Operator","Our next question comes from Richard Greenfield from BTIG.","Richard Greenfield - BTIG, LLC, Research Division","A couple of questions. First, Turner was -- has long been seen as kind of a visionary in getting out early in the cable network industry as it was kicking off. And I was curious, as you start to see YouTube evolving as a platform, how do you think about staking out territory there? And how do you want to be positioned vis-\u00e0-vis YouTube? And then two, on Google Fiber, you're not currently participating. Could you just discuss why you're not currently part of the channel package that they're offering? It would just seem to me that the array of virtual or over-the-top MVP -- D players that are coming to the market would improve your leverage with kind of the Comcasts and FiOSs of the world.  Why wouldn't you want to have more distributors over the course of the next 12 or 18 months?","Jeffrey L. Bewkes","Okay. Thanks, Rich. Let's start with YouTube. I think that's a good premise you have. We're paying very close attention to all the alternative platforms, including YouTube. And we've worked closely with YouTube, mostly as a promotional vehicle. If you look at most of our networks, you're going to find a branded environment for our networks on YouTube. And as YouTube shifts to offer more professionally produced content, we'll look to use that to support our existing networks, possibly to launch some new businesses. But remember, our existing content, mostly exclusive content on Turner and HBO, is available to all subscribers and viewers on demand on broadband already. So we think it's great, the extent to which those can have a presence on YouTube to drive viewership on our networks, but that's basically how we look at it at this point. And we're going to watch it closely. And we're in pretty close communication with YouTube to try to understand how we can work together. On Google's facilities-based service, we're in pretty good discussions with them and are optimistic we'll be able to reach a deal. We're very supportive of companies like, in this case, Google, who is investing to make the infrastructure more robust. And I think the one thing I would say about your question, which we all ought to clarify, it's really important to distinguish infrastructure, consumer distribution, more competition, better quality, more choice for consumers, which Google Fiber does. That is not over-the-top, that's not virtual MSOs. That -- those things don't provide quality, they don't provide infrastructure, they don't improve the consumer experience. So we applaud Google for doing that. We're going to continue to see which ways we can work with them. And I think that you ought to be optimistic that we're going to see -- probably, we're going to be able to help them and they'll be able to help us.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jessica Reif Cohen from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Jessica Reif Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I have 2 topics. One, if you -- on the -- can you talk what the underlying Publishing advertising was if you pull out the addition of SI.com and Golf.com? And on Publishing in general, I know you've been asked over the years why keep it. And can you just give us your current thoughts on that? And then the second topic is, the buyback slowed down a bit. Is this the pace that we should expect in the second half?","Jeffrey L. Bewkes","Okay. I'll start with Publishing. Publishing is a strong content business. While the industry is having certainly headwinds in advertising and a little bit of softness during this recession now in readership, it's not been, on the readership side, anything like what's happened in newspapers and things like that. And so as you look at our Publishing titles, which, in most cases, are gaining shares, and as you look at those titles, think of People, In Style, Real Simple, Sports Illustrated, becoming very vibrant on tablets with much more depth of articles and pictures, moving pictures which means video, it's way too reductive to just think that \"Publishing has a constrained future.\" So we think it can grow again, and we think that our publishing company can lead both the evolution and the share gains. When you get to specific advertising questions, I'm going to turn it over to John.","John K. Martin","Yes, sure. Thanks for the question, Jessica. So let me be a little bit more clear. Second quarter reported ad revenue declined at Time Inc. 7%. The impact of the transfer of SI.com, Golf.com, was about 200 basis points of improvement to Time Inc.'s reported ad growth. So it otherwise would've been down 9%. And that was largely driven by around 8% domestic magazine advertising declines which were pretty broad based. International declined about 4%, and digital was essentially flat for the quarter. So looking into the third quarter, we're seeing fairly consistent advertising trends, maybe a little bit of improved results, digital so far. And we're hoping to get some better results from our non-magazine properties, which were also down in Q2.","Jeffrey L. Bewkes","On cap -- you had a capital question?","John K. Martin","Yes, on the buyback, we -- year-to-date, our pace through the first half of the year is probably a good indication of what we're likely to do for the rest of this year, because we're really being governed now largely by a combination of earnings growth, free cash flow generation, all within the construct of our balance sheet management and we're right sitting on top of our long-term target ratio of net debt to EBITDA of about 2.5x.","Operator","Our next question comes from Alexia Quadrani from JPMorgan.","Alexia S. Quadrani - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just 2 questions. One, you mentioned the scatter slowing a bit in the third quarter. I guess, can you give us any color about how significant that slowdown is? And is it consistent with what you've seen in the past Olympics? And then just a second question, sort of clarifying your comments on the international outlook or the headwind. I think, in the second quarter, you said that Imagine generated about $30 million ad revenues a year. Is Turkey notable as well? Or is that included in the $30 million revenue?","John K. Martin","The question on third quarter scatter and the impact of the Olympics, it's really hard, if not impossible, to exactly tell what the impact of the Olympics is. Although based on us being in the market, we will tell you that we have every reason to believe that it's been quite material in the third quarter. And we would anticipate that those dollars would be redirected in the fourth quarter. And right now, our view, which is optimistic but we think realistic, is that fourth quarter scatter could be quite strong. And then on your second question, on international, could you just repeat it quickly because I just want to make sure that I don't quote a wrong number.","Douglas Shapiro","Well I think she was asking -- she said that the Imagine impact was $30 million. How big is the Turkey impact?","John K. Martin","Oh, okay. So look -- I mean, in Q3, the combined impact for advertising is roughly $10 million, $11 million. Q4 is almost $20 million. Like I said, it's about -- full year is $60 million all-in, and that's just ad revenue.","Douglas Shapiro","Look, it's 100 to 200 basis points a quarter, is the way to think about it.","John K. Martin","Yes, yes.","Alexia S. Quadrani - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","For both assets?","John K. Martin","Correct, yes.","Douglas Shapiro","Yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from Marci Ryvicker from Wells Fargo Securities.","Marci Ryvicker - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Two questions. First, it feels like you don't get much credit from investors for your TV studio performance, given that it's combined with film. I know you break it out in your comments, but any thoughts about separating these into 2 distinct financial divisions so as to maybe unlock some of this value, at least in the eyes of investors? And then the second question is on Netflix. They did make some interesting comments about potentially partnering with HBO. I wouldn't expect this to be a near-term thing, but would this be a consideration at all in the future?","Jeffrey L. Bewkes","Okay, TV production, you're right to say that the TV production business is a very attractive and strong business for Time Warner and Warner Bros. We don't, at this point, think that it really makes sense to separate it and fragment reporting further than we already do. We have said we've made the TV production earnings and so forth very clear for years now. And it's a key part of why we're so consistent at Warner, why our cash flow performance is so good in relation to earnings and why we have such visibility in the studio business having strong earnings predictability going forward. And we do encourage, which I think is in your question, for everybody to always focus and think hard about the TV business when they -- and add to that the scale and the tent-pole strategy in our film business, which also allows us to be more stable, really to have consistently superior performance on earnings and cash flow than the other studios with whom we compete. On the Netflix side, look, we -- the press, particularly, goes running, gets very amplifying on anything we've said about Netflix. We've tried to be very constructive and stable over the last 3 years, saying that we thought there was a good role for subscription video-on-demand. We've always said, because this company invented subscription video-on-demand, it's called HBO, and HBO was the first one to go on-demand, both on televisions and now, it's widely available on broadband, HBO. And it's doing really well. And I think Reed Hastings has been very complimentary at certain times about how -- the high regard they have for HBO. And I think we've been complimentary of them in terms of the great work they've done in both the strength of the interface that they've created and the fact that we've proved that people love on-demand programming. That's been the point we've been trying to make to everyone, not just about HBO GO, but about TNT go, CNN on-demand and so forth. And so given the -- all of that, there are not talks going on now between HBO and Netflix because they certainly -- just like all subscription VOD services, HBO, Showtime, Netflix, Amazon Prime, they all compete. And that's probably the primary way that they have a relationship is as competitors. But as you know, in the television and media business, sometimes there are ways for other relationships to emerge over time. Not now, but we'll see in the future.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jason Bazinet from Citi Investment.","Jason B. Bazinet - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Yes, I just had a question on HBO GO. Wondering if you could just sort of help us think about how to potentially size the upside to the subscribers if this works? Is it reasonable to assume, over the course of history, that sort of HBO subs have been flat to nominally growing and churn has sort of run in that 4% to 5% range per month? Is that sort of a reasonable proxy?","Jeffrey L. Bewkes","Yes, that has been the general state of subscription services. If you're asking what's the upside from this, which I think you're right to ask about, we're very pleased with the user data and the satisfaction levels because, if the subscribers really value something, we've seen this with multiplex and video-on-demand, now HBO GO on broadband, what will happen is the subscription levels will go up because either churn will moderate, you'll get more people using it because it's more useful for them, they can be more engaged with the programming. Let me give you a few examples of that. Registered accounts for HBO GO are up 50% since the end of 2011. Monthly plays have increased over 150%, and average monthly usage of the service and HBO programming is increasing. It's really a function of the device rollout, particularly the Xbox 360, which just came on, but we think all devices will be hooked up to it in a way that's easier for people to use. So while it's a little early to discern the impact, all those things are positive. They lead to more engagement and utility for a viewer, therefore, they keep the service. And that's not just in the United States. We've now got that rolling out in all the HBO overseas territories. And I think, as we have noted, we also have -- we're selling HBO programming, and it does really well, in 200 countries where there is no HBO service. So the opportunities for HBO there to sell either maybe an unauthenticated broadband-delivered VOD service remain as upside.","Operator","Our next question comes from Anthony DiClemente from Barclays.","Anthony J. DiClemente - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I just wanted to follow up on that last comment. Jeff, I'm wondering if there's any catalyst for an unauthenticated distribution of HBO GO here in the United States? I guess, in the quarter, these online fan campaigns have begun to pop up, HBO fans asking for HBO GO as a stand-alone service. It sounds like this is -- HBO GO is, in some ways, a victim of its own success. And that's why your customers, according to these campaigns, really want HBO GO stand-alone. They say they'd be willing to pay a lot for it as a stand-alone service. I'm just wondering if you can give us an update on how Bill Nelson and his team are thinking about that?","Jeffrey L. Bewkes","Yes. Well, we, as you of course imagine, we know all of that. And we have the ability to do it. And we will do that if we thought it was in our economic best interest. But right now, we don't think that it is. We have a very good relationship with our distributors. They're in the midst of making HBO GO available in an easy, seamless, high-quality way, which everybody forgets. The broadband infrastructure would have a little difficulty doing that in a consistent way that brings the quality that HBO requires. So right now, the other thing -- I think the mistake everybody makes when they think about that is that there aren't that many homes with broadband and no multichannel TV. So the issue really is, it's not that people want to knock out multichannel TV and have HBO. Most -- it's a question that -- most people have multichannel TV, and there's tens of millions of homes with multichannel TV and they will keep multichannel TV and they aren't currently subscribing to HBO. That's the opportunity. And that gets into a question of -- all those people are hooked up to our distributors, and it's a question of how to have that distribution plans market HBO in a more attractive way. So it's easier for people to hook up and they don't have to, for example, buy things that perhaps they don't want to buy. But the whole idea that there's a lot of people out there that want to drop multichannel TV and just have a Netflix or an HBO, that's not right. Look for the data, you won't find them.","John K. Martin","Anthony, do you have a follow-up? We lost you.","Operator","Our last question comes from John Janedis from UBS.","John Janedis - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Jeff, you mentioned the Cartoon Network and Nick in your prepared remarks. Can you talk about what you saw in the kids upfront? And have you made any changes at Cartoon in an effort to drive share this year?","Jeffrey L. Bewkes","Yes, we had solid prices in the kids upfront. We're able to take advantage of our ratings growth. News pricing was continuing to trend up in contrast, but the volume was much lighter. So we think that the success of Cartoon lately, and let's not forget the tremendous success of Adult Swim, which is on the channel at night that Cartoon occupies, is a really strong driver for us of advertising. And as -- to get back to the affiliate revenue side, we basically have tremendous upside in the subscriber revenue side of Cartoon Network and Adult Swim.","Douglas Shapiro","Okay, and with that, I think we'll cut it off. And thanks, everybody, for listening in."],"20147":["Time Warner, Inc (NYSE:TWX) Q4 2014 Earnings Conference Call February 11, 2015 10:30 AM ET","Executives","Michael Kopelman - SVP, IR","Jeff Bewkes - CEO","Howard Averill - CFO","John Martin - Chairman & CEO","Kevin Tsujihara - Chairman & CEO","Richard Plepler - Chairman & CEO","Analysts","Doug Mitchelson - UBS","John Janedis - Jefferies","David Bank - RBC Capital Markets","Alexia Quadrani - JPMorgan","Jessica Reif Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Rich Greenfield - BTIG","Operator","Welcome to the Time Warner Inc. Fourth Quarter 2014 Earnings Call. My name is Joe and I will be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Michael Kopelman, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Kopelman, you may begin.","Michael Kopelman","Thanks and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Time Warner's fourth quarter and full year earnings conference call. This morning we issued two press releases, one detailing our results for the fourth quarter and full year and the other providing our 2015 full year business outlook. Before we begin, there are two items I need to cover.","First, we refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Schedules setting out reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our earnings release and trending schedules. These reconciliations are available on our website at www.timewarner.com\/investors. Reconciliations of our expected future financial performance are also included in the business outlook release that is available on our website.","Second, today's announcement includes certain forward-looking statements which are based on management's current expectations. Actual results may vary materially from those expressed or implied by these statements due to various factors. These factors are discussed in detail in Time Warner's SEC filings including its most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q.","Time Warner is under no obligation and in fact expressly disclaims any obligation to update or alter its forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.","I will now turn the call over to Jeff Bewkes, Time Warner's Chairman and CEO, who will be followed by Howard Averill, Time Warner's CFO. After their prepared remarks, our divisional CEOs, John Martin, Richard Plepler and Kevin Tsujihara will join us for a Q&A session. Jeff?","Jeff Bewkes","Thanks, Mike and thanks for listening in this morning. 2014 was another year of strong financial performance for our company with solid revenue growth and 18% growth in adjusted EPS. That's our sixth straight year of at least high-teens adjusted EPS growth and it's consistent with our plan to reach close to $6 in adjusted EPS in 2016 and over $8 in 2018.","We also grew free cash flow by 12% to $3.5 billion and we returned more than $6.6 billion to shareholders through buybacks and dividends and as we announced this morning, we anticipate another year of very good growth in adjusted EPS in 2015. We're also committed to building on our strong record of providing direct returns to shareholders which have totaled more than $26 billion since 2008. You can see evidence of this commitment in the 10% increase in our dividend approved by our Board. That is also the sixth straight year we have raised the dividend by double digits.","So we expect another great year in 2015 and that is in the context of an industry where, like all of you, we see the pace of change accelerating. Consumers' appetite for high-quality video content is increasing globally, but we're in the midst of a secular shift to on-demand consumption. At the same time, advertisers' expectations for data analytics and targeting are also increasing.","These changes create new challenges for our industry, but we think they are also creating big opportunities for the producers of the very best video content. In fact, we've spent the last several years positioning ourselves to take advantage of these trends. In 2014, we've completed our transformation into a more focused, nimble and collaborative video content company that takes better advantage of our leading brands and our global scale at Warner Bros., Turner and HBO.","We also finished the transition to a new generation of CEOs at each of our divisions and we continued to invest even more in the very best content. In 2014 we invested $14.5 billion in programming, production and marketing. That's up about $3 billion compared to just five years earlier and we expect that to grow to around $19 billion a year over the next several years.","That investment is going into increased original programming at HBO and Turner, into high-profile sports like the NBA, NCAA March madness and major league baseball; and also into the biggest film and TV franchises at Warners. And those investments will continue to pay dividends in the years to come as the demand for high-quality on-demand video content grows.","We also continue to invest resources in improving the user experience in order to increase the value we're providing to our distribution partners and to consumers of multichannel television. Last year we launched CNNgo, the most advanced multiplatform news product on the market. We expanded HBO GO to additional platforms including Amazon Fire, PS3 and Xbox One and we started to make stacking rights available for some of our biggest hits at Turner.","At the same time, we're increasingly investing outside the traditional TV ecosystem to help ensure that consumers can access our great content wherever, whenever and on whatever device they choose, even if they don't have a conventional multichannel TV subscription. The most notable example is our HBO OTT service which we're on track to launch later this year. We think there is a big opportunity for us to reach broadband-only consumers and to reduce the friction of subscribing to HBO for multichannel subs that don't currently have the service.","We look forward to sharing more details about the service closer to launch, but HBO's OTT product is only one element of our digital strategy. At Turner, CNN Digital grew both average monthly video streams and mobile uniques by more than 30% in 2014. And Turner's Bleacher Report averaged 39 million monthly unique visitors, becoming the number two digital sports destination in the U.S.","We have carried that momentum into 2015. All five of Turner's most important networks were included in Dish's Sling TV service, making up more than a third of the channels at launch. CNN and Bleacher Report were two of Snapchat's launch partners for its Discover feature. And last month Warners announced that it will be launching an SVOD service in Southeast Asia in partnership with SingTel and Sony Pictures Television. That is another opportunity for Warners to use new distribution platforms to grow its business in Asia, where it already has a significant stake in Hollywood VIP. That is a rapidly-growing SVOD service in China which recently expanded its content offering to include HBO programming.","You will also see us investing in our advertising business by rolling out advanced products that provide advertisers with the analytics and targeting they are coming to expect. We started that process last year when we began selling based on consumer behavior rather than just the traditional age and gender demographics. This year we're going to take that one step further.","For the first time, we will have one joint upfront for all of our networks and we'll provide our best partners the ability to buy behavior-based inventory across all of our networks and digital platforms. We started talking to our partners about this at CES last month and the response has been overwhelmingly positive. Combining the reach and quality environment of TV with the analytics in targeting digital is the holy-grail for advertisers and if we do that successfully, we think we can take share back from digital competitors over time.","So clearly, there is a lot of change occurring in our industry, but we're more confident than ever in our position. That confidence stems from our belief that the very best video content is becoming more valuable to both consumers and to our advertising and distribution partners. We produce more of that great content than anybody which was evident once again in 2014.","It is awards season, so let's start there. We received 13 Academy Award nominations this year including a best picture nomination for American Sniper. In true Warner Bros. fashion, this film has been both a commercial and a critical success. After opening in select theaters on Christmas Day, it shattered records when it went wide last month including the biggest January opening ever.","Last year we also released the Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies which was the final installment of the epic trilogy by Peter Jackson. Through last week, the movie had brought in well over $900 million at the global box office and that brings the total for The Lord of the Rings franchise to close to $6 billion. That gives Warners two of the top four global film franchises in history including the biggest ever in Harry Potter.","No one manages film franchises better than Warners and they are at the core of its film strategy going forward. Warners has laid out the most ambitious slate in its history which starting in 2016 will be built around DC Comics, LEGO and the world of Harry Potter. And we couldn't be more excited and confident in the opportunity it has, not only to drive growth at the box office, but also to significantly expand its ancillary business.","None of that should overshadow Warners' continued leadership in television production. Warners has more than 60 series airing for the 2014 to 2015 season including the most primetime series on broadcast of any studio for the 11th time in the past 12 seasons. This season was particularly notable for Warners mining of the DC library which gave rise to two of this year's bona fide new hits, Gotham and The Flash and The Flash is just one of three DC shows on the CW with their presence helping the CW to broaden its audience and grow its ratings this season.","DC is also a major driver of our games business including last year's release of LEGO Batman 3. That will continue in 2015 with the highly anticipated release of the final installment of the Batman: Arkham trilogy. Along with the release of Mortal Kombat X and a new mobile game based on Game of Thrones, that should propel Warners' give business to a record year in 2015.","Now going back for a moment to the multiplex, last week HBO concluded a limited IMAX run for two episodes of its monster hit, Game of Thrones. That is HBO's most-watched series ever. It was the first television show to ever screen in an IMAX theater and that is a testament to the anticipation for Thrones' upcoming fifth season as well as to HBO's creative excellence.","Last year HBO received 19 Primetime Emmys including five for True Detective, its most-watched freshman series ever and HBO's content superiority translated into close to 3 million additional domestic subscribers that is its highest growth in domestic subs in over three decades.","In 2015, HBO plans to raise its game again with returning hits like True Detective, Veep, Silicon Valley, The Leftovers and Last Week Tonight with John Oliver. As well as adding several new series like Westworld which is the second HBO drama produced by Warner Bros. and The Brick, a comedy series starring Tim Robbins and Jack Black and Ballers, starring Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson.","As we start this year we also have a lot of momentum at Turner. In 2014, TBS, TNT and Adult Swim claimed three of the top 10 spots in primetime among adults 18 to 49. TBS was the number two ad-supported cable network in prime time among adults 18 to 49 and 25 to 54. And TNT was home to six of the top 15 original series on ad-supported cable that is more than any other network and that included three new hits in The Last Ship, The Librarians and Murder in the First. That is strong evidence that its emphasis on more distinctive original programming is starting to work.","2014 was also an important year for our sports business with Turner extending its partnership with the NBA through 2025 and kicking off its new agreement with Major League Baseball. We dipped our toe into the water with sports internationally by obtaining the UEFA Champions League rights in Brazil which will cement the must-have status of our recently acquired sports network, Esporte Interativo.","Adult Swim continued to attract the largest audiences of young adults including the top two new shows among adults 18 to 34, Attack on Titan and Black Jesus. That is the type of programming that helped Adult Swim to be ranked as the number one ad-supported cable network in total day among adults 18 to 24 and 18 to 34 for the 10th consecutive year, as well as being the number one ad-supported table network in total day among adults 18 to 49.","And the network it shares a channel with Cartoon Network, is on an absolute roll. In a year where most kids networks were down double digits, Cartoon grew its audience from kids 6 to 11 and we gained momentum through the year. In the fourth quarter, Cartoon grew ratings in its key demos by solid double digits and that is a trend that has continued into the first quarter of this year. Despite these successes, we know we can do better, in particular at TBS and TNT and we're confident that with new leadership in place and a focus on distinctive original programming, we will do better. The success of CNN is a great example of how the right management and the right programming strategy can drive growth, even in the face of challenging industry trends.","In 2014, CNN grew its primetime rating in adults 25 to 54, while MSNBC registered double-digit declines and CNN had an average total day monthly reach of almost 77 million total viewers, the largest cumulative audience of any cable news network. CNN took share by going deeper on the biggest stores, revamping key day-parts like morning and expanding its innovative lineup of original primetime series based around talent like Anthony Bourdain, Morgan Spurlock, Lisa Ling and Mike Rowe.","Its original programming also helped CNN draw by far the youngest median primetime audience among its cable news rivals and match its youngest on record. CNN's strong performance has continued into 2015 with its ratings in adults 25 to 54 up 70% in January, compared to double-digit declines for MSNBC. And CNN will look to build on that success by further expanding its lineup of originals this year.","Developing a robust slate of must-have programming is a process that takes time but that is one of the things our company does best and we're confident in the team at Turner, their strategy and their ability to drive increased viewership across platforms as they execute on the plans they are putting in place.","Before I turn it over to Howard, I want to emphasize that we have a lot of confidence in our ability to execute on the ambitious strategy and growth plans we shared with you last October. We're proud of our track record of industry-leading adjusted EPS growth and shareholder returns over the past five or six years.","But 2015 is really our first full year as the new Time Warner and we're just getting underway. We're mindful of the challenges ahead of us, but we've done a lot of work to get to the right structure, the right management and the right strategy so that we're positioned to lead the industry and continue to deliver superior value to our shareholders.","With that, let me turn it over to Howard.","Howard Averill","Thanks, Jeff and good morning. I will begin by referring to the first slide of our presentation which is now available on our website. Starting with consolidated results, we're pleased with how we ended the year and the progress we're making on the long term targets we discussed at our investor day. As we look out over the next several years we continue to expect that solid revenue growth, attractive margin expansion and accelerating growth in adjusted OI will, on average, lead to high-teens growth in adjusted EPS.","In 2014, we delivered adjusted EPS growth of 18%, our sixth consecutive year of double-digit growth. That is in line with our updated guidance and exceeded the outlook we provided at the beginning of the year. As a reminder, adjusted EPS included a net benefit of $0.10 from the tax matters and programming, restructuring and severance charges that we previously discussed with you.","Including the additional restructuring and programming charges we took in the fourth quarter and net of intercompany eliminations, we incurred $469 million of restructuring and severance charges and $388 million of programming charges in the second half of 2014. We're expecting the restructuring actions to translate into run rate savings of close to $500 million, most of which will come in 2015. That will free up resources to invest even more in content and position us to accelerate our revenue growth in the coming years, while also continuing to expand margins.","Those actions were consistent with our ongoing focus on expense management, excluding programming, restructuring and severance charges from both periods, total expenses increased only 3% from the year, despite our continued investments in great content. And about 100 basis points of that growth was due to the international consolidations at HBO and Warners' acquisition of Eyeworks. Total SG&A declined slightly for the year.","We also had another strong year of cash flow which was up 12%. Free cash flow per share was up an even more impressive 19%, benefiting from our ongoing share repurchase program. In 2014 we repurchased $5.5 billion of our shares, a significant acceleration from the prior year. Combined with $1.1 billion in dividends, we returned $6.6 billion to shareholders during the year and as evidenced by the dividend increase we announced this morning, we remain committed to delivering significant direct returns to shareholders going forward.","So we had another good year of financial performance in 2014 and returned a substantial amount of capital to shareholders, while also making great progress in positioning the company for strong growth in the years to come.","I have one additional item to note regarding our 2014 results. One of our equity method investments is currently undergoing an international tax audit. If there are any material developments with this situation prior to the filing of our Form 10-K at the end of the month, we may be required to update our results to reflect their final 2014 earnings.","Moving on, this morning we provided our outlook for 2015. We anticipate another year of very attractive growth with adjusted EPS of $4.60 to $4.70 a share which implies mid-teens growth when excluding the $0.10 benefit to 2014 I noted earlier. So we expect good growth despite foreign currency swings that at current rates would result in a year-over-year drag of approximately $0.20 to $0.25 and we will do that as we continue to invest aggressively in content to position the company to accelerate revenue growth in 2016. I will provide additional context around our outlook as we go through the presentation.","Now turning to the segment highlights. I will begin at Turner, where we ended 2014 with a record fourth quarter for revenues and adjusted operating income. Just as important, we continued to make progress in positioning Turner to accelerate growth over the next several years and beyond.","Subscription revenues increased 5% for the quarter and 7% for the year and that included an FX headwind of close to 200 basis points in the quarter and approximately 100 basis points for the year. Without that international subscription revenue would have increased double digits for both periods due to continued positive trends in Latin America.","Domestic subscription revenue growth was in the mid-single-digits in the fourth quarter, but excluding the impact from our dispute with Dish, domestic subscription revenues would have increased in the high single digits, similar to our growth for the full year and that reflected the positive impact of our current domestic renewal cycle. We anticipate completing new deals with the remainder of our top 10 affiliates by the end of this year which should drive very attractive growth in our subscription revenue over the next several years.","Largely as a result of timing of those renewals and as we indicated to you in the past, we will not see the same benefit from domestic renewals in 2015 that we saw in 2014. At current rates we also expect headwinds of around 300 basis points from foreign currency movements including the move to the SICAD 2 rate in Venezuela. Taking into account those factors, we anticipate subscription revenue growth will slow materially this year before re-accelerating well into the double digits in 2016 and beyond.","Moving on, advertising revenues declined 1% in 4Q, similar to our expectations coming into the quarter, but were up 1% for the year. The fourth quarter included a drag of close to 500 basis points as a result of airing fewer Major League Baseball playoff games, foreign currency movements and the impact from Dish. Absent those, ad revenue would've grown in the quarter. Domestic advertising declined modestly in the quarter and that included a decline in domestic entertainment including young adults which was partly offset by healthy growth at news, where we continued to benefit from positive ratings momentum and very strong trends in our digital business. Excluding the impact of FX, international advertising increased on the high single digits with growth across all regions.","Looking to 2015, current rates imply about 200 basis point drag on advertising foreign currency movements including the move to the SICAD 2 rate in Venezuela. In the first quarter, we're seeing a modest improvement in the domestic environment. Scatter pricing is pacing up mid to high single digits over the upfront, while volume remains moderate. Putting all those factors together, we anticipate total advertising revenues to be about flat.","Excluding programming and restructuring charges in both periods, adjusted operating income would have grown modestly in the quarter and 5% for the year and without those same charges, programming expenses increased 2% in the quarter and 7% for the year. That reflects our ongoing investments in both sports and original programming which we expect will generate attractive returns over the next several years.","Looking through the charges I just discussed, we limited total expense growth to 4% in 2014 and that was a result of keeping SG&A costs flat, reflecting our commitment to tightly managing our non-programming expenses in order to direct additional resources to key programming. So in 2014 we continued to execute our plan at Turner and we feel we have laid the groundwork to expand margins and grow the business at very attractive rates over the next several years.","Turning to HBO, where we had another year of solid growth in both revenues and adjusted operating income, subscription revenues were up 5% in the quarter and 8% for the year. The consolidations of HBO Asia and HBO Nordic contributed about 300 basis points to the full year growth. As a reminder, we had fully lapped both consolidations before the start of the fourth quarter.","Domestically we had steady subscription revenue growth throughout the year. And as Jeff mentioned, HBO and Cinemax together added over 2.8 million domestic subscribers in 2014 that is the best domestic sub growth in over three decades. As we've previously discussed, most of these subscriber additions are non-revenue-generating. Still, we saw some improvement in the subscriber mix in 2014 which contributed to a modest acceleration in domestic subscription revenue growth and we expect a further acceleration in that growth over the next few years.","Turning to content and other revenues which increased 14% in the quarter and 24% for the year that was boosted by a record year in home video led by sales of season three of Game of Thrones. HBO's licensing deal with Amazon also contributed to the strong full year results. Across HBO's international operations including unconsolidated JVs, we increased revenues double digits in 2014 and that included growth in both our licensing and networks business. International subscriber trends also remained strong, growing double digits across most regions. Sub growth was especially strong in Latin America and Europe in 2014.","Adjusted operating income declined 5% in the quarter and that was largely due to the timing of theatrical expenses and investments in original programming which drove mid-teens growth in programming expenses. Marketing expenses were also higher in the quarter as we continued to invest in the brand.","For the full year, programming costs were up in the high single digits when excluding the international consolidations. To help fund that investment, HBO remains focused on constraining non-programming expenses and excluding the international consolidations, we limited SG&A growth to 1% in 2014.","Despite the drop in the fourth quarter and higher restructuring charges, adjusted operating income grew 7% for the year, so we had another year of solid growth and we continue the subscriber momentum we have had over the past few years, both domestically and internationally. Given the strong demand for the product globally, we feel very good about our ability to further accelerate growth over the next several years.","Now on to Warner Bros. where excluding restructuring and severance charges, 2014 would have been another record year for adjusted operating income. And we achieved that thanks to continued growth in the TV business and our focus on cost containment. 2014 also benefited from a patent license and settlement agreement.","On the TV side, revenues grew double digits in the fourth quarter capping off a great year. Internationally, Warners continues to benefit from the growing demand for high-quality TV content from both linear and SVOD buyers. We're also seeing growth in local production from Eyeworks acquisition we completed earlier in 2014 and domestically Warners remains the industry leader in primetime series produced for broadcast networks for the 2014-2015 TV Season. So the trends in TV production remain positive and we're confident we can continue to grow this business over the next several years.","Theatrically coming into the year we knew we had tough comps, especially in the fourth quarter and that played out as expected with revenue declining for both the quarter and the year. But we're off to a terrific start in 2015 with the success of American Sniper and longer-term we think we have the strongest slate in the history of the company, so overall we feel really good about the outlook for our theatrical business.","Across theatrical and TV, home entertainment revenue declined 12% for the year in part due to a softer slate. That was roughly in line with the overall market which was down 7% excluding SVOD, however we continued to see positive trends in digital across both theatrical and television product with electronic sell-through revenue up 40% for the year.","On the expense side, consistent with our companywide focus on efficiency, Warner continues to tightly manage overhead costs. Excluding restructuring and severance charges from both periods, total expenses increased less than 2% and SG&A was down 4% for the year. As we head into 2015 we will start to see the benefit from the restructuring actions taken in the fourth quarter which we expect to contribute to margin expansion over time.","So on the whole, Warners had a very good year and with our slate of franchise films starting in 2016 and the strong secular demand for high-quality TV content, we feel we're in a great position to grow Warners at attractive rates for the foreseeable future.","Turning to the next slide, we had another year of strong free cash flow generation, growing free cash flow 12% to $3.5 billion. As can see on the slide, we've broken out the programming, restructuring and severance charges incurred in the second half of 2014 which had a significant impact on adjusted operating income. Our cash taxes increased primarily due to lower foreign tax credits. Cash interest increased as a result of the additional debt we issued during the year and the improvement in working capital was primarily due to lower participations at Warner Bros.","Looking to 2015, keep in mind that we will have approximately $300 million of severance payments related to the restructuring actions we took this past year. In addition, we expect working capital to be a more significant use of cash, primarily due to the large syndication sales at Warners. All that aside, we still anticipate 2015 will be another healthy year for free cash flow generation and we expect to continue converting a very high percentage of our earning into free cash flow in the years to come.","Looking at our balance sheet, we ended 2014 with $19.9 billion of net debt, up $1.6 billion compared to the end of 2013 that is primarily a result of our continued commitment to direct returns to shareholders. As I mentioned at the start of my presentation, during 2014 we repurchased $5.5 billion in shares and, combined with our dividend, returned $6.6 billion in total to shareholders.","During the year we took advantage of favorable market conditions to strengthen our balance sheet by issuing $2 billion of long term debt at very favorable rates. On the M&A front we invested just under $1 billion in 2014. The majority of that was directed towards our financing arrangements with CME and our acquisition of Eyeworks' international television operations.","Due to the programming, restructuring and severance charges in the second half of the year, our net leverage ratio was around three times at the end of 2014. However, explain those charges, our net leverage ratio would have been 2.7 times, slightly below our target level.","One item to keep in mind in terms of our use of capital during the next few years will be the cash payments related to our real estate project at Hudson Yards. The majority of these payments will be recognized in investing activities including a few hundred million dollars in 2015.","On balance, I'm pleased with how we executed on our capital plan in 2014. And as we look ahead, neither our philosophy nor our processes around capital allocation have changed, so you can expect us to remain very disciplined and balanced in our approach to capital allocation.","We remain committed to maintaining our solid investment grade credit ratings and are comfortable with our net leverage target of 2.75 times. We continue to believe that target provides us the flexibly to invest in our businesses, engage in strategic M&A and provide direct returns to shareholders, while at the same time optimizing our cost of capital and providing strong access to the capital markets in a variety of macroeconomic scenarios.","With that, let's move on to the final slide which looks at our outlook for 2015. In 2015, we expect to deliver really attractive growth in adjusted operating income and another year of solid double-digit adjusted EPS growth and we expect that will be as a result of strong growth across all of our divisions.","Before getting into the details, please note that my comments will be based on 2014 results, excluding the programming, restructuring and severance charges taken in the second half of the year. At Turner we will benefit from around $200 million in savings from the restructuring efforts and more modest programming expense growth as our NASCAR deal ended in 2014. Those factors should translate into healthy margin expansion.","While we continue to see positive underlying trends internationally, the strong dollar and the exchange rate change in Venezuela will provide headwinds. Nonetheless, we anticipate a return to very healthy adjusted operating income growth which is evidence of our continued ability to manage our cost structure to drive attractive growth even in years with more modest top-line trends.","At HBO we continue to see strong demand for our services globally and that should result in continued solid subscription revenue growth. And along with disciplined expense management, we anticipate that we will drive a significant acceleration in adjusted operating income growth in 2015. As we've previously discussed, we plan to launch an over-the-top service domestically this year and will provide more color on those plans as we get closer to launching.","At Warner Bros., we anticipate revenue growth to be led by our TV syndication slate which includes 2 Broke Girls and Person of Interest. We also have a robust slate of video games anchored by key franchise releases, Batman: Arkham and Mortal Kombat, so we expect strong revenue growth combined with cost savings from the restructurings to translate into very attractive adjusted operating income growth and another record year at Warners.","Looking across all three segments, we're set up for a very good year from an operating perspective and that is despite an expected drag on adjusted operating income of approximately $250 million to $300 million as a result of the strengthening U.S. dollar and the exchange rate change in Venezuela. That impact will primarily show up at Turner and Warner Bros. and equates to approximately $0.20 to $0.25 at the adjusted EPS level which we have factored into our outlook.","It is also worth noting that intercompany eliminations will be a material drag this year due to increased content sales from Warner Bros. to HBO and Turner including the syndication sale of 2 Broke Girls. In addition, we started to recognize 100% of CME's losses in our equity income in the fourth quarter as a result of our accumulated net losses exceeding the book value of our common stock investments. For context, in 2014 this change would have resulted in an additional $0.05 negative impact to adjusted EPS.","In terms of cadence, we expect 2015 adjusted operating income and adjusted EPS to be heavily weighted towards the second half of the year given the timing of both syndication availabilities and this year's theatrical slate at Warner Bros. Putting all that together, we expect another very good year in 2015 which is reflected in our outlook for adjusted EPS of $4.60 to $4.70 or mid-teens growth, when excluding the second-half restructuring and programming charges and tax matters we noted earlier and that is despite the negative impact of foreign exchange that I just noted.","At the same time, our continued investments in high-quality video content and our industry-leading brands will position us for accelerating revenue growth in 2016. So we continue to expect high-teens adjusted EPS growth on average through 2018 and remain on track to hit the financial targets we shared with you at our investor day in October.","With that, I'll turn it back to Mike to start the Q&A.","Michael Kopelman","Thanks, Howard. Joe, can you open up the line for questions please?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. And our first question here comes from Doug Mitchelson from UBS. Please go ahead, sir.","Doug Mitchelson","One for Howard or John, one for Jeff. There has been a lot of focus on affiliate revenue growth for Turner Networks. I was hoping first, that Howard or John, you would help us know whether Turner domestic affiliate revenue is on track towards your initial budgets for pricing and subscriber levels or if those budgets have been shifting around as you saw 4Q results. And are you able to be more specific regarding the year-over-year domestic drivers for 4Q, the Dish impact and subscriber changes versus core pricing?","And for Jeff, you expressed a lot of confidence in achieving 2016 EPS guidance, but I think some investors are still uncertain with all the cross-currents right now for affiliate revenue. You've got Sling TV and cord cutting, cord shaving; the Dish outage in October. I'm just curious, how many of the top 10 renewals are left to be completed and what drives your confidence in hitting your 2016 and beyond affiliate revenue goals? Thanks very much.","Jeff Bewkes","It's Jeff, I'll start. Let me just begin by saying I am and we're all still confident in our '16 and '18 targets and let me go into some of the reasons and then John and Howard will pick up from there. We did see some sub declines last year in the basic cable universe and we have planned for modest declines to continue. And I think, as everyone knows, ad growth has been very muted, but we still see very strong consumer demand for multichannel TV and increasing viewing across all the platforms. And we think that TV and video remains the best platform for reaching a mass audience for advertisers.","We also see that multichannel revenues are all still growing at a healthy clip, so we think there is pretty good opportunity for continued growth. We're working closely with all our distributors to improve the consumer value proposition, that means more and more vibrant VOD offerings from all the networks.","It means providing stacking rights for original series; that would be another example where I think HBO has all its series up pretty much. Turner has all of its series up. And we think more SVOD -- more VOD and more and better user interfaces are going to make a difference in all of the retention, basically, of multichannel TV. We're also moving aggressively to provide advertisers with the analytics and targeting that they are coming to expect. And we think that as we do that more successfully we're going to take back share from digital competitors over time.","Beyond the traditional ecosystem, we think there's a lot of opportunity for companies like ours that specialize in high-quality content, not just in the U.S. but also globally. But if you just go back to the United States, Sling TV is one example of increased value and opportunity from networks like ours. HBO over-the-top is another example.","So on the whole, we think the value of that content and of our networks is growing and we think some of the changes that all of us are beginning to see in having more flexible consumer offerings are going to support the value of the best networks and the strongest brands. That\u2019s basically why we see ourselves on track for our targets in '16 and '18. And John and Howard, I think you have a few things to add.","John Martin","Just a few additional comments, with regard to the rhythm of our affiliate contracts, we've got seven of the Top 10 affiliates closed and we anticipate closure of remaining deals this year. As we reported in the past, everything is going exactly in accordance with plan. We're achieving the rate increases and the terms that we have been seeking. And this year in the multiyear overall cycle we fully anticipated and we have communicated before, that there will be somewhat of a moderation in subscriber revenue growth, but then it's going to pick back up beyond 2015.","I think it's important though, when you look at the longer-term trends of multichannel in the U.S. to understand that the evidence that we see clearly indicates that the main reason why people are leaving the multichannel universe, let's call them cord cutters is because they either can't afford it or they don't think there's enough value in the offerings that are currently being provided to them by the MVPDs. We also believe that a portion of that community would like to sign back up for multichannel TV if the offerings were comprised of more affordable and greater flexibility.","I think Sling, as Jeff said is a great example, but I think it's important to understand that it is the first example. A lot of the economy packs that the MVPDs are currently offering are based more on whether the contracts allow for them and they are based more on cost and they're offered as retention tools as opposed to proactive marketing opportunities. I think that is going to change over time.","We've been saying for a long time that there's too many channels in existence today. The approach that Time Warner and Turner have taken over the years of investing heavily in a core group of channels we think is going to really pay handsome dividends in the future, as we have two of the top five, three of the top 10 networks and 85% of our affiliate fees are comprised in the Top 4 and we're pleased to be in the Sling initial offering.","So we're quite optimistic about how things are going to continue to evolve over time and we're quite optimistic about the hand that we have in terms of the value of the networks.","Howard Averill","Doug, just a quick point in terms of the drivers in the fourth quarter, the biggest impact was the result of FX and that was followed by the impact of the Dish dispute and then finally, there was a smaller impact from subscriber declines that includes sub losses, the move to smaller bundles, a redefinition of bulk accounts. So it's a handful of smaller impacts that make up the sub declines.","Operator","Our next question here comes from Mr. John Janedis from Jefferies. Please go ahead, sir.","John Janedis ","Maybe a slight follow-up, can you give us an update on the Dish negotiation? I guess with the launch of Sling including your networks is the read-through that you\u2019re confident that something gets done in the near-term? And is the issue more on pricing or rights? And then, Howard based on your response to Doug's question, is Dish one of those three that are still outstanding? Thanks.","Jeff Bewkes","I will start and then the chorus will go. We're having very good conversations and we have a good business going with Dish that is why we all came -- Charlie's management and ours to I think a happy agreement on the Sling product. And we feel very good about our overall business together, whether it is at Turner or HBO. Beyond that, I don't have more to add. John, do you have more?","John Martin","John, I was just going to point out that Dish is one of the deals that we have not completed at this point.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mr. David Bank from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","David Bank","So it looks like Kevin Riley now has basically his team in place and I think we could assume that the new content cycle has begun. So could you, I guess first articulate is there a different vision that that team has in terms of genre or programming? Is it basic continuation of sort of the BOOM! [ph] brand and the Turner Comedy brand?","When do we expect to see the impact of Kevin's team and his process on ratings for the schedule and ultimately on advertising? Then also, how close is he working with Peter Roth for a holistic Turner Warner product, as well as Kevin, for broader monetization outside of the first window? If you could talk about the holistic approach Warners has to the Turner properties there for content creation and distribution.","John Martin","It's John, I will start. Look, Kevin is here. He has hit the ground running. He has brought great new perspective, a lot of energy, a lot of enthusiasm. He has officially been here for just over a month and he is already announced a new organization and a new structure and he is bringing in some fresh talent. And he is working terrifically with David Levy and together working towards the upfront on the existing development slate and working on sharpening the brand positioning reach of TNT and TBS as we move into the future.","I want to just caution that we got to give Kevin some time, because he hasn't been here for very long, but I couldn't be more pleased with the talent and the direction that our big networks are going to be going in and we're starting to build off of an increasing position of success.","As we said before, TNT we're going to look to go a little bit younger, more dual and sharpen the TBS brand promise. But if you think about in the fourth quarter we premiered The Librarians which is the highest premiere on all ad-supported basic cable. It beat out Last Ship which was number two. We had six of the top 15 original dramas, as Jeff said. And on the original program side on TBS, we've got six new shows, three returning and 2 Broke Girls coming on from Warners. So I would love for Kevin to give some perspective on how Kevin and the team are working with Warners.","We're really excited about two big dramas coming out of Warners that are going to be moving on to TNT soon and just from my perspective at Turner, I think the relationship has never been better and Warners is our most important partner.","Kevin Tsujihara","Peter Roth and Kevin Riley have a long history together at both FX and Fox and they've really hit the ground running. They can talk in shorthand; they have a great relationship. As John said, we have two big dramas that we feel really good about and we have a number of other projects in the hopper and so we feel great about where we're at with Turner as well as HBO. I think things from a Warner Bros.' production perspective and getting access to our roster of talent and being able to work as we're currently with Turner and HBO is a huge opportunity.","Richard Plepler","It's Richard. I would just add that this is the first time in history that Warner Bros. and HBO are doing business together in television production. Huge success with Leftovers doing over 7 million viewers, in production on Westworld with Jonathan Nolan and tremendously talented cast and I think it just speaks to what we talked about on investor day which is working together across divisions to maximize our capacity.","Operator","Our next here comes from Ms. Alexia Quadrani from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Alexia Quadrani","I've a question on HBO. It's been several quarters now since you had the deal with Amazon which obviously has the obvious benefit of giving you the revenue stream that you've been able to reinvest in programming. But beyond that benefit I guess can you talk about how you think it has maybe changed audience habits and sense? Are you seeing more -- do you think it's driving consumers to HBO, traditional HBO in terms of getting them hooked on shows or attracted to that kind of programming?","Richard Plepler","Couple of things, first of all the performance on Prime and everything we have heard from our friends in Amazon has exceeded even their expectations in terms of usage and customer satisfaction. We said at the beginning that in addition to helping us monetize some of our library -- remember it's windowed at three years, we thought it was a wonderful opportunity to have some of the 70 million non-HBO homes have a chance to sample some of our best programming. We think that only has the catalytic effect of driving people back to the network.","Listen, we had the biggest sub growth last year any time in 30 years and I think there is a lot of factors that contributed to that, but Amazon I think might have been one of them because people have an opportunity to see what they previously haven't seen. So it has been a tremendously positive relationship for us which we expect to continue.","Alexia Quadrani","And then just a quick thought, if I can, on your commentary earlier about Turner subs. I think you mentioned it was a small cause I guess of the weakness in the subs in the quarter. And you said you had mentioned that you are expecting further sort of modest declines in subs in 2015. I guess are you looking for that decline to accelerate or is it kind of the same sort of level?","Howard Averill","We're expecting to see the same sort of levels that we saw over the past year or so.","Jeff Bewkes","But if I could add, you may see, as time goes on, some important increases coming out of more, better targeted bundles, smaller bundles with powerful networks that are more intentional by the distributors rather than just retention save packages that they have now, where they are essentially using low-cost networks to do retentions. So we would not necessarily sign up to a long term decline on that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jessica Reif Cohen from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Jessica Reif Cohen","I have two questions; the first is a follow-up to Jeff's comments on the expanded -- on behavioral-based advertising. Could you just talk a little bit about how you will sell this? Is this addressable advertising? And can you do it on your own or do you need the industry to participate?","John Martin","Listen, we will be talking a lot more about this at the upfront, and we have released this in a press release some time ago that we've got an arrangement with a third party who is going to help us with our mix of programming, connecting with advertisers and providing us with certain behavioral targeting capabilities that we previously didn't have. And we really look forward to the upfront, because I think you are going to see a much more unified Turner and much more focus on targeting and delivering audiences to advertisers, not just key demos.","Just to repeat what Jeff said, because I think this is really, really important, the holy-grail for us, as advertising-supported cable network companies is to sync together the targeting capabilities which is the big selling point of digital right now, link that together with the reach and the fantastic immersive environment of full-scale, long-form video.","And so we think that -- and that's just going to continue. We're going to invest. We're going to build internal capabilities and we're going to use the best products on the market to continue to get better at delivering ROI to our marketers.","Jessica Reif Cohen","Okay. We could go on forever on that one, but then just to switch gears; on HBO I know you said multiple times on this call that you will have an OTT offer later in the year. Can you just give some color on pricing and positioning? How do you not cannibalize your existing subs? There is a huge universe that doesn't get right now, whether they are pay-TV subs or non-pay-TV subs. So can you just talk about how you are thinking about approaching it?","Richard Plepler","Jessica, it's Richard. Look, we're going to price it in a way that obviously maximizes the value on all platforms. Quite obviously, it is a premium product and it will be priced accordingly. But the other point I would make as we talk to our distributors is there is a real opportunity out there in the low-hanging fruit of the 10-or-so-million broadband only homes and we're very excited about working together with them to leverage that opportunity. Our meetings have gone very well in that regard and I think it's a tremendous advantage for them and us to use HBO to drive broadband and to drive some of the low packaging.","Michael Kopelman","Joe, I think we have time for one more question, please.","Operator","Our next question here comes from Rich Greenfield from BTIG. Please go ahead.","Rich Greenfield","Kind of a conceptual question, your Netflix has come out and said they are spending $3 billion to $4 billion on content and I think Jeff Bezos announced as part of Amazon earnings, that they are going to spend $1.3 billion on content. So we're clearly seeing that big tech companies are investing heavily in content. Time Warner made the decision to scale back its tech investment and outsource technology to Major League Baseball. I just wanted you to go through the puts and takes of outsourcing technology versus having your own internal tech stack. Particularly I think it sounds like you are going to use HBO as kind of the leading force to build a direct-to-consumer business for your other brands and just how that all evolves.","Richard Plepler","Rich, it's Richard, let me start. First of all, I would dissent slightly that we're pulling back from our investments. We're not -- we're continuing to invest in technology. MLB is an investment in technology. We just happen to think that working with a partner that already has a platform built makes the most sense and we're very comfortable, we're on track for our launch. I can't say more about the date other than that we have a date and we feel very comfortable with our schedule.","The thing I would add about content is, look it's true that there is a plethora of competition out there. It's also true that more is not better, only better is better. And I like our hand a lot, as I've said to you before given the range of talent that comes to our door, I think on a forward [ph] first call basis. So as we've said, this isn't a zero-sum game, other people are going to do good work, but we're going to have a first look at most everything that we want to make an investment in in terms of content.","Kevin Tsujihara","And I would add, as Richard said earlier, when we can go to our talent base and be able to demonstrate through Leftovers and Westworld that we're taking the best projects and projects over to HBO, it helps us as well because they are going to get access to the best talent that we have on a daily basis.","Jeff Bewkes","Rich, it's Jeff. I can't resist adding, those were nice numbers you gave on some of our new brothers and sisters in the content business. But as we mentioned in our call, I don't of it me or Howard, we have been ramping up our content spending dramatically over the last five or six years and we're continuing to do that. We're spending $15 billion a year on production, marketing, etc. It's going up to $19 billion in the horizon that we've been giving plans for.","So there is global support in terms of viewers and attachment to video content. These check changes, whether they are being provided as platforms by other companies or which part of it we decide to provide, are simply making the content more powerful and bringing in more viewers and giving us more ways to monetize.","Rich Greenfield","If I could just follow-up -- that's a great answer. I'm just curious, is there any way to think about total companywide spending on technology?","Jeff Bewkes","We don't have that number sitting right here because it's hard to do the borders on that. There is so much technology, Rich involved in our ongoing operations. Just take CNN with its tens of feeds all over the world, all digital. We've got HBO GO. I think it's artificial to take a border on certain broadband-delivered tech products and not consider the very adjacent and very intertwined technology that is required in digital transmission backhauls, all of our feeds across the planet. We have hundreds of them, so that's why we don't segregate.","Michael Kopelman","Thanks, Rich. Thanks, everybody for joining us today. If you have any follow-up questions, we're always around. We appreciate your time. Have a great day.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation and you may now disconnect."],"20350":["Time Warner (NYSE:TWX) Q1 2013 Earnings Call May  1, 2013 10:30 AM ET","Executives","Douglas Shapiro - Senior Vice President of Investor Relations","Jeffrey L.

My name is Dawn, and I will be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to your host for today, Mr. Doug Shapiro, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations for Time Warner. Please proceed.","Douglas Shapiro","Thanks, and good morning. This morning, we issued 2 press releases, 1 detailing our results for the first quarter and the other reaffirming our 2013 business outlook.","Before we begin, there are 2 items I need to cover. First, we'll refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Schedules setting out reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our earnings release and trending schedules. These reconciliations are available on our website at www.timewarner.com\/investors. Reconciliations of our expected future financial performance are also included in the business outlook release that's available on our site.","And second, today's announcement includes certain forward-looking statements, which are based on management's current expectations. Actual results may vary materially from those expressed or implied by these statements due to various factors. These factors are discussed in detail in Time Warner's SEC filings, including its most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. Time Warner is under no obligation and, in fact, expressly disclaims any obligation to update or alter its forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.","Thanks, and let me turn it over to Jeff.","Jeffrey L. Bewkes","Thanks, Doug, and thanks, everyone, for listening in this morning. Before I talk about our first quarter results, I'd like to touch on the biggest news that we came forward with over the last few months. And that was our announcement in March that we intend to spin off Time Inc. as an independent public entity by the end of the year. We think it's the right step for Time Inc., for Time Warner and for our stockholders for a few reasons. As you know, Time Inc. is by far the largest magazine publisher in the world with iconic brands and massive reach. After the spin, it will have much more strategic, financial and operational flexibility, and it will be able to develop a shareholder base that's aligned with its strategy and its growth prospects. Also, it will be able to attract, retain and reward talent with equity that's directly tied to its own performance. Ultimately, we concluded that these benefits substantially outweigh the relatively smaller strategic links between Time Inc. and our other businesses. These are essentially the same reasons why we separated both Time Warner Cable and AOL 4 years ago. Back when we did those transactions, it wasn't common for large media companies to take steps to become smaller. But we did them because we believe they were in the best interest of our stockholders. And in light of the performance those companies and their stocks, I think it's fair to say that they're both in a far stronger position today as independent companies. We fully expect the same for Time Inc.","Following the spinoffs of Time Warner Cable and AOL, we quickly saw the benefits of making Time Warner smaller, more nimble and more focused. With the separation of Time Inc., we'll complete the final natural step in that process.","After the spin, Time Warner will be the leading pure-play video content company in the world, operating the largest cable networks business, the largest TV production company and the largest film studio with the largest library. We'll derive 80% of our profits from our cable networks. And when you consider that roughly half of Warner Bros. profits each year come from its TV production businesses, that means 90% of our profits will come from the broader television ecosystem. With video consumption, pay TV subs, pay TV ARPUs and television CPMs all growing globally, we think that's a very good place to be. It was certainly a good place to be this quarter, and we're off to a great start this year.","In the first quarter, we grew adjusted operating income 7%, adjusted EPS increased more than 20%, and we returned over $900 million to our stockholders through buybacks and our dividend. We also saw a number of very encouraging operational trends. At Turner, the headline this quarter was again the outstanding performance of March Madness. Across TNT, TBS, truTV and CBS, total viewers were up 11%, making it the most watched tournament in almost 2 decades. We also saw really strong digital engagement. For instance, we delivered close to 50 million live streams. That's up more than 150% over last year. Since we acquired the rights, the tournament has far exceeded all our expectations for ratings, linear ad revenue, digital usage metrics and digital ad revenue.","We also continued to see solid performance across most of our networks. TBS was the #1 ad-supported cable network in prime time across adults 18 to 34 and 18 to 49, powered by the continued strength in The Big Bang Theory and the success of some of our new series, including Cougar Town and King of the Nerds. TNT faced some difficult NBA comparisons this quarter against the lockout-affected season last year with fewer games and fewer compelling matchups. But TNT grew ratings for its entertainment programming, which included originals like Dallas and the new unscripted show, Boston's Finest.","As usual, we have the bulk of our original programming on our big entertainment networks between now and the end of summer. In June, we'll bring the biggest original shows back to TNT, including Rizzoli & Isles, Major Crimes, Falling Skies and Perception, and launch several new unscripted series. At TBS, our biggest original comedies returned to the lineup in the second quarter, Men at Work and Sullivan & Son, and we'll debut a couple of new unscripted shows. And you can expect to hear more about the continuing evolution of our original programming strategy for both TNT and TBS at our up-front presentation in a couple of weeks.","Turning to some of our more targeted networks, Adult Swim continues to a juggernaut. It posted its most watched quarter ever and again ranked #1 on all of basic cable for total day delivery of adults and men 18 to 34 and 18 to 49. And truTV saw extremely strong performance from some of its biggest hits and some of my favorite shows like Hardcore Pawn, Impractical Jokers and Lizard Lick Towing. Check that out.","At CNN, coverage of the recent tragic events in Boston and Texas reaffirmed that it's more essential than ever, reaching more viewers in the key demos than any other news network as well as experiencing record traffic levels on CNN Digital. I'm optimistic that under its energized new leadership, CNN will build on its position as the leading source of breaking news to become the destination for compelling TV all the time.","I'll shift next to HBO, which continues to perform at the very top of its game. Unless you've been hanging out with some White Walkers north of The Wall, you know that Game of Thrones has become a cultural phenomenon. So far this season, it's averaging over 13 million viewers per episode, making it the most watched series on HBO since The Sopranos. As a sign of its popularity, despite challenges in the home video business in general, the just-released second season of Game of Thrones posted the highest first day DVD and DST sales of any HBO series ever.","And Game of Thrones is only one part of what is arguably the strongest programming lineup in HBO's history. We just debuted the second season of VEEP to critical acclaim and will follow that with the return of True Blood in June, The Newsroom in July and Boardwalk Empire later this year, among others. We also have several exciting pilots in development, including new shows from J.J. Abrams, David [ph]  [indiscernible] and Ryan Murphy","At Warner Bros., we're finishing up a very strong TV season. Among adults 18 to 49, we've got 4 of the top 6 comedies on the air: The Big Bang Theory, Two and a Half Men, Two Broke Girls and Mike & Molly. We've got both of the breakout new dramas this season: Revolution and The Following. And we have the #1 reality show on TV, The Voice.","With a really strong slate of returning shows and a promising crop of pilots this year, particularly 30-minute comedies, we think we're again really well positioned heading into the up-front over the next few weeks.","Our theatrical results over the last quarter were somewhat disappointing as both Gangster Squad and Jack the Giant Slayer fell short of our expectations. But our ability to post strong financial results in spite of this is a testament to the resilience and breadth of Warner's businesses. And importantly, all of our most promising and highly-anticipated theatrical releases of the year are yet to come. Next week, we'll premier The Great Gatsby, followed by The Hangover Part 3, then Man of Steel, then Pacific Rim and, at the end of the year, the second film in The Hobbit trilogy. We're particularly excited about Man of Steel, which is shaping up to be one of the biggest movies of the year, and it's a real opportunity for us to relaunch the Superman franchise. As you may have seen in the press, we recently received a few very favorable legal rulings related to the Superman IP. Those court decisions paved the way for us to be more aggressive in developing our future plans for Superman. We hope to share more on that front soon.","So all in all, it was another successful quarter for us, both financially and operationally. And although it's just the first quarter, we're really pleased about how we're starting off the year.","With that, I'll turn it over to John.","John K. Martin","Thanks, Jeff, and good morning. I'll begin by referring to the first slide, which is now available on our website, and starting with the consolidated highlights.","We're off to a terrific start this year with adjusted operating income up 7% to a first quarter record of $1.4 billion and adjusted EPS up over 20%. And if you look at the company, excluding the results of the Publishing division, adjusted operating income was even stronger, up 10% year-over-year. We were able to do that despite relatively flat revenue in the quarter as costs were down low-single digits year-over-year. That resulted in margin expansion of 140 basis points on a total company basis and around 250 basis points for the Time Warner, excluding the Publishing division. That's consistent with our expectation that we'll post a fifth straight year of margin expansion in 2013, reflecting both underlying growth in our businesses and our commitment to efficiency gains.","Moving down the P&L. We continue to leverage growth in adjusted operating income and to even faster growth in adjusted EPS, and that was mostly due to a combination of a lower effective tax rate and our ongoing share repurchase program. Coming into the year, we set a goal to once again deliver double-digit adjusted EPS growth, and, as Jeff mentioned, with the first quarter now behind us, we have increased confidence we'll achieve that goal.","We also had a great start to the year for free cash flow generation, generating over $900 million in the quarter. So we fully expect to deliver a lot of free cash in 2013, supporting our continued significant returns to shareholders. During the quarter, we repurchased about $670 million of common stock, and we paid $273 million in dividends. So we think we're set up for another great year as our investments in content, international expansion and digital initiatives continue to pay off.","Now let me turn to the segment highlights, and let me begin with our largest segment, the Networks, where revenue growth and margin expansion at both HBO and Turner resulted in record first quarter adjusted operating income for the segment. Subscription revenues were up more than 5%, relatively consistent with the trends we saw for the full year 2012. Our underlying rate increases are not changing much this year, but changes in unit growth, currency and various other factors can move the needle one way or another in any given quarter. We expect to remain in the mid-single-digit range for the balance of the year, and we fully expect to see an acceleration in subscription revenue growth in 2014 as Turner will begin to see the benefits from its upcoming affiliate renewal cycle.","Turning to advertising, revenues were down 1% year-over-year in the quarter, which is about in line with what we expected coming into the quarter. There were a number of headwinds, and let me just mention a few. These included the timing of the Final Four games, which fell into the second quarter this year. It also included the closure of certain networks in India and Turkey last year and the transfer of management of SI.com and Golf.com to Time Inc. last year. Looking through these items, domestic advertising was up in the mid-single digits with entertainment advertising, including kids and young adults, up in the mid- to high-single-digit range, while news was down about 10%. And international advertising would have been down mid-single digits due to double-digit increases at international entertainment, which was more than offset by declines at international news.","Looking at the second quarter, we expect overall Networks advertising growth to rebound and accelerate into the high-single digits. Recall that next quarter, we'll benefit from the timing of the Final Four, and we'll finally lap the transition of SI.com and Golf.com back to Time Inc. as well as the shutdown of India's Imagine. In addition, the second quarter scatter market has been very healthy with double-digit premiums over up-front pricing.","Adjusted operating income was up 7% in the quarter at the Networks with margins increasing 150 basis points. That was a result of cost discipline, the timing of programming expenses and the international network shutdowns last year. However, we continue to invest in our most important brands, including a double-digit increase in Turner's original programming spend this quarter. For the full year, we continue to expect overall programming expenses to be up in the mid- to high single-digit range. We also anticipate that margins will be up for the year at the Networks division as revenue growth should improve beginning in the second quarter. So 2013 should be another really strong year of financial results for the Networks segment.","Turning now to film and TV. Despite the somewhat disappointing box office performance start of our films this quarter, Warner Bros. had a strong quarter financially. Adjusted operating income grew 23% year-over-year, and margins expanded more than 200 basis points. That was driven by the strong performance of our carryover films, the home video sales from the first Hobbit film and lower prints and advertising spend in the quarter. The performance of The Hobbit on home video was part of a broader trend of stabilization for the industry. For the overall industry, the first quarter was particularly encouraging in that regard as both sell-through and total home entertainment revenue increased year-over-year. Growth was especially strong for electronic sell-through, which was up over 60% from a year ago. It's particularly encouraging to see these signs of stabilization even as some of the industry's digital initiatives, including UltraViolet, remain at a relatively early stage.","On the SVOD front, we recognized about $75 million of revenue at this segment in the quarter, similar to last year with significant contribution from international territories. If you include Turner as well as Warner's, we recognized about $100 million of SVOD revenue in the quarter. And we continue to expect the SVOD distribution channel to be a significant contributor to our results this year.","Looking ahead, as Jeff mentioned, over the next few months, we'll start to release our most promising and anticipated films of the year. Likewise, we're optimistic about this TV pilot season. And between a strong stable of returning shows and a great lineup of pilots, we expect to be in a very strong position again this fall in television. With a really strong film slate and continued momentum in TV, Warner Bros.' profits this year should be at least as good, if not better, than a year ago.","Now moving on to Publishing, where both first quarter revenues and adjusted operating income were down somewhat versus last year. A significant portion of the decline in adjusted operating income was due to higher restructuring expenses this year and absent that increase, adjusted operating income would have been about flat in the quarter. Advertising revenue was up 2% in the quarter, but that included the positive impact from the transfer of management of SI.com and Golf.com back to Time Inc. And without this transfer, advertising revenues would have been down modestly year-over-year. And based on our current outlook for Q2, we expect advertising to be down somewhat again in the second quarter.","Subscription revenues were down 11% in the first quarter, though that included the impact of certain weekly titles having fewer issues in the quarter than in the prior year quarter. As we look to the rest of the year, we anticipate subscription revenue declines to be more similar to the mid-single-digit declines that we experienced in 2012 at Time Inc. We remain very focused here on taking costs out of the business, both to improve efficiency and to allow for investment in growth initiatives. So as we previously announced, Time Inc. made significant reduction in its workforce during the first quarter, and restructuring costs were a little north of $50 million in Q1. This process is an important step in preparing Time Inc. to operate successfully as a stand-alone public company.","Now let me move over and provide some additional context to our 2013 outlook. As I noted earlier, we're off to a great start this year, and we're on track to deliver another year of double-digit growth in adjusted EPS. In terms of quarterly progression, we expect the second quarter to be very strong, and it could be perhaps the strongest growth rate quarter we have in a year. And if you'll recall, in last year's second quarter, we had a significant intersegment elimination resulting from the Warner Bros. sale of The Mentalist to Turner, and we also had our softest quarter of the year at Time Inc. Along with positive underlying trends in our businesses, those year-over-year comparisons set us up for a very strong second quarter growth rate. The second quarter should also benefit from an effective tax rate that will look similar to the first quarter and below our expectation for the full year. That means our growth will likely be more heavily weighted to the first half of this year, which is somewhat different from the past couple of years. But it is consistent with what we expected as we entered 2013, and we feel pretty good about how things have started this year and how things are shaping up.","I also want to remind you that we expect to begin accounting for our nearly 50% stake in Central European Media Enterprises as an equity investment during the second quarter of 2013. And due to the accounting rules associated with this, we will be recasting in the second quarter our historical financials as though we had always accounted for CME as an equity investment. Now since CME produces net losses, this accounting change will be somewhat of a drag on earnings. But based on what we know today, we're still comfortable with the absolute range of adjusted EPS in 2013 that is implied by our current guidance.","Turning to the next slide, which looks at free cash flow. We generated about $935 million of free cash in the first quarter, and that's up significantly from a year ago, and that's primarily due to an improvement in working capital as well as a decline in cash taxes. The reduced drag from working capital accounted for more than half of the improvement in year-over-year free cash flow this quarter, and that was due largely to lower production spending at Film and TV and the timing of sports payments at our Networks division. The decline in cash taxes was a result of tax law extenders that were passed by Congress in January earlier this year. Given the strong start and our expectations for the remainder of the year, free cash flow should be up nicely in 2013.","And moving over to our final slide, which looks at our net debt. We ended the quarter with $16.9 billion in net debt, which is pretty similar to where we ended 2012 as we used slightly more than 100% of our free cash flow in the quarter for dividends and share repurchases. That's almost $950 million in the quarter, and that includes about $600 million -- $670 million of share repurchases. Our leverage ratio is now 2.4x, in line with where we ended 2012. We remain comfortable that our target leverage ratio of 2.5x strikes the right balance of maintaining balance sheet strength while allowing us to continue to invest in our businesses, making acquisitions and returning capital to our stockholders. So we'll continue to manage our balance sheet to stay in that range over the course of the year.","With that, let me turn it back to Doug in order to start the Q&A portion of the call. Thank you.","Douglas Shapiro","All right. Thanks, John. Dawn, we'll get the Q&A started [Operator Instructions].","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We have John Janedis from UBS online.","John Janedis - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Jeff, to your point on HBO, creatively it's going great. Can you talk about what you're seeing from a subscriber perspective? Any change in churn given the programming strength? And do you still think you have pricing power given the increase in lower-priced substitutes?","Jeffrey L. Bewkes","Yes, I think subs are going very well at HBO, both domestically and overseas, particularly overseas. I don't know if you're asking about first quarter, but they were pretty -- they move around in terms of the mix of paying versus not paying subs. In general, the trend is very buoyant. We think that subscribers love the program, and we got several shows that are record audience shows led by Game of Thrones. HBO GO continues to pick up users, registrations and tremendous reports from the families that are using it. Let me -- what are you asking exactly?","John Janedis - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I guess what I'm asking is that given the strength of Game of Thrones, et cetera, is that bringing churn lower, I guess, number one? And then number two, given some of the lower-priced substitutes for, let's say, $8 or $10, is there any kind of impact in terms of your subs as it relates to some sort of substitution effect as a result of that?","Jeffrey L. Bewkes","Okay, now I got it. No, I don't think there's any effect of other complementary services like Netflix, et cetera. Remember, both Netflix over-indexes in HBO homes and HBO over-indexes in Netflix homes. So these are not -- these are very complementary things. On the churn side, churn is certainly kind of restrained and improved by strong programming at HBO. But the churn dynamic for any pay TV service that flows on top of basic packages has a lot more to do with what the distributors are doing in terms of price offers, vigorousness of -- vigor of marketing and so forth, not that much to do with programming. But having said that, HBO has the lowest churn of any premium service.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dan [ph] Swinburne for Morgan Stanley.","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I think that's me. I guess is that me? I have 2 questions, one housekeeping just on the advertising. John, what was the actual domestic international year-over-year growth rates or declines at Networks this quarter?","John K. Martin","So in the first quarter, I think I might have even said this, we reported down 1%. The movement of the NCAA Final Four from Q1 to Q2 probably cost us about 200 basis points. And then all of the other sort of noise, whether it's the network shutdowns, the transfer of SI and Golf.com and FX, was about another 200 basis points. So overall, organic ads were up call it around 3%. And if you look at that between domestic and international, domestic was up mid-single digits, right around 5%, and international was down mid-single digits, right around 5%. And internationally, we saw particular strength in our entertainment properties, which were up double digits with a very strong rebound in Latin America, and that was more than offset by double-digit declines at news.","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then, Jeff, I would love to hear your comments on some of the comments Richard Plepler made, I think, over the last couple of months about HBO potentially exploring kind of a broadband-only distribution plan with MVPDs. Sort of how real is that in your mind? How big of an opportunity is that? And in particular, why would you argue that's consistent with your 'TV Everywwhere' strategy at Time Warner overall?","Jeffrey L. Bewkes","I'm not sure you have. I mean, we always look at opportunities to increase the distribution, the availability of HBO. And so I think Richard was speaking to that. We have done, for example, that model in Scandinavia where you can buy HBO the traditional way on TV with HBO GO attached to it from a traditional video distributor there. But because they don't have that many multi-pay subs over there, basically we also offered it through broadband. So if you then go to the United States, I think you're asking about that.","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Yes, yes.","Jeffrey L. Bewkes","HBO has got 40 million HBO Cinemax subs here. We are vigorously offering HBO GO through all our distributors. If you then go and say, well, should we add it as a broadband-only service, which you could do through facilities-based providers or you could do it through non-facilities-based providers, which I think was the discussion Richard was having, we have the rights to do it, and we would do it if we thought it was in our economic best interest. At this point, we don't think it makes sense. We don't think the target market is sufficiently large to be attractive at this point. So what we're doing, and it is working pretty well, is we're working with the MVPDs to increase the penetration of HBO in a mutually beneficial way. We're always going to keep evaluating it depending on the country, and I think that's what Richard was talking about. I think he's right to say it that way.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jessica Reif Cohen from Bank of America.","Jessica Reif Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I have 2 questions, 2 topics. One is on SVOD. You mentioned that this will be a strong year, and I was just wondering, I wondered if you could give us your current thoughts. You've talked about it in the past. And also, how much of an opportunity do you think there is with Netflix moving away from Viacom? You guys have one of the biggest, if not the biggest, television library. So that's the first question.","Jeffrey L. Bewkes","Oh, so you're asking, Jessica, about SVOD outlook for 2013?","Jessica Reif Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Yes.","Jeffrey L. Bewkes","Like going forward? Good. It's pretty good. What we have said, I'll try to remember all the things we've said publicly, we have disclosed that we generated over $350 million in revenue from SVOD sales in 2012. We think that's near the top of our competitive set, and that does not include the revenue from the CW Network deal, which is pretty significant. As we look at this year, we feel very good. We've got some deals we've already done. We have a number of agreements that we did last year that have ongoing components. We've recently signed additional deals with both Amazon and Netflix, and we did that both at Warner's and at Turner. We're in active negotiations with all the major players, including those buyer. So we think it'll be a significant revenue stream for us again this year, and it may well grow this year. But we do want to keep it in perspective. It's a small percentage of our revenue. It's only around 10% of our TV syndication revenue last year, and we -- it's about 3% of total Film and TV. So hopefully, it'll grow. While -- I want another point, which is take the biggest SVOD buyer outside of HBO, which is the biggest. Netflix on the new basis, it's getting more selective what Netflix is trying to buy, and we thought that would happen. We think it's a good trend for us. I think what'll happen with SVOD providers' broadband is they're going to focus more on current content, especially back seasons of series that are currently on the air and some select high-value library series. We have not done -- or we've got the biggest supply in all those categories. We haven't done kind of general deals that require people to take less desired series. So we think we're in a catbird seat from that point of view with all the SVOD buyers.","Jessica Reif Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Great. And then just a completely different topic. On CNN, can you talk a little bit -- you made a lot of changes and continue to make changes, but what is the upside over the next couple of years with ratings improvement? Are the affiliate contracts from the same cycle as the Turner's or the Turner networks?","Jeffrey L. Bewkes","Yes, they are. The biggest upside is in affiliate improvement. We think there's a lot of correction there. There's certainly a lot you can do on the advertising side, but let's focus on really the strength of CNN as it comes back here. We think the new leadership is off to a great start. We feel momentum in ratings. If you look at April, it's significant progress. CNN is #2, HLN is #3. If you look at online, we had our highest day in history just last month. You can see, as you just looked at what happened in Boston last week, and we keep, all us are, saying this over and over, whenever there's a global news item of interest, CNN is the first place to go. We're getting better all the time in extending that and covering it in all its dimensions. So we have said, as having said that, that CNN can't just mean politics and wars. And we're -- we will cover those, but we don't need to start a war to have a success at CNN. We do need to be more competitive in the mornings. We're working on that. I think you can see the focus on some of our broadening of what we're doing in the hires of Chris Cuomo, Jake Tapper and Rachel Nichols. You can see it in the success of Anthony Bourdain. And so we think -- because remember, more people tune in to CNN than any other news channel, and the issue is how long do they tune in. We're making strides on the length of time that people watch CNN as we really basically deepen the program.","John K. Martin","And just a quick amplification, too. Looking at the second quarter, I talked a little bit about ad revenues strengthening. We are seeing improvements in the news category, both domestically and internationally in Q2. So that's also encouraging.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Morris from Davenport & Company.","Michael C. Morris - Davenport & Company, LLC, Research Division","First, just following up on that question of news. And the news ratings not just for CNN but some of your competitors' have been down pretty significantly so far this year. Now I'm curious, where do you think that audience is going? And hopefully, I mean, that does kind of tie into the comments you just made about the new programming. But I guess I want to get a little better understanding of why you feel certain that, that opportunity is there, where those people are going and how you're -- where you're winning them back from. Then I have a follow-up.","Jeffrey L. Bewkes","So remember -- okay, the reason is it's really what -- it's in your question. You have -- see, the ratings were down at all the news networks. The number of people tuning in was not down. And so what you have is a variation in either the sense of urgency people have around the country or the world as to whether they want to watch news coverage or if there's something happening of great interest to them. And then secondly, you have the question of whether news channels are delivering the kind of coverage that would motivate people to stay. So it's not an issue of reach. It's not an issue of whether people are showing up and are interested in the news. It's really a question of whether the programming is engaging and whether what the news is, is drawing audiences. We have seen Fox as one of our competitors moving more to the extreme, and NBC doing -- and MSNBC doing the same thing on the other side. We think that's a huge opportunity for us. And because we have more people tuning in to us than either of them do, we think that if we just do a job on finding the news and the coverage that satisfies them that they find relevance to stay for a little longer than just getting the headlines, that we have a great upside. And I would add one thing, which is the world, the media world, the press world covers very intensely all the developments in online or digital that are relatively, they think, small but portend the future. CNN's digital and online business is the biggest one out there. It ought to get more attention.","Michael C. Morris - Davenport & Company, LLC, Research Division","Great. And then also on the international side, on Turner International, I think you made a management change about a year ago right now. Can you talk a little bit about the progress there in terms of strategy, both any markets that you're focused on or increasingly focused on? And also, whether -- is news a focus? Is more entertainment content a focus? Just any update there will be helpful.","Jeffrey L. Bewkes","Okay, there you're referring to Gerhard Zeiler, who's the CEO of Turner International. First thing I would say is we're coordinating more, and we have more positions of strength between Turner, HBO and Warner's in various places, overseas where we've concentrated, particularly in Latin America. Secondly, I think we've said now many times and we're pretty much on track that our international business is on track to make $1 billion in operating earnings in the next few years. It'll be either '14 or '15 that we hit that. Some of the change, if you're asking for specifics, has been the cleaning up of efforts that didn't work like in India and Turkey. And a lot of the rest of the changes essentially focus on the places where we've been churning along. I think it's important to point out that the margins overseas -- we're usually the leading share player on the multichannel side where we're competing, and our margins overall are still in the 20s. They have improved 500 or 600 basis points on an underlying basis over the last couple of years if you leave out shutdowns. And so there's kind of a -- we all know there's a growing multichannel market out there. We've got tremendous position in distribution. We have channels from Turner to HBO to Warner that make a nice package. And you have basically an opportunity cause these are scale operations, of raising margins pretty rapidly because we're in that phase of growth in Latin America, Eastern Europe and Asia. So that's basically the outlook. It's pretty strong.","John K. Martin","Just one further thing, Michael, specific to next quarter and then this year. We do anticipate our international network ratings at Turner to begin to improve in the second quarter. So I think Q1 will probably be the low watermark for the year. And then because of the restructuring initiatives that have already been put in place, we think that the profit growth internationally at Turner this year is going to be really, really substantial, and we're going to experience meaningful margin expansion in '13.","Operator","Our next question comes from Anthony DiClemente from Barclays.","Anthony J. DiClemente - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I had 2 questions. At the Film and TV segment, John, you called out EST growth as 60%. Wondering, as you look at your new home video releases like Hobbit or Argo, what percentage of units sold for a property like that these days are digital versus physical? It seems like digital is accelerating. Is that -- and what is that from? Is it distribution of EST platforms? Is it pricing? Is a tablet growth? And then second question, there've been some talk out there about Turner carriage of the Final Four in your talks with CBS and the chance that, that could move up. I wonder if you could remind us strategically of the puts and takes there, Your willingness to absorb a greater percentage of the licensing costs in order to perhaps strengthen your content portfolio ahead of your affiliate renewals.","John K. Martin","Anthony, I'll take the first one. Yes, I don't know title by title specifically the differential in EST versus traditional physical sales. I mean, something like The Hobbit, frankly, across all distribution methods exceeded our expectations. If you look at EST in the quarter for us, and we probably have the lead EST share across the industry, we were up in the first quarter 20% year-over-year, and the overall EST revenues were north of $75 million. If you look at EST and VOD, which is another important form of digital distribution, it was up significantly in the quarter, and we approached -- we were north of $150 million, close to -- approaching $200 million in the quarter. And just a reminder, if you add SVOD on to that, if you add EST, SVOD and VOD, last year we were at $1 billion. So those 3 forms are already big. And frankly, that's one of the reasons why you're seeing stabilization in the overall home entertainment market in general, and it's one of the reasons why we're feeling more optimistic about the going-forward performance of the home entertainment business. So I apologize, I don't have the specifics for the newer titles.","Anthony J. DiClemente - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And so the...","Jeffrey L. Bewkes","On the NCAA question, we do have the option to start airing the Final Four next year, and that does not involve any incremental payments from us. So we have not made an announcement on that front yet, but it's something we've been discussing with CBS. So stay tuned.","Anthony J. DiClemente - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And what would be the downside to doing that if there aren't any incremental costs or losses incurred?","Jeffrey L. Bewkes","There would not be downside.","Operator","Our next question comes from Richard Greenfield from BTIG.","Richard Greenfield - BTIG, LLC, Research Division","When you look -- we love the HBO GO app, especially because of the way it curates a deep catalog experience. Yet when you look at apps like the Turner apps, the content is significantly more limited, and we've even seen you sell back episodes of things like Falling Skies to Amazon or Netflix. I forget which off the top of my head. But why not follow the HBO GO strategy with authentication to drive sub fees even higher when you force people to authenticate and really drive more usage of those apps? Basically, what are differences in strategy between HBO GO and the Turner assets? And then if you could just touch on Cinemax seems like you've had a real progress over the course of the last 6 months. You never really talk about Cinemax on your conference calls. Can you just update us on how big it is today and how big it could be over the next couple of years?","Jeffrey L. Bewkes","Yes, thanks, Rick. Let's start with Cinemax first. So Cinemax subs have been growing well in America and overseas. Cinemax original programming is a new genre over the last year or so. You have Strike Back, Hunted, Banshee. I watch them all. If any of you on the call have not seen every episode of all of those shows, go home -- well, don't go home, just turn your iPads right now and watch them all. You take the rest of the day off. They're really good. If you're asking, and I think it's a good question, about what about a more robust offering of VOD rights for basic channels, Turner or the -- ours but there's all the other ones owned by other companies, I think it's a good question, but you've said a lot when you mentioned the distributors. Well, what you have to do in basic is you have to try to figure out how to get the industry or, if you're going to do something different, have it work in a package of other channels. So up to now, we were the lead company. We did it first of putting at least 5 episodes of every series that we have on our Turner networks up there for free to subscribers on VOD and on broadband availability. We haven't been acquiring the back season rights. If you me for stacks of full seasons for the TV offering, yes. It's a big question because we're not really able to monetize them through carriage fees. If you take a show and put it on right now, it's not easy to get monetization, whereas if you're selling kind of library serialized, and I can't think of a series, to an SVOD provider, you can get monetized. And most are the natural places for consumers to find those shows and look deeply as 10, 20, 30 episodes. So kind of a video on-demand is the best way to watch serialized series. It can be VOD, as it is on HBO, as it could be on TNT, but it's essentially a model that has to evolve. So we're keeping an eye on the balance of how to make all of these networks, TBS, TNT, truTV, along with HBO, stronger and be things that viewers know they can go there and watch their favorite series and whichever episode of that. It's easy to do in pay TV, as you saw actually us do with all our shows on HBO, than it is on basic.","Richard Greenfield - BTIG, LLC, Research Division","And Jeff or John, is there any way to just quantify what percentage or even like the size of Cinemax in the portfolio relative to HBO just as it keeps growing? It seemed like a big opportunity that -- trying to get my arms around that size potential.","John K. Martin","Domestically, I think we ended 2012 with about 41 million HBO Cinemax subs. We don't break out the specific numbers, but HBO generally has twice the number of Cinemax. Cinemax, just to echo what Jeff said, has been growing very, very healthily. And then outside the U.S., I don't even know how many we have. I mean, if -- it's -- we have 71-plus million HBO Cinemax subs outside of the U.S., they grew like 35% last year, a big chunk of that growth was Cinemax, particularly in Latin America.","Jeffrey L. Bewkes","I just want to clear, we -- in domestic, we -- the relation, HBO to Cinemax, well, we don't -- it's more than 2x HBO. HBO has a bigger share than Max.","Operator","Our next question comes from Alexia Quadrani from JPMorgan.","Alexia S. Quadrani - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just looking at The WB, the TV studio business, are you seeing any change in demand for more the traditional syndicated programming domestically as more networks are focusing on original programming? And if so, maybe that's more than offset by international demand. And then just a second question, just to follow up on your earlier comments on the SVOD business that you made, I -- is there a way you can sort of quantify how big of an opportunity there is for potential revenues outside of Netflix if Netflix were to really pull back on the syndication programming?","Jeffrey L. Bewkes","All right, so you're asking about demand in syndication first or -- is that what you're asking?","Alexia S. Quadrani - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Yes. Just demand by...","Jeffrey L. Bewkes","Increased demand by regular syndicated buyers?","Alexia S. Quadrani - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Exactly.","Jeffrey L. Bewkes","Okay. It's up for A titles, and it's up around the world as well. So it's a very strong market for A titles. The B titles are tending to go more and more to either some cable or some SVOD players. And it's not a divide, as we've said many times, between serialized things versus non-serialized things. The serialized are of more use to subscription VOD players. What was the other question?","John K. Martin","On SVOD?","Jeffrey L. Bewkes","SVOD.","John K. Martin","Yes, I mean, look...","Jeffrey L. Bewkes","[Indiscernible].","John K. Martin","Yes, we've been doing deals with other SVOD providers outside of Netflix actually all along. And if you just look at the first quarter, about 30% to 35% of the deals that we did that we recognized and revenue were non-Netflix and a considerable portion of those are outside the U.S. And so I just want to also reiterate and repeat what Jeff said a little bit to your earlier -- to an earlier question because I think your question somewhat assumes that we have a lot of risk should Netflix pull back and change its buying patterns. We don't really see that. And as Jeff said a little bit earlier, we haven't really sold these huge blanket library deals perhaps as some of our -- other media companies have had. So we think, if to the extent that a Netflix or, frankly, all of SVOD providers become more selective, we've got the best shows that we think demand is going to go up.","Alexia S. Quadrani - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So that $350 million that you saw last year, that could potentially grow this year, in 2013?","Jeffrey L. Bewkes","Yes.","John K. Martin","Yes. I mean, yes. Yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Nathanson from Nomura.","Michael Nathanson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","I have one for John and one for Jeff. John, can you give just me some help? On programming cost growth, I know the shutdowns of the networks internationally have helped you. What is -- what are the like-for-like programming international [ph] growth be in the first quarter? And when you gave your guidance for the full year, how are you factoring in the shutdown within your guidance?","John K. Martin","Well, if you look at programming costs, which were basically essentially flat in the quarter, I think they were down 1%, they were lower than they ordinarily would be for really 3 reasons: it's the NCAA shutdown -- or excuse me, the NCAA move from Q1 to Q2; it was also the shutdowns, as you said; and it was also we had a pretty big write-off for a series at HBO last year. So on a normalized basis, programming costs would have been call it mid-single digits, which is consistent with our plans to grow programming mid- to high single digits over time. And I think even said that in my proactive remarks in 2013 that's the expectation. But I just want to remind everybody that, that does include significant investments in original programming and sports. So in other words, we're already factoring that into the mid- to high single-digit outlook and, because we know that we've got several components of programming expenses that are growing more slowly than that, are either flat or low single digits. So we do expect overall programming costs to increase, but we think they're going to be at a very measured and controlled pace. And obviously, beyond programming costs, we are looking to restrain growth in all non-revenue-generating expenses, and you saw that again and again this quarter, so.","Michael Nathanson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","And John, that's on a reported basis. Your guidance, as reported, mid-single-digit programming expense growth?","John K. Martin","Correct, on a [indiscernible].","Michael Nathanson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay, okay. And Jeff, can you just go back to...","John K. Martin","And so Michael, just to qualify, it's going to -- basic -- over an annual period, it's going to basically be about the same, reported and normalized.","Michael Nathanson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay. And Jeff, the last question is about the value of A titles going up in the world [ph], and that's totally true. But the question I had, though, as as a buyer of syndicated content at Turner, does your definition of A titles change over time? Like what was considered an A title 2 years ago? [Indiscernible] do you believe now [indiscernible] anything about that?","Jeffrey L. Bewkes","[Indiscernible] So company A titles, let's take Two and a Half Men. I mean, Two and a Half Men, Big Bang -- Two and a Half is on Fox, Big Bang is on FX, Big Bang is on TBS. Clearly, extremely successful and valuable, holding up well on whichever networks they go to. So that's a very healthy ecosystem. It's a very good part of your programming mix for our basic channel. That's comedy. So as we know, they've been resilient for decades. Dramas are kind of interesting. It's a bigger field. We certainly think titles like Mentalist, Hawaii Five-0 are A titles. There are plenty of buyers for them. The question that's going to emerge over time is that as cable networks, TNT, USA, FX, et cetera, move into drama production, it started at HBO, now everyone's doing it, you end up with a kind of a continuum of successful cable originals that, depending on the kind of niche appeal of a show on AMC versus a show on TNT, et cetera, that then starts to proliferate production into those cable-hour drama originals. It's -- then you still have the power and value of hit hours that come off of the big networks like Mentalist, like NCIS, but the relative performance of those kind of off-network-hour drama hits, still A titles, may change just because you have more and more kind of fragmentation and focused appeal of cable hours. So it's a moving spectrum. We feel very happy about our position at Warner's as the biggest producer and seller of those across the 5 broadcast networks. So we have a lot of them to put into syndication or cable networks or SVOD. And then on the Turner side, we have such an advantaged schedule of kind of -- we've got a very healthy schedule of both originals and acquired. We have great access to acquired hits. So as we figure out what the optimal mix of acquired dramas is versus cable original produced dramas, we're going to be able to dial it up and down on both sides. So that's essentially how we see it. And we've got a pretty good position and flexibility.","Operator","Our last question comes from Michael Senno from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Michael Senno - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Two quick ones, if I could. One, in terms of international, if you were to look at any M&A opportunities, would you provide some context on what attributes, what type of assets you may be looking at and what areas of the globe you're interested in complementing the current portfolio? And then second, just in terms of Time Warner being one of the more aggressive TV Everywhere early adopters, do you think a virtual MSO is the catalyst that's needed to really accelerate the adoption of TV Everywhere in its ultimate form?","Jeffrey L. Bewkes","No to that question, but we don't have theological views about it. On your international first question, we've said this a lot. And certainly, we can remember that. I'm not sure you should. But the areas that we focused on are ones where we think there are -- there is basically high secular growth, both in the underlying economies and in the video habits of the population; and then secondly, where there is reasonably hospitable rule of law and acceptance of nonlocal media network operators, full-on ownership. So basically, what we've said and still say is let's ask America, Central America, that's all of Latin America, it's been a very strong market for us. We have the leading network position of any nonlocal broadcaster network operator across all of Latin America. We've said Eastern Europe -- and while the Eastern Europe economic macro situation is a bit difficult, we've got an interesting position at CME that we're optimistic about, and we're in the midst of helping to strengthen the financial resources of CME. So we think that's going to be a great long-term network across numerous countries in Eastern Europe. And we think Eastern Asia -- we think Asia, South Asia and Southeast Asia, where we've got a lot of -- we're #1 actually in all of our HBO territories, including the Asian ones, and we've got some good positions with our Turner networks there, we think that's the other obvious growth area, so we're going to put more emphasis there.","Douglas Shapiro","Well, that's it.

And after their prepared remarks, our divisional CEOs, John Martin, Richard Plepler, and Kevin Tsujihara, and our general counsel, Paul Cappuccio, will join us for our Q&A session. Jeff?","Jeff L. Bewkes - Time Warner, Inc.","Thanks, Jessica, and thanks, everybody, for joining us this morning. We continued our momentum into 2017 and delivered a strong first quarter that sets us up very well to achieve our goals for the year. Our results highlight not just our focus on being home to the world's best video content but also on delivering that content to consumers in new ways and developing new revenue streams that will drive continued growth.","For the quarter revenues grew 6% to $7.7 billion. Adjusted operating income increased 7% to $2.2 billion. And adjusted earnings per share was up 11% to $1.66 a share.","These results reflect the successful execution of the strategy we've discussed with you before and which has served us and our shareholders very well. It starts with investing in great content, whether it's drama like Big Little Lies on HBO; action films like Warner Bros. Kong: Skull Island; comedies such as The Big Bang Theory and The Detour; sports like March Madness and the NBA on Turner; news on CNN; or kids with properties like The LEGO Batman Movie and Powerpuff Girls on Cartoon Network.","Another core part of our strategy is broadly distributing our content, as we move decisively to connect more directly with consumers and to give them new and better ways to experience our content and brands. As you know this consumer focus is an important strategic priority for us. And it's one of the key underpinnings of our merger with AT&T, which we remain on track to close by year end.","As we get closer to joining forces with AT&T, we're increasingly excited about the potential of our organizations to accelerate innovation together and to do it across the entire media and entertainment industry in ways that will excite and benefit consumers in an area where video consumption in is increasingly happening on demand and on multiple platforms.","At the same time we're focused on executing our business plans and doing what we do best. So let me share some recent highlights, starting with Turner, where the tremendous value of our premium high quality sports has been on display in the first part of the year.","As I mentioned we had another very successful presentation of the NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament across platforms. And that's in partnership with CBS, as you know. We posted record revenue, strong ratings growth, and record digital performance. This year was the second most watched NCAA tournament in 23 years, and viewership was up 16% over last year.","And we've transitioned from March Madness right into the NBA Playoffs on TNT, which kicked off a few weeks ago. We're already off to a great start, with viewership through the first round of the playoffs that are up 9%. And we're very excited to be the exclusive home to the Eastern Conference finals later this month.","Our commitment to high quality sports also extends overseas. Turner, in conjunction with Fox, recently announced its acquisition of the rights to First Division soccer in Argentina, further strengthening our leading position in Latin America. And so we're really pleased with our portfolio in a genre that resonates so passionately with both viewers and advertisers. Sports are what makes \u2013 are part of what makes TNT and TBS attractive to audience, but so is Turner's increasing focus on bold, exciting original series.","At TBS, we continue to see the benefits of the content refresh we began about a year ago, reinforcing TBS as a preeminent comedy brand. Our returning shows are building on last year's momentum. The new seasons of Angie Tribeca and The Detour have each grown audiences by double digits from last season. And we've already green-lit The Detour for season three. And Full Frontal with Samantha Bee has built tremendous followings, almost doubling its audience since the debut early last year. And with that growth, Samantha Bee ranked as the number one late night show across all networks among adults 18 to 34 in the first quarter.","We're earlier on in the content refresh at TNT, where in coming months we'll be rolling out new originals, including Will \u2013 that's a show about a young William Shakespeare \u2013 as well as two Warner Bros. productions, the premier of Claws, and the return of Animal Kingdom for its second season.","We also saw Adult Swim maintain its stronghold on millennial audiences. It's the number one ad-supported cable network among adults 18 to 34 for the 36th consecutive quarter. That's nine years. And there's already tremendous buzz for the return of one of Adult Swim's most popular shows, Rick and Morty, later this year. Last month, we unveiled a new virtual reality experience based on the show that lets each of you live the adventures of Rick and Morty. That's a great example of how we're focused on leveraging technology and building experience around our brands in ways that allow consumers to reach across platforms in a variety of devices and ways.","CNN continues to build on its strength as a trusted source for news and analysis in a complex world, growing its total day ratings among adults 25 to 54 by 21% in the quarter, and posting its most-watched first quarter since 2003. And CNN remains the undisputed leader in digital news, continuing to grow its multi-platform uniques and its video starts by solid double digits.","Turner is also one of the founding partners in Open A.P. That's a new platform announced last month that will make it easier and more efficient for advertisers to target audiences in a consistent way across TV networks, and offer our partners important third party verification. This is further evidence of Turner's innovation in the ad space. And advanced advertising is an important area where combining with AT&T can accelerate our progress and improve our chance for success.","Now moving over to Home Box Office. We continue to define what premium television means for the digital age with a mix of groundbreaking originals, Hollywood hits, and a broad range of other distinctive programming. Our limited series Big Little Lies, with a stellar cast, including Reese Witherspoon and Nicole Kidman, was both a critical and a cultural breakout, averaging over 8 million viewers per episode. And the final season of The Leftovers, produced by Warner Bros., has also received tremendous critical acclaim. And viewership for its premiere episode grew 26% from last season. Other standouts in the quarter at HBO were Last Week Tonight with John Oliver, which is having its most-watched season to date, and Real Time with Bill Maher, where viewership is up 22% this season.","Last month, we also had much anticipated returns of new seasons of comedies Veep and Silicon Valley, while Girls wrapped up its run with its most watched season finale since season one. And we're already in development on two new projects with Lena Dunhan. So we're excited about building on the great success of Girls.","We're now putting the finishing touches on season seven of Game of Thrones, which returns in July. And later this year, we'll also premier The Deuce, a new drama from David Simon, creator of The Wire. And that's set in the gritty streets of New York in the 1970s and 1980s, and it stars James Franco.","As I've mentioned before, HBO's originals are so good they can overshadow the powerful lineup of hit Hollywood movies that rounds out HBO's programming lineup, thanks to our output deals with top studios like Warner Bros. In fact, Batman v Superman, The Legend of Tarzan, and Suicide Squad, all three from Warner's, were the most viewed Saturday night film premieres on HBO over the past six months.","And we continue to see big Hollywood hit films like Batman v Superman gross over 20 million viewers during their initial run on HBO. So we're really pleased with the value that HBO is bringing to its subscribers and the exciting lineup that it has planned for the rest of 2017 and the years beyond.","Now let's turn to our studio, Warner Bros., which remains the number one supplier of broadcast television for the current season, which includes the strong results of our lineup on the CW, where total viewing is up 16% this season across all CW platforms.","On the film side at Warner's, the first quarter was highlighted by the strong global performance of Kong: Skull Island and The LEGO Batman Movie. And we're also very excited about Warner's slate for the rest of the year, which includes Dunkirk from legendary director Christopher Nolan and the next two installments in our DC franchise. Wonder Woman comes to theaters June 2 and Justice League will hit theaters in the fall.","As we did highlight before, our focus on franchises like DC Entertainment encompasses not just film and TV but also consumer products and video games. And a great example of that is Injustice 2, which is set for release on May 16. And we anticipate will be one of the cornerstones of a very strong year for our games business.","Finally I want to update you on some of our efforts to harness technology to directly reach audiences. Last month Turner and Warner Bros. jointly launched a new kids subscription VOD service under the Boomerang brand that features our company's deep library of iconic animated content as well as fresh, new originated animated fair that will debut weekly. And lastly, Warner has announced it's developing two series for a DC-branded over-the-top service we plan to launch next year.","These are great examples of how we're investing in both high quality content as well as in the technology and new capabilities to make sure we get that content to consumers wherever and whenever they want.","The Boomerang subscription VOD service and the upcoming DC digital products are both powered by DramaFever, which Warner's acquired last year. Similarly, we've been increasingly leveraging the capabilities of iStreamPlanet, which Turner acquired in 2015, across a range of live sports properties, including March Madness Live and NBA LEAGUE PASS.","Among our over-the-top offerings, the Boomerang service joins FilmStruck, our arthouse film service that Turner launched last year; Warner Archive and DramaFever, both at Warner Bros.; and of course HBO's over-the-top products, which continued to grow subscribers at a very healthy pace in the quarter. These all reflect our growing recognition of the importance of delivering great experiences to consumers alongside our great content and doing it across distribution channels. And so joining with AT&T will expand our capabilities in this area, allowing us to significantly accelerate our efforts to deliver consumers more innovative products.","As you can see we had a very active quarter. And we have a lot of momentum across our businesses. Thanks again for listening, and I'll turn it over to Howard.","Howard M. Averill - Time Warner, Inc.","Thank you, Jeff, and good morning. I'll begin by referring to the first slide of our presentation, which is now available on our website. We are off to a terrific start in 2017, posting our highest quarterly adjusted operating income ever, as we continue to benefit from growing global demand for our high quality content.","Revenues grew 6%, and adjusted operating income was up 7%. Total expenses increased 5% as we continued to make significant investments in content across our businesses. And that was partly balanced by our ongoing focus on constraining overhead costs.","Adjusted EPS grew slightly faster at 11% and included an approximately $0.07 benefit from the adoption of new guidance on the tax accounting of equity-based compensation. So we've carried our operating momentum into 2017 and remain focused on executing our strategy. And we remain on track to deliver on the outlook for high single digit growth in adjusted operating income that we laid out at the start of the year, which I'll touch on more throughout my presentation.","Now turning to the segment highlights. I'll start at Turner, where we continue to benefit from strong subscription revenue trends as we invest in great content, new capabilities, and innovative business models to position the business for long term success. Subscription revenues increased 12% in the quarter. Domestic affiliate revenues were up a robust 13%, marking our fifth consecutive quarter of domestic growth in the teens. And we remain on track for domestic subscription revenue growth to be solidly in the double digits for the remainder of the year.","International subscription revenue grew in the mid-single digits with particular strength in Latin America. Total advertising decreased 2%, and domestic advertising was down a similar amount, both below our expectations. That was in part because of some rating softness.","In addition, during the NCAA tournament, CBS aired games with more favorable matchups, drawing higher viewership than we initially projected. And because of how we account for the NCAA deal, that resulted in Turner recognizing less ad revenue than anticipated related to the NCAA tournament in the first quarter. But keep in mind based on the structure of the collaborative arrangement with CBS, the shift in revenue recognition does not impact our bottom line. So this year's tournament was again very successful with strong ratings growth and record revenues across both linear and digital, further reinforcing the value of our premium sports portfolio.","Moving on. International advertising was up in the mid-single digits and was also led by healthy growth in Latin America as well as in Europe. Turning to the second quarter, we've seen overall market demand moderate a bit relative to the strength we saw over the past year, although scatter pricing remains healthy.","Looking specifically at Turner we expect total advertising revenue to be down this quarter, since we have an approximately 700 basis point negative impact from the shift of the NCAA Final Four and championship games from Turner to TBS. And excluding the NCAA shift, we expect total advertising revenue to be about flat in the quarter.","Adjusted operating income was down 4%. That's a reflection of significantly higher programming costs, investments in new digital initiatives, and higher marketing spend. Programming expenses grew 17% due to the increased costs associated with the first year of our new NBA deal and higher original programming expenses. And as we've discussed, we expect the new NBA deal will also have a material impact on programming costs in the second quarter.","Still, Turner is set up to have another good year. And we're confident that the investments we're making across the business, combined with continued strong execution, leave Turner well-positioned to sustain healthy growth trends long term.","Turning now to HBO, where the strength of the brand and the global demand for its premium content translated into record quarterly profit and is contributing to solid subscriber growth year to date, setting HBO up for accelerating subscription revenue growth. Total subscription revenues increased 5% in the quarter, right in line with our expectations. Domestic sub revenues were also up in the mid-single digits, similar to recent quarters. International subscription revenue increased in the double digits, as we benefited from healthy demand for our OTT products in Europe.","Looking ahead, we're seeing better subscriber performance at our traditional distributors as we begin to benefit from our new affiliate deals. And we expect that to continue improving throughout the year. When combined with continued healthy growth for our OTT products and solid international trends, we expect subscription revenue growth to accelerate into the high single digits in the second quarter, and to remain strong throughout the year. So we're very confident in delivering the high single digit growth for the year that we previously discussed.","Content and other revenues were down slightly in the quarter, due to the timing of home entertainment releases. That was largely offset by healthy growth in international licensing revenues, as demand for HBO's original content around the world remains robust.","Adjusted operating income was up a very strong 22% in the quarter, as total expenses declined 5%. That was related to lower distribution cost associated with the decline in home video revenue and lower programming expenses. Programming costs declined 2% as a result of the timing of the reduction in amortization, which was recognized in the second quarter of 2016. Excluding the lower amortization, programming expenses would have been up high single digits, as we continue to invest in new original content like Big Little Lies and The Young Pope, as well as higher acquired (20:43) programming expenses tied to the delivery of major theatrical titles.","Overall, HBO is off to a great start to the year. And with a strong pipeline of content and accelerating subscription revenue trends, HBO is set up for very healthy growth in adjusted operating income in 2017.","Moving on to Warner Bros., where we also had a tremendous first quarter, with revenues up 8% and adjusted operating income increasing 20%, led by our TV and theatrical businesses. Revenues and associated profits in our TV business grew well into the double digits, as we benefited from strong growth in licensing revenue related to a few catalog titles, including Friends, and continued healthy demand internationally. This reinforces the staying power and value of the biggest hits, which bodes well for Warner Bros. going forward as a leading producer of TV shows.","The strong performance on global demand for hit content is also evident at our theatrical business. In the first quarter, we benefited from the box office releases of The LEGO Batman Movie and Kong: Skull Island. We also posted strong home entertainment results, with revenues up 15%, including over 40% growth in EST [electronic sell through]. That was led by last year's franchise films, with the home entertainment release of Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, as well as carryover revenues from Suicide Squad.","We expect to maintain the momentum in our theatrical business as our franchise release slate continues with Wonder Woman next month and Justice League later this year. And we should continue to see the benefit in home entertainment and TV licensing as these films move through those windows.","Turning to games. We faced difficult comparisons in the quarter. and we did not release any major console games. So as expected, revenues declined. But with two franchise console releases on this year's slate, starting with Injustice 2 later this month, we expect significant growth in our games business in 2017.","So Warner Bros. has great momentum and is executing at a very high level. And with its strong franchise-led theatrical and games slates, combined with healthy trends in the TV business, Warner is positioned to deliver another year of strong adjusted operating income growth.","Turning to the next slide. Free cash flow in the quarter almost doubled compared to last year, totaling close to $1.4 billion. In addition to the growth in adjusted operating income, working capital was a significantly lower use of cash in the quarter. Working capital benefited from the positive impact to accounts receivable from the strong performance of Warner Bros. theatrical and home entertainment slates in the fourth quarter, as well as the timing of production spend. So we had a strong first quarter of cash generation. And we expect another year of healthy free cash flow.","Looking at our balance sheet. We ended the first quarter with approximately $21.8 billion of net debt, down about $1 billion compared to the end of 2016. That's primarily a result of our strong free cash flow generation. As a result, our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 2.6 times, below our target leverage ratio of 2.75 times. And we expect our leverage ratio will continue to fall through the year as a result of discontinuing share repurchases in connection with entering into the merger agreement with AT&T.","So overall, we're very pleased with our strong financial results in the first quarter. And that keeps us on pace for the outlook we laid out in February for full year adjusted operating income growth in the high single digits based on current exchange rates. We continue to expect growth for the remainder of 2017 to be weighted to the second half of the year due to the timing of expenses at Turner.","Looking specifically at the second quarter, as we planned for, Turner will see the biggest impact related to its new contract with the NBA. And we expect that to contribute to total programming cost growth of approximately 20%.","We also plan to continue investing in new digital initiatives, including the Boomerang branded SVOD service we recently launched, and in marketing to support upcoming original programming like season two of Animal Kingdom and the debuts of Claws and Will on TNT. So as a result of these factors we expect adjusted operating income to decline in the second quarter for both Turner and the total company with both returning to very healthy growth in the second half of the year.","Overall, we continue to make great progress on our key strategic initiatives across the company. And we're confident that with our continued investments in high quality content and new digital initiatives and business models, we're well-positioned to sustain our momentum and deliver strong financial results in 2017 and for many years to come.","Now I'll turn it back to Jessica for Q&A.","Jessica L. Holscott - Time Warner, Inc.","Great. Thanks, Howard.

And how the current environment might influence the upfronts this year? I know you gave a lot of color on sort of the ratings and what you're seeing specifically there into Q2. I think you might've said you're seeing some moderation in overall ad spend. I guess if I heard that correctly, around what kind of \u2013 sort of any color on what's driving that?","Jeff L. Bewkes - Time Warner, Inc.","John, why don't you?","John K. Martin - Time Warner, Inc.","Yeah. Hi, Alexia. It's John. Listen, let me begin by saying that I and Turner team remains pretty optimistic about the health of the overall U.S. ad market for the full year. But I think there are a few factors to consider. So let me just go through them, and I'll do it reasonably quickly.","I mean not to repeat everything that Howard just said. But while the news category in the second quarter remains incredibly, incredibly strong, we have seen, and it'd be particularly in the beginning of the quarter, somewhat of a moderation in a bit of the strength as compared to the year ago. And we think there's a few factors that are contributing to that.","Given some uncertainty in the economy we think that advertisers are holding back a little bit. And they're taking a little bit more of a wait-and-see approach. And in addition, a number of large advertisers saw fewer product launches early in the year, which have impacted categories like tech, autos, and pharma, which were stronger a year ago. So I think that is probably more timing related as opposed to something that's purely cyclical.","We've seen the market move in cycles. But given the reach of TV and our innovative targeting products and high quality programming lineup, we continue to believe we're pretty well positioned.","And also I think interestingly enough in the most recent weeks, as we get deeper into the quarter, we have seen the entertainment marketplace actually improve modestly, as compared to what it looked like in the beginning of the second quarter. And we're experiencing elevated level of activities with continuing strong pricing.","The sports marketplace is a little bit fragmented. There's a lot of inventory. And the heightened political climate continues to benefit CNN, resulting in news market moving early, and there's a lot of demand.","I mean the last thing I would say \u2013 because just I listed through a bunch of stuff, so I apologize if I just rambled through it \u2013 this time of the year we always see posturing and positioning going into the upfront. So we expect the upfront is going to be healthy. And I think it's hard, particularly in the second quarter, to look at it as being a sustainable trend, because I think a lot of advertisers are looking at their budgets and figuring out how they want to play in the upfront.","So we continue to remain optimistic. And we don't see anything that's going to be problematic for us. And we're going to continue to try to lead the industry with our innovative ad products to try to take as much share as we can.","Alexia S. Quadrani - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you for all that color. Just a quick follow-up. And do you think your open app (sic) [Open A.P.] (29:25) will be a \u2013 play a big role in the upfronts this year? Do you think it's too early?","(29:32 \u2013 29:35)","Jessica L. Holscott - Time Warner, Inc.","Open A.P.?","Alexia S. Quadrani - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah, Open A.P.","John K. Martin - Time Warner, Inc.","I mean, look, we're really excited that we've developed this early consortium along with Viacom and Fox because \u2013 and we're excited that we were able to announce it ahead of the upfront, because I do think it's going to begin \u2013 it's probably not going to have a meaningful impact this year, but it's a beginning.","And it achieves two things that we hope are going to facilitate the adoption of audience based ad buying. And for those who may not realize what audience based ad buying is, it essentially is going to be a big boom to our industry over time, because it'll essentially make us day part agnostic, demo agnostic, and network agnostic, which we think is going to be critical to move the business forward.","The Open A.P. platform provides advertisers with a standardized way to create audience based targets and reporting through an independent third party. So Open A.P. is going to make it more efficient for advertisers to buy audience targeting products at scale across programmers and increases transparency and verification, something the advertising community has been asking for, which has been a shortcoming frankly of a lot of the digital companies.","So far, early days, it's received an incredibly positive response from the ad community. And combined with the benefits of our advanced ad products, we think this initiative is really going to help accelerate advertising.","Alexia S. Quadrani - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you very much.","Jessica L. Holscott - Time Warner, Inc.","Great, thanks. We're ready for the next question.","Operator","Next question is from the line of Michael Nathanson with MoffettNathanson.","Michael B. Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC","Thanks. I have two quick ones on strategy. One for Richard and one for John. Richard, there's some reports earlier, I guess this quarter, that HBO was pulling some content off of Amazon Prime. And I wonder if you update us on that relationship? And how you think about Amazon Prime as a home for HBO shows?","And for John, I think earlier this quarter too, you guys bought Champions League football \u2013 soccer \u2013 for Turner domestically. That's a bit of a switch, given that you've always bought big, high profile U.S. events. So give us a sense of how maybe your sports strategy is changing domestically?","Richard L. Plepler - Time Warner, Inc.","Thank you, Michael. It's Richard. Well, as you know we announced in December our HBO deal distributed through Amazon Prime channels. And we have seen enormous momentum there. As we have by the way across all of our digital platforms, including DIRECTV NOW.","So as we see the progress and the sub-revenue acceleration in our digital business, I don't think you're going to see us extend or expand our relationship with our library of programming on Amazon. And we have no plans to do that beyond the end of the date, which is the end of next year.","Michael B. Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC","Thanks.","John K. Martin - Time Warner, Inc.","Thanks, Michael. It's John. Listen, with respect to the soccer rights that you were referring to, unfortunately I can't specifically comment, because at this point it's only press speculation.","But broadly speaking, our sports strategy is unchanged. And it's long focused on high quality, popular sports with the overwhelming majority of the value coming from championship, tournament, or playoff games. And so we're always open to opportunities that would fit that criteria and where we think we can earn an attractive return on investment.","Last point I would make is, as we think about securing sports rights in the future, multi-platform rights are going to become more and more important. So I'll leave it at that.","Michael B. Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC","Okay. Thanks, John.","Jessica L. Holscott - Time Warner, Inc.","Thanks, Michael. We're ready for the next question.","Operator","Next question is from the line of Omar Sheikh with Credit Suisse.","Omar Sheikh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Thanks, everyone. Just a couple. Maybe for John to start with, going back to Open A.P. I wonder if you could just give us a sense of sort of what impact you expect the platform to have? Will you be pushing for higher CPMs on the inventory that you're selling that's more targeted? Or will you think \u2013 do you think you'll use it to reduce ad loads? Sort of sense of some color on that would be helpful.","And then just a question for Kevin if I could. Kevin, you talked in the past about potentially introducing a premium VOD window domestically. I wonder whether you could just update us on where are your discussions on the circuits? And what you think might be the right model that will get traction going forward? Thanks.","Jessica L. Holscott - Time Warner, Inc.","Why don't...","John K. Martin - Time Warner, Inc.","So, Omar, it's John. And we're laughing here, because if you could witness, we've got these window washers banging and...","Jeff L. Bewkes - Time Warner, Inc.","We can barely hear you.","John K. Martin - Time Warner, Inc.","So we can barely hear the questions. Like, everything is working perfectly here. So I think I heard your question and I'll \u2013 and let me address the idea of commercial ad moves.","Overall, we've been talking about how increasingly the consumer experience is critical for us to be able to compete against particularly all platforms. And starting with TNT's Good Behavior and Animal Kingdom last year, and going forward all of our new originals on TNT are going to have limited commercial interruption.","The goal is to offer a much, much more engaging viewer experience and an ad experience for consumers that adds more value for our advertising partners. And so far the results are very, very encouraging. More viewers are watching through the ad breaks. Our research indicates higher consumer satisfaction. Brand awareness and ad recall are up. So we're delivering more value to our partners and viewers.","And separately, starting in the fourth quarter of last year, we reduced our ad loads on truTV in half. And it's been extremely well received by advertisers. And we're seeing better and higher pricing. So the change has been essentially revenue neutral, which we see as a positive. And we expect to continue to experiment more and more with ad loads over time.","Jeff L. Bewkes - Time Warner, Inc.","That was \u2013 okay. The other one? What was the...","Jessica L. Holscott - Time Warner, Inc.","Premium viewing.","Jeff L. Bewkes - Time Warner, Inc.","Premium \u2013 boy.","Unknown Speaker","Really the windows. (35:44)","John K. Martin - Time Warner, Inc.","Just kind of an update on where we're at? I had a hard time hearing exactly what your question. Could you repeat it please?","Omar Sheikh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Yeah, sure. I noticed you could be vocal, Kevin, in the past about the consumer desire for an earlier window for home consumption of movie content. I'm just wondering where your discussion is right now with the circuits? What do you think is the sort of the model that will get most traction with the circuits?","Kevin Tsujihara - Time Warner, Inc.","Great. So, I don't really have a lot to add to what I've already said. We continue to be having constructive discussions with the exhibitors to create a new window that will be a \u2013 as you said, the model will be a premium video on-demand model that hopefully will be beneficial. And we think will be mutually beneficial to both of our businesses, both our business and exhibitors' business. And I think we're making good progress.","We really do believe that, by giving consumers more flexibility and more options when the awareness of the films is the highest, early on, earlier \u2013 forward, will actually create, overall, a bigger pie versus a smaller pie. So we're really excited about this opportunity.","Omar Sheikh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Thanks, all.","Jessica L. Holscott - Time Warner, Inc.","Great. Thanks. I think we're ready for the next question.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Jessica Reif Cohen with Bank of America.","Jessica Reif Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I have a couple of like questions. On, just going back to the advertising topic, you mentioned AT&T Time Warner ad side \u2013 the benefits are from an ad platform. Can you \u2013 and actually, I guess, layering on the ad consortium, can you talk about how you see the addressable market developing? Over what timeframe? When will it ramp, and what is \u2013 I know, John, you said more of the benefit will be kind of in the \u2013 in coming years from the ad consortium. But just wondering how quickly you guys think your advertising focus \u2013 I mean not \u2013 focus is the wrong word. But addressability will change?","And then the second question is, given that most of the big operators have \u2013 distributors have reported, the pay TV sub losses were a little bit surprising this quarter. What are your views on OTT kind of making up for these losses?","Jeff L. Bewkes - Time Warner, Inc.","Oh gosh, (38:01) you ought to do ads.","John K. Martin - Time Warner, Inc.","Yeah. Okay. Hi, Jessica. It's John. Listen, last year in our upfront, we did more than 100 audience-based deals. This year, as part of this year's upfront, we anticipate that that number is going to go up significantly. And we've already set a goal by the year 2020 that we anticipate that half of our advertising is going to be sold based on audiences. So that's a pretty aggressive goal and ambition.","And we think Open A.P. is going to really help facilitate, because everything that we've been hearing from the advertising community is, until you can segment audiences and define them the same way, and until data can somehow be more unified, it's going to be an impediment to the ramping of the way that this type of ad business is going to be sold. It's very difficult for me to forecast beyond what I just said to you, in terms of how fast this is going to ramp. But that's what I would \u2013 I mean that goal \u2013 I mean we look at 2020. If we're selling half of our advertising based on audiences, we're going to be in good shape.","Jeff L. Bewkes - Time Warner, Inc.","So, Jessica \u2013 you're answering a lot, John \u2013 is your question on subs for basic cable networks or for pay TV premium?","Jessica Reif Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Well, it would take (39:47) for both. And then, just on the advertising, just to clarify. How does the AT&T Time Warner platform combined affect advertising? Like, how do you see that combined platform playing out from an advertising perspective?","Jeff L. Bewkes - Time Warner, Inc.","Well you \u2013 in general, you may move towards more information. Supported advertising could allow you to target better, could allow you to do things that viewers find more relevant. And that could reduce ad loads in addition to making it better for consumers and more valuable for advertisers. That's generally the case. John, you want to add?","John K. Martin - Time Warner, Inc.","I think there were even comments made on the most recent AT&T earnings call, where Chairman [Randall] Stephenson said that in their own ad business, they've been essentially targeting customers using their own data. And they're experiencing revenues per impression that are 3x and 4x as compared to what you would traditionally consider for revenue impressions.","So their own experiments within their own company are yielding big results. And we are looking forward to the opportunity of working together with them to figure out what we might be able to bring to each other.","Jeff L. Bewkes - Time Warner, Inc.","On your question, let me start with basic ad supported networks. And then, Richard, you might want to comment on HBO. You got a lot of momentum on all kinds of new distribution.","In the basics, our outlook doesn't really assume a material benefit from these virtual MVPDs to overall sub levels yet. But we do see an opportunity for it. And they're gaining traction. It's mitigating some of the declines at the traditional providers. And it also proves there's consumer demand for smaller video packages with top networks, lower prices, depending what the appetite in a given household is, and better interfaces for VOD, search, and channel surfing.","So if new offerings can combine that kind of attractive pricing and packaging with the sort of new 21st century on-demand platforms, interfaces, and so on, then we think they can definitely attract new subs into the network system. And that's a great opportunity for Turner and every other network to find its natural audience. You want to add anything?","Richard L. Plepler - Time Warner, Inc.","Sure. Hey, Jessica. Look, all of our major affiliate deals are now done. And we're already beginning to see the momentum from those in packaging and marketing. And you're going to see increasing momentum in the second quarter and throughout the second half of the year.","So we couldn't be more excited on the traditional affiliate side, as we are on the digital side. And our sub revenue acceleration for the year is on track, as Howard said, to be in the high single digits.","Jessica Reif Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thank you.","Jessica L. Holscott - Time Warner, Inc.","I think we're ready for the next question, Rob.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Bryan Kraft with Deutsche Bank.","Bryan Kraft - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi. Good morning. I wanted to ask Richard and Howard each a question. Richard, just wanted to ask you how you think about your plans for continuing to grow the content slate at HBO in terms of genres. Is it more serialized dramas or comedies or kids, et cetera? What's the key to optimizing the slate for growth?","And, Howard, can you just elaborate on the NCAA tournament accounting? It sounded like you were saying that it pressured ad revenue in the quarter if I heard it correctly. Or was that just a reference to CBS capturing their share of the ad revenue? I wasn't sure there. So if you could clarify, that'd be great. Thanks.","(43:28 \u2013 43:32)","Howard M. Averill - Time Warner, Inc.","So it did impact advertising in the first quarter, Bryan. And again it goes back to the root cause of the better matchups were on CBS. So the way the deal and the accounting is set up, the revenue follows basically the rating points. So because they had better matchups, a little revenue went to CBS and less relative went us on the revenue line. But as I mentioned, the collaborative arrangement on a P&L basis, there's no net impact, because it nets out when you get to the total profitability of the property.","Bryan Kraft - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Okay.","Richard L. Plepler - Time Warner, Inc.","So, Bryan, it's Richard. Look, we're going to continue to do what we've always done, which is invest in the best premium content possible. Our brand is built around the curation of superior content. And all I can tell you is that the performance of our shows, whether it's Big Little Lies, whether it's Leftovers, recently our movie with Oprah [Winfrey], Henrietta Lacks, did extraordinarily well. [Bernie] Madoff is coming up later this month. Succession, our new show for next year. Here, Now with Alan Ball, our docs, our sports, the vibrancy, the extent and lift on ratings, we couldn't be more pleased.","I say all the time, it has the virtue of truth, which is every Friday there are four or five ideas inside our building that we didn't know about on Monday. So the line at our door with talent, with writers, with producers, it's bigger than it's ever been. We're going to press on that going forward. And fortunately I think we continue to be a place where talent wants to work and do its best work. And we're going to continue to make the kind of investments that we need to to continue our advantage in that area.","Bryan Kraft - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thanks.","Jessica L. Holscott - Time Warner, Inc.","I think we have time for one more question.","Operator","And the question will be coming from the line of Anthony DiClemente with Nomura.","Anthony DiClemente - Nomura Instinet","Thanks a lot. And just for John on the Turner network brands, there are examples recently of peers of yours in this space are consolidating their brands and moving kind of to where you guys are in terms of having affiliate fees concentrated in the top five or six flagship networks. As you look out over the next few years, does it makes sense for Turner to undergo any more consolidation in terms of network brands?","And then specifically as it relates to the TNT brand, what's your vision for that particular network's identity and content genre? And how it could evolve over the next few years? Thanks, John.","John K. Martin - Time Warner, Inc.","Thanks, Anthony. I think you \u2013 in the way you asked the question, you almost sort of gave me the answer, which is as we look across the landscape \u2013 and I've been pretty outspoken over the last number of years that there's a lot of networks that are in existence today that add no value to consumers, yet get paid affiliate fees. And in a perfectly competitive market those are eventually going to go away. That'll be good for us.","We have 10 network brands. We have three of the top 10, four of the top 20. truTV has grown five quarters in a row it's ratings. I think we've gotten incredibly popular networks and the most concentrated portfolio of popular networks in the United States. I don't see any need for further consolidation. I think other network groups are going to need to consolidate.","And as it relates to TNT, I'm really optimistic about the rebranding efforts that Kevin Reilly and the team, Sarah Aubrey is doing with TNT. I think last year was the really big rebrand year for TBS. And I couldn't be more pleased with how successful that's going.","And to reiterate what Jeff said in his proactive remarks, we're seeing returning shows actually grow ratings year on year, which you're not seeing a lot in the television landscape. And I think that's a testament to the quality of the shows themselves, plus the way that we've marketed them.","And this year you're going to see a number of really distinctive unique dramas on TNT that will be a bit of a departure from the type of original programs that were on in the past. They're going to have a much more distinctive voice. They will probably be much more even between male\/female. And they'll bring in younger audiences.","And we want TNT to be the place where people want to go to see great distinctive voice dramas. Drama category is very crowded, but I think we've got a great opportunity. We've got scale. And we've got lead position.","Jessica L. Holscott - Time Warner, Inc.","Great.","Anthony DiClemente - Nomura Instinet","Thanks, everyone.","Jessica L. Holscott - Time Warner, Inc.","So that wraps \u2013 sorry, did you have \u2013 were you going to say something, Anthony?","Anthony DiClemente - Nomura Instinet","I just said thank you.","Jessica L.

Welcome to Time Warner's first quarter earnings conference call. This morning we issued two press releases, one detailing our results for the first quarter and the other reaffirming our 2016 full-year business outlook.","Before we begin, there are two items I need to cover. First, we refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Schedules setting out reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our earnings release and trending schedules. These reconciliations are available on our website at www.TimeWarner.com\/investors. Reconciliations of our expected future financial performance are also included in the business outlook release that is available on our website.","Second, today's announcement includes certain forward-looking statements, which are based on management's current expectations. Actual results may vary materially from those expressed or implied by these statements due to various factors. These factors are discussed in detail in Time Warner's SEC filings, including its most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. Time Warner is under no obligation and in fact expressly disclaims any obligation to update or alter its forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.","I'll now turn the call over to Jeff Bewkes, Time Warner's Chairman and CEO, who will be followed by Howard Averill, Time Warner's CFO. After their prepared remarks, our divisional CEOs, John Martin, Richard Plepler, and Kevin Tsujihara, will join us for our Q&A session. Jeff?","Jeffrey L. Bewkes - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Mike, and thanks, everybody, for listening in and staying on the call through our medical report at the beginning.","We told you on our last call that we expected 2016 to be another standout year for Time Warner. And in recent years, as you all know, we've been investing aggressively in the very best content while moving quickly to take advantage of new distribution opportunities that are emerging around the world. At the same time, we've maintained our disciplined approach to cost controls and capital allocation in order to maximize shareholder returns, and we anticipated that that combination would allow us to continue to deliver industry-leading performance. That's exactly what you're seeing in our first quarter results.","Revenues increased 3% to $7.3 billion, and adjusted operating income grew 11% to $2 billion. Adjusted earnings per share grew 25% to $1.49 per share, and we also returned over $1 billion to shareholders in share repurchases and dividends.","In addition to strong financial results, we're off to a tremendous start this year from a content perspective. In just the past few weeks, we've had the buzzer-beating final game of March Madness on TBS, CNN's must-watch election coverage, a global hit from Warner Bros. in Batman v Superman, and the return of HBO's epic series Game of Thrones. Those are just a few examples of how our investments are translating into great content that deeply engages audiences across platforms and around the world.","But there are many more. Let me start with Turner. Once again, Turner had three of the top 10 basic cable networks in the U.S. and it continued to make progress on a multiyear transformation of its brands. The first quarter marked the start of TBS's repositioning as the place for young, fresh comedy, with the successful premieres of Angie Tribeca, Full Frontal with Samantha Bee, and Separation Anxiety. We followed those up last month with our new hit, The Detour. It's the biggest new comedy on cable this year.","The early results are very encouraging, with TBS ending the first quarter ranked as the number one ad-supported cable network in primetime among adults 18 to 49. And we have a number of additional distinctive shows on tap this year, including Wrecked, which will debut next month.","The first quarter also marked the start of an acceleration in Turner's domestic affiliate revenue growth, which we've been talking to you about now for some time. That acceleration underscores the strength of the Turner brands and the investments we've been making in them in recent years. One of our most important investments was March Madness. And last month, Turner brought the championship game of the tournament to cable for the very first time. This year's tournament was another great success, delivering both a stirring finale and record revenue. Recently, we agreed to build on that success by partnering with CBS to extend our television, digital, and marketing rights to the NCAA Tournament all the way through 2032.","Marquee live sports continue to grow in importance both to consumers and to advertisers. And combined with our extensive multiplatform rights, that gives us a lot of confidence we'll be able to generate a very attractive return on our investment in this unique property.","As March Madness wound down, the NBA Playoffs were just getting started. The NBA on TNT grew viewership double digits in the first quarter. And with the playoffs underway, we have a great platform for TNT's own drama-focused brand refresh, which starts with Animal Kingdom from Warner Bros. in June.","Nowhere is Turner's transformation more evident than at CNN, which more than doubled its primetime audience in the first quarter. CNN's ratings benefited from its own reliable coverage of the U.S. presidential race as well as from its continued success with original series. Those two areas overlapped in Race for the White House, which premiered as the most watched CNN original telecast ever.","Over at Home Box Office, I mentioned Game of Thrones already, which grew its opening night viewership double digits versus a year ago on a cross-platform basis. But it doesn't stop there. That same weekend, HBO was host to Beyonc\u00e9's headline-grabbing visual album, Lemonade, also the television premiere of Jurassic World, a world championship boxing match, and the return of our two hit comedies, Veep and Silicon Valley. It was a great example of the range and quality of the content that HBO delivers to its subs.","We're just as excited for what's still to come this year at HBO, including the second season of Ballers. That's our new series, started last year; a new series, Divorce, with Sarah Jessica Parker; and our limited series, The Night Of, which just previewed to a tremendous reception at the Tribeca Film Festival.","At Warner Bros., Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice set a record for a March opening weekend, and it's already Warner's biggest ever first quarter release. Even better, it's only the opening chapter of an exciting slate of DC Entertainment films that we think will captivate audiences globally for years to come. Next up is Suicide Squad this summer, followed by LEGO Batman, Wonder Woman, and Justice League, all in 2017. And as you know, these franchise films are the cornerstone of a strategy that's making DC a growth driver across film, television, digital, games, and consumer products.","Warner's has a lot more on deck, including J.K. Rowling's return to the big screen this November with Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them. Judging by the huge crowd since the opening last month of the Wizarding World of Harry Potter attraction in Hollywood, there are plenty of fans who are just excited as we are for the next installment of this great franchise.","In television, Warner's has built on its leading position in broadcast with three of the top five new series this season. That includes not only scripted series like the number one new show, Blindspot, but also unscripted series like Little Big Shots, which has already been picked up in two major international territories. Given the performance of Warner's current shows, with a record 21 renewals ahead of the upfront this year and a strong slate of pilots, Warner's is in a great position to once again lead the industry in broadcast series programming this coming season.","Now we're also expanding our production for cable and over-the-top [OTT] services. We have twice the number of new series orders for next season. So across the company, we're continuing to lead the way in producing groundbreaking content.","And to capitalize on the rapid shift to on-demand consumption and broadband delivery of video, we're focused on innovation both in the type of content we produce and how we get it to consumers. For example, on May 24, Turner is launching ELEAGUE. That's our professional competitive gaming league in partnership with WME | IMG.","In addition to its telecasts on TBS, ELEAGUE will have a significant digital component in partnership with Twitch. ELEAGUE reflects Turner's commitment to creating and delivering content for multi-platform audiences. That commitment is also reflected in Turner's other efforts to grow its presence outside the traditional television ecosystem, particularly in news and sports. CNN finished the quarter as the leading digital news brand in multi-platform video, and Bleacher Report remained number two online sports destination. We'll be ramping up investments in both of these properties over the next couple of years to further expand on their leadership positions.","HBO is also investing in content geared toward digital audiences by bringing on board talent like Bill Simmons and Jon Stewart. Any Given Wednesday with Bill Simmons does not debut until next month, but Bill is already making his mark with HBO's first after-show, After the Thrones. Like Animals, After the Thrones is debuting first on HBO NOW and HBO GO. We continue to see significant growth in both users and usage of our digital platforms, and we expect that to continue with our recent expansion of HBO NOW to Microsoft's Xbox and to Samsung's smart TVs.","We're also expanding the reach of HBO's OTT products internationally. In the first quarter, HBO LAG [Latin America Group] launched an OTT service in Mexico, and HBO announced plans for OTT launches later this year in Spain, Brazil, and Argentina. That's all part of a broader push across the company to develop new services and capabilities.","We talked to you previously about Warner's SVOD [Subscription Video On Demand] investments in Asia. In February, Warner Bros. announced the acquisition of DramaFever to further bolster our OTT capabilities. And just last week, Turner announced its first domestic SVOD service, FilmStruck, which will build on the curation expertise of TCM to target enthusiasts of independent, foreign, and art house films.","At the same time, we're deeply committed to strengthening our core networks and to helping our traditional distribution and network partners improve their products to satisfy consumers' desire for on-demand content. HBO and Turner have been at the forefront of providing on-demand and multi-platform rights to our partners. And in March, Warner's announced a new deal granting ABC Network in-season stacking rights for its new series.","So we're making progress on many fronts both inside and outside the traditional ecosystem. We're seeing the benefits of strong execution of our strategy and how that can continue to deliver superior returns for our shareholders. We've also ramped up our investments and our pace of innovation to meet the high expectations of today's and tomorrow's consumers. And that's why we're so confident about the rest of 2016 and beyond.","Thanks for listening, and let me turn it over to Howard Averill.","Howard M. Averill - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Jeff, and good morning. I'll begin by referring to the first slide of our presentation, which is now available on our website.","Starting with consolidated results, we're off to a terrific start in 2016, with growth across each of our divisions. And that resulted in a quarterly record for adjusted operating income, which reached over $2 billion, and a 25% increase in adjusted EPS. Total revenues grew 3%, and adjusted operating income was up a very healthy 11%, with margins expanding 200 basis points. And we did that while continuing to grow our investments in programming and marketing at HBO and Turner. That was balanced by lower costs at Warner Bros., mainly due to the timing of our theatrical slate in light of continued company-wide focus on constraining growth and overhead costs.","And we were able to once again leverage our positive operating results into even faster growth in adjusted EPS. That was partly due to our ongoing share repurchase program. During the quarter, we bought back $700 million of our shares. And combined with our dividend, we've returned close to $1.3 billion to shareholders year to date. This morning, we reaffirmed our guidance for 2016 adjusted EPS to be in the range of $5.30 to $5.40. So we're pleased with how we're executing and have significant operating momentum across our businesses, which gives us great confidence in our outlook for the rest of this year and beyond.","Now turning to the segment highlights, I'll start at Turner, where the benefit from our domestic affiliate renewal cycle and continued strong advertising performance resulted in our best quarter of revenue growth in almost three years and record adjusted operating income. Subscription revenues were up a strong 11% in the quarter, and that included a close to 300 basis point headwind from FX. Domestic subscription revenues grew close to 15%, as we benefited from the higher rates we achieved in our recent affiliate agreements. Excluding a 15 percentage point drag from FX, international subscription revenue growth was in the high single digits. While there may be quarter-to-quarter fluctuations due to a variety of factors, domestic sub revenue growth is on track to be in the low teens for the year, and we expect total subscription revenue growth through the rest of the year to be similar to the first quarter.","Advertising was up a solid 5%, despite approximately 150 basis points of headwind from FX. Domestic advertising grew in the mid-single digits. That was due to double-digit growth across Turner's linear and digital properties for both news and sports, including strong growth from the NCAA Tournament. International advertising was also healthy in the quarter, up high single digits excluding a close to 15 percentage point drag from FX.","Looking to the second quarter, scatter pricing at our domestic entertainment networks continues to be up well in the double digits versus the upfront and will benefit from the NCAA Championship Game, while FX remains a headwind. As a result, we expect total advertising revenue growth to be in the mid to high single digits. And with a healthy ad market, the continued rollout of our industry-leading advanced advertising products, and momentum at many of our brands, every indication points to a very strong upfront this year.","Adjusted operating income increased 10% and margins expanded 100 basis points. And we achieved that even as we continued to invest in programming and marketing, as Turner kept all other expenses close to flat in the quarter. Programming expenses increased 4%, mainly due to our investments in sports and election coverage. And marketing costs were up well into the double digits to support the TBS and TNT rebrands.","So Turner is off to a terrific start in 2016 and is well positioned for another strong year, and we're confident the investments we're making across our brands will enhance our competitive position and allow us to sustain strong revenue trends and attractive financial results in the future.","Turning now to HBO, where we continue to see very strong global demand for the product in the form of both subscriber growth and content licensing, domestic subscription revenue growth was in the mid-single digits, and that included a sequential increase in the benefit from HBO NOW. However, despite year-over-year subscriber growth, we continued to experience headwinds from fewer revenue-generating subscribers at certain MVPDs [Multi-channel Video Programming Distributors], which has been partially driven by M&A activity. Over time, we actually see an opportunity to help those partners grow their businesses while accelerating our own revenue growth.","Content and other revenue increased 23% in the quarter. That was mainly due to higher international licensing revenues, as HBO continues to benefit from its ability to effectively monetize its original content around the world.","Across HBO's international networks, including unconsolidated JVs, revenues were up in the double digits excluding the impact of FX. And international subscriber trends remained strong, with healthy growth across all regions, especially LatAm and Europe.","Adjusted operating income was up 6% in the quarter, and that was despite a double-digit increase in programming costs as well as continued investments in marketing and technology related to HBO NOW. The increase in programming expense is related to new original programming like Vinyl and Sesame Street as well as programming charges related to series in development.","Overall, HBO is off to a great start to the year. We're excited about our upcoming programming lineup. And with continued investments in the brand and product, we're in a great position to capitalize on the significant global opportunities for premium services.","Moving on to Warner Bros., where we posted record first quarter adjusted operating income, on the TV side, we benefited from higher international licensing revenues. And at our Games business, the continued success of our LEGO and Mortal Kombat franchises helped drive another quarter of double-digit revenue growth. Despite the strong box office opening of Batman v Superman late in the quarter, total revenues were down modestly due to the difficult theatrical comparisons from last year's release of American Sniper and carryover from the final installment of The Hobbit.","Across theatrical and TV, home entertainment revenues were down 12%, as last year's quarter benefited from the home video release of the final Hobbit. Despite the difficult comparisons, EST [Electronic Sell-Through] revenues were still up mid-single digits in the quarter, and we expect our home entertainment trends to improve in the back half of the year as a result of a stronger theatrical slate.","Adjusted operating income grew close to 30%. In addition to our strong Games performance, we also benefited from lower P&A spending as a result of fewer releases this quarter.","So Warner Bros. has great momentum, and we're just getting started on the theatrical side with Suicide Squad and Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them leading what should be a very strong lineup for both the remainder of this year and many years to come. Along with our strength in television and video games, that gives us great confidence in Warner's ability to continue delivering attractive growth well into the future.","Turning to the next slide, free cash flow totaled over $700 million, which was down from a year ago due to a significant increase in working capital. That was largely related to increased production spend at Warner Bros. as well as the performance of its theatrical product in the fourth quarter of last year and the related impact on accounts receivable. Even so, we still expect very strong cash flow in 2016, driven by strong profit growth and another year of high conversion.","Now looking at our balance sheet, we ended the first quarter with $22 billion of net debt, up $500 million compared to the end of 2015. That's primarily a result of our ongoing commitment to direct returns to shareholders, which is a key component of our balanced approach to capital allocation. We ended the quarter just above our target leverage ratio of 2.75 times, but we remain committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet and our investment-grade credit ratings and are on track to return to our target by the end of this year.","With that, let's move on to the final slide, which looks at our outlook for 2016. We got off to a strong start in the first quarter, delivering growth across each of our businesses and setting us up for another very good year. That's reflected in our outlook for adjusted EPS of $5.30 to $5.40, which we reaffirmed this morning. And based on current rates, that includes an estimated $0.10 headwind from foreign exchange.","Looking ahead, we still expect growth in adjusted OI to be weighted toward the back half of the year. Specifically in the second quarter, we continue to see positive trends in both advertising and subscription revenue, and global demand for our content remains very strong. But there are several items that we expect to weigh on adjusted operating income, including the timing of content licensing revenue, the comparison to strong video games profits at Warner's in last year's quarter, and programming investments at Turner.","Despite that, we're on track for another year of very healthy growth in adjusted operating income and solid double-digit earnings growth, extending our history of delivering consistently strong operating and financial performance. And with Turner's revenue trends accelerating, HBO positioned to accelerate its subscription revenue growth over the next couple of years, and Warner's in the early stages of an exciting theatrical slate, we feel we're in a great position to continue delivering strong results for many years to come.","With that, I'll turn it back to Mike to start the Q&A.","Michael Kopelman - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, Howard. Operator, can we please open the queue for questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from Michael Nathanson from MoffettNathanson. Your line is now open.","Michael B. Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC","Thanks. I have one for Kevin and then one for Richard. I'm going to hold off my St. Jude's questions for later. Kevin, as Jeff just said, ABC and Warner's announced a deal in March that gives ABC in-season stacking rights to all new series. So I wonder, can you talk about whether or not that's going to be a standard, do you think, for other networks going forward? And then how do your back-end economics \u2013 are affected by giving people more early window rights? What does that mean for your SVOD windows and maybe the second and third windows after that?","Kevin Tsujihara - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Warner Bros. Entertainment, Inc.","We don't think it impacts the back-end value of the rights. We've given Turner stacking rights. We sold stacking rights to FOX last year on Lucifer. And we feel really good about the deal we did with ABC. I can't speak for the rest of the industry, but I know that we are having a number of conversations with all the networks about stacking rights and think that it's certainly a good thing for consumers.","Michael B. Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC","And will you only sell rights going forward with stacking rights included? Is that your template, or are you flexible depending on what the networks need?","Kevin Tsujihara - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Warner Bros. Entertainment, Inc.","I think each conversation with every network is an individual conversation with them, and so I can't speak for every single show we're going to sell.","Michael B. Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC","Okay. And then, Richard, we've had a lot of questions about the timing of your next round of affiliate fee negotiations. Can you remind us what percentage of your footprint is coming due over the next few years? And is there any one year in general that's a bigger year for your next round of negotiations?","Richard L. Plepler - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Home Box Office, Inc.","Michael, look, as we've said before, a large percentage of our deals are up in the next couple of years, some of them toward the end of this year. We think that's a huge opportunity for us because some of the poorer performing affiliates are being acquired by some of the higher performing affiliates, and obviously we see that as a big opportunity going forward for revenue growth. And some of the better performing affiliates, those deals will come up in the next year or so, and we see an opportunity to monetize some of those subs as well. So you can look for the next 18 months to two years for the vast preponderance of our affiliate fees.","Michael B. Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC","Thanks, Richard.","Michael Kopelman - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, Michael. Operator, next question, please.","Operator","It comes from the like of Alexia Quadrani from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Alexia S. Quadrani - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you. My question is on Turner. You've increased your investments in some of the original programming, which I know you highlighted in your opening comment, with some of these premieres coming out recently. How are you trending I guess on this front? How have they been doing versus your plan, and I guess do you have any overall commentary on the upfront?","John K. Martin - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Turner Broadcasting System, Inc.","Thanks, Alexia. It's John. Listen, I think we are proceeding exactly on pace with our internal plan. And so if you think about it, Kevin Reilly, as the head of our entertainment networks, has been on the job for about a year, and it's really his new programming slate that's just beginning to roll out.","We did view 24 new seasons of owned original series on our domestic networks in the first quarter alone, and we have 20 more slated for the second quarter. And these new series hopefully give you a small sense for the bold, high quality and engaging programming that you can expect from Turner going forward. And we're very happy with the critical acclaim and the performance that these new shows are demonstrating across, frankly, all platforms, TV, digital, and social.","And just to add a little bit more flavor to that, premiering Angie Tribeca in a very new and unique way with a 25-hour commercial-free marathon brought about 36% new young audiences to network. Median age was about 10 years younger than our TBS median. And it continued its success in its regular season run, and it ranked number one on Monday nights across all of cable sitcoms.","I think it was Jeff that said we couldn't be more pleased than with the success of The Detour, which recently premiered and is reaching over 5 million viewers per episode across all of our TBS platforms, and it's ranked number one of the new comedy releases in adults 18 to 49. Full Frontal with Samantha Bee, huge critical and commercial success across all platforms. We're reaching around 3.5 million viewers and we're driving 30 million views on the show's YouTube channel. And that's really just TBS.","During the first quarter, we had new seasons of Impractical Jokers. And for those who can't actually DV, We Bare Bears and Steven Universe on Cartoon Network, and The Race for the White House and The Eighties on CNN. So we're driving, I think, a general improvement in the quality of our original programming across all of our networks, and we've got a lot more to come. And most notably, the TNT rebrand will begin later this year, and Jeff mentioned some of the shows that we're really excited about.","With respect to the upfront, I just would reiterate the enthusiasm that Howard suggested, which is that given the strong scatter where we're seeing some of our inventory sell for upwards of 30% to 50% higher than last year's upfront levels. And given low cancellations, we think all signs point to, frankly, the best upfront we will have seen in years. And we think our networks stand to gain at least our fair share of what happens in the upfront. And we think it spells very, very well for just television in general, as television is experiencing resurgence in the minds of brand advertisers, as we're delivering reach and increasing targeting and audience capabilities. So we're very, very optimistic.","Alexia S. Quadrani - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you very much.","Michael Kopelman - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, Alexia. Operator, next question, please.","Operator","It comes from the line of Doug Mitchelson from UBS. Your line is now open.","Doug Mitchelson - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks so much, two questions. One, Richard, you noted a lot of affiliate renewals coming up. Can you talk about how the environment for distribution renewals might have changed over time, what the give-and-take in negotiations might be in this next cycle? It seems like you're going in asking for an uplift with all the promotional subs at a higher level than you might have been in the prior cycles.","And for Kevin Tsujihara, Kevin, it seems you've got a pretty good line of sight on 2016 at this point. When you look out the next few years, do you still see continued strong growth from Warner's, and what are the key drivers of that? Thank you.","Richard L. Plepler - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Home Box Office, Inc.","It's Richard. Look, I think as I said earlier, a huge opportunity for us going forward because in the higher performing affiliates that are acquiring the weaker affiliates, the blended penetration is below industry average. That gives us an opportunity with our partners to grow together up to the better performing affiliates' penetration levels and beyond. So we see this as an opportunity for them and we see this as an opportunity for us. And listen, all negotiations are difficult, but we think this is going to be a win-win.","Doug Mitchelson - UBS Securities LLC","Okay.","Kevin Tsujihara - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Warner Bros. Entertainment, Inc.","We feel great about our \u2013 can you \u2013 let's move the mic so you can hear. We feel great about the long-term growth of Warner Bros., and we continue to feel that way. We're going to continue to grow, as we said in the past, our leading television business. We have 21 shows, as Jeff mentioned earlier, coming back, and there are still three or four more shows that might also get picked up, and we feel great about our pilots so far.","We're going to continue to build on the theatrical slate. We love the pipeline, and the foundation is going to be the franchises that we've talked about, DC, Fantastic Beasts, and LEGO. And we're going to continue to focus on margins. We think that we've done a very good job in reducing costs, but we think there's still work to do. So we feel really good about the long-term growth of Warner Bros.","Doug Mitchelson - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks, Kevin.","Michael Kopelman - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Operator, can we have our next question, please?","Operator","It comes from the line of Jessica Reif Cohen from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.","Jessica Jean Reif Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you. I have two separate questions. The first is for John or \u2013 I guess John. But following up on something Howard said, which was Howard mentioned the advanced advertising array of products, could you talk a little bit about what you're planning to do this year in terms of targeted or advanced advertising? And how different is it for television versus over-the-top? I know this is a long one question. But on over-the-top, will you participate in Hulu or not?","And then the separate second question is for Kevin. Do you think the sale of DreamWorks Animation will spark mid-size or other studio consolidation? And if yes, will Warner Bros. participate in consolidation?","John K. Martin - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Turner Broadcasting System, Inc.","Thanks, Jessica. I guess I'll start just taking it in the order that you asked the questions, and I appreciate the question. We're spending a lot of work, a lot of time, investment in increasing our capabilities in advertising. And frankly, we're holding ourselves accountable to lead the charge to modernize TV advertising by combining the unparalleled reach of television and the engagement of TV with the measurement and targeting capabilities of digital. And we are quickly evolving the advertising industry to simultaneously benefit our advertisers as well as improve our overall consumer experience, and we don't see these goals as being mutually exclusive. Frankly, what we're trying to do is combine the best of both TV and digital, uniting scale and targeting with top tier content, and that's one of the reasons why we're very bullish about the upfront.","In terms of our own new products, we've discussed before that we have built Oracle into Turner Data Cloud, which is the central repository of all of our consumer information. And that's helping us launch new innovative products that focus on analytics, targeting, and ROIs. So just the names of the products, of some of them, we've got individual products called Targeting Now, Audience Now, ROI Now, Provable ROI. And what all that means is that it's going to be targeting audience-based selling coupled with our data cloud and client insights. And I think there are going to be increasing opportunities over time, and that's going to be a major, major focus in our upfronts.","And then I think you asked specifically with respect to OTT. I think the opportunities to develop advanced targeting capabilities in OTT are absolutely there. They're available. That is assuming that the OTT offering is, in fact, ad-supported. FilmStruck, which is our first domestic offering, is going to be non-ad-supported, which is consistent with Turner Classic Movies. So I think the targeting opportunities will only grow over time, and we're still in the very early stages. So we believe that TV advertising has to evolve, but it's going to remain the most effective option for brand advertisers to convey their message at scale. And that's why we expect a resurgence in TV advertising, beginning at this year's upfront.","Jeffrey L. Bewkes - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So you had a question, there were several points. Is there a Hulu question, Jessica?","Jessica Jean Reif Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yes.","Jeffrey L. Bewkes - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","What was it?","Jessica Jean Reif Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Sorry, obviously, Hulu announced this week \u2013 and it can potentially be a really compelling product. And I was just wondering if you envision yourself participating in Hulu and the Hulu over-the-top service.","Jeffrey L. Bewkes - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I see. Okay, let me start. And, John, you may want to fill in. Just maybe, maybe we want our networks in every one of these packages. I think we ought to include that in a larger view of how the industry is evolving. And if you think about subscription VOD, it's been an opportunity that started with the first SVOD service, which is called HBO, a long time ago.","And what we're watching happen, and I think it probably did start with HBO a decade ago, is consumers want, they expect, they're going to demand SVOD access to all their favorite networks, all their favorite shows. And what we've been seeing as an evolution is the on-demand functionality and better guides are sprouting up, first at HBO, then at some of the broadband delivered services. And increasingly, you're seeing more full on-demand offerings of current exhibition networks and better interfaces, guides, and recommendation engines at places like Comcast, Verizon. Sling has one.","And for us with our networks, whether it's the Turner networks or the HBO networks, we've long said that we'd like our networks and their programming, including the debuts of current first season exhibitions like what John is talking about and what Richard has been building for years at HBO. We want them to be on-demand. And we would like to see most of our networks, whichever exhibition window, first run or syndication, to be on-demand. And we're basically in an enviable position that our networks, Turner and HBO, are among the most desired networks for consumers and therefore to be included in all these packages.","So you will hear I think increasingly of different packages with different network offerings that consumers can choose between at different price points available from existing cable, satellite, and telco distributors, increasingly from new virtual distributors, whether it be Hulu, whether it's Amazon, Apple, whoever comes in and creates packages for consumers. So I think what you're seeing is a very vibrant rebirth of the strength of TV networks and TV programming across all of these distribution platforms. And because of our \u2013 we've always taken the position, being the first to launch VOD, that we think more of it is better for consumers, and therefore we're going to try to be available in all the packages consumers are interested in.","Kevin Tsujihara - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Warner Bros. Entertainment, Inc.","As it relates to the DreamWorks Animation transaction, I don't think you're going to see significantly more consolidation. That being said, the business is getting more and more stratified. Big franchises are more valuable than ever. But I don't think there's a lot of those that are actually available at this point in time. And so I don't think that that's going to be a precursor to a lot of transactions.","Jeffrey L. Bewkes - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","One thing I should add; I should have said it. Let's not limit the VOD transformation to the United States. You're seeing very strong SVOD proliferation all over the world. And whether it's the Warner Tencent venture in China, whether it's some of our HBO overseas VOD services, whether it's companies like Sky and others in the UK, and in South America they're launching VOD, whether it's networks or programming, we're seeing our stuff going into all of these new platforms. And it's raising the value not only of our content if you think of it show by show, but also of our networks.","Jessica Jean Reif Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Jeff, one last follow-up, but is it all television, or do you think this is film-based as well?","Jeffrey L. Bewkes - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","You mean SVOD exhibition of films, because you have certainly have had that for more than a decade on HBO.","Jessica Jean Reif Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","But not so much outside the U.S.","Jeffrey L. Bewkes - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yes, you do. Kevin, you can add. You've got film licensing on SVOD all over the world.","Jessica Jean Reif Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay.","Kevin Tsujihara - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Warner Bros. Entertainment, Inc.","Yes, I think you're seeing \u2013 it's a critical component of any SVOD offering that wants to be at scale, be it either movies and television.","Jeffrey L. Bewkes - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","And let's remember, and we've tried to make this point over and over. The SVOD exhibition \u2013 or the VOD exhibition is not just on what you think of as an SVOD service. It's also in what used to be thought of as traditional TV services that become on-demand services.","Michael Kopelman - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, Jessica. Operator, can we have our next question, please?","Operator","That comes from the line of Michael Morris from Guggenheim Securities. Your line is now open.","Michael Morris - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Thank you. Good morning, guys, two Turner-related questions. First on the affiliate fee growth, several of your peers see impact from the distributor consolidation and some rate resets dragging on their growth. Obviously, you're putting up great growth right now. Do you expect to have any impact in the future from consolidation? Is any impact of consolidation already in your results, or perhaps the way you're structured you won't be impacted by that?","And then my second question is on ELEAGUE, specifically most strategies we see as taking linear content and finding new digital avenues. This is a case where you're taking something that's done well digitally and you're bringing it to TV. Could you just talk a little bit about why you think that's the right strategy, what your hopes are for that product? Thanks.","John K. Martin - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Turner Broadcasting System, Inc.","Sure. Thanks, Mike. Look, with respect to our affiliate fees, I think the forecast or the guidance that we provided for this year and next year where we expect domestic subscriber revenues to be in the low teens, I think it's fair to say that that considers the current environment of the number of distributors and what's happening in the marketplace. So when you have a highly concentrated portfolio of must-have networks, which we do, where we've got 85% of our affiliate revenues in four networks, I think it's a really advantageous place to be. So I think I'll leave it at that because obviously we're not going to specifically comment on any particular consolidation.","And then with respect to ELEAGUE, look, this is one of the innovations with respect to content that I think we're particularly excited about and proud of. And it's really not necessarily by design that we're looking to take digital content and move it to the TV. It's more just really trying to position the company to be where consumers are. And in looking at secular growth areas and in looking at areas where particularly young people are spending tremendous amounts of time, you obviously have to pay attention to the gaming industry. But this whole notion of a very significant population of individuals who are really excited to sit and watch professional gamers and some of the best gamers in the world, that's already happening. It's happening globally. In some countries, it represents some of the highest levels of consumption of video content. So in some respects, having ELEAGUE be aired on TBS is somewhat of an experiment. I think we're going to learn a lot this year. And I look forward to hopefully building a big franchise and a big asset along with our partners on both TV and digital platforms.","Michael Kopelman - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, Mike.","Michael Morris - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Thanks, John.","Michael Kopelman - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Operator, can we have our next question, please?","Operator","Your line comes from Vasily Karasyov from CLSA. Your line is now open.","Vasily Karasyov - CLSA Americas LLC","Thank you, good morning. John, I have a couple quick ones for you on Turner. I think in Jeff's remarks, he said that sports was up in advertising and news. Can you tell us what the advertising for entertainment at TBS ex-sports is with Turner?","And also, my question is you spoke in answering Alexia's question about what went right at Turner. Is there anything that you think will be changing in the next TV seasons and how you approach things? Thank you.","John K. Martin - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Turner Broadcasting System, Inc.","Terrific, let me start with the last part. Listen, I think, to be completely candid, not everything goes right in any of our businesses. But...","Jeffrey L. Bewkes - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Wait, really?","John K. Martin - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Turner Broadcasting System, Inc.","But I have to say we are off to a terrific start. And at this moment, I can't think of a thing that if we were to look backwards that we would do differently, and really excited about looking forward. I think you should expect us not only to continue to produce high-quality compelling programming, but to try to rebrand these networks into \u2013 continue to be must-have distinctive destinations for original programming, acquired programming, and sports. And so I couldn't be more proud of the team under David [Levy] and Kevin's direction and where we stand today and where we're going. So the simple answer is really pleased, wouldn't really want to change a thing.","Howard M. Averill - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","In terms of advertising...","Vasily Karasyov - CLSA Americas LLC","And advertising and ratings for entertainment ex-sports and news?","Howard M. Averill - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes, so I would say across the portfolio most of the growth did come from both news and sports, which is why we have that diverse portfolio. Ratings on the entertainment networks, the audience levels were down a bit, and the scatter pricing was not enough to offset that. But in aggregate, overall domestic entertainment advertising was fine.","Michael Kopelman - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, Vasily.","Vasily Karasyov - CLSA Americas LLC","Thank you.","Michael Kopelman - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Operator, next question, please.","Operator","It comes from the line of Vijay Jayant from Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.","Vijay Jayant - Evercore ISI","Thanks, just a question for Richard. I just wanted to understand. As HBO NOW is a stand-alone product, trying to be an all-encompassing product for a consumer, is there an optimal amount of content you expect in terms of new originals every year, split between comedies, dramas, kids? And as you go international, how much local content do you need to make that a viable or a successful product rather? And where are we on that transition, if there is one? Thank you.","Richard L. Plepler - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Home Box Office, Inc.","In terms of how we aggregate our programming decisions, I think as you look at the network right now, you see a textbook example of how we break up different genres, documentaries, mini-series, half-hours, hours, original films, sports programming. And as I've said before, the mission of programming is to build as many addicts as we can out there in the consumer base. And different people love different things. So you have huge Silicon Valley fans, huge John Oliver and Bill Maher fans, huge sports fans. So we like the way we're breaking up our choices. And a lot of this of course is informed by the talent that comes through the door. If somebody comes in with a brilliant idea for an additional half-hour, we're not going to say no to it because we have a certain number that we think is a ceiling. That's not how we make choices.","In terms of HBO NOW, what we have done is we've augmented our programming with decisions like Jon Stewart and Vice News and I think Bill Simmons will work across all platforms. So again, that opportunity to not be constrained by schedule is opening up a lot of creativity on the part of our talent who are coming in literally every week with new ideas. So you're going to see more and more of that going forward.","So listen, we like our mix. We think if you look at just the Emmy nominations and the Emmy wins of last year, I think the thing that was most rewarding for us was that they were across all categories, a wide range of categories, and I think that's what makes our programming mix so special.","Vijay Jayant - Evercore ISI","If I can try my luck, any update on HBO NOW subscriber numbers?","Richard L. Plepler - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Home Box Office, Inc.","I'm not going to get into numbers other than to say that we've had a good start with sub growth this year, both in terms of the traditional ecosystem and NOW, and we're very encouraged by what we're seeing. And as we learn more and more about our subscribers and our marketing becomes more precise, particularly with NOW, I think we're going to do even better.","Michael Kopelman - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, Vijay. Operator, next question, please.","Operator","It comes from the line of Anthony DiClemente from Nomura. Your line is now open.","Anthony DiClemente - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Hi, good morning and thanks for taking my question, just one question for Howard. Howard, the company had a really strong quarter across the board, beating Street estimates by a lot. But just on the outlook, you didn't raise the outlook. So totally hear you on the 2Q items you mentioned in your prepared remarks. But is this just a little bit of conservatism, or has the visibility around the rest-of-year expectations changed at all as you look segment by segment? Thanks.","Howard M. Averill - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","We had a terrific first quarter, again, with a double-digit OI and the 25% EPS growth. We are really pleased with how we're executing, and we see that continuing across our businesses. But look, it's still early in the year. We did mention, and you just mentioned back, the fact that we are making some investments across the business. And look, we're also mindful that FX can move around. So at this point, we're still comfortable with the $5.30 to $5.40, and we are on track clearly for that.","Anthony DiClemente - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Thanks a lot.","Michael Kopelman - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, Anthony. Operator, next question, please.","Operator","It comes from the line of John Janedis from Jefferies. Your line is now open.","John Janedis - Jefferies LLC","Thank you. Jeff, maybe a follow-up to your comment on SVOD and related distributors or offerings. From your perspective, how do you think about the potential for them to expand or stabilize the pay TV universe relative to the declines over the past 18 months or so? Or maybe asked differently, do you have any line of sight or confidence in improved sub trends as a result of new entrants or offerings?","Jeffrey L. Bewkes - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I think it's important to look basically to de-aggregate the performance in the cable\/telco\/satellite world. So you do have affiliates, cable affiliates who are growing subs and penetration. And the reason basically is they're offering very effective packages of VOD. They've got various packages at different prices with different network bundles for consumers. They've got good guide interfaces. And so you have a fairly large disparity in performance between distributors. And I think if you look at the high performers, you see where the future can go. And the fact you that now have more VOD offerings and different packages and price points is basically, I think, and we've seen it happen, it's going to increase penetration because consumers are going to find more packages that suit what they want. And in most cases, that will be the biggest and largest packages of the big networks, but not in all cases.","And so I think you're going to see \u2013 and remember, to the extent have you some marketing of VOD products, think of broadband delivery with good navigation, it basically increases consumer demand, consumer recognition for powerful networks like CNN, TNT, HBO. All of that has a national effect of increasing the presence of TV networks because all age groups increasingly now are finding their favorite programs offered the way they want, and they find their way to the networks if we sell them in the right distribution offering.","John K. Martin - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Turner Broadcasting System, Inc.","Can I just say one thing? There are too many networks in the United States. And we've been saying for years that there's going to be a rationalization of those networks. So as you think about subscription trends going forward, I think there are going to be increasingly differentiated subscription trends, meaning that marginal or lesser-valued networks are going to find it very difficult to keep their footing and keep pace with the best networks. And I think further to what Jeff just said, as affiliates, whether they're traditional or non-traditional affiliates, put out packages \u2013 smaller packages of better networks at lower economic price points, we're going to be able to attract back households into the multi-channel ecosystem that have frankly moved away because they don't see the value of the uber-bundles. That will be good for us.","Jeffrey L. Bewkes - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yes.","John Janedis - Jefferies LLC","Thanks. And then maybe separately, just back to HBO for a second, with Game of Thrones premiering a week or two ago, can you talk about your confidence in the slate's ramping and accelerating subscriber growth the rest of the year, and to what extent maybe the programming budget is locked in or may need to move higher? And on HBO NOW, that you're a year in, can you share some data on how the subs are different from traditional linear subs from either maybe a churn or engagement perspective? Thanks you.","Richard L. Plepler - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Home Box Office, Inc.","Sure, the second first. Obviously, it's a younger demo. It's about a decade younger than our traditional HBO sub.","In terms of the programming slate, look, we're very excited about what's coming, Vice Principals with Danny McBride, Sarah Jessica Parker's Divorce, our co-production with Warner Bros., Westworld, just an extraordinary varied and dynamic slate of stuff coming. And Game of Thrones also has a couple of years left as well before they finish out their story.","John Janedis - Jefferies LLC","Richard, do HBO NOW subs churn more, or is it negligible?","Richard L. Plepler - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Home Box Office, Inc.","Look, as we saw in the Nordics, churn was a bit elevated initially. But as you would expect, the churn has been coming down as our subscriber base has aged. And I think as we continue to drive churn down over time, we improve the service, we improve our UI and UX, we roll out more of the programming that I spoke of earlier, I think we'll learn and we are learning how to better serve our customer and continue to effect a decline in churn.","John Janedis - Jefferies LLC","Thank you.","Michael Kopelman - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, John. Operator, we have time for one more question, please.","Operator","It comes from the line of Bryan Kraft from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Bryan Kraft - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi, good morning. I had a question for Richard and for John. Richard, just a question on HBO, following up on John's question. How do you gauge what is a successful show on HBO versus an unsuccessful one? Is there a minimum audience level that you're looking for?","And then for John, John, I'm just curious. How is the reduction in ad loads at truTV going to impact pricing and audience levels for advertising on the network? Do you see the increase in CPMs and ratings offsetting the reduction in ad loads? Thank you.","Richard L. Plepler - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Home Box Office, Inc.","On your question of how we gauge a successful show, look, it's largely about whether we think something is elevating the brand, and that's obviously a subjective judgment that we make all the time. It's not so much about rating as whether or not it's serving what we think is its design purpose to affect resonance with a particular part of our consumer base. So as I said earlier, it's all about developing a kind of engagement with our subscriber. Some people are going to look at Real Sports with the same degree of passion that other people look at Bill Maher or John Oliver. Some people are going to look at Veep with the same passion that other people will look at Silicon Valley.","So this is a very subjective determination. We've been doing it for a long time. We think we have pretty good instincts about how to build a large variety in our slate which appeals to a huge part of our consumer base. There's no exact science to it. Obviously, critical acclaim plays a role. But we have a very good collective instinct inside the company when we think something is resonating with a particular part of our audience. And we give our creative teams an opportunity to stay with it and develop story and continue to build the show, as we've shown over many years.","Bryan Kraft - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks.","John K. Martin - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Turner Broadcasting System, Inc.","Thanks, it's John. With respect to \u2013 for anybody who's unaware, because you made reference to truTV and ad loads, we had announced a number of months ago our intention that beginning in the fourth quarter of this year, we're going to essentially take the number of minutes per hour on truTV dedicated to advertising, and we're going to essentially cut it in half. And that again is consistent with our desire to evolve the industry. That's going to simultaneously benefit our advertisers and improve the overall consumer experience.","I will tell you we are not doing it to lose money. So we fully intend to provide increased value per inventory unit that we sell. And now it's up to you to us to demonstrate that, but we are actively going to be moving beyond the 30-second spot business to create innovative new ad products for our advertisers and marketers. And we made a number of announcements a number of months ago at CES, including Native Plus with longer-form brand ad breaks, and Launchpad, which is a social tool, and Courageous, which is our own in-house ability to develop branded content in the form of advertising. Again, I would say we're going to learn a lot, but we absolutely believe that this experiment is not going to result in us taking a step back.","Bryan Kraft - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","I just wanted to see if I could follow up on that. John, how are you thinking about the ad loads on the other networks? Do you first do this with truTV, see what you learn, and then start thinking about the larger networks, or is there anything that you're doing now in terms of ad load reductions on TBS and TNT?","John K. Martin - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Turner Broadcasting System, Inc.","We're not doing anything material today. And one of the reasons why we are starting with this commitment on truTV is obviously it's a network where we have less advertising exposure than some of our larger networks like TBS and TNT. Having said that, the type of approach and ideology that we have with truTV, which we think will succeed, we're already beginning to plan for on some of our other networks, and I believe it was Kevin Reilly at TCA [Television Critics Association] that mentioned that on some of our new original programming, we're actually going to be making more minutes of content, with the expectation that on a number of those new original scripted series, we'll probably be running fewer ad commercial breaks. So this is going to be an evolution, but it's something that we're planning now for what's going to take place in the future.","Bryan Kraft - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks to you both.","Jeffrey L. Bewkes - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I just want to thank everyone for hanging in through our medical section and hope you can all see how we're so excited about not only our prospects for the business this year but in the years out beyond that. We think the company is very well positioned, and the evolution at the networks, at Warner's is going global, is proceeding as well as I could have hoped. And I'm also seeing a lot of encouragement in industry developments. I think the industry around the world is finally starting to catch up to the innovation speed necessary to take this huge value that's resident in all the network offerings, not just ours, and bring it to consumers in the way that consumers increasingly want. So we're quite encouraged about the environment that we're operating in and particularly our strength relative to the others.","Michael Kopelman - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, everybody.

My name is Janette, and I'll be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Michael Kopelman, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Kopelman, you may begin.","Michael Kopelman","Thanks, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Time Warner's third quarter earnings conference call. This morning, we issued 2 press releases, one detailing our results for the third quarter and the other, updating our 2014 full year business outlook.","Before we begin, there are 2 items I need to cover. First, we refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Schedules setting out reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our earnings release and trending schedules. These reconciliations are available on our website at www.timewarner.com\/investors. Reconciliations of our expected future financial performance are also included in the business outlook release that is available on our website.","Second, today's announcement includes certain forward-looking statements, which are based on management's current expectations. Actual results may vary materially from those expressed or implied by these statements due to various factors. These factors are discussed in detail in Time Warner's SEC filings, including its most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. Time Warner is under no obligation, and in fact, expressly disclaims any obligation to update or alter its forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. I'll now turn the call over to Jeff Bewkes, Time Warner's Chairman and CEO; who will be borrowed by Howard Averill, Time Warner's CFO.","After their prepared remarks, our divisional CEOs, John Martin, Richard Plepler and Kevin Tsujihara, will join us for a Q&A session to answer any follow-up questions you may have from our investor event last month. With that, Jeff?","Jeffrey L. Bewkes","Thanks, Mike, and thanks for listening in this morning.","We had another quarter of solid revenue growth and strong growth in adjusted EPS, and that puts us on track for another very good year of financial performance in 2014.","But more important, we're executing our longer range plans to go after the large and growing global opportunity we see in video content, that opportunity and our plans to capitalize on it was a focus of the investor event we held last month. I'd like to thank all of you who took the time either in person or by videocast to attend.","We were pleased to share our long-range plan and financial targets with you. Those targets include adjusted EPS of close to $6 a share in 2016 and over $8 a share in 2018, representing a more than doubling of our earnings over the next few years.","We also discussed with you the significant upside opportunities that we believe exist above and beyond those targets. Those include the new global kids partnership between Turner and Warner Bros and the even greater exploitation of our IP at DC Entertainment, and the potential for breakout hits at Turner and a standalone broadband-delivered HBO product we intend to introduce domestically next year.","We've been positioning ourselves to go after that big opportunity in video I mentioned earlier by streamlining our company, putting in a new generation of collaborative leaders and executing a strategy that has not only served Time Warner and its shareholders well over the past several years, but is also evolving to incorporate new opportunities outside the traditional ecosystem.","And with our scale position and our leading portfolio of brands, we think we are the best positioned media company to take advantage of that opportunity.","While evolving, our strategy remains focused on 4 key areas: content, technology, international and efficiency. And there's a reason that investing in content is at the top of the list because great content is the life blood of our company.","We spent close to $14 billion on content and related marketing expenses last year. We'll invest even more this year and in the years ahead because of our confidence in our unique ability to monetize those investments.","For example, both HBO and Turner had double-digit increases in Subscription revenues during the quarter, and that flows directly from having the best story to tell.","You can see further evidence of our commitment to the best storytelling in the 19 Primetime Emmy Awards HBO received, the most of any network for the 13th consecutive year, with True Detective receiving 5 awards. And as I've mentioned before, True Detective was the most-watched freshman series in HBO history. And it wasn't the only successful new hit on a service that already boasts its strongest lineup of original shows ever.","Newcomer, The Leftovers, averaged over 7 million viewers per episode, received a lot of critical acclaim and has been renewed for a second season.","Turner is also investing in great original content, and you're seeing the results of those investments. TNT ranked its ad-supported cable's #1 prime time network for the second consecutive quarter. TNT's series, Rizzoli & Isles, Major Crimes and The Last Ship, comprised 3 of the top 5 original series on ad-supported cable in the third quarter, and TBS was the #2 ad-supported cable network in prime time among adults 18 to 49 and 25 to 54.","But not to be outdone, Adult Swim was once again ad-supported cable's #1 total day network among all its key adult demos.","Turner's recent extension of its 3-decade relationship with the NBA through the 2024 to 25 season is yet another great example of investing in distinctive programming that will serve us well for years to come.","The agreement will further grow our partnership with additional games, continued management of NBA's digital assets and new digital rights for Bleacher Report.","Our investment in great storytelling is also paying off at Warners, which is the leading producer for broadcast TV for the 11th time out of the past 12 seasons.","This fall, the Big Bang Theory and The Voice are once again, the #1 scripted and non-scripted shows, respectively, on all of television. And we're particularly pleased with 2 new shows, Gotham, which ranks as broadcast's #2 new show with adults 18 to 49; and The Flash, whose premiere drew close to 7 million viewers, making it The CW's most-watched telecast ever. Both those programs are based on IP from our DC Entertainment group, and they lead a roster of 5 DC-based shows that we have on broadcast this season.","As Warner announced at our investor event, DC is also a big part of our theatrical strategy with 10 DC-based films slated for release between 2016 and 2020.","Warner also unveiled plans for films built around the LEGO franchise and the World of Harry Potter conceived by J. K. Rowling.","More imminently, we're going to see another terrific example of our franchise products when the final installment in Peter Jackson's Hobbit trilogy, Battle of the Five Armies, storms theaters in December.","As we're investing in great content, it's worth emphasizing our commitment to a strong multichannel ecosystem. That commitment is clear in the new NBA agreement I just mentioned, which represents an investment of more than $10 billion in the kind of must-have content that makes the TV bundle so valuable to consumers, and it makes our networks essential within these bundles.","On top of our sports commitment, we intend to double our spending on original programming over the next several years. So in total, we expect to grow our annual programming investment at Turner to over $5 billion within the next several years.","Our commitment is also clear in products like CNN Go, which we recently launched, and is perhaps the most advanced TV Everywhere product yet developed.","Similarly, Turner's leading the charge in providing in-season stacking rights to our distributors and consumers when many of our peers have been reticent to do so.","At HBO, we're equally committed to working with our distribution partners to grow our mutual business. Where others have cut back on their investments to drive margins, HBO has been investing aggressively in original programming, and it's extended its film output deals to maintain the very best selection of recent Hollywood hit. And HBO GO is the gold standard TV Everywhere product for the industry.","At the same time, we can't ignore the growing opportunity outside the ecosystem. So we'll be investing there as well. I already mentioned our plans to expand the reach of HBO to consumers who are not currently multichannel subscribers, and we'll be working very closely with our current distribution partners in that area. We think that's a big opportunity.","We are also thrilled with the performance of CNN.com, which in September surpassed Yahoo! News to become the most consumed news and information website in the United States, as measured by both page views and video starts.","At Warner's, we recently created a new division, Blue Ribbon Content, to focus on short-form digital content. Its initial lineup consists of both original concepts and DC-based content, including an innovative virtual reality experience produced for the Samsung GALAXY Gear VR and Oculus Rift that will take you inside the bat cave. That's exactly the type of innovative storytelling that will allow Warner Bros. to remain at the forefront of the industry as consumer viewing habits continue to evolve.","When we talk about pursuing opportunities outside the ecosystem, I think there's an important point to keep in mind. If you look back over the past decade, we've seen the introduction of all kinds of new platforms and services for video, including iTunes, YouTube and SVOD offerings from Hulu, Netflix and Amazon. And what we've seen, both outside the system and inside it, through services like our own VOD and our own TV Everywhere product, is that the more options you give audiences to access video content, the greater the consumption. Rather than merely shifting share from one platform to another, we continue to see growth in the video universe. And that's why we're convinced we can effectively pursue growth in both areas.","Now before I turn it over to Howard, I want to say, again, how confident we are in Time Warner's position. We're proud of our track record of industry-leading EPS growth and shareholder returns over the past 5-plus years.","We're really just getting started. The best video content is growing in value and we occupy the perfect position in the value chain to benefit from that.","And so while there are risks, we're confident we can mitigate them. We have an industry-leading collection of must-have networks, we have unmatched film and TV production capabilities, we have leading global brands and we're investing in the very best programming to capitalize on growth across all distribution platforms, both within the traditional ecosystem and outside of it. All of that gives us great confidence in the financial plan we presented last month, in the upside opportunities we discussed and in our ability to continue delivering industry-leading shareholder returns.","And with that, let me turn it over to Howard.","Howard M. Averill","Thanks, Jeff, and good morning. I'll begin by referring to the first slide of our presentation, which is now available on our website.","We're really pleased with our performance so far this year and the progress we're making toward the longer-term targets we discussed with you last month. While there were a number of moving pieces in the quarter, on the whole, our results were a little better than we expected, and that included a further acceleration and subscription revenue growth at both Turner and HBO.","Before I go to our divisional results, I'd like to address the restructuring, severance and programming charges and tax matter that we outlined at our investor meeting 3 weeks ago.","We will take over $400 million in restructuring and severance charges in the second half of this year. About $300 million of that was recognized in the third quarter. The charges reflect our company-wide focus on efficiency and stem from global reviews of our businesses by the new CEOs at each of our divisions.","We previously discussed with you the importance of constraining non-programming costs, and this is a reflection of our commitment to that goal. We expect to generate annual savings from our restructuring actions of around $450 million over time, with much of it coming in 2015. That will allow us to invest even more in great content and help position us for future growth across the company.","Additionally, Turner decided to stop airing certain programming that no longer fit the brand promise of its networks. As a result, Turner incurred a significant programming charge this quarter. Since some of the programming was licensed from Warner Bros., the net impact to the company after accounting for intercompany eliminations was $343 million.","More than offsetting these items on an after-tax basis was a $639 million net benefit resulting from tax matters primarily as a result of a federal tax settlement.","Given their nature and size, my comments throughout the presentation will largely focus on results excluding these 3 items.","So excluding them, our adjusted EPS would have been $0.97, and that benefited from our ongoing share repurchase program. During the quarter, we repurchased $1.6 billion in shares, and year-to-date, we bought back close to $4.9 billion of our stock. Combined with paying close to $850 million in dividends, that means we have returned over $5.7 billion of capital to shareholders so far this year, and that's after investing more than $10 billion in programming, production and related marketing. So we're continuing to invest aggressively in our businesses, while providing significant direct returns to shareholders.","This morning, we increased our 2014 adjusted EPS guidance to high teens growth, which includes an estimated net benefit of around $0.15 from the reversal of tax reserves and the programming, restructuring and severance charges in the third and fourth quarters. So we're firmly on track for our sixth consecutive year of double-digit growth and adjusted EPS. And I'll touch on that in more detail later in the presentation.","Now turning to the segment highlights. I'll begin at Turner, where we continue to see strong subscription revenue growth. Subscription revenues increased 10% in the quarter, an acceleration from the second quarter, and that included a pickup in growth at both our domestic and international businesses.","International subscription revenue increased in the low double digits, primarily due to positive trends in Latin America.","Domestic subscription revenue growth remains very healthy and was, again, in the high single digits, as Turner continues to benefit from the rate increases associated with its domestic affiliate renewals. And as we look out over the next several years, we expect subscription revenue to remain a key driver of growth at Turner.","Moving on. Advertising revenue declined just under 2%, in line with our expectations coming into the quarter. Domestic advertising was essentially flat, and that included a low single-digit decline in domestic entertainment, including young adults, which was offset by solid growth at news.","While our original programming at TNT performed well over the summer, ratings at our domestic networks have remained a headwind, and scatter demand in the quarter remained moderate.","International advertising was down in the quarter, partly due to adjustments impacting year-over-year comparability and FX. Excluding those factors, international advertising declined in the mid-single digits, and that was largely a result of somewhat lower demand in Latin America following the World Cup.","In the fourth quarter, scatter pricing has been pacing up high single to low double digits over the upfront, while volume has remained relatively modest. With that backdrop, we anticipate total advertising revenues to be about flat in the quarter, and that includes a drag of about 500 basis points as a result of fewer Major League Baseball playoff games, the strengthening U.S. dollar and DISH pulling down certain of our networks. Without those, we would have anticipated a return to growth in the quarter.","Excluding the programming and restructuring charges in each period, adjusted operating income would have grown modestly. That reflects healthy revenue growth and our continued focus on limiting non-programming expenses.","Excluding those charges, programming cost increased in the low double digits due to the new MLB deal and the airing of additional original episodes.","Looking to the fourth quarter, we expect very healthy underlying trends and subscription revenues and have easier comparisons on the programming cost side due to impairments in the year-ago period. And depending on its length, those will be offset either modestly or to a more significant degree by our DISH dispute.","Looking beyond 2014, we anticipate the restructuring efforts this year to result in over $200 million in annual savings at Turner, with a majority of those savings starting in 2015. Those savings will help fund aggressive investments in programming while allowing for sustainable margin expansion. And combined with what we expect to be accelerating subscription revenue growth in 2016 and beyond, we plan to deliver very strong growth and adjusted operating income for the next several years.","Turning now to HBO, where we continue to have very good operating momentum. Subscription revenues increased 10% in the quarter with the consolidation of HBO Asia contributing about 400 basis points to that growth.","As we discussed with you at our Investor Day, domestic sub-trends remained very healthy, with HBO on track for its best year in almost 2 decades.","And combined with some improvement in the subscriber mix, that resulted in a modest acceleration in domestic subscription revenue growth in the quarter.","As a reminder, we have now fully lapped the consolidation of both HBO Nordic and HBO Asia, so subscription revenue growth should return to a more normal level in the fourth quarter.","Content revenues grew 7%, and that was driven by increased international licensing revenues and strong home video sales. Those factors more than offset lower domestic syndication sales.","In the quarter, we recognized $48 million of restructuring charges related to the company-wide efforts I discussed at the start of my presentation. Excluding restructuring charges in both periods, adjusted operating income would have grown modestly in the quarter.","Programming expense growth included 600 basis points from the consolidation of HBO Asia.","Looking through that, programming expenses increased 10%, driven by mid-teens growth in original programming as a result of spending on new series, including The Leftovers and The Net.","HBO's international operations posted another quarter of solid growth, with total revenue, including unconsolidated JVs, increasing double digits. And that included growth in both licensing and our networks businesses, which continue to benefit from robust sub-growth, especially in Latin America.","Looking after the fourth quarter, we anticipate continued solid growth in subscription revenues.","At the same time, programming expenses should grow in the mid-teens, primarily due to the timing of theatrical expenses.","But given the strong year-to-date results and very healthy underlying trends, HBO remains on track for another year of solid growth in adjusted OI. And we think HBO is well-positioned to grow at even more attractive rates for the next several years.","Moving on to Warner Bros., where we're benefiting from increased global demand for our content, and are on track for another very good year despite difficult theatrical comparisons in the third and fourth quarters.","Looking specifically at the third quarter, and excluding restructuring charges in both periods, adjusted operating income would have fallen 6%, and that included both the benefit from a patent license and settlement agreement as well as a drag from a onetime VAT catch-up. Theatrically, our lineup was not as strong as the year ago when we released The Conjuring and We\u2019re the Millers and the carryover revenue from Man of Steel, but the fourth quarter got off to a great start with Annabelle, and we're excited about our upcoming releases, which include the international opening of Interstellar this week as well as the final installment of the Hobbit and American Sniper next month. And longer term, we think we have the strongest slate in the history of the company.","So overall, we feel really good about the outlook for our theatrical business.","On the TV side, demand for our product remains robust with revenues growing high single digits in the quarter. That included growth in SVOD revenue and increased TV production, including the consolidation of Eyeworks.","Across theatrical and TV, Home Entertainment revenue was stable in the quarter. And digital trends remain very positive, with electronics sell-through growing over 50%.","Looking at the fourth quarter, Warner Bros. will incur additional restructuring charges of around $100 million.","In addition, we face difficult home video and theatrical comparisons. Recall that last year's fourth quarter set a record for Warner Bros. as it benefited from the home video releases of Man of Steel, Pacific Rim and The Hangover Part III as well as the theatrical release of Gravity.","But if not for the restructuring charges I just noted, Warner's would be on track for record year. And the global demand increasing for the high-quality content that Warner Bros. specializes in, we're confident we can grow the business at very attractive levels for the foreseeable future.","Turning to free cash flow, which also remains healthy, we generated $2.5 billion in free cash flow year-to-date similar to year-ago levels, and that's despite a material increase in cash taxes due principally to the expiration of certain favorable tax legislation.","As you can see on the slide, we've broken out the programming, restructuring and severance charges incurred in the third quarter, which had a significant impact on adjusted operating income. It's worth noting that the majority of severance payments related to the restructurings will come in 2015. Cutting through the noise, we're on track for another year of healthy free cash flow generation in 2014, and we expect to continue converting a very high percentage of our earnings into free cash flow in the years to come.","Now on to our balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $19.3 billion of net debt. That's up over $1 billion versus the end of 2013, and that's primarily due to our commitment to direct shareholder returns.","During the first 9 months, we returned $5.3 billion to shareholders, including almost $4.5 billion in share repurchases. And we continue to think our stock is very attractive at these levels.","On the M&A front, we've invested about $880 million year-to-date. A majority of this came in the second quarter as we closed our acquisition of Eyeworks international television operations and completed financing arrangements with CME.","Due to the programming, restructuring and severance charges in the third quarter, our net leverage ratio was 2.9x as of September 30. However, excluding those charges, our net leverage ratio would have been 2.6x.","On that basis, we're on track to reach our target net leverage ratio of 2.75x by the end of the year.","And as we said last month, we remain committed to maintaining our solid investment-grade credit rating.","Now onto the final slide, which shows our 2014 outlook. This morning, we raised our full year 2014 outlook to high teens adjusted EPS growth. Our outlook includes a net benefit of approximately $0.15 from the tax matters and programming, restructurings and severance charges I noted earlier. One item that could impact our result is our current carriage dispute with DISH. And as I noted before, DISH has unilaterally dropped a number of our networks.","Furthermore, our contracts for TNT and TBS expire soon. We're working hard to reach a new agreement in the near future, but if we're not able to, our adjusted EPS would likely come in toward the lower end of the range I just provided.","Excluding the $0.15 net benefit I just mentioned and any potential impact from DISH, we would still be tracking ahead of the outlook we have provided in August. And that's despite the significant 4Q programming investments at HBO and difficult 4Q comparisons at Warner Bros.","So we're pleased with our performance this year, and the investments we're making in high-quality video content put us in a great position to deliver the double-digit CAGR and adjusted OI and over $8 in adjusted EPS by 2018 that we discussed with you last month.","With that, I'll turn it back to Mike to start the Q&A.","Michael Kopelman","Thanks, Howard. Janette, if we could go ahead and open up the line? [Operator Instructions]","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Michael Morris of Guggenheim Securities.","Michael C. Morris - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","A couple of questions on programming at Turner. First, with respect to the size of the content write-off, it's pretty substantial relative to, let's say, the cost of an individual episode of programming. Can you provide more color on what was included in the write-off and how it affects sort of your investment on programming going forward? And then second of all, you recently announced the hiring of Kevin Reilly as the Head of TBS and TNT. Can you talk a bit about why he's the right person and how that affects the investment there?","Jeffrey L. Bewkes","I'll take that. Mike, I think as you may all remember, when we started this, we've got all the CEOs here. So John's here and I think it's probably better for you to start, John.","John K. Martin","All right, thanks. Good morning, Mike. Thanks for the question. Listen, and I think Howard said this in his proactive remarks, that the charge that we took was a portfolio of programming that no longer fits the brand direction that we want to take each of TNT and TBS in. But the biggest components included The Mentalist and a number of shows that we had historically with the relationship with Tyler Perry, including House of Pain. And that is going to allow us to better program the network with series that better fit the evolving brands. In terms of the impact that it's going to have on overall investment levels going forward, as I said at the recent analyst meeting, our intention and expectation is to contain overall programming costs at Turner to be no more than high single digits over several years on an annual basis. And we have every confidence that we can do it. But I want to make sure I want to pause for a second because I don't want people to believe that acquired programming no longer has a place on our networks. I think the only change in our view of acquired is that we need to be more selective, which is similar to our strategy with originals, by the way, as we'll look to get -- to become more distinctive in our programming, and over time, targeting a younger audience, particularly on TNT. But acquired can still play an important role for the foreseeable future, and all you need to look at is the big, big hits like Big Bang Theory, which is going to have a place in prime time for the foreseeable future. So that answers that question, and thank you for mentioning the hiring of Kevin, which we announced yesterday. And speaking on behalf of David Levy, who is the Direct Hiring Manager and myself, we couldn't be more thrilled that Kevin's going to be coming over to join us here at Turner. I mean, he is absolutely one of the most respected, innovative and influential executives in this industry, and he's always been a champion of quality television, who does not shy away from taking bold programming risks. And we've carved out and created a new role for him because of his unique tastes, experience and his creative relationships. He'll have the title, Chief Creative Officer, which will allow him to work with and lead the Turner creative executives and finding new ways to reach viewers with programming that plays to the strength of our various brands and platforms. So really, really thrilled.","Richard R. Plepler","Yes, John. Michael, it's Richard. I'll just punctuate that. I mean, Kevin enjoys a truly stellar reputation in Hollywood. And my emails yesterday were plentiful with people from the community just saying, bravo to our cousins at Turner's for making that hire. I think it's a very smart creative choice, and he's going to do great things there.","Kevin Tsujihara","Warner Bros. has -- this is Kevin. Warner Bros. has a fantastic relationship with Kevin that goes back a long way. And as Richard said, the creative community response has been tremendous regarding this hire. So we're really excited about it.","Howard M. Averill","Mike, this is Howard. I just wanted to come back. Mike, this is Howard. I just wanted to come back and just reiterate the fact that on a net basis, the programming impairment is $343 million, which is consistent with what I outlined at the Investor Day. The decision was a jump point. It was really about making the most in programming so that we could move faster. We don't expect to have any significant savings over the term or the long range plan on that.","Operator","And our next question comes from Jessica Reif Cohen of Bank of America.","Jessica Reif Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","It's great that you have the division guys on, so we'll take advantage of that. One for John and one for Richard. So on the DISH dispute, which you guys brought up a few times, I'm just wondering, you said it might affect Q4 -- or Howard said it might affect Q4 earnings. But John, how do you -- how should we think about this over the longer term given the guidance you've given for affiliate fee growth of low double digits? And for Richard, I just want to ask about the broadband opportunity, which Jeff just highlighted. Do you see that -- and you've obviously discussed it at the Analyst Day, but do you see the standalone broadband opportunity as a bigger potential opportunity for HBO than simply driving performance from the poorer-performing pay-TV operators to like the mid or upper level? Like which one is the bigger opportunity?","John K. Martin","Thanks, Jessica, it's John. I'll start. Listen, I mean, ordinarily, we wouldn't be in the practice of commenting publicly as it relates to what's a private business dispute. But given Charlie Ergen's comments on the earnings call yesterday, I just want to provide a little bit of context from our perspective. And it think it's fair to say that we disagree with virtually everything he said as it related to the importance of our product, as it related to his platform. We were both disappointed in the very antagonistic and aggressive nature of his comments yesterday, and we're disappointed particularly given the fact that DISH had previously agreed to our network's rates and our carriage proposals weeks ago. And we were working hard to get a deal done. We were supportive, in fact, unclear now, of additional TT efforts, and we have found common ground on virtually all of the major issues there. So while there clearly were more deal points to get done, they are not of the type of nature that would result in networks going dark. And I think all of us sitting around the table have been in this industry a long time, so we have a pretty good sense of what those are. So to us, it's unclear exactly what the dispute with DISH is, and we were told by them that we were taken down because we wouldn't move an expiration date later into the year. What's kind of interesting about that is it was an expiration date for networks that aren't even up yet. And it's important to note that other top five U.S. distributors have signed up for the deal that DISH has now walked away from. And look, we're confident in our brands. The value of the Turner news, entertainment, kids and young adult brands and the content that we have are reflected in the leadership positions that we have across the media landscape. And we have 2 of the top 5, 3 of the top 10 and 5 of the top 30 cable networks. We're the only programming group that has that. And CNN is #2 in ratings, #1 in reach and it has the most innovative TV everywhere product available on the market. So we honestly have no idea what DISH was talking about yesterday. Having said all of that, Turner's had a long-term relationship with DISH that has been to a mutual benefit. And that's one of the reasons that we agree to multiple calendar extensions during this lengthy negotiation process, and we worked diligently and in good faith to try to address what those issues are. In fact, we even stayed at the table after DISH removed our networks from their service. And look, we believe in our brands and we're willing to work constructively to get a deal done in the near term.","Howard M. Averill","So Jessica, just to get your point about the impact on guidance, we still expect we'll reach a deal. So we don't expect this is going to impact our long-term guidance.","Richard R. Plepler","Jessica, yes, Richard -- Jessica, I'm going to answer your broadband-only question. So look, first of all, as I think I said on Investor, this is not binary, it is not one of the others, it's multilateral. We're going to go first after the enormous opportunity that I spoke about in 70 million homes that do not get HBO in the MVPD universe. We think, as I've told you, there's 10 to 15 million persuadable homes. We want to work with our partners to attack that market aggressively. And in the broadband-only universe, we think there's 4 million to 5 million also working with our partners. So to us, this is just net upside everywhere, margin upside everywhere. I talked to all of our distributors about it. We want to lean in with them early in the new year, begin working on the plans for this for 2015. And I see nothing but upside for us, nothing but upside for the consumer, nothing but upside for our distributors.","Operator","And our next question comes from John Janedis of Jefferies.","John Janedis - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","John, you mentioned syndication earlier. As content has become available in more platforms, there is a view in the market that it's weighing on syndication broadly. So can you tell us what you're seeing globally in syndication, and to what extent you're seeing either inflation or deflation in license fees?","Kevin Tsujihara","This is Kevin from Warner Bros. I think that what we're continuing to see is on a global basis, demand for our product and the pricing for our product continues to go up. And as John said, the programming that -- the hit programming that continues to kind of dominate the airwaves today is the programming that you're seeing the most pricing power on. And so -- but international markets are very strong right now, and we continue to -- we expect to continue to see that in the foreseeable future.","John Janedis - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay. And maybe just going back, John, to this question maybe. Just going forward, it seems like distributors are appreciatingly focusing on ratings when negotiating fees. And so how relevant are ratings in your view? And is this argument missing viewers and platforms that aren't -- but will be measured someday?","John K. Martin","Yes. I mean, look, and I noticed from my experience on this side being a programmer, I also know from my experience having worked at Time Warner Cable for a number of years. Ratings are one measurement, but there is not a particularly strong correlation between ratings and affiliate fees because what's more important than ratings is the brand affinity and the passion engagement that subscribers have with particular branded environments and networks. And so you can have a network that has lower ratings, but has a subset of fans, like Turner Classic Movies, for example, that are incredibly passionate about a particular network. Those networks can command a premium and affiliate fees because the distributors value that relationship with the consumer. And so I don't want to say that ratings are unimportant because obviously, higher-rated networks mean that viewers are spending more and more time with them. But it's only one of a number of a variety of factors that determines what clears the affiliate fee price in the marketplace.","Jeffrey L. Bewkes","I just want to add, the classic example of that is sports.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ben Swinburne of Morgan Stanley.","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","You guys talked about sort of moving into new areas and at the same time, supporting the ecosystem. And you highlighted the NBA, Jeff. There's a lot out there about the NBA looking to go over the top. Adam Silver did an interview talking about an urgency to do that soon. And I think ESPN has at least hinted at the idea of doing something as well. How does NBA, ESPN over-the-top fit into your worldview? And how does Turner participate or not participate in that opportunity?","Jeffrey L. Bewkes","I'm going to give it to John to ask him about Turner.","Jeffrey L. Bewkes","Yes, thanks. To a large extent, as you add more opportunities for consumers to see things on demand, that's probably a good thing to strengthen their attachment and engagement with the brands. And most of their -- most of the consumers' increasing excitement with, engagement, time spent every day goes across a number of channels that they watch on demand on their television, and then it they want to leave the house they can watch it on a mobile device. And so I think what you're seeing here is really an increase in the value of having these networks and having a lot of them on, on demand basis. But I'll give -- John, you can talk about the specifics of the...","John K. Martin","Thanks, Jeff. I mean, further to what Jeff just said, listen, we're supportive of the relationship between the NBA and ESPN as it relates to this OTT package, but I do think it's very important to understand what it is and what it is not. The OTT package is very targeted. It's a mobile product with select out-of-market games. It won't include any of the games that air on our networks. Those are exclusive to us and include our own digital rights with respect to those, and it wont's include any playoff games. So it doesn't impact the package that we have with the NBA at all. We still have the same package of exclusive Thursday night games. In fact, we got 12 additional games. And as I mentioned, we maintain all streaming rights there. We already partner with the NBA on an OTT call offering. It's called NBA League Pass, and we're continuing to manage the NBA's digital properties, and we partner on NBA TV. And lastly, I would mention, we also got increased digital rights for Bleacher Report, which is the #2 sports destination now in the U.S. So there were plenty of digital rights that were spread around, and we think it's good for the NBA. We think they were very smart the way that we're approaching, that they've approached it. And I think it's going to work out well for all 3 parties, us, ESPN and the NBA.","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And can I ask Kevin a follow-up along the same lines around the ecosystem with Gotham? Kevin, can you talk about that deal, why that was the right deal for Warner with Netflix? You mentioned full seasons stacking and Fox does not have stacking rights for that show. So it went in a different direction. Why was that the right path for Warner and Time Warner on that property?","Kevin Tsujihara","It was the right deal for that particular show at that moment in time. I think that as we look more broadly at stacking, we believe that stacking rights are very much important to be part of the overall TV Everywhere experience, and that you can make that argument that by allowing cable networks and broadcast networks to stack our program, it actually increases the value, of the long-term value of the content. It increases the amount of sampling of a show. If you look at something like Gotham and if you add all the viewing, and I think Fox just reported this, if you take out live plus same day, you add the 7-day DVR, you add the days 4 plus, you're now looking at a P2-plus number of 22 million viewers. That kind of viewing when cum'd like that, that would put in a top 10 show 10 years ago. So I think we need to look at these kinds of things differently. We need to obviously figure out ways to monetize that audience more effectively, but it does kind of show the value of product and the fact that viewing is happening in many different ways today, and we just have to catch up in the way we measure it and we monetize it.","John K. Martin","It's John. We couldn't agree more. I mean, the same thing on Last Ship, where half of the viewing was non-live. Falling Skies, the same thing; Legends, significant increase. All of these shows, well Last Ship and Falling Skies were stacked, and we saw significant catch-up viewing deep into the season. So this -- we think the industry who is not granting stacking is looking at this the wrong way. This is about creating hits and the ability for consumers to find shows and to make it convenient for them, increases their discovery and their willingness to view shows. So at Turner, we have a deal with Warner's. And really, really couldn't be more pleased with Kevin's support and team's support of Warner's. We're going to be looking to stack all of our originals.","Howard M. Averill","Richard talk about -- I mean, HBO basically stacks our originals. So it's selling something.","Jeffrey L. Bewkes","But I've said this before. If you just take Thrones or True Detective or as an example, on Sunday night itself, we're doing probably somewhere in the neighborhood of 25% or 30% viewing. And then on demand, it is doing another 60%. And then you have HBO GO. So even a show as popular as Thrones or True Detective is doing 75%, 80% if it's viewing on non-premiere nights. And for us, obviously, making show available when the consumer wants and how they want it is how we cume up the numbers as high as 19.5 million for Thrones, 13 million for True Detective. John Oliver, or Bill Maher cuming over 4 million, same viewing patterns.","Unknown Executive","So we -- this is more evidence that the TV Everywhere basically, including all networks on demand, and having it available on your television is what the ecosystem should do, it's what cable and telcos should offer, it's what networks should grant for their current year seasons. You can see it. It's as clear as a 5-lane highway. So let's get everybody out there on how to get it done.","Operator","And our next question comes from Alexia Quadrani of JPMorgan.","Alexia S. Quadrani - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Can you provide a bit more color on the upside in HBO subscriber growth domestically in the quarter? I guess, was it driven by more favorable terms with some of your distributors, more aggressive marketing? I guess, any color behind that? And if we should expect it to continue to the fourth quarter?","Jeffrey L. Bewkes","Yes, I think we have better performing distributors in Time Warner Cable and some of our others. And as I made clear, you have a vast disparity and penetration, as low as 14 and as high as 42. So we'll work very hard on this year getting some of our lower penetrating distributors up. That happened. We've seen nothing but a real upside on that going forward. And again, as I've talked about the data that makes clear how many persuadable homes there are out there, we are now taking all of that inside our distributors, breaking it down for them and making clear how much upside opportunity is available to them. The response, as I said on Investor Day, has been extremely enthusiastic. So we believe we're going to see all of those distributors leaning into that possibility going forward.","Alexia S. Quadrani - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And just a follow-up, if I can, on Turner. Can you talk about the difference that you're seeing particularly now with a bit more volatility in the ad market between the demand and maybe pricing for sports programming versus general entertainment?","Jeffrey L. Bewkes","Sure. Right now, we're doing really, really well with the NBA. And so relative to general entertainment, which is probably a better proxy for the broader market, I'd say sports is stronger. And just to repeat what Howard said, we're doing fine in terms of pricing in the scatter market. There just isn't the type of volume that we would like in an ideal world, but sports for us is working quite well.","Alexia S. Quadrani - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Would you say the volume deteriorated in October or is it about the same?","Howard M. Averill","I didn't hear the question.","John K. Martin","No, there hasn't been a demonstrable trends line difference in volume.","Operator","And our next question comes from Michael Nathanson of Nathanson.","Michael Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC","I have one for John and Jeff, one for Kevin, which I want to take, if you can. In answering the DISH question, you did bring up that personal streaming service and you're positive about it. So can you walk us through the parameters of that deal? And what gives you comfort that signing up with a personal streaming service won't impact the 90 million homes that are paying for a bigger bundle?","Kevin Tsujihara","Well, yes, I mean, I mentioned it. I mean, look, we don't have a deal with them. So we -- and I think we've been fairly consistent, Michael, in our view of OTT and -- or what were called virtual MVPDs. What's important for us and what would make us support a service like this would be to get the networks that are leading networks into those packages. And I'll go back to what I said at the Analyst Day, we've got virtually all of our economics in our top 4 or 5 networks. And we don't have that many networks that are niche, that are small, that don't much in terms of ratings that aren't that important. And so we would anticipate, as over time, if bundles get smaller, we would be able to protect and hopefully, even expand as these services will appeal to a greater level of audience, our overall appeal and overall number of consumers that we can get in front of.","Michael Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC","So John, are there conditions on the size of the number of networks in that streaming bundle that you had to work with?","John K. Martin","That's a question for DISH, not for us.","Michael Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC","Okay. And let me ask one for Kevin. Kevin, when answering the stacking rights questions, John and Richard both said, how important stacking rights are to their in the networks. And a lot of times, they mentioned their original content that they've stacked. I wonder, going forward, given the Gotham example, do you think your role as independent producer for broadcasters may change because networks want to may -- control more of their stacking rights and own more of those rights themselves? So how do you see that evolving at a broadcast level?","Kevin Tsujihara","I think the trend will be increased rights granted to networks in stacking. And as John mentioned, we reached an agreement between ourselves to grant those rights to Turner. And I think that as a company, we believe that there isn't an impact on long-term rights related to these kinds of stacking. And I think that therefore, you're going to see, on a go-forward basis, a more consistent grant of rights that is broader.","John K. Martin","Then just one quick further thing. The other thing I just want to mention, too, is that, I mean, our goal and expectation at TNT and TBS is we're going to own more of our originals. And when I say own more, that's Turner and Warner's, and Warner's being our most important studio partners. So we are going to make whatever the right decisions are to increase the probability of success for the shows that we air on our network. And obviously, right now, you can hear a unified approach that stacking is going to help the shows.","Operator","And our next question comes from David Bank of RBC Capital Markets.","David Bank - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Just a quick follow-up, I guess, for Kevin and Jeff on the stacking right question. When you look at the value chain then between what you're doing with Turner in selling full stacking rights for those originals and then looking at the monetization outside of the Turner platform, frankly, like how much more do the Turner nets have to pay for those rights? And do they make them less valuable in the actual deals you're doing now with SVOD distributors? Like is the money more or is it less or is it the same?","Jeffrey L. Bewkes","Look, I'm going to start, and let's go global here. You're talking about an evolution of the rights and windows for shows. And so I think the way to think about it is if the norm becomes that all television networks, when you go to whatever network you want to see your show on, and you know that you can watch any episode of the current season on demand, and you can do it on your television stream, you can do it on a broadband-delivered VOD service, what we're talking about here is taking television and making it VOD universal. Therefore, it would not have an effect on really the discrete change and the price of the show. And as Kevin said earlier, the -- when you do that, and you make the show easier to get attached and engaged and follow, you have actually a more valuable show in subsequent seasons and on later windows. So that's basically what's going to happen in the industry. If you focus too much on any particular deal in the transition period of going from rolling 5 to a full season, I think you'd be missing where this is going. The net effect of the whole thing is to have TV networks become more valuable and more powerful to have the value of any hit show become more valuable, and to then create basically evolution of the windows, where anything in a current season, you know it's on demand, doesn't matter what network you're watching. That's how we see the change in the definition of a television network. You can watch once a day. That works exactly like that, it's called Home Box Office. So just watch HBO. It's been doing that for years. You can -- Showtime now does it, too. You can see exactly how powerful that is. It makes all the networks more valuable, and it makes all the shows more valuable.","Kevin Tsujihara","Yes. And I think the only thing I would add is the key thing is the consistency. But you don't have to guess whether all those shows are going to be stacked on HBO or not, and I think we've got to get to a place where there's more consistency on the rights granted.","Operator","And our last question comes from Anthony DiClemente of Nomura.","Anthony J. DiClemente - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","A question for Richard, and then maybe a follow-up for Howard. On the Comcast-NBCUniversal calls, Steve Burke said about the HBO TT product. He said, \"I think it's going to challenging for HBO to go and try and attract new customers into this ecosystem without cannibalizing existing customers.\" I think you've been clear, Richard, that you don't think that will happen. Presumably, you'll be working with your traditional MVPD partners. I guess, the question is, if you have enough success with your partners on Internet Plus-type offerings, as you described, would you revisit your decision to roll out a standalone OTT product after that sequencing?","Richard R. Plepler","The answer to the last question is no. Let me go to the first, which is Steve. Steve called me personally to give some context to the comment, number one, and I think it was somewhat overreported, if you will. Neil called subsequently and I spoke to him and I think the real point is the one that Neil made in The Wall Street Journal, with namely that HBO and Comcast have been terrific partners. He expects us to be terrific partners going forward. I couldn't echo that more enthusiastically. So we're going to work very closely with them on our current business. We're going to look -- work very closely with them growing it not only in their current video business, but also on the broadband-only and Internet Plus side. And if you have any doubt that we're each -- helping each other to grow each other's business, just look at the performance, and look at 2015 and -- '14 and I think '15 portends even greater growth.","Anthony J. DiClemente - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay. And then one quick one for Howard. You mentioned you continue to track a little bit ahead of the full year earnings guidance that you had provided earlier in the year. If I flow through the third quarter beat and then the tax benefit, it does seem like the fourth quarter comes down a little bit. You called out, Howard, a few of those factors, programming, investments at HBO, comps at Warner, the DISH dispute and then the advertising expectation at Turner, how am I doing on those factors? And then maybe as a way, you can sort of rank those in terms of their impact on the 4Q.","Howard M. Averill","Your underlying assumption about us not looking as good if you take those things out is actually not correct. When I indicated it, if you exclude the restructuring and tax and the program impairment, we're tracking a little bit better than our prior guidance that we gave in August. And what was the question in terms of the ranking of ...","Anthony J. DiClemente - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Well, maybe another way to ask it would be specifically on Turner advertising, so I think you talked about flat. Was that where you had expected the fourth quarter Turner ad growth, for example, going into this part of the year? Or had you expected a growth for the fourth quarter Turner advertising?","Howard M.

Please note that this conference is being recorded.","I will now turn the call over to Michael Kopelman, Senior Vice President-Investor Relations. Mr. Kopelman, you may begin.","Michael Kopelman","Thanks. And good morning, everyone. Welcome to Time Warner's fourth quarter and full-year earnings conference call.","This morning we issued two press releases, one detailing our results for the fourth quarter and full-year, and the other providing our 2016 full-year business outlook. Before we begin there are two items I need to cover.","First, we refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Schedules setting out reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our earnings release and trending schedules. These reconciliations are available on our website at www.timewarner.com\/investors. Reconciliations of our expected future financial performance are also included in the business outlook release that is available on our website.","Second, today's announcement includes certain forward-looking statements, which are based on Management's current expectations. Actual results may vary materially from those expressed or implied by these statements due to various factors. These factors are discussed in detail in Time Warner's SEC filings including its most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q.","Time Warner is under no obligation, and in fact expressly disclaims any obligation, to update or alter its forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.","I will now to the call over to Jeff Bewkes, Time Warner's Chairman and CEO, who will be followed by Howard Averill, Time Warner's CFO. After their prepared remarks our divisional CEOs, John Marten, Richard Plepler and Kevin Tsujihara, will join us for our Q&A session. Jeff?","Jeff Bewkes","Thanks Mike. Thanks, everyone, for listening in this morning. We had another strong year in 2015. Our revenues increased 3% to $28.1 billion, adjusted operating income grew 19% to $6.9 billion and adjusted earnings per share grew 14% to $4.75 a share. That's our seventh consecutive year of double-digit growth in adjusted EPS and we've outpaced all of our peers over that time.","We also returned close to $5 billion to shareholders in share repurchases and dividends and our updated $5 billion share repurchase authorization and our 15% increase and the dividend underscore our commitment to disciplined capital allocation and continued direct returns to shareholders.","It's the same combination of strong execution, continued investment in our businesses and disciplined capital allocation that's allowed us to provide superior long-term returns to shareholders.","As we discussed with you last quarter, the shift to on-demand multiplatform consumption of video content is accelerating. Consumers increasingly have greater control over where, when and on what device they watch their favorite content and they're responding by spending more time and money watching video than ever. With more options available they're also demanding great content be accompanied by a great viewing experience.","And while these shifts present challenges, they also create enormous opportunities. In this environment we're convinced that the strongest brands, biggest networks and the best content will take share. Our strategy was designed with these shifts in mind and we're more confident than ever that we are ideally positioned to benefit.","For years we've been investing in the very best video content and using technology to enhance the value of our brands. With our revenue growth is set to accelerate this year, we will be investing more aggressively not only in content, but also in new capabilities in digital products to ensure our brands and content are available wherever and however consumers look for them. And that we can monetize them effectively when they do.","At the same time we will continue to take our brands around the world and operate as efficiently as possible to help fund investments in future growth. Our structure supports this strategy.","We've deliberately reshaped the company to focus on high-quality video businesses with global scale and are well positioned to capitalize on the growing demand for the very best video content.","The combined scale of our businesses is critical to our ability to take advantage of that growth and it's particularly important in distribution and programming, the core of what we do as a company.","The benefits of our strategy and the advantages of our scale and structure were evident in our many successes in 2015. Let me share a few highlights starting at our networks which continued to lead the industry.","Turner was the only programming group with three of the top 10 ad supported cable networks in prime time among adults 18 to 49. And TBS finished as the number one entertainment cable network in that demo for the third consecutive year.","Our operating momentum was strongest at CNN and Cartoon Network. In 2015 CNN was the fastest-growing top 40 cable networks in the U.S. in its key demo and Cartoon network was the only top three kid\u2019s network to grow ratings.","And then when it comes to premium content HBO remains peerless. Its 43 content Emmy awards not only led all networks for the 14 consecutive year, but was also the most Emmys received in a single year by any network in at least 25 years. That included 12 for Game of Thrones setting a record for any series in one year.","We demonstrated the combined strength of our brands and the scale of our network in affiliate negotiations during 2015. Last spring for example Turner and HBO worked together to renew their agreements with Dish and later in the year, Turner completed a deal with one of its largest distributors and now has all of its top 10 affiliates on a new rate card that will drive accelerating revenue growth starting in 2016.","While strengthening its place inside the multichannel ecosystem, Turner has been expanding its presence outside with two of our biggest digital properties CNN Digital and Bleacher Report growing revenue over 25% on a combined basis.","CNN Digital remains the top position in news for multiplatform views and Bleacher Report again finished the year as the number two digital sports destination in the U.S.","HBO also accelerated its efforts outside the ecosystem with the pioneering launch of HBO NOW last April. HBO NOW was a significant contributor to HBOs 2.7 million domestic subscriber additions last year, capping its best two-year period of subscriber additions in the past 30 years. Just as importantly, HBO continue to have positive momentum with its traditional distributors.","Outside the U.S., HBO Latin America introduced a standalone OTT product in Columbia followed recently by Mexico, expanding the international reach of our streaming products.","We also extended high return, low risk licensing agreements in Canada and certain European territories as we continue to execute the multi-model international distribution strategy that we think best monetizes our great content.","At Warner Bros we had a record year in both revenue and profits driven by growth in its television business and a best ever year in video games. While our overall theatrical performance was not as strong as another years, we\u2019re really proud of our two Oscar-nominated films, Mad Max: Fury Road and Creed.","In television we were the leading supplier to broadcast again and we had the top new broadcast show in Blindspot, the top reality program with The Voice, and the top comedy in The Big Bang Theory.","And Warner Bros ended the year as a top three video game publisher in the U.S. and Europe on the strength of Mortal Kombat X, Batman Arkham Knight, and the successful introduction of a new franchise in Lego Dimensions.","Warner has also continued to build its international business to tap into the significant growth opportunity we see in China specifically. Last year Warner entered into an exciting new venture to produce local language films.","Our confidence in the China opportunities that we enforce by the success of Hollywood VIP, an SVOD partnership between Warner' and Tencent, Holiday VIP added more than $5 million new subscribers in 2015 helped by its exclusive access to Warner Bros Movies and HBO's original program.","So 2015 was another very successful year on multiple fronts and thanks for the investments we've been making we're poised for an even better year in 2016 as we roll out richer, more engaging content line ups across the company and accelerate the pace of investment and innovation.","At HBO that includes increasing the hours of original programming by 50% globally. We'll have an unmatched line-up of returning shows including Game of Thrones, Silicon Valley, John Oliver, Ballers and VEEP as well as some of our oldest new programming in years including Vinyl from Martin Scorsese and Mick Jagger which will debut this Sunday, Westworld from JJ Abrams and produced by Warners, and Divorce with Sarah Jessica Parker.","We also have an ambitious roster of new programming geared to the NOW audience, including shows from Jon Stuart, Bill Simmons, Sesame Street and a Daily Vice Newscast.","As we introduce all this new content and further expand distribution, we\u2019re going to step up our marketing reach beyond that. We think the combination of an even stronger original programming line-up and best selection of hit Hollywood movies and ever improving digital products will drive continued subscriber growth both at HBO NOW and with our traditional distributors.","As we renegotiate some of our more important affiliate agreements over the next couple of years, we expect to better monetize those subscribers and accelerate subscription revenue growth at HBO.","We\u2019ll continue to expand HBO streaming products internationally as well. We anticipate significantly expanding our OTT footprint in Latin America and recently we announced plans to launch a standalone streaming product in Spain later this year.","We\u2019re equally excited about everything to Turner has in store for 2016. It\u2019s going to historic year for Turner Sports, which will broadcast the NCAA Men\u2019s Basketball Finals for the first time and we\u2019re rolling out Turner's new E-Sports league in partnership with WME\/IMG.","And as we head into the home stretch of delivering 2016 presidential election race, CNN will continue to be the place to find authoritative political coverage and analysis.","In Kids, Cartoon will look to build on its momentum from last year and we\u2019re excited about Boomerang's content refresh and global expansion which is the centerpiece of the Kids partnership between Warner and Turner.","This year we\u2019ll also start the brand refreshes of TBS and TNT. TBS recently kicked off it's near line-up with launches of Angie Tribeca and Full Frontal with Samantha Bee. We're already changing perceptions of what to expect from the network and there is a lot more to come.","TNT will start its own refresh later this year with projects such as Animal Kingdom from producer John Wells and Warner Bros. Good Behavior and The Alienist joining its existing line up of leading original, while it will take some time to fully refresh their line ups, we\u2019re already seeing evidence of a bolt new voice from both networks.","These changes at TBS and TNT are just the latest steps in a multiyear transformation at Turner. Over the last several years, we put in place new management teams at Cartoon Networks, CNN, truTV and Turner's international portfolio and the results give us a lot of confidence in our ability to further strengthen TBS and TNT in the years ahead.","In 2015, CNN and Cartoon significantly outpaced their peers and one year after it\u2019s rebrand truTV's ratings in its key demos returned to growth in the fourth quarter and excluding the impact of FX, Tuners internationals networks have grown profits over 60% since 2013.","2016 is also set to be blockbuster year at Warner Bros. We\u2019re expecting another record performance this time led by our theatrical business. Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice arrives in theatres on March 25 and its one of the most anticipated films of this or any year. More than just to class between the two iconic super hero\u2019s it will mark the beginning of a multiyear slate of franchise films at Warner\u2019s.","DC will be a significant part of that slate including Suicide Squad this August and Wonder Woman and the First Justice League movie in 2017. Cartoon Network is also launching a new justice league TV show which will join Teen Titans Go, another DC-based program from Warner Bros and the number one show on Cartoon Network.","That underscores both DCs success in television. It has eight shows on air this season and the deepening integration between Warner\u2019s and Turners Kids business.","The strength of our theatrical slide extends far beyond the DC titles. We're just as excited about fantastic pieces and where to find them. The magical return to JK Rowling's world of Harry Potter set for release this November and we\u2019re already looking forward for the return of our Lego franchise in 2017 with and Lego Batman and Ninjago.","As those title migrate into premium and broadcast windows we'll also benefit from them on HBO and Turner's network.","While it's too early in the development season, we're very confident about the prospects of Warner Bros TV and the upcoming TV season. We're expanding and diversifying our slate of programming working to expand our leadership position in broadcast to basic cable, premium cable and OTT services.","That includes some of HBO's and Turner's biggest new shows that I noted before as well as original broadening for SVOD services like 11\/22\/63 for Hulu and Fuller House for Netflix.","Putting all of this together, I hope you can appreciate why we expect 2016 to be a standout year for Time Warner. We expect the investments we've made in recent years to drive and acceleration in revenue growth.","Along with continued cost discipline that will allow us to invest aggressively in the business while delivering very attractive financial results. All that's reflected in the outlook we released this month.","We're just as confident about our long-term prospects. As I noted earlier, the shift to on-demand consumption is accelerating and we're stepping up our pace of innovation investment to match it.","Because of our industry-leading brands and scale, we're in a great position to take advantage of the many opportunities these shifts are creating and we have clear momentum across the company, so we fully expect to continue delivering industry leading financial results and shareholder returns in many years to come.","Thanks for listening in. I'll turn it over to How.","Howard Averill","Thanks Jeff and good morning. I'll begin by referring to the first slide of our presentation, which is now available on our website.","As you'll recall, 2014's results were affected by significant restructuring and severance charges across the company and programming charges at Turner. Given the nature and size of these items my comments today related to expenses, margins and adjusted operating income for the fourth quarter and full year will exclude these charges from all periods.","Starting with consolidated results, for the year revenues grew 3% or 7% excluding a drag of almost 400 basis points from FX. Adjusted operating income increased 6% or a very healthy 13% absent or more than 700 basis points currency headwind and that came despite a decline in the fourth quarter primarily due to the timing of programming expenses at Turner, programming charges at HBO and difficult comparisons at Warner.","As a result of the restructuring actions we took and ongoing efficiency measures, we limited total expense growth to 2% and increased margins close to a 100 basis points. When we took those actions, we set a goal of $500 million in cost savings.","We recognized the majority of those savings this year and expected to catch our initial target in 2016. Those savings helped find nearly $12 billion in content investments across the company. So we were able to drive margin expansion while still investing aggressively in the business.","Moving down the income statement, adjusted EPS of $4.75 exceeded our outlook for the year and when excluding an FX drag of $0.50, adjusted EPS growth was a very strong 27%.","In addition to our strong operating performance, we also benefited from our share repurchase program. In 2015, we repurchased $3.6 billion of our share. So combined with $1.2 billion in dividend we returned $4.8 billion to shareholders during the year. So we had another really good year in 2015.","That was the result of the same combination of top tier operating performance, relentless focus on efficiency, growth investments and disciplined capital allocation that has allowed us to provide our shareholders with long-term returns well above our peer group average and that's the combination we will continue to strive for in 2016 when we anticipate another year of attractive growth.","That's reflected in our 2016 outlook for adjusted EPS of $5.30 to $5.40 achieving current rates including approximately $0.15 year-over-year headwind from FX. Since that additional FX headwind, our outlook would imply mid to high teens growth in adjusted EPS. I'll provide additional context during our outlook as we go through the presentation.","Now turning to the segment highlights. I'll start at Turner where we grew adjusted operating income double digits in 2015 even in the face of significant FX headwinds and while we continue to invest in the transformation Jeff discussed.","Advertising revenues increased 2% for the year and 5% in the quarter that was ahead of our expectations for the quarter due to the strong domestic ad market and improved ratings trends.","Domestic advertising grew high single digits in the quarter. That was boosted by particularly strong results in news and kids record ratings for MLP Playoff games and comparison for last year's dispute with Dish and the airing of three additional major league baseball playoff games.","International advertising grew low double digits in the quarter excluding an over 18 percentage point drag from FX and the benefit from the consolidation of our sports network in Brazil.","Looking ahead to the first quarter we're seeing a continuation of the recent positive trends. So we expect total advertising revenue to be up in the mid-single digits despite continued FX headwinds and with the scatter pricing pacing up double digits versus the upfront, historically low cancellation levels and great momentum at many of our brands, every indication points to our very strong upfront this year.","Moving on, subscription revenues were up 1% for the year, but looking through the impact of foreign currency would have increased 5%. In the fourth quarter domestic subscription revenues grew in the mid-single digits, which included a benefit of from the top against the dispute with Dish last year and absent a greater than 20 percentage point drag from FX, international subscription revenue grew in the low single digits. A slowdown internationally was due in part to the timing of revenues related to a contract renewal.","Looking to 2016 we now achieved the rate increases we were targeting with all of our top 10 domestic distributors. So we continue to expect domestic subscription revenue growth to accelerate into the low teens starting in the first quarter.","We also anticipate attractive local currency growth at our international networks. So our current rates FX headwinds will prevent a return to reported growth until the later parts of the year.","Adjusted operating income was up 11% for the year. As we anticipated, that included a fourth quarter decline due to 13% programming cost growth, which was mainly a result of higher MLB expenses and the timing of original programming.","For the year, total expenses declined 3% and margins expanded over 300 basis points to the highest level in Turner's history. That was due to continue tight cost control and the benefits of the restructuring we undertook in 2014.","Putting that all together, Turner delivered very strong growth in adjusted operating income while making progress on the multi-year transformation of our core networks. We took share in both news and kids and started the hard work of rebranding our entertainment network. And with the investments we made across the business we laid the groundwork for continued attractive growth in the years to come.","Turning now to HBO where we had another year of strong subscriber growth, while continuing to make the investments necessary to go after the significant global opportunity we see for the business.","Subscription revenues were up 3% for the quarter and 4% for the year. Both periods included about 100 basis point headwind from the combination of foreign exchange and the transfer of HBO's basic cable service in India to Turner.","Domestic subscription revenue increased in the mid-single digits for both the quarter and the year. We continue to see very strong growth in our subscriber base, but subscriber mix remained a constraint on revenue growth.","At the same time, we're pleased with the early progress we're making with HBO NOW who's contribution to subscription revenue increased sequentially throughout the year.","As we move into 2016, we expect the revenue contributions from HBO NOW to increase further as we rollout new programming and expand distribution allowing us to invest even more aggressively in marketing the product and later in the year, we expect to begin renewing some of our affiliate deal, which should result in improved monetization of our subscriber base.","Moving to content and other revenue, which grew 20% in the quarter and 6% for the year, that's mainly due to higher international licensing revenues and is indicative of a strong demand we're seeing globally for HBO's premium content.","Across the HBO's international networks including unconsolidated JVs, revenues increased high single digits for the quarter and year when excluding the impact of FX and transfer of the basic service in India and subscriber growth remained strong especially in Latin America and Europe.","Adjusted operating income was down 3% in the quarter but up 1% for the year. The decline in the fourth quarter was mainly due to higher programming expenses, which increased 11%.","That growth included programming charges primarily related to series and development that HBO decided not to move forward with. Looking through those charges programming cost would have grown 1% in the quarter.","For the full year, total expenses increases 5% reflecting investments in technology and marketing related to the launch of HBO NOW as well higher programming cost.","So 2015 was another successful year for HBO as we maintained the subscriber momentum we had for the past few years and with another year of profit growth and continue to execute our key strategic initiatives including the launch of standalone streaming products in the U.S. and Latin America.","And given the strength of both the global demand for our product and our programming slate, we remain very confident in HBO's ability to accelerate its growth over the next several years.","Moving on to Warner Bros, despite a dip in the fourth quarter, we finished the year with record revenues and profits lead by our TV and games businesses. We achieved that even with a material drag from FX.","On the TV side, revenues increased modestly in the quarter due largely to international growth and for the year, TV revenue grew double-digits that was primarily due to significant growth in licensing revenue including the domestic licensing of 2 Broke Girls, Big Bang Theory, Person of Interest, Seinfeld and Friends.","We also continue to see increasing demand and strong pricing around the globe for Warner's hit content. So we remain encouraged by the strong secular trends in the TV business.","Turning to video games, we have difficult comparisons in the quarter against Lego Batman 3 and Middle Earth Shadow of Mordor. Even so, we posted record video games revenue up close to $1.5 billion for the year and with the great IP and strong franchisee at Warner's we're confident we can continue to grow our games business over time.","We actually knew 2015 would be a challenging year given the lack of any core franchisee releases and the comparison against the end of the Hobbit trilogy, as well as the releases of the Lego movie and Godzilla. So as expected revenues declined for both the quarter and the year.","Looking ahead, 2016 will mark the beginning of an ambitious slate of franchisee movies including at least 17 releases from our DC, Lego and World of Harry Potter franchises through 2020. So we feel great about the outlook for our theatrical business in 2016 and beyond.","Across theatrical and TV, home entertainment revenue declined 10% for the year due to continued weakness and physical sale in particular catalog releases and lower carry-over revenue.","However, digital trends remain healthy with the FT growing in the high teens for Warner's. On the expense side and in line with the enterprise wide focus on cost efficiency, Warner's reduced SG&A by 2% for the year and that included significant savings from the 2014 restructuring actions.","So on the whole Warner's had a terrific year and with a moment at our TV and games businesses and ambitious franchisee film slate for the next several years we're in great position to drive attractive growth at Warner's for the foreseeable future.","Turning to the next slide, we generated very healthy free cash of $3.6 billion in 2015 converting over 90% of our earnings into cash. The year-over-year increase was due to the growth in adjusted operating income and lower cash taxes and not despite the increase in working capital as a result of increased content investments across our division and severance payments related to the restructuring initiatives in 2014.","Our cash taxes declined primarily due to the timing of tax legislation and related payments. Looking to 2016 we expect another year of solid growth and free cash flow driven by strong profit growth and continued high conversion.","Now looking at our balance sheet, we ended 2015 with $21.6 billion of net debt up $1.8 billion from the end of 2014. That's primarily a result of our continued commitment to direct returns to shareholders.","During 2015 we repurchased $3.6 billion in shares and combined with our dividend return $4.8 billion to shareholders. And as Jeff noted earlier the Board authorized a 15% increase in our dividend and up to $5 billion in share repurchases, reinforcing our commitment to provide direct returns to shareholders.","During the year we took advantage of favorable marketing conditions to strengthen our balance sheet by issuing $2.8 billion of long term debt including our first euro denominated debt offering. We also extended the maturity of our revolving bank credit facilities through the end of 2020.","Meanwhile we retired $2 billion of debt in the year as a result of a maturity and a tender offer and redemption of higher price debt and on the investments front, we spent close to $700 million about half of which is related to our real estate project at Hudson Yards. We expect to invest a similar amount in that project in 2016.","We ended the year with a net leverage ratio of approximately 2.85 times just about our target level. Looking forward we plan to return to our target leverage ratio of 2.75 times over the next few quarters and we don\u2019t anticipate a change in either that target level or our capital allocation\u2019s velocity which will remain focused on investment back into our businesses, coupled with M&A and consistent direct returns to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.","With that let's move on to the final slide, which looks at our outlook for 2016. 2016 marks the start of what we anticipate will be a strong content cycle across the company and that should translate into an acceleration in revenue and adjusted operating income growth and another year of strong growth in adjusted EPS.","At Turner we expect another strong year as we take advantage of faster revenue growth and continued cost efficiencies to increase investment for the future.","As I mentioned earlier, subscription revenue growth should accelerate meaningfully and advertising revenue should benefit from a strong ad market, continued momentum at CNN, including from its election coverage, and entering the NCAA championship game for the first time.","And at the same time, we are planning for higher programming and marketing expenses tied primarily to the NCAA championship game and the start of our new NBA deal in 4Q as well as election coverage at CNN and investments in originals related to the brand repositioning at both TBS and TNT. We remain focused on continuing to efficiently manage overhead expenses to help fund these initiatives.","At HBO we also expect faster growth in subscription revenue in 2016 driven by continued subscriber gains including from HBO NOW and improved monetization of our subscriber base. Over the next couple of years we would expect that to take HBO subscription revenue growth into the high-single-digits.","That will be balanced against investments associated with HBO's slate of new originals as well as the new programming targeted for digital platforms. We will also continue to invest in marketing and technology to drive growth on HBO's digital platform.","At Warner Bros. we will kick off our slate of franchise films with the release of Batman v Superman, Suicide Squad and the first of Jo Rowling's Fantastic Beasts films and while we are facing challenging comparisons in TV licensing and video games, we expect both businesses to continue to deliver healthy results.","In addition, we remain focused on driving margin expansion through efficiency measures and the transition to digital. So all in all we expect very strong growth and another record year at Warner.","So looking across all three segments we are set up for a very good year from an operating perspective. That is despite an estimated year-over-year FX drag of approximately $125 million on adjusted operating income and approximately $0.15 on adjusted EPS, which we have factored into our outlook.","And if we look back relative to the expectations we shared with you at our Investor Day, the FX drag on adjusted EPS in 2016 is in the range of $0.55 to $0.60. Absent that we would be on track for the close $6 in adjusted EPS we shared with you then.","In terms of the cadence of the year, we expect our earnings to be weighted toward the back half as a result of the timing of both our film slate and marketing investments at HBO and Turner.","Putting all that together, we expect another very good year in 2016, which is reflected in our outlook for adjusted EPS of $5.30 to $5.40. And that incorporates continued investments in high quality video content and new business models and capabilities that should position the Company to continue to drive very attractive growth for the next several years and beyond.","With that I will turn it back to Mike to start the Q&A.","Michael Kopelman","Thanks, Howard. Mike, can we please open up the line for Q&A?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question is from Alexia Quadrani from JPMorgan.","Alexia Quadrani","Hi. Thank you. There seems to be a lot of opportunity ahead with HBO, traditional domestic opportunity, HBO NOW and international. I guess can you provide us some color of where you think the most upside is, specifically any upcoming milestones that come to you from the outside, for signs of traction?","I know you mentioned some renewals later this year, I guess any color on when and what to expect there and any more color you can give us on HBO NOW subscribers.","Jeff Bewkes","Hey, thanks, Alexia. This is Jeff, I'm going to turn it to Richard.","Richard Plepler","Alexia, thank you. Look, we had a terrific year in sub growth, 2.7 million additional subs. Quite obviously our mission and our opportunity is now, as we have said, to go capture the revenue that reflects that sub growth toward the end of this year and into next year and we are going to do that.","HBO NOW, where we are just getting started, I think we have made a lot of progress. We are not yet out on two major platforms, PlayStation and Xbox, which, for example, on HBO GO account for over 20% of viewing.","And we've not yet put out the content like Jon Stewart, Bill Simmons, VICE daily news show that we think is particularly suited for those platforms. And that of course will catalyze a great deal of marketing, digitally and otherwise, which we think will drive subscriptions.","So, we are very excited about where we are. I think it is important to punctuate that of the 2.7 million, those are full paying subscribers. Our job now is to go -- as the deal renewal cycles open up at the end of this year and into the next 18 months, to go capture that revenue and we intend to do that.","Jeff Bewkes","Richard, why don't you add a little about international HBO?","Richard Plepler","Sure. Well look, we have three basic tenants of course of profit around the world, one is our networks business in 60 countries, and of course licensing into over 150 countries. And it is not, as we've said to you before, a one-size-fits-all strategy. We look at this market by market where we think we can make the most money and we follow the money.","We just added an OTT service in Spain, doing the cost benefit and decided that that is where the best long-term growth opportunity was for us. We extended a licensing deal in Canada with Bell Canada and Bell Media because that's where we thought the best long-term growth opportunity was.","So we take this market by market, we have a lot of flexibility and the reason I think that we're uniquely suited to exploit these opportunities is because we own our own content and that gives us an enormous amount of flexibility however we choose to pivot around the world.","Howard Averill","Hey, Alexia, this is Howard. Just to clarify one thing. The 2.7 million subs, they are paying consumers, we're just not seeing the benefit, as Richard pointed out. That we need to go and we need to work with our distributors to renegotiate as we go forward so that we capture some of that upside as we move forward.","Alexia Quadrani","And then would you see some of that I assume when you do some of the renewals that you pointed to toward the end of this year as well?","Richard Plepler","Precisely right.","Howard Averill","Yes, that starts this year and it goes over the next 18 months or so.","Jeff Bewkes","Look I can't resist -- this is Jeff. I can't resist adding, this is exactly what we've been telling you and it is on track because, remember what we are all focused on here, particularly at HBO, is that we want to show the value and demonstrate consumer penetration, these are paying subs, the value of the service.","We intended to do that before then aligning the affiliate renewals to capture the money and this is something we do in partnership and in order to incentivize our distributors. And we are pushing HBO out both in traditional distribution and on the NOW platform to cover either of the 70 million basics that don't have pay TV or to go after the 12 million or 13 million broadband only's, again just in the U.S.","But if you look at it across all of those platforms, it's basically quite an advantageous position that HBO is now in to accelerate the revenues, not just in '16, but in '17, '18 and beyond.","Alexia Quadrani","Thank you very much.","Michael Kopelman","Thanks, Alexia. Mike, can we have the next question please?","Operator","The next question is from John Janedis from Jefferies.","John Janedis","Hi. Thank you. Just wanted to start maybe with a couple of housekeeping questions. First, can you clarify the programming charges during the quarter by segment? And do you foresee more in the near-term? And then secondly, for the '16 guidance, how much of its driven by the tax rate and do you expect to buy back a similar amount of stock this year?","Howard Averill","Hey, John, this is Howard. So in terms of program impairments, at Turner we had about $130 million in the fourth quarter and that was tied to the TBS and TNT transition which has now started at TBS and we have rolled out some new shows and we are pretty pleased so far with where that is going.","There is another $50 million or so of charges at HBO and that was tied to some series that we decided not to move forward with which happens occasionally. So in the quarter it was about $180 million of charges.","As far as the taxes and the buyback, I would say the tax rate in '16 will actually go up versus '15. That's in part because we saw some fourth quarter benefits that lowered the rate overall for '15. So I think if you look forward you should see a tax rate that might be up a couple hundred basis points, more in line with what we had in the first three quarters of 2015.","In terms of buybacks, as always that's going to depend on what our free cash flow generation is and what other alternative uses of capital are. But given that we ended the year at about 2.85 times, which was above our target leverage of 2.75 times, I would expect that the buyback would come down a bit versus 2015 levels.","John Janedis","Thanks, Howard. And maybe, Jeff, separately. You talked a bit now about potentially retaining rights longer or delaying SVOD sales. Can you give us updated views? And is there any anecdotal evidence that there would be an impact on ratings given how millennials consume content?","Do others need to follow to strengthen the industry broadly and if there is anything to share in the context of partnering in Hulu that would be helpful, thanks.","Jeff Bewkes","That's a lot of questions. Let's start with what you were talking about in terms of either syndication sales, windows, etc. We are not ideological about syndication windows, that depends on evolution and a lot of factors.","But I think the overriding point everybody ought to focus on is that it is becoming crystal clear that consumers want the ability to watch their favorite show, their favorite network on demand across whatever platform they are watching, whatever window it is, whether it's a new show, current season, whether it is one- or two-year-old show they want to see it on demand.","We want to make sure our networks have the flexibility to meet that consumer demand. Now if you look at HBO, a perfect example. HBO has for many years provided on demand access to almost all the content, multiple seasons that it has ever produced. Some of the new entrants in the business that have VOD as a primary feature have also put multiple seasons on.","The Turner networks are committed to delivering more programming on demand across their distribution channels, that is whether you get it in a new bundle over the top, whether you get it through a traditional distributor. And Warner's already sells broad suites of rights when partners are interested in them. And of course Warner sells to every kind of network, broadcast, premium, cable, over the top subscription VOD services.","So the overriding development, which is a good development, is that consumers want VOD on whatever show or window they are watching and we are basically moving to satisfy consumer demand.","Now your second question, which is what has to happen, not just in our company, and I think we have been pretty clear about what we said, is that distributors need to be able to offer more on-demand functionality.","We see them moving quite rapidly now to do that. You can look at interfaces and on-demand offerings at Comcast. You can see new bundles and moves at Verizon or Sling and I think Sony has a new product.","I think you are going to see ever increasing innovation across the distribution platforms over the top and in traditional distribution package offerings. So this consumer demand is going to be satisfied and it is basically going to be good for any brand, any network or any show that has strong consumer residence.","And that is why we think that it's very good for our very concentrated suite of networks at Turner and HBO and we think it's very good for the world's leading producer of TV shows and films, which is Warner Bros. He had one more question, what was it?","Howard Averill","Well I just want to go back to it. I want to just do some housekeeping on your housekeeping question which you talked about are there future plans for charges. There is not any plans for any material charges going forward.","Jeff Bewkes","I think you asked a question about Hulu.","John Janedis","Correct.","Jeff Bewkes","Yes. Well, as you know, we're not going to comment on someone else's asset or any press speculation. But so putting aside who -- we're actively pursuing opportunities outside the ecosystem. You have heard it at Turner, at HBO, at Warner's.","It is part of our efforts to meet the consumer demand who are looking for more video and more VOD, whether it is HBO NOW, whether it is our Turner networks and all the new over-the-top bundles, whether it is both Turner HBO product or Warner product in overseas markets, basically that is what you are seeing. We think it is a good thing that we have these new entrants offering more on-demand.","Michael Kopelman","Thanks, John. Mike, can we have our next question, please?","Operator","Your next question is from Michael Nathanson from MoffettNathanson.","Michael Nathanson","Thank you. I have one for Richard and one for John. Richard, now you are into the first year of life at HBO NOW. I wonder what has surprised you in terms of the roll out. And how have you adjusted your strategies based on that learning?","And then for John, there's been increasing focus by us on minimum carriage agreements between networks and distributors. So if you could talk a bit about how close Turner is to your floors on those minimums and whether or not you have to adjust down any of your minimums in exchange for the better pricing that you received?","Richard Plepler","Michael, thank you, it is Richard. Look, we are learning all the time. We are at this eight months, we are at about 800,000 paying subscribers. We see an enormous amount of opportunity ahead.","As I said to Alexia, we are excited about getting on additional platforms. We're excited about bringing new content to the product which we think is going to draw people in on a daily basis, things like Stewart and VICE News and Simmons and we're going to begin to market more aggressively.","But again, I don't want to bury the lead. HBO NOW is an additive part of our growth strategy. And what we have seen in the ecosystem where we see the vast amount of growth is that we have huge opportunities there as well. So we are going to work on a multifaceted way to expand our sub base and to expand our sub revenue as I discussed earlier.","John Martin","Hi, Michael, it's John. So with respect to your carriage agreement question, for a long time now Turner has paid a lot of attention to it distribution commitments. And I'm not going to speak specifically about any one of our distributors, but we do have protections in all of our agreements and we feel really confident from a contractual standpoint that we will be highly penetrated and remain highly penetrated.","I think more importantly over time what's going to determine the distribution strength is going to be the strength of your brands. And we have now -- and this has been a long time coming for Turner and Time Warner, we've just now completed a distribution rate renewal cycle that we started planning for four years ago and beginning in the first quarter of 2016 we're going to see meaningful acceleration in our domestic subscription revenues.","And we feel great about that, we think it is a tremendous validation of the brands that we have. And I feel very confident that our brands are going to be carried in all and any major programming packages going forward. So we haven't made -- and specifically to your question have we made adjustments down on penetration, the answer is no.","Michael Nathanson","Okay. Thanks John,","Michael Kopelman","Thanks, Michael. Mike, can we have our next question, please?","Operator","Your next question is from Ben Swinburne from Morgan Stanley.","Ben Swinburne","Thank you. Good morning. A couple. Howard, I don't know if you would be willing to help us with working capital and cash taxes for '16. And then, John, just picking up on the Turner outlook, as I am sure you are well aware, there is a big focus on domestic affiliate revenue growth across the space.","Now that you have got all of your deals done can you help us with '17 and '18? I think you had guided to low teens again in 2017. But given what you are seeing in subs and sub trends and your deals that are now done, you probably have pretty good visibility so any comfort there you could give us would be really helpful.","And then if I can sneak one more in on HBO. Richard, have you thought about -- I am sure you have thought about it, but are you -- are there any restrictions to changing the price point on HBO NOW? Just wondering if you have considered lowering the price of the over the over-the-top product in the U.S. given where the sort of other over-the-top services are priced? Thanks.","John Martin","Do you want me to start? Hey, Ben, it is John. I will start on the carriage agreements and visibility. Look, I think this is one of the great benefits of being in this business and having the great partnerships that we have with our affiliates is that we have multiple year deals with great visibility on how that is going to translate into revenue.","And so, as I said, we still continue to expect, and we have been predicting this now for a long time, that our subscription revenues are going to accelerate into the low teens in 2016.","I think in 2017 I would expect the growth rate to be in a similar level. We feel really terrific about and confident about our ability to achieve those levels. We have done everything we said we were setting out to do on our rate renewal cycle and we feel great about that.","Ben Swinburne","Thank you.","Richard Plepler","Yes, Ben, you wanted to know about price. Look, we don't have any plans to change the price point at this point. We have a lot of flexibility. But what we are seeing is an enormous amount of growth in the ecosystem. So, listen, we think that our premium price right now makes sense. And we will assess that as we go forward, but right now we have to plans to change it.","Howard Averill","Back to free cash flow, Ben. So as I mentioned, in 2015 we converted at over 90% of our earnings to cash flow. We see strong conversion going forward, nothing really unusual from a working capital standpoint.","I would say with respect to cash taxes, we did see some benefit this year from some legislation. We're going to see continued benefit in '16, but I would expect it might tick up a bit from a cash tax standpoint in 2016.","Ben Swinburne","Thank you all.","Michael Kopelman","Thanks, Ben. Operator, Mike, can we have the next question please?","Operator","And your next question is from Anthony DiClemente from Nomura Securities.","Anthony DiClemente","Thanks for taking my questions. I have one for Kevin and one for John. Kevin, of course big film year for Warner's. I wonder if you can also touch on the TV licensing comparisons that Howard mentioned, the large syndication sales that you guys had in 2015 in the prepared remarks.","And given those compares on content licensing, I wonder if you could help us with the swing factors around the growth trajectory for Warners in 2016. So can video games and film kind of more than offset the tough TV licensing comps this year?","And then for John, Howard said just back to restructuring, I know Howard just said that you have no plans for further restructurings as of now, but I was just wondering at Turner what gives you the confidence and do you think the businesses are right sized at this point given the cable TV environment.","Do you have any further cost-cutting for the non-programming expenses planned and just walk us through how you evaluate that on an ongoing basis. Thank you.","Kevin Tsujihara","Anthony, it's Kevin. As Howard mentioned, we do face a very difficult comp from a TV licensing perspective. We don't have -- we had 2 Broke Girls, Person of Interest, Friends and Seinfeld and the second cycle of Big Bang Theory. We don't have similar type product going down the pipeline in 2016.","But I will say that one of the things that we do have we have Monk coming up. And the lumpiness of television licensing has decreased as you have seen more of the SVOD revenue.","Shows like Blindspot, Supergirl, Lucifer and Legends of Tomorrow, which are big first-year shows this year, won't have the same type of one-time kind of lumpiness as you look at how we are recognizing revenue and how we are selling these shows going forward.","'16 and beyond, '16 and '17 are big film years, it's what we talked to you about in October. Feel really good about kind of setting up a film franchise with Batman v Superman, Suicide Squad and Fantastic Beasts look great. And so yes, I do believe that film and games will more than offset the difficult comp in TV and we will have strong growth in 2016.","Anthony DiClemente","Thanks, Kevin.","John Martin","Hay, Anthony, its John. So let's start with where we are at right now, yes we've taken some pretty material restructuring recharges over the last couple of years. As you heard Howard say, no plans on the programming side. Look, I would say -- to take additional restructurings that is.","Look, with regard to expenses overall on an adjusted basis, Turner finished 2015 with the highest margins we have had in its history. And I think our margins are now at or near the top of for the industry is and having said that, we are going to remain incredibly disciplined across the entire Company as it relates to expenses and pay very close attention to how and where we are spending our money.","And we are going to be doing that at the same time that we are going to be investing to improve capabilities and build new businesses. So, I feel terrific about the efficiency of the operations of the Company right now.","I still believe longer term that our programming costs will grow in the high-single-digit range which is what we have been saying now for a long time and our non-programming costs should grow much, much more slowly than that.","Howard Averill","I just wanted to follow on and just point out -- John's discussion of the efficiency at Turner that is a philosophy across the entire company. It is something that we continue to be focused on as we move forward.","Anthony DiClemente","Okay, thanks.","Michael Kopelman","Thanks, Anthony. Mike, next question please.","Operator","And your next question is from the line of Richard Greenfield with Deutsche Bank.","Brandon Ross","Ross from BTIG in for Rich. Two questions, one for Jeff and one for Richard. First for Jeff, one of your peers, Facebook, grew mobile ad revenue by $2 billion year over year in Q4 alone, largely on the back of video advertising.","As consumer engagement shifts to mobile away from TV what is your strategy for competing specifically in mobile? Do you need to start new businesses, make acquisitions, or combine with another entity?","Jeff Bewkes","Brandon is this Jeff. Good question. We're focused on that opportunity. And let's break it into a couple of pieces. One is availability and that is we are committed to making our content available across all platforms including mobile. That is why we went out years ago and put the TBE contracts in place for VOD to all of our affiliates. That is why HBO announced On Demand more than a decade ago and now they have NOW.","And so what we have been doing, if you go beyond those two pretty obvious examples, is we've been building more digital businesses that go straight to mobile.","So let's look at them. There is CNN, which is the leader in mobile news and you are seeing very strong growth in CNN in all digital platforms but certainly in mobile and domestically and internationally, by the way.","You have the launch of Great Big Story, that is already with 170 million video views in just the first few months. Bleacher Report -- the number two online sports destination in the country has a very strong mobile presence given the nature of that programming, particularly with its team stream app.","Super Deluxe, which is a new launch at Turner of a digital studio that makes short form video that is very weighted to mobile, is yet another one. So if you take all of those together, that could -- probably should add some -- John, add the cartoons.","John Martin","Yes, just to amplify what Jeff said, the other category where we have a very strong competitive position and we are really focused on growing the business is in kids. We re-launched the mobile app for Cartoon Network in the summer and within two months I think our traffic doubled.","And so, there is going to be consistent innovation as we are going to continue to make our products better and better and better. And I think the monetization of our traffic on all of these platforms is going to begin to improve.","Jeff Bewkes","And then let's go back to HBO. You were asking mostly from the position -- from the point of view of ad revenue. HBO doesn't do that. But we have a lot of sub revenue there that is tied to mobile as well.","So new content like John Stewart, Bill Simmons, the VICE daily show we think is going to thrive on digital platforms. And then not to leave at Kevin, because he is sitting here, with Griffin Studio, that Warner is focused on short form content also for this kind of environment. So we're basically moving with many avenues into this business.","Richard Plepler","Brandon, its Richard. So is that\u2026","Michael Kopelman","Brandon, do have another, I can't remember, do you have another question?","Brandon Ross","Yes, yes. So my second question for you, Richard, was a year ago you thought all the ISPs would be actively marketing HBO NOW. But it seems like they clearly want to protect their legacy video bundle at all costs.","Do you think this is why you only have 800,000 HBO NOW subs? And does it alter your thinking about the economic viability of OTT? And does it change your view on ISP consolidation?","Richard Plepler","The answer to the last two questions are no and no. Let me make a couple of points. First of all, I wouldn't say only 800,000 HBO NOW subs. We are just getting started, as I said earlier. I think we are going to make a lot of progress as we put new content on and get onto new platforms. And listen, our distributors are selling HBO in a variety of different ways.","I had dinner with one of our major distributors the other night. We talked about our growth opportunities. Part of the conversation was HBO NOW and they were very excited about it.","So I reject the notion that our major distributors out of hand don't want to bundle HBO NOW, I don't think that is true. And as our deals come up for renewal I think we will see different kinds of packaging.","But listen, if they want to sell HBO through skinny bundles, fantastic. If they want to sell HBO through triple plays, fantastic. And I think it is very important to remember that in the last four years we have grown eight million subscribers over the 44\u2026","Jeff Bewkes","In just the United States.","Richard Plepler","In just the United States. In the 44-year history of our Company that is 20% of our sub growth. What that tells you is, and I have said before, nobody is doing us any favor selling HBO. They're growing their own businesses by using our brand to grow their different companies.","So, I think this is a win-win. And whether they want to market and bundle NOW or whether they want to do skinny bundles or basic packages or triple plays, there is growth opportunities for them and parenthetical growth opportunities for us. That's what we are excited about.","Michael Kopelman","Thanks Brandon, Operator, Mike, I think we have time for one more question.","Operator","The last question is from Jessica Reif Cohen from Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Jessica Reif Cohen","Thank you. I have two questions. We've talked a lot on the call about TV windows. Can you discuss how you are thinking about film windows, how they might change and how that would affect both Warner Bros and HBO?","And the second question is you and all of your peers have talked about the strength of the ad market. What do you think finally drove it back up and how are you feeling going into the upfront market?","Jeff Bewkes","Kevin, you start on it.","Kevin Tsujihara","On the film window question, I think that similar to the conversation that Jeff had on television windows, we are constantly looking at what consumers are looking for, what consumers are asking for and evaluating how to monetize that demand for content earlier and earlier. We obviously have constituents in the film exhibition community that we are trying to also weigh the impact on that as well.","But I think that we continue to look at it. I think the industry is looking at it. And it also would affect the pay-TV window. And Richard and I have had a number of conversations about what that would do to that and how HBO would play potentially even in that world as well.","Jeff Bewkes","Well, let me add something because Richard it's good for HBO; however, that ends up. And one of the reasons is if films get more available in your home on demand and you have got to look at what kind of price will be yielded by that, it is going to make the movie aspect of premium TV, which HBO has the lead of, more valuable from consumer -- in terms of what consumers value they're going to see what they're getting in the HBO subscription just on the movie side, leave out the original program -- as ever more valuable. That's a good thing.","Richard Plepler","Absolutely. I would just add that, because it is often obscured, that our film viewing across all platforms is over 72% of viewing, and on a linear network it is over 77% of viewing. So the truth of the matter is, the film business continues to be an enormous engine of viewership and subscriber satisfaction for HBO.","John Martin","Hey Jessica, it's John. So I will take the advertising question. We were really pleased with how strong 2015 ended. And I'm also pleased, as Howard said, that we have seemed to be continuing a meaningful amount of momentum into the first quarter. And I think there were a number of factors, I think some of them are company specific and I think some of them are market specific.","The company specific factors would be right now our news business is killing it. And we are really taking advantage of the hot news cycle and sports is really strong for us. We're seeing very strong demand for the NBA and for the NCAA men's basketball championship. We are also seeing great strength in the kids market and I think we are taking share there.","In terms of the overall ad market, I think you are seeing a few things that are contributing to the buoyancy and the vibrancy of the market. Number one, the strength of scatter all throughout 2015 means that if you sat out the upfront you paid for it in the scatter market.","So we're looking ahead and we think all indicators would seem to suggest that this year's upfront is going to be particularly strong. And I think that is going to reverse what has been a couple of years of being not so strong.","And I think there is a recognition that TV is still the best reach medium and the most effective option for brand advertisers to convey their message. And so, there is going to be a lot of innovation happening in advertising. We want to lead the market there. But we feel really good about where things are right now.","Michael Kopelman","All right, thanks, Jessica. And thank you, everybody, for joining us today. If you have any follow-up questions please give us a call. Have a great day.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."],"20488":["Time Warner, Inc.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded.","I will now turn the call over to Michael Kopelman, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Kopelman, you may begin.","Michael Kopelman - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Time Warner's second quarter earnings conference call. This morning we issued two press releases, one detailing our results for the second quarter and the other reaffirming our 2015 full-year business outlook.","Before we begin, there are two items I need to cover. First, we refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Schedules setting out reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our earnings release and trending schedules. These reconciliations are available on our website at www.timewarner.com\/investors. Reconciliations of our expected future financial performance are also included in the business outlook release that's available on our website.","Second, today's announcement includes certain forward-looking statements, which are based on management's current expectations. Actual results may vary materially from those expressed or implied by these statements due to various factors. These factors are discussed in detail in Time Warner's SEC filings, including its most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. Time Warner is under no obligation and in fact expressly disclaims any obligation to update or alter its forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.","I will now turn the call over to Jeff Bewkes, Time Warner's Chairman and CEO, who will be followed by Howard Averill, Time Warner's CFO. After their prepared remarks, our divisional CEOs, John Martin, Richard Plepler, and Kevin Tsujihara, will join us for our Q&A session. Jeff?","Jeffrey L. Bewkes - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Mike, and thanks, everyone, for listening in this morning.","We had another very strong quarter, with revenues increasing 8% to $7.3 billion, reflecting growth at all our operating divisions. We grew our adjusted operating income by 15% to a record $1.9 billion. Adjusted EPS was up 28%. And year to date, we've returned $2.6 billion to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. These results reflect the steady progress we're making on our strategic priorities, and they put us on track for another year of very attractive financial performance.","As you all know, we're committed to delivering industry-leading financial results while investing aggressively to adapt to the rapid changes in the media landscape. We will continue to help fund those investments through a companywide focus on operational efficiency. And those investments are what will allow us to capitalize on the growing global opportunities for the very best video content across both the traditional and emerging video ecosystems. You can see how we're taking advantage of those opportunities in the performance of each of our divisions this quarter.","Let me start with Home Box Office, where our unrivaled original programming has never been stronger. This year, HBO and its sister channel, Cinemax, received a combined 131 Primetime Emmy nominations. That includes a record of 126 for HBO. And that marks the 15th year in a row that HBO has received the most nominations of any network. And it includes nominations for outstanding comedy series for Silicon Valley and Veep, and for outstanding drama series for Game of Thrones.","These accolades reflect the excitement we're seeing among HBO subscribers. Game of Thrones' fifth season set yet another record as the most watched HBO season ever, captivating over 20 million viewers each episode. And three of our acclaimed newcomers from last year, Silicon Valley, Last Week Tonight with John Oliver, and True Detective, each returned to strong audiences in their second seasons.","In June, we introduced two new hits, Ballers and The Brink, both of which have already been renewed. We launched HBO NOW, our standalone streaming service in the U.S., during the second quarter, and we're extremely pleased with how well it's been received. It was the top grossing entertainment app on iTunes in both May and June, and we recently extended its distribution to Verizon, Amazon, and Google. We'll be adding other platforms soon as well as more traditional distribution partners.","Given the positive early reaction to NOW, we are already investing in additional programming to support the service. For example, we think programming from our new multi-platform agreement with sports personality Bill Simmons will be particularly appealing to consumers in an on-demand environment. At the same time, our discussions with the creative community indicate HBO GO and HBO NOW have made the service an even more attractive outlet, and you will see additional announcements demonstrating that in the coming months.","In addition to programming, we'll be investing even more in marketing to take advantage of the large subscriber opportunity we see in front of us. We are also in the process of significantly increasing our programming investment at Turner's Entertainment Networks, with a focus on more creatively ambitious projects, and that's going to further differentiate and strengthen networks that are already leading the industry.","In the second quarter, TNT and TBS ranked number one and number two respectively among ad-supported cable networks in primetime with adults 18 to 49. And including Adult Swim, Turner claimed the top three spots in primetime among adults 18 to 34. Adult Swim also finished as ad-supported cable's number one network in total day among adults 18 to 34 for the 29th consecutive quarter, supported by originals like Rick and Morty, which just celebrated its second season debut by more than doubling its audience from last season's premiere.","TNT's leading performance in the quarter underscored the importance of our partnership with the NBA and the strength of our on-air talent, so we're particularly pleased that the crew of the Emmy award-winning Inside the NBA has re-upped with Turner for the duration of our new NBA agreement.","Over time, we're confident that refreshing our brands and our content at TBS and TNT will result in the same kind of renaissance we're seeing at Cartoon Network and CNN. Cartoon Network grew total day ratings among kids 6 to 11 by double digits, and it was the only major kids' network to grow in the quarter, overtaking Nickelodeon as the number two network in that demo for the first time in its history.","At CNN, primetime viewership in its key 25-to-54 demo grew 25% in the quarter, and it continued to age down while our competitors aged up. CNN is also building on its lead in digital. In June, CNN.com streamed 212 million videos. That's a record for the site, and it made it the news leader in digital video for the second straight month, ahead of Buzzfeed and Yahoo! News.","Turner and Warner Bros. are also making progress on their global kids strategy. Together, they recently announced plans to produce close to 450 half-hours of original animated content for Turner's kids networks, and to make greater use of Warner's iconic animation library globally.","In addition to making Boomerang a global flanker brand for Cartoon Network, this will provide a new platform for Warner's to reinvigorate classic characters and to create new kids franchises, and it's a great example of the natural collaboration taking place across the company.","We're upgrading not just our content but also our marketing partners' ability to utilize it effectively. At this year's upfront, we announced the new Turner Data Cloud, which provides marketers a greatly enhanced ability to target audiences across our linear and digital properties. And our innovative advertising products were critical to Turner garnering price increases at the very top of the industry.","Warner Bros. also had a strong performance in this year's upfront, with 62 programs slated for the upcoming television season. Warner's lineup included 29 shows on broadcast primetime, with at least two series on each network. That includes a record 20 returning shows, and it makes Warner's the top supplier of broadcast series again this year.","We all know Warner's is the gold standard in television and film production, but its growing video game business is also an industry leader. For the first half of the year, Warner ranked as the top video game publisher in North America and had the two biggest releases in Batman: Arkham Knight and Mortal Kombat X. We're looking to build on that momentum with next month's release of LEGO Dimensions, our entry into the toys-to-life category.","What you've seen across Warner, which is also happening throughout our company, is how the best IP can be monetized across many different platforms both inside and beyond traditional ecosystems. For example, DC content is the basis for seven shows scheduled to air in the upcoming season, including returning hits like The Flash and Gotham, and new shows such as Supergirl. It's also the basis for our biggest games franchise and new ventures like DC's Super Hero Girls, the toys and digital content partnership we recently announced with Mattel. Plus, I can't resist pointing out we still have a nice business selling actual comic books.","And of course, there are the films. At last month's Comic-Con, the new trailer for Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice generated the most buzz of any upcoming film both inside the convention halls and on social media, and DC's Suicide Squad was not far behind. Those films don't come out until 2016, but they provide a sense as to why we have so much confidence in our slate for the next year and many years to come.","So a year after the Time Inc. spinoff, I'm really pleased with how we're executing our strategy to take advantage of the growing opportunities we see both within and beyond the traditional video ecosystem. At the same time, we recognize the pace of change in our industry is accelerating. And that means we're going to have to move even faster to ensure we have the best content, provide the best possible consumer experience, and can monetize our viewership effectively across a wide variety of platforms and geographies, all while maintaining our focus on operational efficiency.","So in the coming months and years, you'll see us investing aggressively to stay ahead of the changes in our industry and capitalize on an environment where the biggest hits, networks, and brands are taking share. With our global scale and strong brands, I'm confident we're well positioned for that environment and that we can both meet our strategic objectives and continue to deliver industry-leading financial results.","With that, let me turn it over to Howard.","Howard M. Averill - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Jeff, and good morning. I'll begin by referring to the first slide of our presentation, which is now available on our website, starting with consolidated results.","Halfway through the year, we're really pleased with our execution to date. In the first half, we grew adjusted operating income 13% and adjusted EPS 25%. And we did that while making progress on our strategic objectives and investing aggressively for future growth.","In the second quarter, revenue was up a very healthy 8%. And adjusted operating income rose 15% to $1.9 billion, a record quarterly profit. And excluding a drag of approximately 400 basis points from FX, revenue growth would have been 12%.","In addition to strong revenue growth, adjusted operating income margins expanded more than 150 basis points. And that's despite 6% growth in total expenses, primarily from increased investments in content and marketing. Moving forward, we'll remain disciplined on overhead and other non-programming-related spending to help fund investments that will strengthen our competitive position and drive future growth.","Moving down the income statement, adjusted EPS grew 28% in the quarter. So once again, we were able to grow adjusted EPS even faster than adjusted operating income. That was helped by our ongoing share repurchase program and a lower effective tax rate in the quarter.","During the quarter, we repurchased over $900 million in shares and paid close to $300 million in dividends. So year to date, we've returned over $2.6 billion to shareholders. And this morning we reaffirmed our guidance for 2015 adjusted EPS to be in the range of $4.60 to $4.70. That implies mid-teens growth in adjusted EPS when excluding the programming and restructuring charges and tax matters from the second half of 2014, and that's despite a material drag from a stronger U.S. dollar that we have discussed with you previously. So we feel really good about how we're operating and remain focused on executing our strategy to drive continued growth longer term.","Now turning to the segment highlights, I'll begin at Turner, where we posted very strong profit growth of 20%. Subscription revenues increased 2%, or 6% excluding the impact of FX. Domestic subscription revenue grew 4%, consistent with the first quarter. Absent a drag of approximately 20 percentage points from FX, international subscription revenue was up low double digits. And on that basis, we continue to see the healthiest trends in Latin America.","Looking to the third quarter, we expect a negative impact of approximately 500 basis points on total subscription revenue growth as a result of FX and the benefit from certain contractual settlements in the third quarter of 2014. However, we expect underlying domestic subscriber trends to be consistent with the first half of the year and remain on track for domestic sub revenue growth to accelerate into the teens in 2016 and 2017.","Moving on, advertising declined 1%, but excluding FX grew a little more than 1%. That was a bit below our initial expectations, largely due to airing fewer NBA playoff games than anticipated. In total, the impact from foreign exchange, fewer NBA games, and the absence of NASCAR weighed on growth by close to 500 basis points in the quarter.","Domestic advertising grew slightly in the quarter. International advertising grew low single digits when excluding an FX drag of over 18% and the benefit from the consolidation of our sports network in Brazil, and that was despite difficult comparisons in Latin America due to the impact of the World Cup last year.","Looking ahead to the third quarter, scatter pricing is currently pacing up high single to low double digits. The ratings at our entertainment networks will likely offset that benefit. We also expect a drag of over 400 basis points on advertising from the combination of foreign exchange and the absence of NASCAR programming. As a result, we anticipate total advertising revenue to be down modestly.","Content and other revenues increased close to 50% in the quarter, and that was boosted by our deal with Hulu, which is a great example of how we can benefit from our increased investment in and ownership of original programming.","Adjusted operating income was up 20%, with margins expanding close to 600 basis points. That was helped by a 6% decline in total expenses, including lower programming costs. Programming expenses were down 9% in the quarter. That was largely due to the absence of NASCAR programming as well as lower acquired programming costs.","As we discussed with you previously, we are investing in new content that better fits our refreshed programming strategy at TNT and TBS. The ramp in that programming will start to show up in the fourth quarter of this year. Taking that into account and the absence of NASCAR programming in the third quarter, we anticipate that programming cost growth will be heavily weighted to the fourth quarter.","SG&A expenses were essentially flat in the quarter. But excluding a reversal of an accrued contingency in the second quarter of last year, SG&A would have been down mid-single digits. And that reflects our continued focus on cost efficiencies and savings from last year's restructuring actions.","So overall, Turner is executing really well and is making great progress on its strategic initiatives. And we remain on track to deliver strong growth and adjusted operating income in 2015 while continuing to make the investments necessary to position us for strong growth over the long term.","Turning now to HBO, where we are investing significantly to take advantage of the large global opportunity we see for premium services, domestically subscription revenue growth remained in the mid-single digits despite very attractive sub growth. Consistent with recent quarters, subscription revenue growth has been limited by a shift toward non-revenue generating subs. Over time we expect to better monetize those subscribers, which should help drive an acceleration in domestic subscription revenue growth.","Similarly, we anticipate HBO NOW will be a more material contributor to subscription revenue growth over time. We're pleased with the initial consumer response to the service, but we saw only a modest benefit to the sub revenue in the second quarter due to the 30-day free trial period for new subscribers.","Looking ahead to the third quarter, we expect to benefit from a full quarter of paying subs on HBO NOW. And as Jeff mentioned, HBO NOW recently launched on Amazon, Google, and Verizon, which should contribute more meaningfully to subscription revenue growth later in the year.","Moving on, content and other revenues were down 7% in the quarter, due in part to difficult comparisons with our home entertainment releases. In the quarter, we recognized a comparable amount of revenues from our licensing agreement with Amazon as we did in the year-ago quarter while agreeing to expand our relationship to include the distribution of HBO NOW. At our international networks, including unconsolidated JVs, we continue to see good subscriber growth, though revenue declined due to foreign currency movements and the transfer of HBO's basic service in India to Turner.","Adjusted operating income fell 8% in the quarter, as we made significant investments in marketing and technology to support the launch of HBO NOW. And given our plan to continue investing in customer acquisition, we expect HBO NOW to generate losses for the remainder of this year, and that's typical for an early-stage subscriber business. Even so, we're on track for another good year of adjusted operating income growth, as we anticipate revenue trends to improve in the second half of the year. And our early experience suggests that HBO NOW will be a highly profitable revenue stream for us over time.","Moving on to Warner Bros., which posted a record second quarter, growing revenue 15% and adjusted operating income 46%, and that's despite a significant drag from foreign exchange. These results underscore our growing ability to monetize the best IP across a wide variety of platforms. The biggest growth driver was our games business, which posted its best quarter ever, led by the strong performance of franchise releases Batman: Arkham Knight and Mortal Kombat X. Games revenue more than tripled, passing $0.5 billion in the second quarter alone. And with the great IP at Warner's disposal, we remain optimistic about the long-term opportunity for this business.","On the TV side, revenue increased over 20% due to strong growth in licensing fees. That growth included the second cycle syndication of The Big Bang Theory, the SVOD licensing of Seinfeld, and an international license of Friends, all of which highlight the increasing value of hit content.","In our theatrical business, revenues declined in the quarter despite modest growth from our film releases. And that was a result of lower TV licensing of films and the timing of the home entertainment release of the latest installment of The Hobbit franchise.","Across theatrical and TV, home entertainment revenue was down 18%. That was due to the timing of the home entertainment release I just mentioned and softness in catalog. Even with that difficult comparison, EST revenue growth remained healthy, increasing close to 20%. And EST growth for the industry was close to 30%, helping offset a decline in physical sales that took consumer spending across the broader home entertainment industry down mid-single digits in the quarter.","So overall, Warner Bros. had a terrific quarter and is on pace for very attractive growth and a record year of adjusted operating income in 2015. And with a great theatrical slate and momentum at our TV and games businesses, we're confident we can continue to drive solid growth in the coming years.","Turning to the next slide, free cash flow totaled $1.8 billion in the first half. That's down from a year ago due to a significant swing in working capital, but is still very healthy conversion. Growth in working capital reflects higher receivables from increased games and content revenues, the timing of collections, severance payments related to last year's restructuring initiatives, and increased content investments across our divisions.","Cash interest increased modestly as a result of the additional debt we issued last year. And our cash taxes declined, primarily due to favorable tax legislation that was passed late in 2014.","Looking ahead, we continue to expect working capital to be a more significant use of cash for the full year than it was in 2014, and that is mainly due to strong syndication revenues at Warner's and severance payments related to the restructuring actions taken in 2014. Despite that, we anticipate 2015 will be another healthy year for free cash flow generation.","Now looking at our balance sheet, we ended the second quarter with $20.7 billion of net debt, up nearly $800 million from the end of 2015. That's largely due to our ongoing commitment to direct shareholder returns. In the first half of the year, we returned a total of $2.4 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases.","Since our last call, we took advantage of favorable market conditions to strengthen our balance sheet by issuing $2.9 billion of long-term debt at attractive rates. That included our first euro-denominated debt offering, which will act as a natural hedge to the euro-denominated assets on our balance sheet. We also retired $1.7 billion of debt as a result of the maturity of a tender offer we made for higher-priced debt, and we're in the process of redeeming the remaining $300 million of that series of debt.","Our net leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was approximately three times. However, excluding programming, restructuring, and severance charges from the second half of 2014, our leverage ratio would have been 2.64 times, slightly below our target leverage of 2.75 times. We continue to believe that leverage target provides us the flexibility to invest in our businesses, engage in strategic M&A, and provide direct returns to shareholders, while at the same time optimizing our cost of capital and providing strong access to the capital markets in a variety of macroeconomic scenarios.","With that, let's move on to the final slide, which looks at our outlook for 2015. We had a great first half of the year, and we're very pleased with the progress we're making across our businesses. That progress is evident in our results to date and our 2015 outlook for adjusted EPS of $4.60 to $4.70, which we have reaffirmed this morning. As we've discussed with you previously, that includes a foreign exchange headwind of approximately $0.40 based on current rates. Excluding that FX headwind, our outlook would imply over 20% growth off last year's base of $4.15. That outlook also includes ongoing investments at our network businesses in areas such as programming, marketing, and technology to strengthen our position within the rapidly changing ecosystem, and those investments will be heavily weighted toward the back half of this year.","At Turner, we'll begin ramping up our content investments, resulting in significantly higher programming costs and associated marketing expenses starting in the fourth quarter. Meanwhile, at HBO, we intend to continue investing in customer acquisition and technology for HBO NOW as we expand distribution and position the product for long-term success.","At Warner's, we have challenging theatrical comparisons in the second half of the year. Still, we anticipate healthy growth in the third quarter due to the syndication of Two Broke Girls and Person of Interest as well as the continued benefit from our strong games slate.","Taking the timing of our investment spending into account, we expect our growth in adjusted EPS will slow materially in the back half of the year. Even so, we are on track for another year of very attractive growth in adjusted EPS. And we believe the investments we're making in high-quality content and the development of new business models will position us for accelerating growth in the future.","With that, I'll turn it over to Mike to start the Q&A.","Michael Kopelman - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, Howard. Amanda, can you please open it up to Q&A? I'd like to remind everybody to please limit yourself to one or two questions so we can get to more people. Amanda?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Michael Nathanson from MoffettNathanson. Your line is open, please go ahead.","Michael B. Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC","Thank you. I have two, one for Richard and one for Howard. Richard, let me ask you about international. Over the past few months, as Netflix has rolled out into international markets, there was a groundswell of opinion that thinks they can reach over 100 million subscribers in five years' time. Are those projections close to being right? And I'm going to ask you later to comment on those projections. What does HBO need to do to benefit from the international opportunity, and when can you roll out HBO NOW overseas to actually take advantage of what could be a gigantic market?","Richard L. Plepler - Chief Executive Officer, Home Box Office, Inc.","We like our international strategy a lot, Michael. As you know, we have three tiers to it, our operating networks in 60 countries, our licensing deals in over 150 markets, and our home of HBO deals. And we've seen \u2013 as the value of content increases, we've seen our profits increase. Nordics has been a very interesting case study for us, though, because it shows the power of a multilateral approach. We've grown OTT subs in Nordic and we've grown our linear business. So we look at that and we will be making announcements in the near future about new OTT businesses. But we're going to take it on a case-by-case basis. We're going to follow the money, and we're going to focus on profits, as we always have done.","Michael B. Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC","Okay, let me ask one for Howard. As you've known, two of your peers have reduced their public guidance for a variety of reasons, including foreign exchange, advertising, subscriber growth. Do you still feel comfortable about the guidance you gave on EPS in 2016 and 2018? You gave it back in October, but I wonder. Have things changed enough for you to update the guidance?","Howard M. Averill - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","You know what, Michael, I appreciate the question, and we are aware of some of the trends that you just talked about. But unlike our annual outlook, we don't change our update on long-term targets from quarter to quarter. We're very pleased about how we're operating across all of our businesses, and you can see that from the strong results we generated in the first half of this year. And as we typically do, we're going to provide greater specificity on our long-term outlook at year end.","Michael Kopelman - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, Michael. Amanda, can we have our next question, please?","Operator","Our next question is from Alexia Quadrani from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Alexia S. Quadrani - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi, thank you very much. My question is on really your outlook for a step up in affiliate revenue growth in 2016, now that you've completed or you're in the process of completing most of your renewals. I guess what assumptions do you have in there in terms of sub declines or just sub outlooks in general? And have you seen acceleration in declines, I guess, since you initially gave that guidance a little while ago?","John K. Martin - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Turner Broadcasting System, Inc.","Thanks, Alexia, it's John. So listen, again, I appreciate the question. I think if you go back to when we started to talk about domestic subscription revenue growth expectations, we've been remarkably on track. And I would say that we're still very, very much on track from our original expectations. So last year we grew domestic subscriber revenue high single digits. This year we expected that to moderate somewhat into mid-single digits, and I fully expect we'll be able to hit that. And then in 2016 and then again in 2017, we fully expect that to accelerate well into the teens.","And against that backdrop, we have seen some modest unit declines in the U.S., but I would say that that trend has been in existence and ongoing now for some time. We have not seen any acceleration in those declines. And those declines have not been overly material. And of course, that trend has really been in front of our inclusion in some of these more economically viable or skinny packages, which we think over time as they become a little bit more mature, might have the ability to stabilize the overall unit trends and possibly even return it to growth over time as we think the distributors' ability to offer more economically but very attractive bundles to that element of the demand is only a positive thing. And of course, we at Turner have the type of networks that we think will be overly represented in those type of bundles. So we think the trends have been in existence for some time. There has been no acceleration of any negative trends. And we're still really positive and optimistic about what the future holds.","Jeffrey L. Bewkes - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Alexia, this is Jeff. I just want to add. I think everything John said, and if you consider to the extent skinny bundles or smaller bundles become more prevalent and Turner will be in those, that's a good thing for HBO as well.","Alexia S. Quadrani - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, just a quick follow-up, if I may. Thank you for all the color you guys gave earlier in terms of your leverage targets and free cash flow. One of your peers this morning mentioned that the rating agencies are weighing on the media industry more heavily now and getting a bit more strict in terms of the targets. Have you experienced that, and does that change any of your priorities for use of cash?","Howard M. Averill - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Are you talking about leverage ratios, Alexia?","Alexia S. Quadrani - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yes, are the ratings agencies coming in a bit harder on you guys, maybe putting you guys under a bit more scrutiny?","Howard M. Averill - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","No, I think we've had a pretty consistent process working with the rating agencies over time, and we are in a good spot and feel confident about the leverage structure we have.","Alexia S. Quadrani - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you very much.","Michael Kopelman - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, Alexia. Amanda, can we have our next question, please?","Operator","Our next question comes from Omar Sheikh from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Omar F. Sheikh - Credit Suisse Securities (Europe) Ltd.","Good morning, everyone, a question for Richard, first of all, on HBO NOW. I hear what you say on the comments you made on the level of demand. I wondered if you might be able to just give us an idea of what kind of programming you're adding to the NOW product. And are you seeing any change in the MVPD base? Is it primarily the pro bono (34:37) universe you're taking subs from? Some color on that will be very helpful.","And then a question for Howard possibly on the Turner programming expense growth for this year. You've called out some of the investment that you'll be making and the phasing of that in quarters. But I wonder whether you could just update us on your full-year expectations for programming expense growth this year. Thanks.","Richard L. Plepler - Chief Executive Officer, Home Box Office, Inc.","Omar, hi, it's Richard. Thank you for the question. Look, it's obviously early days, but we are very excited by what we've seen with HBO NOW right out of the gate. We've just added, as you know, Amazon and Google to Apple. You'll see other products added in the near future. And everything we're seeing both from sampling and from subscriber satisfaction has exceeded our expectations.","With regard to any kind of cannibalization, I can tell you, as we predicted and as our research indicated, we've seen less than 1% of HBO subs leave the bundle to go get HBO NOW, which is exactly what we suspected was going to happen. So while it's very early, we feel very good about it, and we think HBO NOW will be very profitable in the coming quarters.","Howard M. Averill - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Omar, it's Howard. In terms of the programming expense, we do expect on a full-year basis to be up modestly for the year. But as I indicated in my prepared remarks, it's going to be heavily weighted to the fourth quarter. And I can let John provide any other insight on that.","John K. Martin - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Turner Broadcasting System, Inc.","Thanks. Listen, thanks for the question. We've been expecting for some time that on average in any given year, we expect to hold down programming cost growth to on average no more than high single digits. And so clearly in some years it will be higher; in some years it will be lower. This year in 2015, it will be a year, as Howard just said, with the expectation of growth only in the low single digits, that it will be lower than the average. In part, that's due to the loss of NASCAR and before some of the new sports deals kick in, in future years. So for example, programming costs in Q3 will probably be down again because of the absence of NASCAR.","In the fourth quarter, I think we're currently planning on doubling the number of original series episodes compared to a year ago. And they'll be a lot more heavily weighted to the scripted side versus non-scripted, where it was a year ago too, so the average cost per episode will be higher. But we're really excited about the programming cycle that we're going to be beginning to enter, which should be over a prolonged period. So we think that that investment is very smart, it's wise, and it's going to be and will remain very much in control.","Omar F. Sheikh - Credit Suisse Securities (Europe) Ltd.","Perfect, thanks very much.","Michael Kopelman - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, Omar. Amanda, can we have the next question, please?","Operator","Our next question is from Doug Mitchelson from UBS. Your line is open.","Douglas Mitchelson - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks so much, a couple topics for me as well. I think first, Richard and Jeff, I was just hoping you'd expound on what you've learned so far with the HBO NOW launch in the U.S. I don't know if there's any contrast with what you've seen so far in the U.S. versus your experience in the Nordics, which you highlighted has nice traction now with the conversion rate you're seeing from free app downloads to paid subs. And any clarity or quantification to your willingness to spend on incremental marketing and programming that you discussed in your formal remarks? That's the first topic.","Richard L. Plepler - Chief Executive Officer, Home Box Office, Inc.","Look, I think what's clear to us is we have to make clear to first the low-hanging fruit, which is the 10.7 million broadband-only subscribers, what HBO NOW is, how much value is in there, 3,000 hours of library, all of our movie output, and that is part of the marketing investment that we're going to make. The good news is that it's pretty clear once people see the value as we explain it to them of what's in the HBO NOW package and what kind of versatility it provides them, they are very, very responsive to it. So we need to make that investment going forward, that marketing investment going forward so we can drive profits in HBO NOW, and that's what we plan to do.","Douglas Mitchelson - UBS Securities LLC","Richard, I guess I'm trying to figure out whether that's a pretty efficient digital spend because you're talking app downloads, or whether you actually pursue traditional marketing highlighting your programming because then it helps both HBO and HBO NOW.","Richard L. Plepler - Chief Executive Officer, Home Box Office, Inc.","It's a little bit of both. The spend is going to be both digital and in traditional television. But quite obviously, when we're selling HBO NOW and all the brand components of it, it also has a certain resonance for the brand itself. And remember, not only do we see a huge opportunity in the 10.7 million broadband-only homes; that is the low-hanging fruit. But as we've said before, there are 70 million people in the ecosystem that don't subscribe to HBO. We want to go after that market as well with our partners. And that's why we were very excited last week to see Verizon Wireless sign up for HBO NOW. We think that's going to be followed by other distributors doing it. It's a huge opportunity for them to grow their businesses. And as I said earlier, less than 1% of the linear subscribers have left to go get HBO NOW. So we see this as additive for our partners in the traditional business, and we want to continue to drive that point because there's gold in the hills for them too.","Douglas Mitchelson - UBS Securities LLC","And, Richard, anything you want to offer for us on sub levels or conversion rate from free to paid?","Richard L. Plepler - Chief Executive Officer, Home Box Office, Inc.","A little too early to do that, I think, but stay tuned.","Douglas Mitchelson - UBS Securities LLC","All right, this will be quick. Howard or Jeff, just let me try another way because I think not reaffirming longer-term guidance can be perceived negatively. Can you talk about what trends you're seeing that are more positive or more negative versus what you were expecting last October, so perhaps investors can add up for themselves whether you're tracking ahead or behind the long-term guidance? I know John already indicated, if I heard him right, no material change in affiliate fee revenues. Are there any other puts or takes that you would highlight at this point?","Howard M. Averill - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Doug, there are a lot of things out there that we're seeing. There are some positive and some negative. You did hear us talk about the sub trends. We're very aware of the advertising profit. Look, we've made some pretty good progress on the initiatives that we talked about last year as well. So again, it comes back to the fact that we'll give an update when we get closer to year end, hopefully year end next year.","Jeffrey L. Bewkes - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Other positive trends, you've got very positive demand trends across the world for both content, sales, episode shows, movies, and for networks, and that's a huge positive trend. And you're seeing it in sub counts across the global environment. You're seeing it in increased buying pressure, pricing, et cetera for content, whether it's in first-run, whether it's in syndication, or whether it's in SVOD. In fact, all those things support each other. And so what you see, everybody talks a lot about, for example, SVOD or Netflix internationally. That's fine, that's good, but what that does is it leads to increased demand from other SVOD services. It leads to increased demand from other incumbent networks all over the world, and those are pretty positive.","I think we mentioned a number of things in the prepared remarks on overcoming FX. And I think the way you opened your question is not something we totally agree with. The timing is such we're not going to make specific statements every quarter on very long-term guidance. Things are going very well for us. If you look at 2015, this year, you had headwinds in foreign exchange of about $0.40, and yet here we are pulling in an earnings growth that essentially takes that into account. I think we all expect, just picking that, FX, as an ongoing situation for next year, but if you look at what we've done this year, that indicates actually from an operating point of view we're ahead of the plan that we gave you. So I'm not going to go farther because we have decisions to make about what we do year by year.","Douglas Mitchelson - UBS Securities LLC","Richard, Howard, Jeff, thanks so much.","Michael Kopelman - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, Doug. Amanda, next question, please.","Operator","Our next question is from Michael Morris from Guggenheim Partners. Your line is open.","Michael C. Morris - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Thank you. Good morning, guys, two questions. One, you significantly increased I think the amount of content you made available on a stacked in-season basis to Comcast. Can you talk about why you did that based on what you saw in the past? What are the trends that you're seeing, and what's your expectation for how you can capture incremental economics from making that available, whether it's on the affiliate side, the ad side, or both?","And then second, with respect to the NBA, this season I think the NBA is going to make out-of-market games available \u00e0 la carte. And it's not on television, it's via broadband. But still, it is a step forward in people getting games. How do you think about that product relative to the amount that you're investing in the national NBA contract? Thanks.","Jeffrey L. Bewkes - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","John will do the NBA, but can you go back? Are you asking about stacking rights and the extent of stacking rights from either a network like Turner or from Warner Bros.? What was your question?","Michael C. Morris - Guggenheim Securities LLC","So I think what I understand is that Turner has made in-season stacked rights more broadly available to Comcast in the coming year. And there's a debate on whether that can cannibalize audience in the C3 window and therefore hurt your advertising, whether you can capture more advertising, and then of course, whether or not you can capture and share in the value that the consumer gets through their payment to Comcast or other distributors. We can speculate on that, but I'd rather hear from you why you're doing it and what you see.","John K. Martin - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Turner Broadcasting System, Inc.","Thanks for the question, Mike. I'll speak for Turner. Maybe Kevin can comment from the Warner's side. We at Turner have now for some time been very, very much in favor of granting in-season stacking rights to distributors and affiliates for a number of reasons. The first is we want to make sure that, with respect to the original programming that we have on the network, that we're encouraging people who want to view these shows on a delayed basis, that they can come in, in the middle of the season and catch up. And we think it increases the probability of having successful shows and will drive overall viewership not only for the shows that are stacked, but also the shows later on in the season that are being viewed live. So we think that that can help the advertising business for the live linear feed.","And we also think Comcast, for example, probably the furthest along in the development of dynamic ad insertion, we think dynamic ad insertion is a potential huge opportunity for us as network owners and for the industry at large, as we think that delayed viewing as a currency will grow increasingly important over time. So we intend to offer stacking rights on all the shows that we own and get rights for, and we think it's just a really, really smart thing to do.","Kevin Tsujihara - Chief Executive Officer, Warner Bros. Entertainment, Inc.","I think you can make \u2013 this is Kevin. I think you can make the argument, as John just did, that it helps build the audience, that it actually increases viewing in seasons two, three, four, and five. And I think from our perspective, there's no diminution in the back-end value of programs that have stacking rights. And therefore, between Warner Bros. and Turner, we're licensing those rights over to Turner on every show we do with them.","With regard to the NBA, this isn't anything new. This is something that they announced when we announced the new deal, which we at Turner were very much in favor of with respect to the NBA having the rights to do this. We love the partnership that we have with the NBA. We love the long-term visibility and sustainability that we have with respect to the rights. But I think it's really, really important to understand that the games that will appear on our networks are exclusive to our networks. So you will not be seeing those games appear anywhere else other than on TNT. And of course, we're also in the business with the NBA on our digital businesses, and we're a profit participant in that as well.","So I think what you're referring to is a reasonably limited out-of-market, and I think it might even be potentially just a mobile product. So we think for certain real basketball enthusiasts, that will be particularly interesting, but I don't necessarily believe it's going to be a mainstream product.","Michael C. Morris - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Great, thanks, guys.","Michael Kopelman - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, Michael. Amanda, can we have our next question, please?","Operator","Our next question is from David Bank from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","David Bank - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey, thanks very much for taking my question. I guess I wanted to follow up on your comments earlier on the Turner Data Cloud, and I guess probably more specifically for John, what he and David [Levy] are doing in terms of their interest for ad tech at the Turner platform. What kind of investments are you making? How are you thinking about it, dynamic ad insertion as well as non-linear platforms? How do you see ad tech as a long-term value driver, and how are you approaching it? Thank you.","John K. Martin - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Turner Broadcasting System, Inc.","Thanks, David. Listen, this is another area where we see huge opportunity going forward. And I have to say this is an area \u2013 we're talking a lot about the impact that technology is having on consumption. But I think technology is moving so quickly and it's going to have a dramatically positive impact on the efficacy of advertising on TV.","So you're right in the sense that we are making investments to strengthen our overall technology platform. And you saw us introduce a number of advanced advertising products at this year's upfront a few months ago, whether it's Targeting Now, which allows an advertiser to optimize across TNT and TBS, or a product called Audience Now, which allows them to optimize across all Turner networks with audience guarantees. So we're highly confident we're going to be able to more efficiently manage and monetize all of our inventory across all of Turner. And it's one of the reasons why we wanted to present all of Turner in one meeting at the upfront because of the strength and the breadth of our brands.","We have a lot to learn as we move forward. We're working with some of our biggest partners, and we're roughly using 20% of our inventory for targeting, but that's going to dramatically ramp in the future. We're investing in technology. We're investing in data. We've come a long way over the last year. And I think a lot of the capabilities that so-called digital companies have had an advantage of over TV are going to be eliminated, as TV can not only provide targeting and increased reach and relevance, but also in a very, very immersive experience with long-form video that's professionally produced. So I think we're in the very, very early stages of seeing TV make a dramatic comeback on the attractiveness of advertising.","David Bank - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Have you seen \u2013 as you took Targeting Now into the marketplace at the upfront, is there a way to quantify the upside on CPMs that you're seeing from beginning to monetize this stuff?","John K. Martin - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Turner Broadcasting System, Inc.","It's an easy question, difficult to answer because it depends flight by flight. But I think even in the upfront itself, we've announced for those advertisers that we've run campaigns for that we've seen double-digit lifts in sales. And that at the end of the day is what's really important, is advertisers selling product.","David Bank - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks very much.","Michael Kopelman - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, David. Amanda, could we have our next question, please?","Operator","Our next question is from Ben Swinburne from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you, good morning. I have two questions. Kevin, can you talk about the age-old debate about Warner's position selling to the broadcasters? I think this year you guys actually saw some of your big customers own more of their own shows. And I think there's some discussion in the market whether that's a structural change in the trajectory. Warner has been really well positioned as an independent. When you look at it, do you think the world is changing, more vertical integration, or is this just a blip in the trend line? And then I have a follow-up for Richard.","Kevin Tsujihara - Chief Executive Officer, Warner Bros. Entertainment, Inc.","I think that we've seen this go up and down since the change in the Fin-Syn [Financial Interest and Syndication] rules over time. This is not a new concept with the networks wanting to own more and more of their programming. But I think the key statistic that I would ask you to look at is, for us, is returning shows. And this year we have more returning shows in 20 than in the history of Warner Bros. So while we may not have sold as many shows into the marketplace as we would have typically have done, we have more shows coming back than ever.","The pressure is always going to be on us to maintain our level of creative excellence. But as we look at last year, when we had two of the most successful shows in The Flash and Gotham, we feel really good about our position in the marketplace, our relationships with the key writer-producers. That maintains our ability to be able to sell to every network. We're very proud of the fact that we have at least two shows on every single network. And as I said, we have more shows coming back than ever.","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","That makes sense. And then for Richard, and I don't know, Jeff, if you want to answer as well, when you scenario plan out HBO over the long term, do you ever think about what a significant increase in content investment would do globally to the business? In other words, I think you spend about $2 billion a year. Is there a business model where that number doubles and you go big, global, more direct to consumer? Is there enough content out there to make it worth that kind of investment? I realize you have guidance, so you've got to work through all those pieces. But I'm just wondering, given how rapidly the world is changing, do you ever think about what HBO could do if there's an opportunity to just get much more aggressive on the content side to build the long-term value of the business? I'd be curious if you have any comments there.","Richard L. Plepler - Chief Executive Officer, Home Box Office, Inc.","We're always thinking about content opportunities ,and it's one of the reasons internationally why we've invested a lot more in content, both in Latin America and Asia and with our partners. And remember, some of our content for our international business, like in Nordic, is joined with other people's content that helps enhance the brand.","As far as our content spend here, I like our mix a lot. I think across genres, you just saw 126 Emmy nominations, which one of the most important things about that is that it crossed different genres, documentaries, mini-series, series half-hours, hours. So I like our spend. We're constantly looking at what opportunities there are. As I've said over and over again, and I think it's true, it's not that more is better, only better is better. And so we want to make sure that we're making the investment that's going to elevate the brand and that's going to continue to make an HBO subscription a must-have for people, so that's how we think at it.","Jeffrey L. Bewkes - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Let me add a little because I join Richard in HBO from the past. I don't think there's a shortage of content on HBO right now. If you look at the amount of original series, original programming on HBO, there's more than in any other SVOD service in the world by a wide margin. That's before you say that there's also a first-run movie supply on HBO. That's a tremendous part. Richard, you've said it's how much, what percent?","Richard L. Plepler - Chief Executive Officer, Home Box Office, Inc.","It's over 70% of it.","Jeffrey L. Bewkes - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So you've got an SVOD service that's digital, global, it's called HBO, it's got the most original programming. It's the only one with current movies, so it's got a big content advantage over most of the other alternatives.","The next thing, if you start looking at sub growth at HBO, you have the fact that some of the distributors have twice the penetration of other distributors. That has nothing to do with content. That has to do with marketing, selling, packaging, making things available to consumers both here and around the world in a way that's affordable to them, that has a good VOD interface for them. That is equally true of basic cable, which has a tremendous content advantage. If you look at the original shows or the hit acquired shows on channels like TBS, TNT, FX, USA, AMC, it's a fantastic array of programming, and all it needs is to be on-demand.","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Michael Kopelman - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks. Amanda, I think we have time for one last question.","Operator","Yes, sir. Our final question comes from the line of Marci Ryvicker from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Marci L. Ryvicker - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","I actually have a really easy one for you. You mentioned in your opening remarks that HBO India is being transferred to Turner. Is there a reason for that?","Richard L. Plepler - Chief Executive Officer, Home Box Office, Inc.","That's not true. It's the management of it. It's just scale. It's just scale.","Jeffrey L. Bewkes - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","It's just we're co-marketing it and co-distributing --","Richard L. Plepler - Chief Executive Officer, Home Box Office, Inc.","It's to be more efficient with our resources and management, and its scale in the marketplace.","Jeffrey L. Bewkes - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Exactly.","Marci L. Ryvicker - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","And so what's the financial impact between the two segments?","Richard L. Plepler - Chief Executive Officer, Home Box Office, Inc.","I don't know off the top of my head. I don't think it's over -- Howard, do you know?","Howard M. Averill - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","It's low tens of millions of dollars over the course of the year against HBO.","Marci L.

My name is Ellen, and I will be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to your host for today, Mr. Doug Shapiro, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations for Time Warner. Please proceed.","Douglas Shapiro","Thanks, and good morning. This morning, we issued 2 press releases, one detailing our results for the fourth quarter and full year and the other providing our 2013 full year business outlook.","Before we begin, there are 2 items I need to cover. First, we refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Schedules setting out reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our earnings release and trending schedules. These reconciliations are available on our website at timewarner.com\/investors. Reconciliations of our expected future financial performance are also included in the business outlook release that's available on our site.","And second, today's announcement includes certain forward-looking statements, which are based on management's current expectations. Actual results may vary materially from those expressed or implied by these statements due to various factors. These factors are discussed in detail in Time Warner's SEC filings, including its most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. Time Warner is under no obligation, in fact, expressly disclaims any obligation to update or alter its forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.","Thank you. And now, I'll turn it over to Jeff.","Jeffrey L. Bewkes","Thanks, Doug, and thanks for listening in today. 2012 was another successful year for us, and we're at an even stronger position today than we were a year ago. Adjusted operating income was up 4%, and adjusted earnings per share climbed 13%. Looking back over the last 4 years, adjusted OI has grown at 10% per year, and adjusted EPS has grown by more than 20% per year, or over 130% cumulatively.","Our networks, which is the core of the company, grew adjusted operating income in the double digits in 2012 and 12% annually over that same 4-year period.  At the same time, in 2012, we continue to build a foundation for strong ongoing growth in 2013 and beyond. And as you saw this morning, we once again expect to deliver low double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth this year.","We also continue to return capital to our shareholders, last year, paying $1 billion in dividends and purchasing more than $3 billion of our stock. That's more than 8% of our outstanding shares. Since we restarted our share repurchase program in 2009, we've bought back more than 1\/4 of our equity base.","Reflecting our continued commitment to return capital, this morning we announced that our board has approved a new $4 billion repurchase authorization and an 11% increase in our dividend per share. That's the fourth consecutive year of double-digit dividend increases.","Our performance in 2012 and our expectation of continued strong growth are the products of the strategic priorities that we've put in place several years ago and which we continue to pursue today. They may not sound new to you, but one of the hallmarks of a sound strategy is that it doesn't change too often.","First and foremost, we're investing aggressively in our content. Second, we're pushing to develop the next generation of digital business models in ways that enhance value to consumers and to the company. Third, we're seeking to replicate our domestic success in the most attractive international territories. And fourth, overlaying everything we do as a continuing effort to improve our operating and capital efficiency.","I'd like to spend a few minutes talking about how we executed against these objectives in 2012 and how we aim to do it again in 2013. And I'll start with our first priority, and that's our content.","At Turner, in 2012, we continued our path of refreshing essentially the entire prime time lineup on TNT and TBS over a multiple-year period. Last year, we had more original programming on our entertainment networks than ever, including new originals like Dallas and Perception on TNT and Men at Work on TBS. We also bolstered our lineup of new acquired shows, adding The Mentalist and Castle on TNT and securing 2 Broke Girls for TBS in 2015.","And we extended our relationship with Major League Baseball, securing rights to regular season games and postseason games well into the next decade. So with the NCAA, NBA, NASCAR and baseball, we have the strongest lineup of national sports rights of any cable network other than ESPN's group.","For the most part, these efforts are paying off. In 2012, TBS was the #1 ad-supported cable network in prime for adults 18 to 34, and it was #3 for adults 18 to 49. At TNT, while we have more work to do, ratings improved over the course of the year, and it ended 2012 as the #4 cable network in prime among adults 18 to 49. TNT also claimed 5 of the top 10 cable originals of the year: The Closer, Rizzoli & Isles, Major Crimes, Perception and Dallas. And TNT had the top 3 new originals of the year on cable.","We delivered continued solid performance across our more targeted networks. For the year, Adult Swim was again the #1 cable network in total day for young adults; Cartoon ranked #1 in total day for boys 6 to 11 and boys 9 to 11; and truTV was close to a top 10 network in prime among men 18 to 49.","CNN finished the year on a high note, thanks to its election coverage. And while its overall ratings performance in 2012 fell short of our expectations, I'm optimistic that with the new leadership we've announced, CNN will once again fulfill the promise of its iconic brands.","As we've discussed with you before, over the next several years, we'll be increasingly focused on monetizing these investments in content as we enter our next round of affiliate renewals. We also told you that we expect Turner's domestic subscription revenue to grow at a double-digit compound annual growth rate between 2013 and 2016. And as we get closer to starting the renewal process, we're as confident in that forecast as ever.","In addition to monetizing this content through traditional revenue streams, we also started to license Turner content to SVOD providers. In the last few months, Turner and Warner Bros. together announced deals with both Amazon and Netflix, licensing serialized shows such as Dallas and Falling Skies, along with animated series from both Cartoon Network and Adult Swim. This emerging back end for cable originals is a very promising sign since it should result in production values for cable originals getting even better over time.","In 2013, we'll do even more of the same. That includes airing originals on TNT and TBS year round and increasing the number of original episodes on those 2 networks by more than 40%. We'll do that within the cost growth envelope that we've discussed with you before.","At HBO, our content lineup is the best it's ever been, and it just keeps getting better. In 2012, we added several popular and critically acclaimed new shows like the Newsroom, Girls and Veep to a schedule that already included blockbuster series True Blood, Game of Thrones and Boardwalk Empire. Underscoring the amount of quality programming on that network last year, HBO won more Emmys than any other network for the 11th year in a row. It also just received more Golden Globes than any other network, too.","As usual, last year, HBO also offered by far the largest slate of Hollywood blockbusters of any premium network, roughly 1\/2 of the top 25 films in the pay window. In recent months, we've extended our output deals with both Fox and Universal, helping solidify HBO's leading position on theatrical films well into the next decade.","The strength of this programming on HBO and Cinemax and the success of HBO GO and MAX GO helped generate the best subscriber gains in a decade. Both brands are an improvement at virtually all of our major affiliates. Together, they added 1.9 million subscribers domestically for the year.","At Warner Bros., our investments in great storytelling also paid off last year, enabling us to post the second-highest annual profits ever, even without a Harry Potter release. Our TV studio was again the leading producer of broadcast TV programming in the 2012-2013 season. With hits like The Big Bang Theory, The Voice, Revolution, Two and a Half Men, 2 Broke Girls, The Following, Mike & Molly and Person of Interest, Warner's now accounts for 1\/3 of the top shows on broadcast TV with adults 18 to 49, including 3 of the top 4 comedies on television.","Our game plan in 2013 is the same, to foster the best possible environment for the best writers and producers in Hollywood. And we expect another very good year. As you know, we're seeing great secular dynamics in TV production right now with increasing demand from all our buyers, broadcast, cable originals, off-mix indication, international and subscription VOD.","For instance, besides the deals that Warner Bros. and Turner struck with Amazon and Netflix, which I mentioned earlier, in recent months, Warner's also cut a comprehensive slate deal with Netflix for new serialized shows in the U.S., as well as a series of agreements internationally, including Canada, Latin America, the U.K. and Ireland and the Nordic region. These deals boost our confidence that we'll be seeing strong SVOD revenues again in 2013 and beyond.","We also had a great year at the film studio, led by The Dark Knight Rises, which grossed $1.1 billion at the global box office, making it the highest grossing film in the franchise. We also have the first part of The Hobbit trilogy, which is on track to reach $1 billion globally; Magic Mike; and the multiple award-winning film Argo.","Driven by countries like Brazil, Russia and China, we're increasingly seeing international box office totals outstripping domestic box by more than 2:1 for our biggest hits. It's hard to top that, but our 2013 theatrical slate looks even better. It includes Man of Steel, The Hangover 3, Great Gatsby, Pacific Rim, the sequel to 300 and, of course, the second film in The Hobbit series. In fact, that was all content.","So turning now to our second main priority. In 2012, we continue to lead the digital transition across our businesses. At our networks, Turner expanded its TV Everywhere offerings, adding new platforms and new apps. Turner's TVE services are now available to over 80 million households, and we offer over 1,000 hours of on-demand content and our first live streaming app for CNN.","Adoption of TV Everywhere clearly has not progressed at the consumer level as fast as we would have liked. However, with growing availability of authenticated content for many of our cable programming peers slated for 2013 to finally joining us, we expect much greater consumer awareness and usage starting this year.","At HBO, HBO GO and MAX GO are now available to essentially our entire domestic subscriber base, and they're available across a wide variety of devices and platforms, including iOS, Android, Kindle and Xbox. As we've discussed with you before, we've seen very healthy usage, and consumer satisfaction is through the roof. Gross subs said they are more loyal to HBO and they're watching more HBO, and monthly usage per user climbed 80% between the end of 2011 and 2012.","We've also just launched a program to bundle in HBO GO on college campuses to help us attract the next generation of HBO subscribers. We're rolling out GO as an authenticated product where we have linear networks internationally, too. It's now available in 10 countries in Central and Northern Europe and 8 countries in Latin America. This year, we'll start to launch in Asia.","At Warner's, as you know, we're spearheading a number of initiatives to improve the consumer proposition of buying and owning digital movies. UltraViolet has only been in the market for a short time, but it's gaining momentum. UV is now supported by almost every major studio. Over 8,500 titles are available in the UV format, and it has more than 9 million registered users.","In 2013, we expect to see a lot more retailers coming on board. Flixster and the other providers are also launching in-home disc-to-digital services that allow consumers to unlock the digital rights to their physical DVDs right from their home computers. With UV already available in the U.S., Canada and the U.K., this year, we also plan to roll it out in Australia, France, Germany, Ireland and New Zealand.","Time Inc. significantly expanded its digital efforts in 2012, too. That included launching","[Audio Gap]","iOS, Android and Kindle platforms, and we've seen some encouraging signs so far. For instance, our tablet subscribers are younger, they have higher incomes, and over 70% of them have never subscribed to those titles before.","A third priority I mentioned earlier is expanding our presence internationally in key territories, particularly our network businesses. Turner is focused on increasing its scale in each of its targeted territories, including investing more in local production and securing distribution from new networks in countries where we already have a presence. We're also looking to significantly streamline our operations in areas where we don't have scale like Western Europe.","HBO is following the same playbook internationally that succeeded so well domestically, increasing local production and rolling out product enhancements like HD, On Demand and now, HBO GO. It's working. HBO and Cinemax grew to 73 million subscribers internationally. That's up more than 35% from the end of 2011. Adding in our domestic cap, HBO now has 114 million subs globally. That's far more than any competitor. And HBO is also expanding into new territories. Last year, we launched new HBO premium services in the Netherlands and the Nordic region, and we announced plans for the first premium TV service in India.","The fourth and final objective I mentioned earlier is one that informs everything else we do, and that is continual striving to improve our operating and capital efficiency. And reflecting that focus in 2012, total operating expenses actually declined 2% even as we invested more in content. We may not be able to replicate that every year, but closely managing our expense growth has become a way of life at Time Warner. As one example, we're making progress on our enterprise services initiative that will ultimately improve the efficiency of certain IT, real estate and HR functions. In 2013, that will require some additional investment, but we expect to ultimately save several hundred million dollars annually on a run-rate basis. And at the same time, we know that active balance sheet management is a critical component of equity returns. Over the last 4 years, we've generated $11 billion in free cash flow, and we've returned $15 billion in dividends and share repurchases, including more than $4 billion last year. As you saw with the dividend increase and a new repurchase authorization that we announced today, returning substantial capital to our shareholders remains a cornerstone of our capital plan.","So we accomplished a lot in 2012. I think we're exiting the year stronger than we ended it. And with another year of double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth under our belt, I think it's fair to say that our approach is working. Our track record shows that a combination of good organic growth, tight cost controls and active balance sheet management can consistently deliver attractive financial performance and strong equity returns.","With that, I'll turn it over to John. Thanks for listening.","John K. Martin","Thanks, Jeff, and good morning. I'll begin by referring to the first slide, which is now available on our website. Starting with the consolidated highlights of the first slide, you'll see that the fourth quarter was a terrific way to end what was another really strong year. The fourth quarter was our strongest quarter of the year in terms of growth, coming in even a little better than we anticipated, with adjusted operating income up 16% and adjusted EPS up almost 25%. And that helped us post another year of double-digit adjusted EPS growth, up 13%.","As Jeff mentioned, the initiatives we put in place several years ago have allowed us to achieve consistently strong results. In fact, 2012 was our fourth straight year of double-digit adjusted EPS growth, and that was despite a slight dip in revenue which resulted from very difficult comparisons at the Film and TV Entertainment group, as well as a very challenging environment in Publishing.","We were able to accomplish that due to a continued positive mix shift toward higher margin networks and TV production businesses, a continuing big focus on costs across the company and our ongoing share repurchase program.","We reduced operating expenses by low-single digits in 2012, enabling us to push up margins by over 100 basis points for the full year. That included holding network costs almost flat even as we made significant investments in original programming at both Turner and HBO. As you know, that's been a consistent theme at the company now for a long time. On a consolidated basis, we've kept our expenses essentially flat over the past 4 years, increasing margins by more than 500 basis points over that period.","For the full year 2012, we also deployed about $1 billion in dividends and over $3 billion in share repurchases. And as evidenced by the dividend increase and new repurchase authorization we announced this morning, we remain committed to delivering attractive shareholder returns. So we're very pleased with how the year ended, and we feel great about how we're positioned going into 2013 and beyond.","Now let me turn to the segment highlights, beginning at the networks, where both HBO and Turner grew adjusted operating income double digits for both the quarter and the full year. That resulted in another record year of profits for this segment.","Subscription revenues were up a very healthy 7% in the quarter and 6% for the year, and that's despite a modest negative impact from foreign currency. That growth reflects both higher domestic rates and continued international growth. And as Jeff mentioned, HBO is experiencing the strongest domestic subscriber trends it's seen in years. That includes improved performance across most of our major distributors, and we've seen particular strength from satellite and telco, which continue to take share from the cable operators. Keep in mind that due to the nature of our affiliate contracts, the majority of these subscriber additions are non revenue-generating, still with sub growth provided some boost in 2012 and gives us a good start heading into the year.","So we feel good about the trajectory of subscription revenues here, and that's before we see the expected benefits from our upcoming domestic renewal cycle at Turner, which will begin to kick in, in 2014.","Moving over to advertising, revenues were up 3% in the quarter, with domestic advertising revenue up 7%. And that was helped by additional NBA games compared to the year-ago quarter, which was impacted by the NBA work stoppage. We also had a very good quarter at CNN, which benefited from higher ratings around the U.S. presidential election. International advertising revenues declined just under 10% in the quarter. Growth was negatively impacted by the shutdown of Imagine and TNT Turkey, as well as unfavorable foreign exchange movements.","Looking through these items, international ad revenue would have been about flat in the quarter, and that's clearly below what our longer term expectations are here, and that's due to the tough economic conditions that currently exist in Europe, as well as some current rating softness in Latin America.","Looking ahead to the first quarter of 2013, we anticipate total reported advertising revenues to be about flat. And that's a little slower than the fourth quarter, and that's due to a few reasons. First, we're not going to benefit from additional NBA games; or second, the 2012 U.S. presidential election as we did in the fourth quarter; and third, we'll have fewer NCAA games versus the year-ago period, and that's due to timing of the tournament.","However, we expect the pace of advertising growth to pick up starting in the second quarter as we lap the transfer of management of SI.com and Golf.com to Time Inc. and the international network shutdowns that I previously mentioned. Our year-over-year comparisons also ease somewhat as the year progresses. So for the full year 2013, we still anticipate solid growth in networks advertising.","Adjusted operating income at the networks group was up a very strong 17% in the fourth quarter and 10% for the full year, with margins expanding almost 200 basis points for the year. In addition to solid revenue growth, that reflects continued tight cost controls, which was evident throughout the year. For 2012, programming expenses were up just 2%, and overall expenses were up only 1%. And that's despite a high-single-digit increase in original entertainment and sports programming.","Expenses and margins benefited from international network shutdowns. But even without those, 2012's results were the continuation of a multi-year trend in margin expansion. Networks margins are up over 600 basis points since 2008 and over 1,000 basis points over the past decade. And we expect those trends to continue over the next several years.","At our international networks businesses, including HBO's unconsolidated ventures, profits were relatively flat in 2012 at around $650 million. And that was largely due to the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates; the macroeconomic conditions in some territories, especially Europe; and HBO's expansion into new regions. But we're confident in the longer-term growth trajectory here, and we continue to expect these businesses to reach about $1 billion in adjusted operating income in the next few years.","For 2013, we expect to have another great year at the networks segment. As I just mentioned, we feel good about subscription and advertising revenue trends. And on the cost side, we remain very focused on investing in programming while limiting growth in non-revenue-generating expenses. And internationally, we anticipate a return to very strong profit growth this year as a result of improving organic revenue trends, a reduced drag from FX and recently announced cost savings initiatives in Europe.","So putting that all together, we expect another year of margin expansion, an attractive growth in adjusted operating income at this segment.","Let me turn now over to Film and TV, where Warner Bros. posted its highest quarterly adjusted operating income ever in the fourth quarter of 2012. And from what we can tell, it's actually the highest quarterly profit any studio has ever generated in any particular quarter. And for the year, Warner Bros. had its second-highest profits ever.","For the quarter and the year, margins benefited from both a mixed shift towards higher margin TV revenue and a decline in P&A spending due to fewer theatrical releases. To put the year in context, if you set aside 2011 for a moment, adjusted operating income was more than 10% higher than in any other year in its history. And of course, we did that without a Harry Potter theatrical or Harry Potter home video release. Warner's ability to maintain such a high level of profitability is a testament to the diversity of revenue streams here and in particular, to the strong performance of the TV production business.","In 2012, Warner Bros. TV accounted for approximately 60% of Warner Bros.' profits and it grew both revenues and profits year-over-year despite an extremely challenging comparison against the syndication of The Big Bang Theory and Friends in 2011. It was able to overcome those comparisons partially due to growth in demand from SVOD services and international syndication. For the year, we've recognized around $350 million in SVOD revenues, the majority of which came from our television product.","In our theatrical business, we had a very good year and a very successful fourth quarter despite difficult comparisons. The first film in The Hobbit trilogy has generated around $950 million at the global box office and is on track to join The Dark Knight Rises as our second 2012 release to pass $1 billion in global box office. The strong box office performances of The Hobbit and the critically acclaimed film Argo helped keep our theatrical revenues almost flat in the fourth quarter, and that's despite a decline in the number of theatrical releases.","Looking ahead to 2013, we are very optimistic about the film slate, which, as Jeff mentioned, includes the second film in the Hobbit trilogy, Man of Steel and Hangover 3, to name just a few.","Additionally, we have another strong year at our TV studio, where we continue to see robust demand across major buyers, including domestic and international SVOD services. In addition to some recent SVOD deals, we remain in active discussions with all major SVOD services about additional content packages. The strong demand for both our TV and theatrical product is showing up in our backlog, which reached a record $6 billion at the end of 2012, and that's up 60% over the past 5 years. Backlog, as a reminder, is cash licensing revenue for television and theatrical product that will be recognized in the future. So that gives us a lot of confidence about the long-term growth prospects in this business.","We're also encouraged by recent signs of stabilization in home entertainment, with total consumer spending for the industry actually flat in 2012. That's happening because digital is now big enough and growing fast enough to make up for physical declines. In fact, Warner's digital home video revenue, including SVOD, VOD and EST, approached $1 billion in 2012, and we expect it to grow close to 20% in 2013.","And we also have a strong games release this year, which will include the next release in the Batman Arkham franchise. So all in all, we expect Warners to post another very strong year in 2013. And with a little luck, the year should be as good or maybe even a little bit better than 2012.","Let's move on to Publishing, where very challenging industry conditions weighed on Time Inc.'s results for both the quarter and the year. Nevertheless, Time Inc. continued to take advertising shares during 2012, and fourth quarter trends showed some signs of improvement across both advertising and subscription revenues.","Advertising revenues declined 4% in the quarter. And while clearly not where we want that to be, that marked the smallest advertising decline of the year.","Subscription revenues were flat in the quarter, an improvement over the last couple of quarters, and that included both better underlying trends, as well as the impact of having an additional week in the calendar. Newsstand sales remained somewhat soft in the fourth quarter, but People Magazine took significant share in its category.","It's worth pointing out that other revenues were negatively impacted by the absence of revenues from QSP, which was sold in the first quarter of 2012. The absence of QSP was also the principal driver of the drop in adjusted operating income at Time Inc. during the quarter. While QSP was roughly breakeven for full year 2011, it was a highly seasonal business, only generating profits in the fourth quarter. So excluding any impact of its sale, adjusted operating income would have effectively been flat at Time Inc. in the quarter.","As we look ahead to the first quarter of 2013, advertising newsstand sales remains somewhat soft, but we continue to see some improvement in underlying trends relative to recent quarters. In light of the ongoing industry challenges, Time Inc. has started the process of reducing its global workforce by approximately 6%. This restructuring will lower costs in both our domestic and international operations by centralizing certain functions, increasing collaboration across titles and streamlining research and marketing. These actions will result in a restructuring charge of around $60 million, which we plan to take in the first quarter.","Turning to the next slide, let me provide some context for our 2013 outlook. As I noted before, we were able to generate really nice growth in adjusted operating income and strong growth in adjusted EPS in 2012 even without growing revenue. That reflects our continued ability to keep tight control over costs and also highlights the positive impact of our ongoing share repurchase program.","As we look at 2013, we see continued strong profit growth at Networks, another strong year at Film and TV Entertainment and some stabilization in Publishing declines. So we expect faster growth in adjusted operating income in 2013 versus 2012.","At the same time, the share count impact will be less favorable than it was in 2012, and that's because our aggressive pace of share repurchases in 2011 benefited the 2012 share count and because the rise in our stock since the summer pushed all employee stock options into the money. All of that's reflected in our outlook for low double-digit growth and adjusted EPS. Keep in mind that our outlook includes the roughly $60 million restructuring that I just mentioned at Publishing. In addition, this year, we expect to incur about an incremental $25 million of spending year-over-year on our enterprise efficiency initiatives. It's also likely that we're going to begin to account for our nearly 50% stake at CME as an equity investment later this year, upon the expiration of our voting agreement.  Assuming the same level of losses as we recognized last year, that would result in us recognizing about a $30 million amount of additional equity losses in 2013.","Looking beyond 2013, I also want to talk about why we feel so confident and why we feel we're so well positioned for the next few years. Around 85% of our profits are tied to the TV ecosystem, which is extremely healthy, both here and around the world. And that's by all measures: subscribers, viewership, affiliate fees and advertising.","Another 10% of our profits come from movies, which are benefiting from positive trends in global box office and recent signs of a stabilization at home video. And as Jeff described, our major strategic initiatives are geared to take advantage of these trends. We think we'll continue to see the payoff from those initiatives in the next several years as we leverage our content investment by increasing our affiliate fees, drive international growth in our networks, continue to monetize our content on new platforms and start to see the benefits from our enterprise efficiency initiatives. When we put all that together and we add in continued returns to shareholders, we think we can continue to generate very attractive growth for the foreseeable future.","Turning to the next slide, which looks at our free cash flow. In 2012, we generated almost $3 billion, and that was higher than we anticipated coming into the year. And that was the result of very strong free cash flow generation in the back half of the year. Free cash flow was up nicely over 2011 as we grew adjusted operating income while reducing our investments in working capital and reducing capital expenditures. The decline in working capital was largely a result of having fewer event films in production, as well as a higher reimbursement for co-financed productions. CapEx was also lower, and that was partially due to the completion of the making of Harry Potter at our studio in Leavesden.","Those positive factors were somewhat offset by an increase in cash taxes and cash interest in 2012, but we still saw an increase in our conversion of both adjusted OIBDA and adjusted net income. As a reminder, over the past few years, we had some significant working capital needs due to principally the timing and nature of film production at our studio. We've begun to see that reverse during the back half of 2012, and we should continue to see the benefits of those investments over the next several years. So as a result of that, we believe our rate of free cash flow conversion should move higher over the next several years.","Let me move now to the final slide, which looks at our net debt. We ended 2012 with a strong and flexible balance sheet. Net debt was $17 billion at the end of the year, and our leverage ratio was 2.4x, which is just below our target of 2.5x.","During the year, we took advantage of market conditions to strengthen our balance sheet and maintained strategic flexibility by issuing $1 billion of new public long-term debt and extending the maturity date on $2.5 billion of our $5 billion credit facility, all at highly attractive rates.","In addition to investing in our businesses, we deployed just under $700 million in strategic M&A transactions, including the acquisition of Bleacher Report, as well as increasing our investment in CME. Also, as I previously mentioned, we returned over $4 billion of capital in the form of dividends and share repurchases. So if you look back over the past 4 years, our approach has been one of balance and consistency.","Since 2008, we have generated over $11 billion in free cash flow, and we've paid out close to $4 billion in dividends. We've repurchased over $11 billion of our shares, or 27% of the base, and we've spent a little under $3 billion on acquisitions.","In 2013, our philosophy of capital deployment will not change. We'll continue to aim for the appropriate balance between maintaining a strong balance sheet, providing us access to the capital markets and strategic flexibility, as well as actively deploying our capital. And we still think that a targeted leverage ratio of 2.5x is the best level that balances all of these goals. This will enable us to invest in our businesses, make strategic acquisitions and return a substantial amount of capital to stockholders.","So I appreciate you listening today. So with that, let me turn the call back over to Doug, and we'll start the Q&A portion. Thank you.","Douglas Shapiro","Thanks a lot, John. Ellen, can we get the Q&A started? [Operator Instructions]","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from John Janedis with UBS.","John Janedis - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Jeff, over the past couple of months, you've announced a handful of exclusive SVOD deals. I think some of them will ultimately include current network shows, which I think is new for you. Can you talk about your ability to grow that exclusive window going forward based on existing rights? And then John, on a related topic, you gave us a $350 million of SVOD for last year. Based on what you have on the books, can you give us an update for this year?","Jeffrey L. Bewkes","Thanks, John. The -- I think you were asking about the slate deal with Netflix. Is that right?","John Janedis - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Yes.","Jeffrey L. Bewkes","Okay. It's not really a change in the syndication business. It's very similar to the CW deal we already had in place. We've been saying for a while that subscription VOD is the right place for serialized and library product. That's also true, by the way, of all the originals on HBO, which is serialized VOD. And on the normal syndication market, serialized series did not have that much value. So we think it's an increase to essentially the financial ecosystem of -- at least the serialized and library part of TV shows. And at the same time, we're seeing positive impact on ratings of new seasons on serialized shows from having the older seasons available on a VOD basis. And so those recent deals with broadcast networks enable us to syndicate serialized seasons -- it's basically, we put those series 1 season back, and it's not really a big change. I'm glad you asked about it because I think, as John pointed out on the call, we generated over $350 million in revenue from SVOD deals in 2012. That doesn't even include the CW deal, which is similar in that serialized \"1 season back\" way. And that's pretty significant. And since we've already signed some new deals in 2013 with both Amazon and Netflix, and there's some more being discussed, we feel very good about the trajectory of the business from a financial support point of view. And we think it's fitting in to the network ecosystem very well.","John K. Martin","Hey, John, in terms the question that you asked about what percentage was essentially already on the books for 2013, the short answer is it's a little bit more than 1\/2.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley.","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Two questions, Jeff, about some recent decisions you guys have made. One, can you talk about the elevation of Kevin to CEO at Warner Bros, what that might mean to the strategy and the cost structure at Warner's? And any expectation around what Bruce and Jeff may do, since obviously they play a huge role at the company? And then #2, at HBO, some people I think thought you might let one of the studios exit over time and redeploy that capital into original programming. Can you just talk about the decision to continue to pay for a film output on HBO, given sort of the macro trends we're seeing in that business?","Jeffrey L. Bewkes","Yes, fine. Thanks. Warner's first. Kevin is going to be a great leader at Warner's. We -- well, I chose him because he's got the greatest breadth of experience across Warner's businesses. I think he's going to do a very good job of bringing together the television group, which is the leading TV production group in the world; the theatrical group, which is also the leading group in the world on a consistency basis; our digital and home video business, which has always been the #1 share leader; and consumer products, which is not #1, that's Disney, but we have high expectations for that going forward. Very thoughtful -- Kevin's very thoughtful about the future of the studio business and the integration of all those businesses that we have. Having said that, we have a very strong group of execs at Warner's, notably Bruce Rosenblum, running the TV group, which is extremely successful and on a big roll right now; and Jeff Robinov running the theatrical group, also very -- much more consistently successful than the other film studios. And operating -- we only had a bigger scale. So I think with those 3 working together going forward, we've got a very good lineup. I think all of those execs, including Jeff and Bruce, have very strong benches of people beneath them as well. So we're basically moving toward -- and Barry Meyer deserves a lot of credit for creating this situation. We've got really a strong next generation coming at Warner's, and all of them are young enough to go pretty long. So one of the hallmarks of Warner's has been consistency of the management over time and a deep bench. And I'm very optimistic about how that's going to go. On your HBO question, yes, we talked about and seriously consider what was the optimal thing for HBO to do in terms of how much movie commitments. As you know, we have had the leading movie lineup at -- with Warner's first and then Fox and Universal joining. We decided to continue that out for the next decade. It gives us some very high quality programming to fill many plex feeds in a very robust VOD offering at both HBO and Cinemax, and it is true that the original programming continues to grow in profile and in volume and in quality at HBO. But still, only about 40% of the HBO subs still primarily watch movies, and about 80% of the viewing on our linear plex feeds are movies. So they still have a tremendous value. They're very important for Cinemax as distinctive offerings. Cinemax may be the world's best movie service. And I think if you look over at some of our competitors, take the move of movie -- Disney movies on to Netflix, which shows that there's some value there for movies in the VOD world. So we basically made the decision to have 1\/2 the -- the exclusive rights to 1\/2 of Hollywood movie outputs, a very advantageous thing for HBO over the next decade. And from a financial point of view, these deals don't come into -- there's no financial effect of these renewals for the next 3 or 4 -- 3 years or so. And then when the new deals kick over in '16, '17, they basically are aligned with box office growth. And what that means is that it's a very good financial ramp for HBO over the long run, and it provides continuously more room for original programming. And as you know, when you have hit original programming series on HBO, they not only fuel the subscription service, they are fueling the subscription growth we mentioned in the global part of HBO, which is now over $70 million, and then they fuel the content revenue. And for -- on that score, I think Game of Thrones is maybe the leading DVD seller in the world right now for TV series. So it's extremely -- it's a very good architecture at the present time at HBO.","Operator","We have Alexia Quadrani with JPMorgan.","Alexia S. Quadrani - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Could you give us an update on how you view Netflix's move into original programming? While they're obviously a nice customer of yours, 5-year content, can they also be viewed -- or do you view them also as a competitor, particularly to HBO? And any influence you think it might have on HBO going forward?","Jeffrey L. Bewkes","Yes, thank you. Let's start with HBO first, since they -- HBO is","[Audio Gap]","I feel great about how HBO is doing today. I think we just talked about it. It's got the best original programming slate ever, a lot of very high-profile series and more every year. We've locked up the theatrical movie position for the next decade. The HBO GO product is a fantastic, 21st-century, Internet-ready product, and we just added more subs than at any time in the last 10 years. Now let's go over and give a little credit to Netflix. They're doing a great job. I think the functionality of their service, some of the really consumer-friendly effectiveness of their search, if you're watching it, finding what you want to watch, getting recommendations to go through a very, very deep library, a lot of programming, it's -- the more programs you have on a service, the more important it is to be able to find them. But if you talk about original programming, HBO has always operated in a competitive environment. We've been happy to see some of the successes at Showtime and Stars recently in originals. Netflix has a new original that's pretty good, House of Cards. I think that's great. It'll take a while for that to turn into -- I forget, what does HBO get? 10 or so hits here? It's all good. I think it reminds consumers of the choice that they have of television programming on demand. And it's an extremely -- the cycle of making breakthrough original programming and having people find it and use it, which HBO has been doing for 20 years, and Netflix is now joining, it takes a while to get back up to scale.","Operator","We have Tim Nollen with Macquarie.","Tim Nollen - Macquarie Research","I wanted to follow up on TV Everywhere, please. What can you do to help galvanize the industry to promote the service better, get more content on and also to promote VOD? Because it seems like you are really -- you have been leading the effort here, and you mentioned it's been a slow start. But I would just like to know what you can do to get your peers both on the distributor, as well as the content owner sides to go further with that. Can I also ask a question on ratings, please? You spoke last time, I think, about doing some things to try to improve the rating systems, whether it's moving from C3 to C7, whether it's including VOD or TV Everywhere, whether it's to include tablets. Just updated thoughts on what might be underway there.","Jeffrey L. Bewkes","Okay. Let me -- good, let's start with TV Everywhere. Basically, that structure of having streaming and VOD available is embraced by basically every program network, every distributor. Even broadcasters are now embracing TVE. For example, NBC had great success with its Olympics coverage, and Disney had a very positive response to its apps for sports. And Fox is authenticating prime time content on hulu.com and fox.com. I think Scripps and Viacom have also made recent TVE announcements. And as you said, Turner, Time Warner, HBO, all of our networks were the first to put most of our shows on a VOD -- television everywhere basis. I think the technology is evolving. Adobe Pass is now an authentication solution. It's in use by most major programmers. It was developed by Turner and Adobe together, and it enables consumers to authenticate just once across unaffiliated networks. So it makes it much easier for a consumer to get keyed up and not have to do it every time they turn on their device or they try to switch channels. Other enhancements like modem-based authentication are also streamlining the authentication process. We totally agree. I view [ph] with your -- the premise of your question, which is it's really important for the distributor world to make it easier, faster, not complicated or daunting, for people to use this fantastic set of rights. So one of the things -- I think HBO GO, which is so powerful and easy to use, is showing everyone exactly how much of a rainbow -- on how much of a pot of gold is at the end of the rainbow. So hopefully that'll stimulate more action. We think there are some very important device companies, Apple may be one of them, who are working to try to create better interfaces with devices people love to access their TV Everywhere content. Of course, that makes your network more valuable if you have it on a device and in an interface that you like. On ratings, we agree generally that probably -- the same point really, to get consumers a stronger connection to their favorite network viewing. It makes more sense for people to work on a weekly basis, not a 3-day basis. So we think C3 should expand to C7. Look, if the rights go there at the office, the measurement will follow. And that's probably how it will happen.","Operator","We have Doug Mitchelson with Deutsche Bank.","Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Jeff, you emphasized a greater level of originals at TBS and TNT. I think you said 40-plus percent more this year, and I know it's been an ongoing strategy. This puts acquired syndicated product as a lesser and lesser part of the mix while you, I guess, look at viewership or dollars spent or however you want to look at it. Is there any update you can give us regarding the effectiveness of acquired syndicated products and any implications for the studio or the cable network business to the extent that syndicated content doesn't provide the same value that it used to for networks like TNT and TBS?","Jeffrey L. Bewkes","Well, it's kind of -- if you're asking whether secularly acquired product is questionable, no, because you've got to look at which kind and which type. If you took the Big Bang Theory, for example, moving on to TBS this year, it's the biggest show in any Cable network anywhere. It took the ratings up 30% to 40%. It's hugely successful. If you then look at the kind of original programming series that come into networks like TNT, USA, et cetera, you have to look at where -- the era which they come from. And as we've talked about before, 3, 4 or 5 years ago, the broadcast networks had a slump in scripted drama and some original series. And so it's important not to generalize from that slump. We've had some come on and work really well. Castle is on TNT, it's a drama. It's working better than we thought. We had The Mentalist come on to TNT. It was the #1 show back when we brought it on, and it has fallen off a bit at CBS in terms of new shows next week, and the same at TNT. So you do have a mixed bag. What we think is that since we at TNT, TBS have essentially a sister company access to the production company that makes the best shows across television, Warner Bros. TV has shows more than 2 at every 1 of the 5 networks, we think that we are in a good position to be able to pick the ones that fit our networks and to put them into an economic system as we dial up and down the mix of acquired series that are hits. You should look at them as hits, not reruns. They're not reruns for the people who watch them. And then if you pick the right diet of increasing, in our case, original series, and you mix that with the right sports offering, you have a very powerful network to launch things. It's kind of the new version of what the broadcast networks were 30 years ago.","Operator","We have David Miller with B. Riley Caris.","David W. Miller - B. Riley & Co., LLC, Research Division","Can you talk about -- Jeff, can you talk about what the scatter-over-scatter performance was at TNT, excluding the NBA and also including the NBA? I'd just be interested in the delta between those 2 numbers. And then, Jeff, can you talk about whether or not your bias would be to renew the output deal with Legendary over here in southern -- in Los Angeles? Obviously, they're just a huge supplier of premium content for you guys. I think they're doing Man of Steel. I think they're shouldering most of that cost burden, correct me if I'm wrong. Hangover 3 is in there, Pacific Rim is in there. There have been some rumors over here in Los Angeles about some contentiousness in the negotiations. Could you comment in any way?","Jeffrey L. Bewkes","Yes, let me start with Legendary. The deal with Thomas Tull's Legendary goes to the end of the year. We're all very close to Thomas. We've got a great relationship. No, there's not contentiousness. There is problem solving going on, and we expect to have very meaningful discussions with Legendary about the extension and the term -- on the basis basically on which it would make sense for Legendary and for us. We're confident in our ability to generate a robust slate of films regardless of our financial partners, and we have very high regard for Legendary. So don't worry about that on either our account or theirs.","John K. Martin","Hey, David, it's John. One always wonders if somebody is going to ask a question that you haven't thought of, and I think you would get the award for this call. I don't know because we don't really look at scatter-over-scatter in terms of the way we run the business in general. So looking backward, with and without the NBA, you'd probably need to follow up with Doug and team afterwards. I will tell you, in Q1, at the risk of repeating what we already said, scatter is pretty steady with pricing up, which probably means current quarter scatter-over-scatter is up a little bit. But we'll have to get back to you in terms of looking backward.","Operator","The last question comes from Michael Morris with Davenport & Company.","Michael C. Morris - Davenport & Company, LLC, Research Division","Two questions. First, on sports rights, Jeff, you mentioned that you have the second-largest collection of national sports rights after ESPN. So my question is, would you consider establishing a standalone sports network? You look at ESPN doing over $5 per sub per month. Is that something you would contemplate? Why or why not? And then second, internationally, you mentioned streamlining Western Europe. Does that mean that you would not look to expand your channel's holdings in Western Europe through acquisition? Or is that still a possibility?","Jeffrey L. Bewkes","Okay. Let me start with sports rights. Sports rights, particularly the ones we've been renewing lately, the NCAA championships, the baseball deal, we're very happy with the performance in terms of ratings, and they're a very important part of the value of our channels as we go through affiliate renewals. So they're an important part of the offer, but we're focused on having the right sports. We'll continue to evaluate potential opportunities in the future, but we will do that basically in the framework of our current existing networks, not as a startup of standalone sports networks. If you go to Europe -- I'll start. What we meant by streamlining Western Europe is we don't have as much scale in essentially locally based networks there or, to some extent, in distribution of our worldwide networks as we do in Eastern Europe, Latin America and Asia. And so we were streamlining the staff layers there. We don't have a big -- we don't have -- we're not interested in going out trying to rig a big acquisition in Western Europe, if that's what you're asking. John, you want to add anything?","John K. Martin","Nope.","Douglas Shapiro","All right. Well, we're upon the hour, so thanks, everybody, for listening.","Jeffrey L. Bewkes","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

This transaction is an excellent outcome for our shareholders and it's an excellent opportunity to drive long-term value into the future. We believe combining with AT&T is the natural next step in the evolution of our business and it's one that allows us to significantly accelerate our most important strategy. We believe that putting these complementary businesses together will drive innovation and accelerate the transition of the ecosystem to more and better choices for consumers. We anticipate the transaction will close by the end of 2017, if not sooner.","Turning to our results, we had another strong quarter and we remain on track to exceed our original outlook. We've delivered these results while making investments to capitalize on the growing consumption of video across both traditional and new platforms all over the world, which we're confident positions us for continued industry-leading growth over the long-term.","In the quarter, our revenues grew 9% to $7.2 billion and adjusted operating income increased 12% to $2.1 billion, and we saw growth at all our divisions. Adjusted EPS grew to $1.83 a share and we also returned over $1 billion to shareholders in share repurchases and dividends. Echoing what we've seen not only through this year but also for the past several years, our performance was propelled this quarter by creative excellence from across every one of our divisions. We're in an environment where leading brands with distinctive content that engages audiences stands apart. It's also an environment of unprecedented consumer choice and control. And as was outlined for you before, we're committed not just to being home to the world's best content, but to generating new revenue streams by leading evolution of how and where content is consumed and experienced. This is where we see enormous opportunity from joining forces with AT&T, because it brings us closer to consumers and allows us to go where they're going. And that is increasingly mobile, it's increasingly multi-platform, increasingly on demand, and it's increasingly through new services and packages via direct consumer relationships over broadband.","As you've all heard from Randall Stephenson at AT&T, we're really focused on the growth opportunities of this combination. We think we can innovate new services and forms of content and experiences faster and better together, and that will benefit not just us, but all our business partners and consumers all over the world. If you look at our third quarter, the strength and breadth of our premium content was underscored at this year's primetime Emmy awards, where HBO, again, took home more awards than any other network for the fifteenth consecutive year. All told, across our networks and studio, Time Warner's divisions won 40 Emmys. That's more than any other company.","More recently, we've just seen the powerful return of the D.C. entertainment-based TV slate on the CW and CNN's continued standout performance in the final stretch of the election race. And the thrilling start to HBO's newest original series, Westworld, produced by Warner Bros. More than 13 million viewers have tuned in to the premier episodes of Westworld so far and that exceeds the first episodes of Game of Thrones and True Detective.","In film, Warner had a terrific quarter led by the latest DC installment, Suicide Squad. And Clint Eastwood's Sully. Sully is our sixth release this year to do over $100 million in domestic box.","Now at the same time, we continue to make progress on our initiatives to develop new revenue streams outside the traditional TV ecosystem. iStreamPlanet, which Turner acquired a majority stake in last year, demonstrated that power when it used its technology to make the live streaming of the real Olympics a reality for NBC. And Turner just debuted its first direct-to-consumer offering in the U.S., FilmStruck, that's an arthouse film SVOD service.","Over at Warners, our SVOD partnership with Tencent \u2013 Tencent video VIP continues to exhibit tremendous subscriber growth and it's currently the second-largest SVOD service in China.","And HBO continues to make progress in its streaming strategy both here and around the world. HBO NOW is building momentum, while HBO's OTT business in the Nordics is showing accelerating growth. And we're on track to launch in more international territories before the end of the year.","These are just early examples of the kinds of vibrant new services and capabilities we're working on, and we plan to accelerate these as part of AT&T.","Now let me spend a little time highlighting what each of our divisions accomplished in the past quarter. At Turner, we've been investing in our leading portfolio of entertainment, news, sports and kids to make these brands even more engaging and essential to audiences. And those investments are driving real momentum across its businesses.","During the third quarter, Turner had three of the top six ad-supported cable networks in primetime among adults 18 to 49, namely, Adult Swim, TBS and TNT. And Adult Swim was the number-one ad-supported cable network in total day among adults 18 to 34 for the 34th consecutive quarter.","At TBS and TNT, we're very encouraged by the brand refresh that's underway and the distinctive programming that we've been rolling out. At TBS, Full Frontal with Samantha Bee has already overtaken the Daily Show in just its first season, and Sam has emerged as a distinctive voice this election, which is saying something, given some of the voices this election.","And on Monday, we debuted People of Earth, a Warner's production, and we'll follow that with Search Party premiering November 21.","Over at TNT, the refresh is at an earlier stage, but we're excited about Good Behavior, starring Michelle Dockery of Downton Abbey fame. And that premiers on November 15.","And we have a very strong pipeline of originals for 2017. We also announced this quarter that TBS and TNT have reached a deal with Disney to be the cable home for the entire cannon of Star Wars movies and a similar deal with Warner Brothers for its DC theatrical titles, and that's adding to an already strong movie lineup that also includes Disney's Marvel movies and the Hunger Games franchise. This aligns perfectly with the younger audiences these brands are drawing.","Let's all turn to CNN, which continues to win over audiences with its mixture of indispensable news and election coverage along with innovative original series.","CNN was number-one news network among adults 18 to 49 in primetime for the fourth consecutive quarter, and CNN had its most-watched quarter in eight years among total viewers and among adults 25 to 54. And CNN's coverage of the second U.S. Presidential debate, co-hosted by our own Anderson Cooper, was its most-watched general election debate ever, making CNN one-number one among all cable networks for that night.","And CNN Digital continued its streak as the number-one news destination, outpacing all news and information competitors with more mobile unique visitors, more multi-platform views, more video starts and more video minutes than any other news outlet.","Let's turn to HBO, which continues to raise the bar and define the word premium for our industry. As I mentioned, its 22 primetime Emmy awards were the most of any network for the 15th consecutive year, and they included Outstanding Drama Series for Game of Thrones, Outstanding Comedy Series for Veep, Outstanding Variety Talk Series for Last Week Tonight with John Oliver. In fact, Game of Thrones received 12 awards and has now earned 38 Emmys, more than any single scripted series in television history.","Never one to rest on its laurels, HBO is aggressively expanding its content as well. In addition to Westworld, it recently introduced Insecure, High Maintenance, Divorce and the new nightly newscast from Vice.","What you're seeing at HBO is our ongoing strategy to provide consumers with a steady flow of the very best content in order to drive demand across both traditional distributors and with HBO NOW.","Speaking of NOW, we remain very pleased with its progress, and in late September, we further expanded its reach with the announcement that HBO NOW along with HBO and Cinemax are now available on Sony's PlayStation platforms.","Looking at Warner Bros. strong performance during the quarter, it underscores its global leadership position in the production of film and television, and it remains on track for another record year. Our theatrical business is setting the pace with a number of standout performers over the last few months, including the Conjuring 2, Central Intelligence, the Legend of Tarzan and Lights Out. But our blockbuster for the quarter, of course, was Suicide Squad, which not only had the biggest August opening ever but has gone on to generate nearly $750 million in worldwide box office. And that's just the most recent example of how we're tapping the growing potential of our DC entertainment IP. We've only just begun our ambitious slate for DC theatrical. Next year's much-anticipated releases include Wonder Woman and Justice League as well as Lego Batman, a fun feature that builds on the franchise we started with 2014's hit, The Lego Movie.","We also have an unprecedented 10 television series airing this season based on DC characters, with DC's TV business now generating more than $1 billion a year in revenue, going up. And I want to highlight the excitement we're seeing for these iconic brands digitally in consumer products and even in print. Our DC Super Hero Girls partnership with Mattel has action figures flying off the shelves. And since May, DC has shipped a record 18 million comic books based on the new Rebirth series concept that was spearheaded by Geoff Johns the renowned comic book writer \u2013 he knows how to pronounce it \u2013 who's also actively helping shape our DC films.","In the near-term, we're very excited about Fantastic Beasts, a brand-new story based in the Wizarding World of Harry Potter, that we think will be a global hit, not just at the box office but in consumer products and across all platforms. Jo Rowling has already written a script for the second film that's set for release on November 16, 2018 and the third will follow in 2020. And as Jo herself recently announced, the story's so rich that she now plans to tell it in five films, giving fans even more to look forward to.","Warner's great franchises like DC, the Wizarding World of Harry Potter, Looney Tunes, Hanna-Barbera are also the driving force behind our consumer products business, which is also enjoying a record year. As we continue to roll at our franchise films and develop more kids content as part of the kids venture between Warner and Turner, we think this business can be an important growth driver going forward.","You can see we're heading into the fourth quarter with a lot of momentum and, as I said up front, we positioned ourselves to benefit from the growing opportunities we see worldwide for the best video content. We're moving aggressively to strengthen our position within the traditional ecosystem while also building new revenue streams outside of it.","As we look at the fourth quarter of 2016 and beyond, we remain very confident about our ability to continue to execute on our plans, and we're even more excited about what we can accomplish given the combination with AT&T and what that will enable us to do as one company, uniquely focused on delivering great content and a great consumer experience across platforms.","Thanks for listening. Let me turn it over to Howard.","Howard M. Averill - Time Warner, Inc.","Thanks, Jeff, and good morning. I'll begin by referring to the first slide of our presentation, which is now available on our website. Starting with consolidated results, we had another great quarter with growth across all of our businesses, fueled by the positive trends we've seen throughout the year and we feel very good about how we're positioned to close out 2016 and as we head into 2017.","In the third quarter, revenues were up 9% and adjusted operating income grew a very strong 12% to a quarterly record of $2.1 billion. Margins expanded about 100 basis points in the quarter despite continuing investments across the company in content and digital initiatives. That was partly due to limiting growth in SG&A to the low single digits. Adjusted EPS was up 46% to $1.83 and included a $0.28 net tax benefit related to a tax accounting method change. Excluding the tax benefit, adjusted EPS would've increased a healthy 24% to $1.55, as we benefited from great operating results, a lower effective tax rate and fewer shares outstanding as a result of our share repurchase program.","During the third quarter, we repurchased over $700 million of our shares and paid $315 million in dividends. And year-to-date, we've returned nearly $3.3 billion to shareholders.","So we're very pleased with our strong operational performance so far this year, and when combined with the tax benefit, we raised our outlook for 2016 adjusted EPS to $5.73 to $5.83, or $5.45 to $5.55 when excluding the $0.28 tax benefit I just mentioned. I'll touch more on our outlook throughout my presentation.","Now turning to the segment highlights, I'll start at Turner, where our revenue trends remain robust and translated into solid double-digit growth in adjusted operating income. Subscription revenues increased 12% in the quarter, and that included 100 basis points of FX headwinds. Domestic subscription revenues grew 15% as we continued to benefit from the rate increases we achieved during our affiliate renewal cycle. That puts us right on track to deliver the growth for the year we've discussed with you, and we expect another year of solid double-digit growth in 2017.","International subscription revenue was up in the low-single digits, and that included a more than five percentage point drag from FX.","Advertising revenue was up 2%, in-line with our expectations coming into the quarter, and that included about 100 basis points of negative impact from FX. Domestic advertising increased in the low-single digits led by solid double-digit growth across our linear and digital news properties. That was somewhat balanced by the impact of our decision to air significantly less original programming at our domestic entertainment networks in part to avoid competing with the Olympics. International advertising was essentially flat in the quarter, but up high-single digits when excluding an eight percentage point FX drag.","Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect total advertising revenue growth to be approximately flat. The scatter market remains healthy, with pricing at our domestic entertainment networks pacing up double-digits over the upfront. At the same time, we faced very difficult comparisons to last year's record Major League Baseball playoff performance and we aired three fewer playoff games this year. We'll also have fewer hours of original programming as the content refresh at TNT will accelerate more in 2017. And based on current rates, we expect FX to have a similar impact as in the third quarter.","Moving on, content and other revenues were up 33% in the quarter. That reflects higher international licensing revenues as we're seeing healthy demand for our original programming abroad.","Adjusted operating income was up 12% in the quarter, and margins expanded 140 basis points. That was despite higher programming costs which increased 5%, mainly reflecting CNN's election coverage.","So Turner is executing really well and is on-track to deliver another year of strong growth in adjusted operating income. And we think the investments we're making in great content as part of the TNT and TBS rebrands as well as the new capabilities and businesses position Turner to carry this momentum into 2017 and beyond.","Turning now to HBO, where we continue to invest in the business and lay the groundwork for accelerating revenue trends over the next few years. Consistent with the first half of the year, domestic subscription revenue grew in the mid-single digits. We continue to see a sequential increase in the contribution from HBO NOW as we benefit from the strong subscriber growth so far this year. On the other hand, similar to the last couple of years, we continue to experience headwinds related to subscriber mix.","Looking ahead, we expect HBO subscription revenue growth to accelerate in the fourth quarter and in 2017. We're currently in the midst of our affiliate renewals, so the timing of when deals close and their implementation will determine the pace of the acceleration.","Content and other revenues were down slightly in the quarter. Last year's quarter included the domestic licensing of a library series and that was mostly offset by increased international licensing revenue as the global demand for our original programming remains robust.","Across HBO's international networks including unconsolidated JVs, revenues once again were up double-digits when excluding FX, and that primarily reflects continued positive trends in LATAM and the Nordics.","Adjusted operating income was up 2% in the quarter, as programming cost increased mid-teens. That reflected investments in new original series like The Night Of and Vice Principals as well as the timing of theatrical availabilities.","Overall, we're very pleased with the performance of HBO's programming lineup and excited about the strong pipeline of new series slated for the next few years, and we're confident the investments we're making in the business and the robust consumer demand for premium content around the world will contribute to significant growth in the years to come.","Moving on to Warner Bros., where despite difficult comparisons in TV and video games, we delivered strong results with revenue up 7% and adjusted operating income increasing 12%. Warner's theatrical business led the way with revenues growing a robust 45% as we benefit from the great box office performance of our film slate. That included our most recent franchise release, Suicide Squad, which has grossed close to $750 million at the global box office. The diversity of our slate was also on display this quarter with the success of Sully, The Legend of Tarzan, and the most recent release in our very profitable horror slate, Lights Out.","In television, we faced difficult licensing comparisons due to the syndication of 2 Broke Girls and Person of Interest in last year's quarter. However, TV revenues only declined modestly as Warner's benefited from increased production with the start of the new TV season, including Warner's continued expansion in cable with shows like Westworld on HBO and Animal Kingdom on TNT.","Across theatrical and TV, home entertainment revenues were flat in the quarter. Digital trends remain encouraging, though, with EFT revenue up 25%, and we expect improved revenue trends as our strong theatrical slate continues to move into the home entertainment window over the next few quarters.","So Warner Bros. has great momentum and is on pace for another record year in adjusted operating income. And the initial success of this year's franchise movies gives us even more confidence in the exciting franchise-led slate we have for the next several years. So combined with the attractive growth opportunities in TV and games, Warners is well-positioned to continue delivering solid financial results over the long-term.","Turning to the next slide, free cash flow totaled $3.3 billion through the third quarter. That's up 15% from a year ago, largely due to the growth in adjusted operating income. Year-to-date, working capital has improved due to the CME refinancing payment we received in the second quarter. So we remain on track for another year of very healthy free cash flow in 2016.","Now looking at our balance sheet, we ended the third quarter with $22 billion of net debt. Looking forward as we move through the approval process for the AT&T transaction, we expect to continue to pay our regular quarterly dividend. However, we have discontinued repurchasing our stock. We've done about $750 million year-to-date in M&A, largely related to the investment in Hulu in August.","Our net leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was just above our target leverage ratio of 2.75 times, and we expect to end the year slightly below that target as a result of discontinuing share repurchases.","With that, let's move onto the final slide which looks at our outlook for 2016. We're very pleased with how we're operating across the company and with our solid financial performance year-to-date, and that's reflected in our outlook for adjusted EPS for 2016, which we increased to $5.73 to $5.83, or $5.45 to $5.55 when excluding the $0.28 tax benefit we recognized this quarter. The midpoint of that range implies mid-teens growth in adjusted EPS, putting us on track for our eighth consecutive year of double-digit earnings growth.","Looking at the fourth quarter, we expect Warners to be the primary growth driver, led by its strong theatrical slate, including the first installment in the Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them franchise. Meanwhile, we continue to invest significantly in programming across our networks. HBO already premiered four new original programs in the fourth quarter, and at Turner our new NBA contract at TNT kicks in. CNN will continue to have elevated costs related to its election coverage. So we expect programming cost at both HBO and Turner to be up double digits in the fourth quarter when excluding last year's programming charges.","In addition, we anticipate our effective tax rate will be in the low 30% range and we expect that to be a sustainable level going forward.","Overall, we have great operating momentum across our businesses and we think the investments we're making both inside and outside the traditional TV ecosystem we're very well-positioned to continue this momentum and deliver strong financial results for many years to come.","With that, I'll turn it back to Jessica to start the Q&A.","Jessica L. Holscott - Time Warner, Inc.","Thanks, Howard. Before I turn the call over to Q&A, I wanted to add that we'd like to focus the Q&A on the third quarter results and operating performance, as there are some limits on the type of questions we can answer regarding the pending merger with AT&T.","Operator, can you please open up the line for our first question?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Yes, thank you. At this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session.","Our first question today comes from the line of Michael Morris of Guggenheim Securities. Please proceed with your questions.","Michael Morris - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Thank you. Good morning. I do have one merger question and then one operating question. There's some concern that an FCC review could be challenging, and so my question is do you expect ownership of any of the assets that you have broadcast licenses or your CW stake or Hulu would result in an FCC review? And do you think you, you know, would you consider divesting any assets as part of the process?","And then I have a second question.","Jeff L. Bewkes - Time Warner, Inc.","All right, I'm going to pass it to Paul, our General Counsel. Go ahead, Paul.","Paul T. Cappuccio - Time Warner, Inc.","Hey, Mike. Thank you. As you pointed out, what the FCC does is they review and approve the transfer of licenses. We have one broadcast license, and that's for an independent local TV station that's managed not by us but by a third-party. And we have a fair number of what we would call operational licenses, many of which are not different from what any company in America has. We're currently in the process of reviewing sort of which, if any, of these licenses will need to be transferred to AT&T in connection with the transaction or which could be relinquished. And the result of that inventory will dictate what's required at the FCC. We'll say what AT&T said, which is we'll do whatever the law requires.","But I think the point is, you know, we have a number of licenses that are essentially operational and we're looking at in fact whether those need to be transferred over to AT&T.","Michael Morris - Guggenheim Securities LLC","That's helpful. Thank you.","And then secondly, can you help us think a little bit, help us a little bit with the longer-term domestic affiliate growth at Turner? I mean, the 15% is very impressive. We know that you've had industry-leading growth with the renewals you've done, but can you help us with how much of that is kind of step-ups as you've moved some of the agreements to kind of market rate? And maybe how we should think about escalators and growth going forward beyond 2016? Thanks.","Jeff L. Bewkes - Time Warner, Inc.","John, you do it.","John K. Martin - Time Warner, Inc.","Thanks, Mike. It's John. Listen, I think we're delivering the type of results this year that we predicted a number of years ago based on the renewal cycle that we were coming up and the deals that we were successfully executing. So really pleased to be able to report subscriber revenue growth domestically in the mid-teens, which is a pretty extraordinary growth rate off of an already high base.","And we expect to have a very strong subscriber revenue growth year next year as well, which we've highlighted and signaled, and I still think we're very, very much on-track for that.","We haven't given any specific guidance beyond that, but I would tell you, we continue to believe that the strength of the Turner networks and our position within the ad-supported cable market is going to be able to garner fair value, and we're going to do everything we can to continue to extract fair value for the value that we think that our networks are bringing to both distributors and consumers.","Michael Morris - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Great. Thanks, John.","Jessica L. Holscott - Time Warner, Inc.","Thanks, Mike. I think we're ready for the next question, operator.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Omar Sheikh with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Omar Sheikh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thank you. Just got a couple; one for Jeff, one for Howard, if I could. Jeff, in your prepared remarks, you talked a lot about the creative performance of all the business units in the company. I just wonder whether you could let us know how you think you can ensure that creative culture is preserved and enhanced under AT&T's ownership, because that's I think a sort of quite a big focus for a lot of investors?","And then secondly, Howard, on the guidance, I wondered if you could just let us know \u2013 obviously excluding the $0.28 tax benefit, since the beginning of this year, you've raised guidance by $0.15. Could you just tell us what that increase would have been if you'd excluded all the FX impacts?","Jeff L. Bewkes - Time Warner, Inc.","Hi. I'll start on the first one. First of all, I'm not going anywhere, and we'll be here through the closing and into quite a period of transition after that, and then Randall and I will figure out what's the best way to go over the long run.","The same is true of our division heads and all of our top execs, so whether it's John, Kevin and Richard and all the teams they lead. And then think of our creative partners, not just our programming development execs inside the company, but all of our very, very important \u2013 most of the creative input comes from outside the company in partnership with us.","That's the essence of Time Warner, and if you listen to Randall, and I've talked to him and all his top management for quite some time now, they are very understanding of the need to keep this company excelling and growing, and it doesn't just mean the ongoing momentum of all of our execs and the Time Warner people, it means continuing to be the leading place which we think we are at Warner, at Turner, and at HBO for creative partners outside the company who know that if you come here, we not only have a culture to make the best out of your project, but we have the resources and the distribution ability, and now with AT&T, an enhanced ability to innovate, bring them new forms and an even stronger platform to fuel all these innovations.","You're looking at a new world of more mobile products, more short-form products, virtual reality; all kinds of exciting developments. That's why we're doing this merger, and that's why creative partners are going to find us an even more attractive place to come in the future.","Howard M. Averill - Time Warner, Inc.","Hey, Omar. This is Howard. So in terms of excluding FX, the $0.15 guidance increase that we've done so far this year would actually be about the same. We haven't really seen much change since the start of the year where we had estimated about a $0.15 FX impact on the year, and that's actually about where we are. So not much impact.","Omar Sheikh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Jessica L. Holscott - Time Warner, Inc.","Thanks, Omar. Operator, ready for the next question.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Doug Mitchelson with UBS. Please proceed with your questions.","Doug Mitchelson - UBS Securities LLC","Oh, thanks so much. So for Jeff, my question is not about AT&T, but rather other companies. Were there any other companies this year that showed interest in acquiring Time Warner?","And on HBO, any update you're willing to give us on the OTT subscriber levels in the U.S. and overseas at this point? And if not, any change in gross add momentum or churn trends? Any enhanced knowledge that you can share with us would be helpful. Thank you.","Jeff L. Bewkes - Time Warner, Inc.","Look, I'll start with I think your question about other companies. Let's focus on AT&T. The transaction here that we're putting together, the two of us, delivers significant value and competencies going forward to our shareholders. It's a quite a unique opportunity, and it came about after numerous conversations that we had in the normal course of our business. They are our strongest distribution partner.","We've been evolving a lot of business initiatives ourselves, and so is DirecTV and AT&T. So we basically saw that this was a fairly unique complementary way to take all the initiatives that certainly on our side we were doing, and accelerating them, and making them stronger. And we figured that together we could drive more innovation.","And the key to having innovative things adopted is consumers finding a better value, whether that's more choice, whether it's better pricing on their packages, whether it's more effective and less intrusive advertising. That's what will determine success. We think this combination of companies is not only going to bring us that, but we think it's going to help a lot of other companies in the industry to evolve faster and bring better results to consumers.","Richard L. Plepler - Home Box Office, Inc.","Doug, it's Richard. On your OTT question, we couldn't be more pleased or enthusiastic about what we're seeing this year. We've seen substantial growth with HBO NOW. We expect that to continue of course across all of our digital distribution, including HBO GO.","And I would add to that that each quarter, we're learning more and more from the data that we're getting about how to refine our market \u2013 marketing, how to improve our efficiencies, how to target better, how to affect churn, and all that is progressing month-by-month. So we're very optimistic by the numbers that we're seeing and we expect them to continue to grow.","Doug Mitchelson - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you, Jeff and Richard.","Jessica L. Holscott - Time Warner, Inc.","Great. Thanks, Doug. We're ready for the next question.","Operator","The next question is from Michael Nathanson with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead with your questions.","Michael B. Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC","Thanks. I have one for John and one for Richard. John, first for you. Howard said growth in affiliate fees this quarter was 15%, which is better than the previous quarter. Was there anything unique about what drove this quarter? Have subs stabilized for you or gotten any better? So what made it a little bit better than second quarter growth?","John K. Martin - Time Warner, Inc.","Hi, Michael. Thanks. It's John. I mean, listen, any given quarter is going to be affected a little bit up or down based on true-ups and audit adjustments and things like that, and so I wouldn't look too closely into sequential quarterly figures.","I mean, I think we'll guide it on an annual basis. That's how we plan for the year. And at the risk of repeating what Howard said or what I said just before, we're going to come in right about where we expected to be, which I'm really pleased with. And the subscriber trends in the United States for us in our networks are continuing to pace at about the same rate of change as they have been for a number of quarters now.","Michael B. Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC","Okay. And then for Richard, now that you've I believe got your deal done with DirecTV earlier in September, are you still confident that you're going to see high-single digit affiliate growth at HBO? And when would be the earliest point at which we will start seeing that high-single digit growth?","Richard L. Plepler - Home Box Office, Inc.","Yeah, Mike, first of all, we've actually completed a couple of deals with our large distributors this year, and we think they create tremendous opportunities for us, not only beginning in the fourth quarter, but into 2017 and beyond to accelerate sub revenue growth. And what's obvious about them is the acquiring company's penetration is in certain cases 50% above the acquired company's penetration, and we look forward over time to driving that not only to the acquiring company's penetration but beyond. And the joint marketing and packaging opportunities that are built into those deals, we're very comfortable are going to drive that upside for us.","So it will begin in the fourth quarter, but begin to kick-in next year and beyond. So we're very optimistic about the deals, and we think they're going to speak volumes about sub revenue growth going forward.","Michael B. Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Jessica L. Holscott - Time Warner, Inc.","Thanks, Michael. Ready for the next question.","Operator","Yes. That's coming from the line of Alexia Quadrani with JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question.","Alexia S. Quadrani - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Thank you. My question is on Turner. You're so into your new strategy which includes a significant increase in original programming, a reduction in ad loads in some of your networks. Are you seeing the economic returns you had hoped for, or is it still too early to tell?","And then just a follow-on. You mentioned that sub trends, you know, pace of change about the same as previous quarters, with the expected rollout of DTC now shortly, and Hulu Live sort of around the corner. Would you expect that rate of decline to accelerate in your view?","John K. Martin - Time Warner, Inc.","I'll take the second one first. The answer is no. I mean, because we're also at the very, very early stages of some new entrants coming in, the virtual folks. And so as a result of that, I \u2013 you know, we're planning for similar trends going forward, although we hope that we'll be pleasantly surprised.","With regard to the strategy that we really started to employ a number of years ago, honestly, I couldn't be more pleased with how things are progressing, because if you look at what we've been able to do at TBS this year, which was really its rebrand year, having four of the top new comedies on cable, all of those shows being renewed for a second season, having a great show from Warner Brothers, Animal Kingdom on TNT which we've renewed for a second season, the continued dominance at Adult Swim and a significant ramp in original programming pace there, and obviously CNN is just killing it this year, and it's going to have a great year next year.","And in terms of advertising, we're still in the very early stages of essentially nothing short of reinventing the ad model for TV. But the early, early examples that we've done, because we have done limited commercials in some of the new originals, is we are seeing some really positive results. We're seeing \u2013 because of TVs unparalleled reach and engagement, we're seeing advertiser response has been extremely positive. We're seeing improved ratings because there's less dislocation going into the advertising pod and coming out. And we've seen higher consumer satisfaction and higher brand recall. So still very early days but very, very, very encouraging and I think we're moving in the right direction, and quite pleased to see that the industry is sort of galvanizing around this idea.","Alexia S. Quadrani - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you.","Jessica L. Holscott - Time Warner, Inc.","Great. Thanks, Alexia. Operator, I think we're ready for the next question.","Operator","Yes. That'll be coming from the line of Richard Greenfield with BTIG. Please go ahead with your questions.","Rich Greenfield - BTIG LLC","Hi. I have a couple of questions, but first just on the business side. Richard, you recently spoke at an industry conference and I think you indicated that the new AT&T DirecTV deal that you had signed enables far more flexible or unique packaging than you've had in the past. And I think you even talked about how HBO NOW could be bundled in with wireless-only bundles, and this was even before the AT&T transaction was announced. Just wondering, how do you think about those opportunities of what you've laid out in the new AT&T deal on the programming side or packaging side? And how that impacts your sub revenue growth going forward? And then I have a question on the deal for after.","Richard L. Plepler - Home Box Office, Inc.","Thanks, Rich. Well obviously everything I said at -- I think you're referring to the Wall Street Journal conference, holds. We're obviously very excited by the deal. We think it allows us to sell across all platforms; wireless, broadband, satellite, expands our reach into the consumer base. AT&T is very excited by the deal, and obviously when we're under one roof, we expect those opportunities to only grow and expand which, by the way, will be the case for all content providers, not just us.","Rich Greenfield - BTIG LLC","But do you really envision them saying, hey, if you want AT&T Wireless and you're a high-end subscriber to AT&T Wireless, it's going to come bundled with HBO NOW? Like, is that what you see as the future for HBO packaging?","Richard L. Plepler - Home Box Office, Inc.","I think \u2013 listen, we're going to stay with the deal that we have which is turbocharging HBO across all of their platforms. They understand they have their data, we have our data, that HBO drives consumer use across all of their different platforms. That's why we did the deal together. That's why it's a good deal for them and a good deal for us. I don't think the merger has any impact on that one way or the other. And everything that they're going to do with us, I punctuate, they can do with any other content providers as well.","Rich Greenfield - BTIG LLC","Sure. And then just a follow-up on the transaction. You mentioned that the FCC only governs license transfers. I just want it to be crystal clear that if the FCC chose to get involved and chose to deny or block those license transfers, are there ways for AT&T to continue to operate Time Warner's businesses without the license transfers? Meaning they don't block \u2013 the FCC doesn't block transactions. They simply block license transfers. So are there alternatives if the FCC tried to use the license transfer process to disrupt your transaction?","Jeff L. Bewkes - Time Warner, Inc.","Paul, why don't you start?","Paul T. Cappuccio - Time Warner, Inc.","Hey, Rich. It's Paul. You're correct to identify that the FCC reviews license transfers, is what they do. If a license transfer isn't required to AT&T, it won't be required to AT&T. And obviously, as you said, the jurisdiction of the FCC is if you need a license transfer to AT&T, and we're currently \u2013 as we said, we're currently looking at whether any of them need to be or whether they're not needed. I think the point we pointed out is there aren't like what we would call material licenses that are the bedrock of our business that AT&T would need to operate our business.","So think of a walkie-talkie. Does AT&T need a walkie-talkie license that CNN holds in order to own CNN? Now you could think of other things like earth stations that are little more complicated in an analysis. But I think the point is, and again we don't want to get crosswise with the FCC or anything because we're looking at what's required. And we'll do what the law requires, of course. But we don't have things that are material to the actual content of the business that AT&T would need in operating our assets.","Rich Greenfield - BTIG LLC","Thank you very much.","Jessica L. Holscott - Time Warner, Inc.","Thanks, Rich. Operator, we're ready for the next question.","Operator","Yes. That will be coming from the line of Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.","Benjamin Daniel Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks. Good morning. Just back on HBO. Howard, you mentioned mix shift being a headwind this year, and Richard mentioned you've already done some renewals. I'm just trying to understand, if we continue to see mix shift, which I think is largely AT&T moving its sub base from U-verse to Direct, but feel free to correct that assumption, is there any way to think about how big that headwind is as we head into the fourth quarter? You called out acceleration, but we just saw the business decelerate. So I'm trying to understand sort of the puts and takes around those moving pieces with HBO.","And then \u2013 at least I would expect AT&T's mix shift to continue well into next year. It's sort of in their best interest.","And then just on Turner, John, can you talk about the NBA, the new NBA contract, both the revenue opportunities from new games \u2013 additional games, other content you got, as well as the timing of the expense increases? I'd imagine it's weighted towards the playoffs next year, but maybe just any color you can give us on sort of how that flows through would be helpful.","Howard M. Averill - Time Warner, Inc.","Hey, Ben. It's Howard. So in terms of the sub mix, you know, as I mentioned, we did see the headwind in the quarter. And we did see a little bit of softness at some distributors. Those recently involved in M&A have had an impact, but we don't see any material change in terms of the trend on that as we look forward.","And we see, you know, what Richard described, some of those new deals and the fact that they'll be kicking in, that's going to have an impact that will \u2013 will exceed that as we look forward, particularly as we get into 2017.","Benjamin Daniel Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it.","John K. Martin - Time Warner, Inc.","Hey, Ben. It's John. Listen, with regards to the NBA, the fourth quarter, as I think Howard alluded to in his remarks, will be the first quarter that we'll begin to recognize the step-up in license fees. And it's one of the reasons why our programming costs will accelerate in the fourth quarter.","Just to take a half a step back, though, we've been saying for a number of years that at Turner our goal and our full expectation is to be able to manage our overall programming cost growth to be no higher than high-single digits over a multi-year period. It's been lower than that over the last several years. Next year, principally because of the NBA rights renewal, we expect programming costs to accelerate, and will likely be double-digits. But that's not going to be a sustainable trend. They'll moderate then after that.","And I think, yes, the way that the rights fees work, there will be a disproportionate amount recognized in the latter part of the season.","With regard to revenue opportunities, this deal is giving us more games. We are launching a Monday Night franchise as a result of that. We have more digital rights. We're working really collaboratively with the NBA to try to dramatically accelerate the digital part of the business and digital profits as we continue to see more and more consumption happening on NBA Digital.","So we \u2013 and by the way, just in the current environment, we're very pleased with how the season has started with what ratings look like, and inventory has been extremely tight and there's been huge demand for our NBA property. So I feel really good about advertising going into next year.","Benjamin Daniel Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you.","Jessica L. Holscott - Time Warner, Inc.","Thanks, Ben. I think we have time for two more questions. So operator, can you queue up the next one?","Operator","Yes. The next question will be coming from the line of Anthony DiClemente with Nomura.","Anthony DiClemente - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Thanks very much, and good morning. First for John or Jeff, you started down the road of addressable advertising at Turner. When you combine Turner's digital ad sales efforts with the subscriber and credit card data that AT&T has, what is that addressable advertising opportunity look like? Does that accelerate it? And how does it allow you potentially to compete with Facebook and Google in digital?","And then a question back to HBO just around long-term investment levels. You guys talked about investing significantly in HBO, programming costs being up double-digits next quarter. Netflix is going to spend over $5 billion this year, Amazon probably over $3.5 billion. I think HBO is on-track to spend roughly $2.2 billion this year, correct me if I'm wrong. But what's the right level of programming investment for HBO over the next couple of years? Do you need to ramp that spend more quickly? And how would the merger change that trajectory, if at all?","And then, sorry, just a quick follow-up on the merger. Maybe this is for Paul. I have a question about the reverse termination fee, the $500 million. There are some investors who think that relative to the deal value and given the regulatory risk here that the fee seems low. So I just want to understand how the Time Warner team got comfortable with that level for the fee. Thanks very much.","Jeff L. Bewkes - Time Warner, Inc.","A lot of questions. Paul, why don't you start with the \u2013 let me start with the regulatory fee, and Paul, you might want to add to it.","We're focused basically \u2013 both the sides, AT&T and us, want to get this done which is going to help accelerate both our businesses. We think the combined company it's going to have the competition spurring advantages and more choice. So if you read the deal, what you should focus on is that AT&T and we who have made very significant commitments to meet the conditions necessary if there are regulatory hurdles to close the deal. That's what we're focused on. We don't think it's very important what the size of the fee is, but Paul, do you want to add anything to that?","Paul T. Cappuccio - Time Warner, Inc.","Well no, I think that's right. I think the importance is, is that both sides signed up to really strong efforts to get this through and are committed to it. We also believe that this is a deal that is, in our view, plainly pro-competitive. It's not a concentration of anything. It's a vertical deal where there's competition at both levels of that vertical deal so there are no possible, in our view, vertical foreclosure arguments. So we feel very good about the deal being pro-competitive. We feel very good about what we've both signed up to do to get it through. And therefore, it was of significantly less importance to us what this hypothetical fee was.","Jeff L. Bewkes - Time Warner, Inc.","So let me jump from that into your question on advertising and competition. And, John, you'll want to bring real facts to it. But remember what you've got as a result of this is you're going to have more competition on the subscriber offering side. You'll have more packages and more, essentially distribution alternatives for consumers, and you're already seeing some new packages and even more affordable price points that are beginning to come out of this. So that's one on the subscriber side.","If you go to advertising, it's very important and, John, you can fill in more. But we're developing some innovative products already at Turner that focus on data analytics, targeting and return on investment for clients, so they can really value and measure what they're doing and what the results are.","If you combine the unparalleled region engagement of television with more ability in direct platform in terms \u2013 whether it's mobile, whether it's broadband-delivered, that can really give you a step up in the efficiency of advertising and the value of advertising. That has tremendous benefits for consumers because it can shift cost from subscription payment to advertising payment. It has great benefits for advertisers because it gives them more effective advertising. And it gives them more competition in advertising. I think we've all seen, and you all know this, an increase in concentration in digital advertising in just a couple of companies. And it's basically good for the market, consumers and advertising clients, if we have a broader number of competitors in the ad business, particularly the digital ad business. So, John, you want to add any specifics on Turner?","John K. Martin - Time Warner, Inc.","No. I don't think I could add anything to that.","Richard L. Plepler - Home Box Office, Inc.","Anthony, it's Richard. You asked about spend. Look, what we're trying to do is we're trying to curate the best content for the best value and make it as available to as many consumers as possible in as many ways as possible. So if you look at our split, first of all, this gets obscured a lot. We have four Hollywood movies studios which make up over 70% of viewing, 68% of on-demand viewing. It's a huge part of our offering. And if you continue to look at the usage, it goes up 92% for, example of HBO subscribers watch a movie at least once a month. When you then migrate over to original programming, I've said this before, it's absolutely true, more isn't better, only better is better. We're not trying to just spend money. We're trying to spend money thoughtfully to differentiate high-quality programming and build more consumers and build more addicts (55:30) across our subscriber base.","I like to think that our track record is pretty good at doing that over the last decade, and I think if you look out at our programming lineup going forward, you'll see that we have every confidence that we're going to continue to do that. So I like our mix, I like our investments, and I think what we're putting together in terms of a value proposition is extraordinary.","Anthony DiClemente - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Thank you very much.","Jessica L. Holscott - Time Warner, Inc.","Thanks, Anthony. I think we have \u2013 we have time for one more question, operator.","Operator","Thank you. That's coming from the line of Vasily Karasyov with CLSA. Please go ahead with your question.","Vasily Karasyov - CLSA Americas LLC","Thank you. Good morning. One quick question on your Hulu stake. What happens to the Hulu stake and your carriage agreements in light of the AT&T news? And then on TV Everywhere, Jeff, you've been a proponent and a supporter of that for a long time. What happens, do you think, to TV Everywhere aspect of video distribution when virtual bundles come out and hopefully gain traction? Do you think that that sort of attempt to improve the consumer experience is behind us now, and we all are hoping for virtual bundles?","Jeff L. Bewkes - Time Warner, Inc.","Yeah. Let me do Hulu and then that. Thanks for the question. So on Hulu, no change. We have a passive 10% investment. We don't think the merger here changes anything. So that's generally true of all our deals with all the other distribution packages and so forth.","On TV Everywhere, let's \u2013 if I could remember what that is, that's about more VOD and it's about better interfaces. And what we've had is we've had a kind of, I think we all know this. We've had not as fast an adoption by all the distribution platforms of full VOD offerings across all networks, good interface to find the network, easy authentication. This will help speed that up and it'll make yet another platform and interface available to all networks and therefore give a national offering for consumers increasing. I think it'll basically spur everybody, other networks, other distributors, to offer more VOD and better interfaces. And that's good for everybody.","Jessica L. Holscott - Time Warner, Inc.","Great.

[Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Doug Shapiro, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Shapiro, you may begin.","[Technical Difficulty]","Douglas Shapiro","Our 2012 business outlook. Before we begin, there are 2 items I need to cover. First, we refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Schedules setting out reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our earnings release and trending schedules. These reconciliations are available on our website at timewarner.com\/investors. Reconciliations of our expected future financial performance are also included in the business outlook release that's available on our site.","And second, today's announcement includes certain forward-looking statements which are based on management's current expectations. Actual results may vary materially from those expressed or implied by these statements due to various factors. These factors are discussed in detail in Time Warner's SEC filings, including its most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. Time Warner is under no obligation and, in fact, expressly disclaims any obligation to update or alter its forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.","Thanks. With that, let me turn the call over to Jeff.","Jeffrey L. Bewkes","Thanks, Doug. Good morning, everyone. Our first quarter results put us in a great position to achieve our financial goals for the year. We grew revenue 4%. We grew adjusted operating income 6%, and we grew adjusted EPS by 16%. And while these results were very good, they understate the strength of the fundamentals underlying our businesses.","Let me give you a sense of what I mean, starting with Turner where we're seeing great momentum at many of our networks. This quarter, TBS was up over 30% in prime time in adults 18 to 49, making it the #1 network on all cable for the first time in a decade.","The Big Bang Theory is performing fantastically. It was the #1 sitcom on cable this quarter, and it more than doubled the delivery in its timeslot. And it's helping to lift ratings across the schedule.","Conan, for instance, has grown viewership for each of the past 6 months and now outdelivers every other late-night talk show in adults 18 to 34. These ratings also provide a great platform from which to launch new originals. TBS will debut several scripted comedies this year: Men at Work later this month, Sullivan & Son in July and the Wedding Band in December. And we'll add unscripted originals starting early next year. Or consider truTV that just delivered its most-watched quarter ever for men 18 to 34, and it was a top 10 entertainment network in delivery of men 18 to 49.","Cartoon Network is also showing great momentum, driven by the popularity of shows like Adventure Time and Regular Show. And lately, it's one of the only kids' networks that's growing. During the quarter in which both of our major competitors declined, Cartoon's viewership among kids 6 to 11 grew 14%. And Cartoon's sister network, Adult Swim, is also posting great numbers. It, too, just completed its most-watched first quarter ever and, again, ranked #1 among all cable for delivery of young adults demos.","The one exception among our entertainment networks was TNT where, as we anticipated, ratings remained challenged in the quarter. Nevertheless, we're confident we'll see improvements starting next month. And by the back half of this year, we expect ratings to be up over last year.","In June, we'll have the first refresh of our prime time acquired programming on TNT in several years as we begin to strip The Mentalist. We'll also debut 4 new originals shows this summer: Dallas, The Great Escape, Perception and Major Crimes. And we'll bring back some of our highest-rated originals including Rizzoli & Isles and Falling Skies, plus the final episode of The Closer.","At the same time, we're continuing to see fantastic performance from our sports programming at TNT, TBS and tru. The NBA on TNT was up for the fifth straight year, making it the highest rated in the network's 28-year history with the league. It's now abundantly clear that the delayed season did not dampen fans' enthusiasm at all.","We're also extremely pleased with the NCAA men's basketball tournament, which has exceeded in every way the expectations we had when we signed the contract 2 years ago. In addition to strong ratings, we continue to see great demand from advertisers and very strong performance from our digital properties.","On our news networks, CNN faced extremely hard comparisons against the events in Japan and the Middle East in the first quarter last year. But that's the nature of the news cycle. Propelled by its brand and global newsgathering capabilities, CNN is still the place where more viewers turn when there's hard news. That was evidenced this quarter when CNN was #1 among 18 to 34s on primary nights. And HLN was the only cable news network to see growth in prime time compared with the first quarter of 2011. It was up 7% over last year.","So overall, we feel really good about the momentum we're seeing across Turner's Networks. That underscores the value that we provide to viewers, advertisers and our affiliates. It puts us in a great position as we head into the upfront, and it gives us great confidence as we enter our next cycle of affiliate negotiations at Turner.","Over the next few years, we'll negotiate tariff renewals for all of our networks, with almost all of our affiliates. We have a number of renewals set for next year, and we will just about finish the process by the end of 2016. We believe strongly that many of our brands are substantially undervalued today. In this next round of affiliate negotiations, we will be very aggressive and correct that. So as we look out to 2014 and beyond, we expect Turner's domestic affiliate fees to grow at a considerably higher rate than they have during the past several years.","I'll turn now to HBO where we're also seeing incredible momentum with our content. In recent quarters, I've said that HBO's programming is arguably better today than it's ever been. I'd like to retract that statement. Now, there's no argument. We just debuted the second season of Game of Thrones to fantastic ratings. This year, the series is averaging over 11 million viewers. That's compared to a little over 9 million on average for the first season. And that makes it the third most popular show ever on HBO, behind only The Sopranos and True Blood.","We're also very excited by a trio of new shows on HBO. Girls from Lena Dunham and VEEP with Julia Louis-Dreyfus are generating tremendous spots. And in June, we'll debut The Newsroom from Aaron Sorkin.","During the quarter, we accelerated the rollout of HBO GO. HBO GO is now available to virtually all of the domestic HBO sub base. We also launched on Microsoft's Xbox and on Samsung connected TVs, and we'll be announcing additional platform launches in the next few months.","Until now, the vast majority of users have accessed GO online or on tablets or mobile devices. We expect to see even higher usage as it becomes widely accessible on connected TVs. And while it's still early days, we're seeing encouraging signs that HBO GO will have a significant positive impact on our business over time.","Consumers using GO are watching HBO more than the they used to, and 93% say GO makes them more loyal to HBO. A second part to the consumer excitement around GO, we're also seeing a bigger marketing push from many of our affiliates. And in fact, HBO is now better positioned and promoted than it has been in years.","Now I'll shift to Warner Bros., which is also on a roll. As we've discussed with you before, our TV Production business had a great 2011-2012 season. In addition to strong performances from some of our previous returning shows like The Big Bang Theory, Two and a Half Men, The Voice, Mike & Molly and The Mentalist, we also produced the #1 new comedy of the season, 2 Broke Girls, and the #2 new drama, Person of Interest. So we'll have an extremely strong slate of returning shows heading into the fall.","And while it's a little early to make predictions, we are in as strong a position as ever heading into this year's pilot season. We also saw solid performances from our film slate this quarter. Journey 2: The Mysterious Island and Project X handily exceeded our expectations. Notably, both Journey 2 and Sherlock Holmes: Game of Shadows surpassed their predecessors at the global box office, which is yet more evidence of Warner's skill at managing film franchises. And while Wrath of the Titans didn't perform as well as we'd hope domestically, it's doing very well internationally.","Looking out over the course of the rest of the year, we're really excited about our slate and several big releases in particular. Next week, we'll premiere Dark Shadows with Johnny Depp from Tim Burton. And of course, later in the year, we'll release 2 of the most hotly anticipated films of 2012: The Dark Knight Rises and the first installment of The Hobbit.","So summing up, it's early in the year, but we're off to a great start. The underlying fundamentals of nearly all our businesses are getting stronger. That makes us even more confident that we'll achieve our financial goals in 2012 and continue to post attractive growth in the coming years.","With that, I'll hand it off to John.","John K. Martin","Thanks, Jeff, and good morning. During my remarks, I'll refer to a presentation that is now available on our website. The first slide shows the highlights from the quarter.","Coming into this year, we set a goal to deliver double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth again. With 16% growth in the first quarter, we're obviously off to a great start. And as Jeff highlighted, we're seeing momentum across almost all of our businesses, which makes us even more confident that we'll be able to maintain attractive levels of growth this year and into the foreseeable future.","During the first quarter, revenues were up 4%, which was a result of growth across all major sources of revenues. Adjusted operating income grew 6% and margins moved up modestly despite a $35 million impairment associated with the cancellation of the HBO series, Luck. We were able to do that due to continued cost controls across our businesses, including holding SG&A costs flat year-over-year.","Moving down the P&L, adjusted earnings per share rose 16%. Please note that our tax provision this quarter included a nearly $30 million reserve related to a potential resolution of a tax dispute. So the effective tax rate was higher this quarter than it has been previously. Going forward, we continue to expect that our effective tax rate should remain somewhere around 35%.","Growth in adjusted EPS was helped by our ongoing share repurchase program, which underscores our continued commitment to provide direct returns to shareholders. During the quarter, we repurchased about $730 million of our shares, and we paid over $250 million in dividends.","So with all that said, we're very much on track to meet our financial goals for the year. And this morning, we reaffirmed our full year outlook for low double-digit growth in adjusted EPS in 2012.","So let me move on to a discussion of our business segments, and let me begin at Networks where overall growth rates were somewhat modest in the first quarter. But underneath that, Turner was up double-digits year-over-year in adjusted operating income, and margins were up 200 basis points. And that was partially offset by a year-over-year decline at HBO, which had difficult comparisons to the second-cycle domestic cable syndication of Sex and the City last year, as well as the impairment that I just mentioned.","Subscription revenues at the Networks segment grew in the mid-single digits, which was driven by higher domestic rates at both Turner and HBO. Turning to advertising. Revenues were up 6% year-over-year, and that's a little bit better than we expected when we were coming into the quarter.","There were some items affecting growth in both directions in the quarter. But if you look through those core domestic growth rates, we're pretty close to the 6% that we reported. For instance, as we've discussed with you before, due to the NBA lockout, we haven't been able to monetize the NBA games at the same level this year as we did last year. So that hurt growth somewhat in the quarter, but that was offset by the timing of a couple of NCAA tournament games, as well as the timing of when Easter hit this year.","Moving over to international. International revenues grew mid-single digits, and that would have been up double digits if it weren't for the year-over-year negative impact related to Imagine, which is our general entertainment network in India, as well as unfavorable foreign exchange rates.","As you may have seen, this quarter, we've decided to shut down Imagine. We're having great success in many international territories and, including our HBO joint ventures, we still expect our international networks business to generate $1 billion in adjusted operating income by 2014.  We're also launching new networks where we see opportunities like HBO Netherlands. But Imagine was not succeeding, so we decided to redirect resources elsewhere. Keep in mind that although we were losing a lot of money at Imagine, it generated about $30 million in advertising revenue over the trailing 4 quarters. So shutting it down will actually improve profitability, but it will be a drag of 50 to 100 basis points per quarter on ad revenue growth for the next year.","Looking to the second quarter, the domestic scatter environment looks pretty steady. We're seeing double-digit price increases over the upfront and very strong demand for our sports properties. And while it's still early, solid pricing and low cancellations are positive indicators for this year's upfront.","Setting aside a number of items, advertising growth in Q2 should be as high or higher than the 6% pace we reported in the first quarter. But reported ad growth will likely be somewhat lower. The timing of NCAA games and Easter this year and the shutdown of Imagine will both be a drag in the second quarter.","In addition, in line with our announcement last November, this quarter management of our digital sports properties, including SI.com and Golf.com shifted back over to Time Inc. And that will be a drag on Networks ad growth of about 100 basis points in each of the next 4 quarters in our Networks division. But, of course, that revenue will be recognized at Publishing, so there's no impact to the overall company.","Notwithstanding any quarterly fluctuations in reported ad growth, we feel good about the trajectory of our networks, and we're optimistic that this year's upfront, improved ratings at TNT and the U.S. presidential election will help our performance in the back half of the year.","Adjusted operating income was up 3% in the quarter, which included the impairment for Luck. Excluding that, programming expenses would have been up less than 4% in the quarter and margins would have climbed over last year. And I'll point out that despite the impairment, we still expect to grow adjusted operating income at the Networks segment at a faster rate in 2012 than we did in 2011.","Turning now to film and TV. Warner Bros. has had another great start to a year, with adjusted operating income up almost 40% year-over-year. The increase in adjusted operating income was largely due to growing demand for our television product as evidenced by mid-teens TV growth. That came from both higher television license fees and increased SVOD revenues. And as Jeff described, we're in a great position to drive continued growth from our TV business going forward.","Theatrically, we saw very strong performances from both Journey 2: The Mysterious Island and Project X, and we benefited from the carryover from the fourth quarter release of Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows. Notably, both Sherlock and Journey 2 outperformed the first film in their respective franchises.","So as we look to the rest of the year despite difficult year-over-year comparisons in terms of financial performance, we remain very, very confident that 2012 will be one of the highest years in terms of profitability in Warner Bros.' history.","On to Publishing where both the first quarter revenues and adjusted operating income were down year-over-year. Advertising revenues declined 5% due to softness in domestic magazine advertising. Subscription revenues were down slightly as we continue to see softness in domestic and international newsstand. So with lower revenue, adjusted operating income was down $24 million year-over-year in the quarter.","Looking ahead, we have not seen any material change in the underlying trends for either subscriptions or ad revenue. However, the comparisons are particularly difficult in the second quarter. Recall that last year's second quarter was the only quarter during the year where revenues grew year-over-year.","So given the current revenue environment, we'll obviously be placing continued focus on cost controls here for the remainder of the year. And because of this, as well as easier revenue comparisons in the second half, we expect adjusted operating income growth trends to improve as the year progresses, especially in the back half of the year.","Moving on, the next slide shows our 2012 financial outlook. As I noted earlier, we're off to a great start, and we're on track to deliver another year of double-digit growth in adjusted earnings per share. As we do from time to time, I wanted to offer some perspective as to how the growth will likely come in over the rest of the year.","In terms of progression, our results should be weighted towards the back half of the year and, in particular, the fourth quarter. The second quarter could be somewhat challenged from a year-over-year growth standpoint, and that's a function of a significant intersegment elimination from the Warner Bros. sale of The Mentalist to Turner, as well as continuing challenges at Publishing. Likewise, our film and TV comparisons will be difficult in the third quarter due to last year's syndication sale of Big Bang Theory and the theatrical release of the last Harry Potter film. So both film and TV profitability, as well as overall company growth, will be heavily weighted toward the fourth quarter. This progression is pretty much what we expected as we entered the year. So we feel pretty good about how things are continuing to shape up.","Turning to the next slide, which looks at free cash flow. We generated nearly $320 million of free cash in the quarter. That's down from a year ago, principally due to higher use of working capital. And that was due primarily just to timing related to programming payments at the Networks, as well as higher cash taxes.","As we noted during last earnings, in 2012, we expect to convert about a similar amount of our adjusted OIBDA into free cash. We expect to convert a similar amount this year as we did a year ago.","And on the final slide, which looks at our net debt, we ended the first quarter with $16.6 billion in net debt. That's up about $600 million compared to just the end of last year, and that's due almost entirely to our continued returns to shareholders. We returned almost $1 billion during the quarter, including, as I mentioned earlier, around $730 million in share repurchases.","We've maintained our leverage ratio at around 2.4x, and that's close to our target of 2.5x. So no changes there. And we still believe that 2.5x strikes the right balance of maintaining balance sheet strength while allowing us to continue to invest in our businesses, make acquisitions and return capital to shareholders.","So thank you for listening. And now let me turn the call back over to Doug where we're going to start the Q&A portion. Thanks.","Douglas Shapiro","All right. Thanks, John. Hilda, let's get the Q&A started. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Spencer Wang from Credit Suisse.","Spencer Wang - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Two questions if I could. First, Jeff, you mentioned you're optimistic about the upfront. I was wondering if you could just maybe talk a little bit about where you think pricing could possibly go and also sellout this year versus last. And then the second question. You guys are about 6 months into the rollout of UltraViolet. So, Jeff, I was wondering if you could just share with us your assessment of the rollout so far? And would you contemplate any changes in the home video business with respect to Windows or pricing of EST.","Jeffrey L. Bewkes","All right, Spencer. On the upfront, basically, it's looking pretty good. Cancellations are low, and scatter pricing is solidly above the upfront. Historically, those are good signs. And if you just think through our Networks, we've got very good momentum. TBS is the #1 cable network in prime time. TNT is about to launch a significant refresh of its programming. truTV and Adult Swim continue to grow with tough-to-reach demos. It really -- both of them are places where it's hard to reach the audience that watch them -- watches them. CNN is going to benefit from the election. And remember, CNN has the widest reach. More people tune in to CNN than any other news network. And Cartoon Network is taking significant viewing share from its competition, probably because a lot of competing cartoon and kids networks have their shows elsewhere, not just on their networks. They're on SVOD services. So I think we're really well positioned. And whatever happens in the upfront generally, we're going to get our fair share or more than that. So we feel very good about that. On UltraViolet, basically, we're happy with the launch. We think it's a big accomplishment for the industry, and it was something that we had tried to do and see if a lot of others would join up. And we think UltraViolet offers a compelling ease-of-use way to access your movies from the cloud and on whatever device you want to use. It's still early, but consumers are downloading and streaming in very large numbers. Just a couple of data points. More than 2 million accounts have been created, and over 5,000 titles are available. It took 5 months for the first million registrations and then we added 1 million more in the last 4 weeks. So at this point, other studios are releasing in UV, not just Warner. Universal, Sony and Paramount have done that. Both Wal-Mart and Amazon are now supporting UltraViolet, and we think other retailers will follow. And we think it's going to be more compelling as more companies and consumers participate. The question that I think you ended up with is, is it at the right price? We think the first step is to continue to make electronic sell-through product easy to use, easy to get, easy to understand, not intimidating for people to buy. We don't set the prices, but we're going to work with our retail partners who have every interest in making this successful and setting the right price that really satisfies consumers.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Nathanson from Nomura.","Michael Nathanson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","I have one for Jeff. And then, John, just a housekeeping. So for Jeff, over the past couple of years, you've been very, very adamant in saying that when the syndicated shows go into an online streaming model, they have -- the sprockets run off of them, which hurts the long-term shelf value. So I wonder now that we had some time, and maybe some other people have different models out there about selling stuff into SVOD, I wonder if your thinking has changed about that, to what shows can be sold in and what happens to the value in SVOD.","Jeffrey L. Bewkes","Yes. As a starting point, we want to reiterate that we think, and we have all along, that there's clearly a role for SVOD in the ecosystem. And we are more than happy to work with SVOD companies to license our content. That's what we've been doing. But to your more precise question, which content should we license, what content is going to be optimized through SVOD licensing, our overarching goal, as we've always said, is simply to maximize the lifetime value of the content. And so let's go through what kind of things belong where. For the shows that are likely to have multiple cycles, one consideration is the potential impact of SVOD on the value of subsequent cycles. So, of course, if you've got something up on SVOD that runs the sprockets off, you're going to erode the value for those kinds of shows that have second and third cycle syndication. And as we all know, some of those big shows have huge second and third cycle values. So let's take an example like Big Bang Theory, which on -- look, we're not saying categorically, but it's unlikely if you look at the prospects for Big Bang Theory that it's going to go to an SVOD service at least anytime soon for a number of reasons. It obviously is commanding very high license fees from traditional networks and stations who want exclusive rights for those exhibitions. There is a very large barter component to that, which, of course, doesn't exist on SVOD as a source of monetization. And so in that case, trying to balance the value of later cycles. For older content that has either already gone through several cycles or for shows that are serialized -- they, therefore, don't have multiple cycles and they work better for viewers on a VOD basis -- serialized dramas would be a pretty good example. That's really not a concern, and those are the kind of things that you can be more efficient with when you put them on SVOD. We had -- for example, let's take The CW deal that we did, which was an SVOD sale to Netflix. And those shows had more efficient and higher value in an SVOD service, with a little earlier availability than we thought we could get in traditional syndicated buyers. So it really depends on the nature of the programming. And what's emerging, as we always thought it would, is basically an efficient market where the addition of SVOD makes content more valuable and where, last point, to quote traditional networks that used to buy syndicated products and you thought that all that was, was going to be available on a once-a-week or twice-a-week schedule, remember, all the traditional syndicated buyers, particularly cable networks, are now putting that product, think of the Big Bang Theory, on VOD given TV Everywhere. So you can watch it on TBS, multiple episodes.","John K. Martin","And, Michael, I'm sorry. He didn't ask the question or he did? Did you -- you said you had a question on...","Michael Nathanson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","No, I was going to say, John, could you just tell us how much Imagine lost last year? Have you seen seasonality to the losses?","John K. Martin","The losses last year for Imagine were around $70 million. We lost around $10 million in Q1. I don't remember the exact seasonality as we progressed through the year, but I think the losses grew bigger in the back half. But I don't remember exactly quarter-by-quarter. But in total, $70 million.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ben Swinburne from Morgan Stanley.","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Jeff, I wanted to ask you 2 questions. One, just back to your prior comment on the kids market. And there's a lot of debate out there about the role of kids programming online versus in a linear format. And I'm curious if you think the decision by Nick, Nickelodeon to put content online has, at all, hurt cartoon or the overall ecosystem by just drawing  eyeballs away. And then on HBO, sort of an unrelated question, I've always heard that as you move towards more on-demand consumption, whether it's GO or SVOD on HBO, that the viewing shifts more to originals and away from film content. And I'm wondering if that's still true. And if it is, would you consider shifting more of your investment capital away from output deals to originals, which actually could, in theory, drive some margins at HBO?","Jeffrey L. Bewkes","Yes. First question, do we think that having -- and you asked it in the case of kids. If you look at viewing in cable, cable actually continued to take share from broadcast. That's particularly true if you look in prime time. It was less clear in total day, and we think that the kind of last trend in cable viewing in total day was in kids viewing, when kids viewing went to SVOD rather than to watching the cable networks. Now Cartoon Network was up 14%. So we didn't have that problem, and we think part of the reason is that we don't have our program sitting on an SVOD service where parents can park their kids in front of an SVOD. And obviously, that's taking some viewing away from some of the other animated channels, which -- not ours, but theirs probably for that reason. We think the same thing if you don't ask in an animated and you look at regular TV programming. The more that it shows up on demand, on TNT and USA and CBS, and the less that it shows up on on-demand services with 100 episodes sitting there with a low commercial load, the more you're going to see the same thing. And that's why we -- our ratings for our shows and our kind of sales and rentals for TV shows that we then put out into the aftermarket do better so long as they're not overexposed someplace else. If you go to HBO, to your question, yes. When people use on-demand, they do use it for movies at HBO. And HBO has a really strong movie lineup that -- it's superior to any other pay TV network. But HBO also has an even greater advantage in terms of the depth and quality of its original series versus other pay TV. And so what happens in on-demand is people go and catch up and watch those series. So there is more original programming viewing in on-demand then there would be slightly. And it'll probably increase because HBO is in the process right now, as we said, of dramatically increasing the number of original series on HBO. What that leads to, to your question, should we -- would we want to drop a studio? We've said very clearly that the advantage HBO has, given the fairly large throw weight advantage we've got in movie deals and the large advantage in original series, that we have the luxury of choice of whether we want to drop a studio. And we're essentially going to evaluate that. First and foremost, for the power of our networks domestically and worldwide, because our originals fuel the worldwide business in HBO, not just the 40 million subs in America but 60 million-plus worldwide that are growing rapidly, that obviously lends to originals. And then the second consideration will just be economics. Is it worth it to us to spend whatever we decide to spend on theatrical films?","Operator","Our next question comes from Anthony DiClemente from Barclays.","Anthony J. DiClemente - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I have one for Jeff and one for John. First, Jeff, for films that have exited the post -- have exited the pay TV window. So they're being marketed on your online distributors like iTunes, like Amazon. I'm wondering if you see an acceleration at all of volume of electronic rentals given, really, in terms of rental market, you have so many more points of purchase in a digital world than you did in the old Blockbuster days. And then secondly, for John, it might be helpful, just given conversation around your affiliate fee renewals, to get some color on the cadence of those renewals? One of the -- when are the bulk of your Turner deals coming up for renewal? And maybe, could you even just talk a little bit about the drivers of your potential rights fee increases?","Jeffrey L. Bewkes","Yes, that -- okay, I didn't understand the first -- You're asking what about electronic? Rental or...","Anthony J. DiClemente - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Yes, I'm just asking about really the split between -- within electronic sell-through, the split between ownership and rental. It seems like in a mobile tablet world, the consumer with all this content having the ability to be stored in the cloud might choose to rent as opposed to own more so. And I understand the economics aren't as good as the sell-through market, but maybe you make it up on volume because you've got so many hundreds of millions of mobile devices out there. And maybe that's what happens because of all the incremental touch points as opposed to a finite number of rental video stores back in the old days.","Jeffrey L. Bewkes","Okay, now I understand. Yes. Well, passing VOD, the statement we made which is true, that electronic sell-through was quite robust this quarter, and going to your point, why would consumers want to buy something if rental and availability of films gets more easy, so they don't need to own it.  It's a good question. It's going to have some -- it will depend on how easy it is to, when you own something, a film, to management -- to manage it, get access to it and think that it's important for you to have it that way. It'll depend on the price, as I think your question implies. And basically, then you get to the habit that people have had where they have, whether it's in books, music, TV shows or films, there is a tendency for people to collect and to want to own and have available. And as you -- whatever the movie is. Even if you say to yourself, as your question implies, \"Well, why do I need to own it? I can get it anytime.\" Although there is a kind of an emotional reaction that if I'm going to have to rent it every time and cost me, I'd rather own it. So you get back to that really trade off in people's minds, the ease of having it on the shelf. Now, on the shelf means in the cloud, the ease of being able to give it to your kids 8x. It kind of depends on the genre. There are plenty of genres you can imagine. Animated for young kids is one, comedies for -- 10s, 20s and 30s is another one where people watch them over and over. And so they don't want to rent them, they want to own them. And then there's some kind of things they love that could be dramas or big epics where they really want to own that and have it in their home. So I think it's going to evolve. If you look for data points, to your question, and look at iTunes, which is obviously electronic sale and rental, 60% of the money is still purchase versus rental. Similar to what we had in physical. But we're not saying to you that we know the -- I think your question is an intelligent one. I don't mean to say that patronizingly. We all have the same question, where is this going to go? If we make the ownership realities for our average consumer easy and rewarding, and if rental continues to get better and easy to use, right now rental is easy to use than ownership, we'll just have to see it unfold. And I think pricing -- to the extent that there's pressure on ownership, if pricing moves to motivate ownership, then I think your question's exactly right, where the volume makes up for whatever price adjustment needs to occur.","John K. Martin","It's John. Let me to provide a little bit more context for -- I think you used the word cadence as it relates to our affiliate renewal cycle. But obviously, I'm going to have to fall short of providing a tremendous amount of transparency because we have confidentiality provisions around most, if not all, of our agreements. If you look at -- we've already been in the market, and we've done some deals as it relates to those networks that are covering March Madness. And what we have seen, by virtue of having done those deals, is it's only underscored and increased our confidence in our ability to get the type of rate increases that we think bring TBS, TNT and truTV up closer to fair value. And we have every intention to try to drive rate aggressively to get fair value over time. The majority of those rate renewals will come into effect -- well, they'll all be in effect before the end of 2016, but they'll be on the first material step-up beginning in 2014. If you look at Turner in total this year, there aren't any major contract renewals. Next year, there are certain contract renewals for Networks, including CNN and Cartoon Network. And we feel confident in our ability to drive rate there as well. So I think we are very, very confident in the long term affiliate fee outlook that we've got the pricing increases that we've been able to garner. And recent deals have only underscored our confidence, and they've all been at much higher rates than we've gotten in the most recent rate renewal cycles, if that makes sense. In other words, the increases -- yes, the rate increases that we're getting now are higher than the rate increases that we got before. And we have every intention to try to get our networks closer to where we believe fair value is going forward.","Operator","Our next question comes from Richard Greenfield from BTIG.","Richard Greenfield - BTIG, LLC, Research Division","Your sub fee growth in the quarter was 5%. You've answered a couple of questions talking about the growth that's going to come from renewals. But also wondering, historically, one of the biggest drivers for all of the cable network industry has been new distributors. And wondering how you think about the evolution of new distributors over the next few years. There's the prospect we're hearing more and more of people talking about non-facilities-based distributors, these so-called virtual MVPDs. If people come to you and want to license all of your channels and pay you at the top end of your rate card, how do you feel about that risks, rewards.  How do you think about what that could do above and beyond the accelerations you're going to get from the core renewals you talked earlier about?","Jeffrey L. Bewkes","Well, there are many aspiring entities that do come forth and we want to offer that. And we do talk with them in detail and as constructive a way as we can. We're willing to look at anything that makes sense provided that it, in fact, does provide long-term sustainable distribution. And one of the major issues when you evaluate that is number one, are the economics additive? I think you said it well when you said, look, those people, in order to win programming rights from established well-distributed networks, are going to try to offer wholesale money that is at the top end of what goes on right now in the industry. But the question for whether they're going to be able to pay that is whether offering consumers anything that's really valuable to consumers and whether they're going to be able to deliver quality transmission of network programming. Think of it high-def, think of it on-demand and what that takes, and how they're going to do that over the distribution plan. So we're all looking at that as are the existing distributors. Whether it's cable operators, the telcos, DirecTV and DISH, all trying to figure out how to continue to move forward, offering consumers the kinds of packages that they want, whether it's over the traditional video broadcasting that they've used or over Internet protocol. So it's an open subject. Right now, we don't see -- we haven't seen any particularly viable \"virtual MSOs\" that would appear to us to have a sustainable ability to deliver a benefit to consumers. But if we see one of those, then we would be open to figuring out whether that would work on a long-term basis.","Richard Greenfield - BTIG, LLC, Research Division","And then could I just follow up on Hulu? How do you think a Hulu-authenticated model could work for you?","Jeffrey L. Bewkes","Well, we think Hulu authenticating makes sense. We think the authenticating of -- the authentication of the programming inside Hulu, which is basically nbc.com, fox.com, abc.com make sense also, obviously because they're trying to strengthen their economic base by adding a carriage fee. And so if that's -- it's perfectly consistent with having a carriage fee to have the programming available on demand but in an authenticated way, whether it's on nbc.com or fox.com or whether it's on Hulu, which is the aggregation of those. We think Hulu's heading in the right direction now, and it might be useful -- continue to be viable.","Operator","Our next question comes from Vasily Karasyov from Susquehanna Financial Group.","Vasily Karasyov - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","One quick one for John. John, what would advertising revenue growth in the quarter be if TNT ratings didn't decline? And then one for Jeff. Jeff, you spoke pretty often about how there is a gap between general entertainment, cable networks, CPM and broadcast networks. And I was wondering if you could tell us if you see that gap contracting over the past couple of years and if there is still an opportunity for further contraction? And would it be easier for you now to drive pricing, now that TBS rating has stabilized and hopefully, TNT will stabilize soon?","John K. Martin","Actually -- it's John. Let me try to address your question, although I'm not exactly sure how to answer it. Clearly, if TNT's ratings were higher, our ad revenues would be higher. We'd be delivering greater gross rating points, and we'd be monetizing our inventory at higher levels. I'm not going to try to characterize to you exactly the materiality of that because I think, in some respects, and we've talked about this before, over any near term and even medium term, the correlation between ratings and ad revenues isn't always perfectly correlated. So there's lots and lots of things that go into the determination of ad revenues, and it has to do with yield managements, sponsorships, mix of inventory, type of demographics that the networks are delivering. But overall, it's clearly a drag on ad revenues, and we would anticipate our ad revenue pacings to improve as we progress throughout the year in line or trend-wise with the stabilization and hopefully, improvement with TNT's ratings.","Jeffrey L. Bewkes","And I think you asked about what is the difference in price for CPM between cable and broadcast?","Vasily Karasyov - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Correct.","Jeffrey L. Bewkes","On what it was contracting? It has been contracting very gradually over the last 3 or 4 years. We think it's -- we see it continuing. But it still is 20 or more percent, depending on the data point.","John K. Martin","I think it also -- just add a little bit there, there are certain elements of programming where the CPMs are essentially at parity now. But there are certain elements of programming, particularly scripted originals in prime where the premium that broadcast garners is materially higher than what cable is getting. So there's a real opportunity to continue to drive that gap narrowing.","Operator","The next question comes from Doug Mitchelson from Deutsche Bank.","Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Two jump ball questions for Jeff and John. First, should investors consider that timing -- taking back control of its online properties from the Networks group anyway makes it easier to undertake strategic actions with that segment? And then on HBO, with content better than ever, how should we think about the impact on profitability over time from the strong original content lineup? Is that something that directly drives 2012 EBITDA growth? Should we think about a delayed impact because we have to wait for syndication sales maybe in '13? Or are you actually reinvesting the increased value and it's really a longer-term EBITDA impact? That'd be helpful.","Jeffrey L. Bewkes","First of all, what we did in the online side of Turner and SI in sports, we had an idea that we could combine the Turner digital sports properties, which potentially exhibit, say, basketball, baseball, et cetera, kinds of things. With the Sports Illustrated site, which draws a lot of viewing to analysis and readership, coverage of every sport, what we found is we just weren't achieving much benefit because the synergy really is between the online and tablet and mobile platforms for SI articles and coverage with the magazine readership. And in the -- and it's not really with, let's say, a baseball game or a basketball game on Turner and exhibition. So we essentially went back to synergizing across the SI platform, print and digital, and the same thing in Turner Sports. None of that would have made or does make any difference in how we -- it's not material enough to change how we think about the operations of either Turner or Publishing in case we wanted to do something and allot one of them with somebody else. I would Just say, on that point, we think Publishing -- and we have a lead position in Publishing. It's a very good business that is core to us. It's got a pretty good return now. It's coming back up. The return on capital, if you exclude purchase price, is now back up into the mid-teens. So it's well ahead of its cost of capital. And while we are right now -- and it's a high cash flow generator. Right now, the whole publishing industry is facing kind of a stall in revenue. So it's not a good situation in the short run. But in the long run, we think there's quite a lot of upside in digital distribution of our publishing position, which is a -- we have a very strong lead position across a lot of areas in publishing. If you go to the HBO question, I think it's -- having a continuing increase in hit original programming and basically maintaining, as I think we do, the whip hand in access to theatrical films in their earliest window after home video puts HBO as a subscription VOD service in the strongest position worldwide. And as we now have a go on GO, in other words, it's available over Internet delivery, it's increasingly available on that basis all over the world, you're going to see obviously, therefore, support in subscription revenue, support and increases in content revenue. Your question asked, or predicted the answer, when you make hit series, think of Game of Thrones right now, True Blood, et cetera, we're going to optimize the value. First, they go across our subscription networks worldwide and then we sell them when we think the time is right as either an electronic sale or a physical DVD sale. And those things are going to be pretty considerable because we have a pretty big backlog of successful series that haven't yet hit the revenue line or the profit line in HBO. So yes, it's coming. It's going to be a steady robust business from now on out.","John K. Martin","So just to give a sense because you were asking specific timing as well, if you think about 2012 HBO, go back to what I said in my prepared remarks.  At HBO, our operating income growth is going to accelerate this year compared to last year. And as you look out over the next 9 months, content revenue is going to be up versus the 9 months from a year ago. So to underscore what Jeff said, we're building assets, and we're building assets that -- at a deeper pipeline that we're going to be able to monetize in numerous ways going forward. And the content revenue line is an important line.","Operator","The next question comes from Barton Crockett from Lazard Capital Markets.","Barton E. Crockett - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","I was interested in the discussion in Filmed Entertainment that revenue growth was partly attributable to subscription video on demand availability of television series. I was wondering if you could characterize to some degree the materiality of that? And tell us whether, to some degree, that was related to kind of The CW Netflix deal, and give us some sense of how material that might be for you guys going forward over the balance of the year.","John K. Martin","We had recognized in the quarter, we had about $75 million of SVOD money. And based on the deals that we've already got to date, that we've already contracted to date, we would anticipate this year 2012 to recognize somewhere in the area of about $200 million. And we've got constructive discussions ongoing with numerous other parties as more and more entrants seem to be interested in acquiring the types of shows that we have. So we've got a couple of hundred million dollars that we'll recognize to date. But we would assume that, that number's probably going to go up.","Barton E. Crockett - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","And can you describe to us how we should think about the margin impact of those revenues as they come in?","John K. Martin","It's high.","Jeffrey L. Bewkes","Yes, no cost. Yes.","John K. Martin","Well, it depends on the deal. But generally speaking, considerably, considerably higher than the margin that we're -- that is the average margin for the overall segment, which is in low teens.","Operator","The next question is from David Miller from Caris & Company.","David W. Miller - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division","Jeff, another follow-up question about UltraViolet. I know you mentioned price as an issue, but as I understand it, and just correct me if I'm wrong here, there's just a number of kinks that just need to be ironed out here. I mean, I don't believe you have one set-top box or game console yet supporting the service, and the software -- and please correct me if I'm wrong, that the software which is supposed to power the concept has proven largely ineffective on certain PC models. There's also the iTunes element. What are you guys doing to kind of iron out those kinks? And I know you mentioned that price is still an issue, and I know you answered that first question.","Jeffrey L. Bewkes","Well, if you would give me your address, I'll come to your house and I'll wire up all those devices. Sorry to joke about it, but you\u2019re on to a good question, which is -- look, we -- you got -- we're the studios that own the content. We're setting up a template that makes it easier for every kind of device maker, interface maker, software runner and retailer from Wal-Mart to Target, et cetera, to support and line up with getting you exactly and every consumer the kind of on-site unscrambling of the wires that we all know is life in the 21st century. So I think when you have everyone aligned in an offering, then those problems will get solved. And I think those are important problems to solve. It's early in the -- it's early. This is 1.0, I guess we would say. So the content is there. Now the interface companies or functions with real people have to take place. So that's step 2, and that's what's happening this year. And I think that'll pick up speed. Because consumers are going to love this, and they're going to demand that they get solutions to those at-home problems.","Douglas Shapiro","All right. Thanks, everybody, for dialing in. Sorry about that technical glitch at the beginning, and we'll talk to you soon.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference.

[Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Doug Shapiro, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations at Time Warner. Mr. Shapiro, you may begin.","Douglas Shapiro","Thanks, and good morning, everyone. This morning, we issued 2 press releases, 1 detailing our results for the second quarter and the other raising our 2013 business outlook.","Before we begin, there are a few things I need to cover. First, we refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Schedules setting out reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our earnings release and trending schedules. These reconciliations are available on our website at timewarner.com\/investors. Reconciliations of our expected future financial performance are also included in the business outlook release that's available on our site. Second, today's announcement includes certain forward-looking statements, which are based on management's current expectations. Actual results may vary materially from those expressed or implied by these statements due to various factors. These factors are discussed in detail in Time Warner's SEC filings, including its most recent annual report on Form 10-K and the subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. Time Warner is under no obligation and, in fact, expressly disclaims any obligation to update or alter its forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.","And lastly, in the second quarter, we began accounting for investment in Central European Media Enterprises as an equity investment. Due to the accounting rules, we have recast our historical financials as though we had accounted for it as an equity investment since we first invested in CME in May 2009. Because CME has historically produced net losses, this accounting change reduced full year 2012 adjusted EPS by $0.04 and our first quarter 2013 adjusted EPS by $0.06. In the second quarter, the impact was a $0.02 reduction.","Thank you, and let me turn the call over to Jeff.","Jeffrey L. Bewkes","Thanks, Doug. This was another really successful quarter for us, financially and operationally. It puts us in great position to post another year of strong growth in 2013 and beyond. In the second quarter, we grew revenue of 10%, we grew adjusted operating income 25% and we increased adjusted earnings per share almost 50%. During the first half of the year, we also generated $1.8 billion in free cash flow. That's triple the amount we generated in the first half of last year. And over the last few months, we bought back almost another $1 billion worth of our stock.","This morning, we also increased our guidance for adjusted EPS growth this year. That's a reflection of our performance in the first half and our confidence about how we're positioned for the rest of the year. John will discuss our financial results and outlook in detail in a few minutes.","I'd like to point out some of our key operational highlights this quarter, starting with the networks. At Turner, we saw a continuing evidence of the growing value of our brands and programming to our viewers, our advertisers and our affiliates. TNT and TBS finished the quarter as the #1 and the #3 networks in prime time for adults 18 to 49 on all of cable. At TNT, the story again was sports and originals. The NBA playoffs on TNT were the third most viewed in the 29-year history of the NBA on Turner, outdelivering all networks, broadcast and cable, among adults 18 to 49 during May sweeps.","And Game 7 of the Eastern Conference Finals was the highest-rating NBA game on TNT ever. As you know, we're steadily increasing the amount of original programming on TNT and we're airing originals year round. We had about double the number of original hours in prime time this quarter compared to last year and it's paying off, led by shows like Falling Skies, Rizzoli & Isles, Major Crimes and Dallas. Ratings on our prime time originals during the quarter more than doubled compared to the same period last year.","At TBS, The Big Bang Theory was again the #1 sitcom on cable and Cougar Town was the #1 original sitcom on cable. In fact, our original programming on TBS was up over 50% compared to our originals in the second quarter last year. As you know, we've recently made a number of changes at CNN and we're seeing real progress. This quarter, CNN was up almost 70% in its key demo during total day, while both of its cable news competitors were down. In fact, CNN surpassed MSNBC to finish as the #2 network of the quarter in both total viewers and adults 25 to 54 for the first time in almost 4 years. That was partially driven by a high volume of breaking news events, but we saw strength across almost every daypart and every show, even away from breaking news coverage. For instance, in June, CNN's new morning show, New Day, was up over 50% in the key demo over last year and Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown is an unqualified hit. Our brands and programming are resonating with our advertisers, too. We just completed negotiations for the 2013 to '14 upfront and our portfolio of entertainment-oriented networks, TBS, TNT, truTV and Adult Swim, obtained CPM increases in the high single-digits. Once again, that was at the high-end of the range for all TV networks, broadcast and cable.","Our affiliates also recognize the value of our networks. As you may recall, last year at this time, we first told you that we expect Turner's domestic subscription revenue to grow at double-digit CAGR between 2013 and 2016. Last month, we completed a contract renewal with a top 5 distributor and got the affiliate fee increases we were seeking. This gives us even more confidence that we'll achieve our long-range targets.","At HBO, our programming lineup is as strong as it's ever been, which is saying a lot. Game of Thrones finished its third season with an average of 14 million viewers per episode. That's up more than 20% from last year and firmly establishes it as the second most popular series ever on HBO. True Blood recently launched its sixth season and is averaging over 10 million viewers per episode. And in its second season, The Newsroom is averaging 7 million to 8 million viewers. Last, but not least, our made-for-HBO movie, Behind the Candelabra, starring Michael Douglas and Matt Damon, was the most-watched HBO film in 10 years. And HBO received 108 Primetime Emmy nominations this year. That's the most of any network for the 13th consecutive year and it's more than double the nearest competitor. It's also the most that HBO has received in 9 years. That included nominations for Outstanding Drama Series for Game of Thrones, Outstanding Comedy Series for both Girls and VEEP and Outstanding Miniseries Or Movie for Behind the Candelabra and for Phil Spector. We intend to build on this success.","HBO remains the port of first call for distinctive-airing television. And right now, we have more pilots in development at HBO than in any time in its history, including projects for Mike Judge, Damon Lindelof, David Milch and Ryan Murphy, among others.","We also had a fantastic quarter at Warner Bros. Warner Bros. TV wrapped up one of its most successful upfront seasons ever. It received orders for 31 shows on the 5 broadcast networks for next season, including 18 that are returning shows and 13 new shows. That's the highest number of total orders in years and it's the most returning shows in over 30 years. Importantly, we have orders for 10 comedies, which as you know, have the greatest potential value in syndication.","We also had a really strong theatrical quarter, led by the performance of Man of Steel and The Great Gatsby. Notably, Man of Steel, our Superman reboot, is on track to generate almost $700 million at the worldwide box office. That's obviously a great start to the franchise. A few weeks ago, we revealed exciting plans for a Man of Steel sequel that will bring together Superman and Batman, which is scheduled for 2015. We have a lot more plans for DC that we look forward to sharing when the time is right.","Looking out into the third quarter and through the rest of this year. The Conjuring is well exceeding our forecast. It's on track to reach $130 million at the box office domestically, putting it among the top 5 horror films of all time. We're optimistic that We're The Millers, starring Jennifer Aniston and Jason Sudeikis and opening tonight, has the makings of a sleeper hit. And we're particularly excited about our biggest remaining release of the year, The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug.","I want to touch on some significant personnel changes we announced recently. After leading Turner Broadcasting to great success for over a decade, Phil Kent recently approached me with a decision not to renew his contract after it expires next year. I'm very excited that John Martin has agreed to take on the CEO role at Turner, starting January 1. We'll miss John's leadership here at corporate, but he'll been in an even better position to drive Time Warner's success from that seat. Howard Averill, current CFO of Time Inc., will move over to Time Warner to replace John. Howard has been a steady hand during a period of tremendous change at Time Inc. and I'm confident he'll prove a great addition to the senior management team at Time Warner. We also announced that Joe Ripp, a veteran of Time Warner and an accomplished media executive, will return to lead Time Inc. as CEO. Having someone of Joe's caliber in place is a key component of our plan to spin off Time Inc. into an independent, publicly traded company.","I'll also update you on the timing of the Time Inc. spend. Our top priority in the spinoff is to make sure that we put Time Inc. in the best possible position to succeed. So rather than rush to complete the transaction this year, we've decided that it's prudent to give Joe some time to further refine Time Inc.'s strategic direction and as a result, we now expect to complete the spinoff early next year.","So in closing, with more than half the year behind us, we're very proud of what we've achieved. We're also very confident of how we're positioned, both for 2013 and the years to come.","With that, I'll pass it to John.","John K. Martin","Thanks, Jeff, and good morning. I'll begin by referring to the first slide, which is now available on our website, and starting with our consolidated results. We're halfway through the year and we couldn't be more pleased with our performance to date. We've delivered strong results in the first quarter and even stronger results this quarter. In fact, through the first half of the year, our adjusted operating income is up 15% and we've grown adjusted earnings per share by almost 30% year-over-year. That's a result of healthy underlying trends across nearly all of our businesses.","In the second quarter, our revenues grew 10% and that included a nearly 200 basis-point drag from our Publishing division. We had a terrific quarter at Networks, which posted its highest quarterly revenues and profits ever. And company-wide, international revenues grew almost 20% in the quarter.","Adjusted operating income grew 25%, making it our highest second quarter ever for profits. Margins expanded over 230 basis points and that included margin expansion at each of our reporting segments. And that's despite double-digit growth in programming, production and marketing expenses, which we were able to offset partially by reducing other cost of revenues and other SG&A expenses. And this discipline has allowed us to produce very strong financial results even while we're investing aggressively for the future.","Continuing to move down to P&L. Adjusted EPS grew even faster than adjusted operating income, climbing 46%. And that's the 12th time in the last 15 quarters that adjusted EPS has grown double digits, along with our strong operating performance that was helped by a lower effective tax rate and our ongoing allocation of capital to share repurchases.","Since we last reported earnings, we've repurchased almost $1 billion of common stock, which is an acceleration from the first quarter, and we also paid over $270 million in dividends. So year-to-date, we returned almost $2.4 billion to shareholders, including more than $1.8 billion in share repurchases and $500 million in dividends. And as Jeff mentioned, in light of this strong performance and our confidence of our ability to execute in the back half of the year, we're raising our 2013 full year business outlook for adjusted EPS and we now expect growth to be in the mid-teens year-over-year.","Let me now turn to the specific segment highlights and let me begin at our Networks segment where each of HBO and Turner grew adjusted operating income double-digits. Advertising revenues were up 11% year-over-year and that's our highest quarterly growth rate in 2 years. And please recall that we benefited from the timing of the Final Four this quarter. But if you look through that, domestic ad growth was also around 11%. And that includes solid growth across all of our categories. That's domestic entertainment, that's kids and that's news.","International advertising declined in the low single-digits, but without the prior year closure of TNT Turkey and the impact of foreign currency movements, it would have been up mid single-digits. And that was a result of mid-teens growth at international entertainment, which was partially offset by declines at international news.","Looking ahead to the third quarter, we continue to see very solid trends here with scatter pricing up double digits over the upfront. So as of now, we anticipate mid to high single-digit growth in total Networks advertising in Q3.","Moving on. Subscription revenue growth was 4% in the quarter, which was relatively consistent with the mid single-digit growth that we saw in the first quarter. This quarter, the mix of subscribers at HBO and a stronger U.S. dollar both somewhat weighed on Subscription revenue growth. And as we look ahead to the rest of the year, we continue to believe that Subscription revenue growth will be up mid single-digits. And as Jeff mentioned, with Turner recently securing a new deal with a top 5 distributor, we have even more confidence that we'll see significant acceleration in Subscription revenues beginning in 2014.","Adjusted operating income at the Networks segment was up a very strong 13% in the quarter, with margins increasing almost 180 basis points year-over-year. And please note that growth this quarter did benefit from an adjustment through a receivable allowance, but even without that, adjusted operating income would still have been up double digits. And that reflects both of the revenue growth as well as our ongoing focus on constricting non-programming costs, as programming expenses increased 8% in the quarter. So in the first half, programming expenses at the Networks were up 4%, which is consistent with our expectation of, in any given year, programming expenses being up mid to high single-digits.","Looking ahead, we continue to anticipate margins are going to be up here at this group for the year. And that's despite continued growth in our programming investments. So 2013 should be another very, very strong year for the Networks segment. And we're positioning ourselves to grow at attractive levels for the foreseeable future here.","So now let me turn to our Film and TV production group at Warner's, which had another really terrific quarter with revenues up 13% and adjusted operating income up 34%. The increase in adjusted operating income was largely driven by the strong performance of our Film slate. And that included films such as Man of Steel, The Great Gatsby and The Hangover Part III. In Television, we faced a very difficult comparison against the domestic syndication sale of The Mentalist in the year-ago quarter. And despite this difficult comparison, the underlying trends remain really strong here. In addition to the really successful upfront season that Jeff described, we also saw higher international license fees and very healthy demand for our television product from SVOD services, both domestic and international. We recognize just under $70 million in SVOD revenue at Warner's in the second quarter and that's up significantly from a year ago.","And if you look at Time Warner, we've recognized now year-to-date about $150 million of SVOD revenues. And we continue to expect that SVOD distribution channel will be a strong contributor to our results this year. Across theatrical and TV, Warner's Home Entertainment revenue was up 3% in the quarter. And while the industry was down slightly in the quarter, it grew modestly for the first half of 2013. And we're particularly encouraged by the growth in the electronics sell-through area, which was up over 50% for the industry in the first half. And while there's still work to do on improving the consumer experience here, we think it's a very positive sign for the future of the Home Entertainment business.","Looking ahead, we expect second half results to be strongly weighted to the fourth quarter at Warner Bros. In the third quarter, we face very tough comparisons against last year's theatrical release of The Dark Knight Rises. In addition, we anticipate recognizing SVOD revenues from certain CW availabilities in the fourth quarter of this year versus recognizing them in the third quarter of 2012. And while we've already released the majority of our larger movies this year, we're optimistic about the rest of this year's theatrical release slate. And We're the Millers, which opens this evening, is a particularly funny film.","Similarly, we feel very good about our position going into the new TV season due to Warner Bros.' industry-leading performance during this year's upfront. And we have very, very high hopes for the fourth quarter games release, including Batman: Arkham Origins. So we remain confident that Warner Bros. profits this year should be at least as good, if not better, than what they were last year. And we've been saying that now for some time.","Let me move on to Publishing. At Time Inc., advertising revenues were down 5% in the quarter and that was due to declines both here as well as outside the U.S. Domestically, we saw softness at the sports and news groups. We also finally lapped the transfer of SI.com and Golf.com back to Time Inc., which contributed to advertising trends appearing somewhat worse than what they were in the first quarter. Subscription revenue fell 7% in the second quarter as we continue to see softness in newsstand sales. And looking to the back half of the year, we expect the decline in Subscription revenue to look somewhat similar to what we experienced in the first half of the year. But note, that we will see some shift of Subscription revenue to the third quarter from the fourth quarter due to the frequency of certain titles in each quarter. Despite lower revenues, adjusted operating income was up a pretty strong 28% in the quarter. And that was primarily a function of cost savings initiatives including the restructuring actions that were taken earlier this year.","As we look to the rest of 2013, our comparisons as compared to last year become somewhat more challenging. So while we remain focused on cost controls at Time Inc., we don't expect that will be sufficient to offset revenue declines in the back half of this year.","Now let me turn to the next slide, which looks at our full year 2013 business outlook. As I just said, we had a great first half of the year. And that's given us a tremendous amount of confidence to raise our full year 2013 outlook to mid-teens growth in adjusted EPS. And despite higher losses from our investment in CME than we originally anticipated at the beginning of the year, the absolute numbers implied by our new current guidance are nicely higher than our previous outlook. Clearly, our updated outlook implies that growth will slow somewhat in the back half of this year. And that's the result of difficult comparisons, particularly at our Film and TV and Publishing segments. And this is consistent with what we expected coming into this year and it certainly doesn't suggest any change to the health of the businesses. I'll also point out that our effective tax rate was a bit lower in the first half than we normally anticipate, as a result of settling a couple of audits with taxing authorities. And excluding those settlements, our effective tax rate would have been somewhere in the mid-30s, which is more in line with our longer-term expectations. So we feel good about raising guidance. We feel good about our performance. And we believe that we are set up for both a very good year and continued attractive growth in the longer term.","Let me now turn to cash, free cash. We're having a big year for free cash flow generation. We've generated, through the first 6 months of the year, $1.8 billion of free cash flow. That's more than triple the year-ago period. And that's mostly due to an improvement in working capital, which we expected, and the strong growth of profits, which I've been just discussing. Capital expenditures and cash taxes are also lower year-to-date. The favorable working capital variance accounted for more than 1\/2 of the improvement in free cash flow year-to-date. And the biggest drivers there were reimbursements for prior co-financings and the timing of payments for sports programming at Networks. The decline in cash taxes was primarily a result of tax law extenders that were passed by Congress in January this year. So with our solid performance through the first half of the year, we're on track for a really, really strong year of free cash flow generation in 2013.","Turning now to the final slide which looks at our net debt. We ended the quarter with a little less than $17.4 billion in net debt. That's up about $350 million from year-end 2012. And that's largely due to the almost $2.1 billion of capital we allocated in the form of dividends and share repurchases in the first half. Providing stockholder returns remains a critical component of our capital plan. And as you can see, the amount of capital we've returned well exceeds the free cash flow we've generated year-to-date. That's consistent with how we've been allocating capital for a number of years now. And since 2008, we've generated about $13 billion in free cash flow. And over that same time period, we've repurchased almost $13 billion of stock or almost 30% of our float and, at the same time, we paid more than $4 billion in dividends. So our leverage ratio is now only 2.3x, which is a little bit below our target of 2.5x. And we still think that our target leverage ratio of 2.5x strikes the right balance of maintaining a balance sheet strength, while giving us the flexibility to invest in our core businesses, make acquisitions and return capital to our stockholders. So we'll continue to manage the balance sheet to stay close to that target over the course of the year.","And with that, let me turn the call back to Doug so that we can begin the Q&A portion. Thank you.","Douglas Shapiro","Thanks, John. Dawn, let's get the Q&A started. [Operator Instructions]","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Alexia Quadrani from JPMorgan.","Alexia S. Quadrani - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","My question is just on the affiliate renewals that are upcoming. The one you referenced to having signed last month, I believe, I assume that kicks in, in 2014 and not right away. And then just staying on that topic, the real positive move you've seen in ratings at CNN recently, is that -- do you expect -- I guess the timing of that is real good given your upcoming renewals or ongoing renewals. Do you expect as much sort of upside opportunity at CNN as you would at TNT in these renewals, given the addition of the NCAA?","John K. Martin","Alexia, it's John. I just -- with regard to the affiliate renewals, we're really not going to speak specifically. We have nondisclosure agreements with regard to the specific deals and -- but what was important and the reason why we felt like it was relevant to mention on the call is because going back to a year ago when we said we expected double-digit compound annual growth for the 3-year period ended 2016, we said that during the middle of this year, we were going to begin what was the most ambitious rate renewal cycle that the company had experienced in years. So this was the first big deal that we were entered into and we successfully completed it and the construction surrounding the agreement where quite constructive. So it not only bolsters our confidence in our ability to get that and those rates will kick in, in the not-too-distant future. As we've said before, just to repeat, the domestic Sub revenue should grow double-digit compound annual growth from '13 to '16. And the only other thing I would mention is that the way that the increases should come in over time over those 3 years, is that we're going to see the biggest impact in terms of growth in 2016. So beginning next year, we absolutely expect to see an acceleration in Turner's domestic affiliate rates off of current year levels. And if I was going to forecast right now, I would say that it will probably be close to double digits. In '15, it will probably moderate somewhat and then in '16, you'll see the biggest overall growth rates. So that over the 3-year period, you get to the double-digit period -- double-digit rates, excuse me.","Jeffrey L. Bewkes","Alexia, were you asking something about CNN rating?","Alexia S. Quadrani - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Yes, I know that they -- I think there is a bigger opportunity, it sounds like, in terms of the potential to move up in rates at probably TNT. I was just saying that with the incredible turnaround you're seeing at CNN more recently, do you think there's also an opportunity there?","Jeffrey L. Bewkes","On CPM rates?","Alexia S. Quadrani - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","No, on the renewals, yes, the renewals.","Jeffrey L. Bewkes","Absolutely. And I think John said it well. We're not -- we do our affiliate rate renewals across our networks. And so the strength of CNN, which as we have said and we certainly believe it, it's essentially worth a lot more in affiliate rates than the current rate that it's getting. And it's not just a function of ratings. As we mentioned in the call, the ratings are up 50% in total day and we're taking share. But the ratings have moved around. That's really not the only thing. It's actually not even the main thing. It's simply the role of in-depth, trustworthy, nonpartisan global news that CNN fills. And the strength of CNN in online and mobile broadband delivery, which is the #1 source to go to for that, whether it's breaking news or not, and certainly during breaking news. So it's very valuable. We think everything at CNN is on the uptick. Really, the quality of what it's doing and also, both the ad rates and the affiliate rates.","Operator","Our next question comes from Doug Mitchelson from Deutsche Bank.","Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","A further clarification on the Turner affiliate renewal cycle, John. It's obviously encouraging, you signed a deal with a top 5 operator. I understand the reticence on giving too much detail, but could you tell us, are there other meaningful deals that you'll strike around this year end that will bolster confidence in the renewal cycle further? Or should we look to 2014 for the next piece of news on that? And the question for Jeff, just curious, your updated thoughts around online video distribution. Disney and Fox decided that Hulu was an interesting business to own. Do you see the appeal and value of having direct-to-consumer online video retail business? Or is remaining an independent wholesaler the right strategy? And to the extent the answer is different for international versus U.S., I would love to hear about that.","John K. Martin","So, Doug, I'll start. I think this answer's going to be pretty short. So, yes, we've got some negotiations and deals that come up for renewal before the end of this year. Some of them are big distributors. But having said that, we're not going to see the impact of those deals kick in, in 2013, which is why I'd said that we're not really going to expect to see anything in terms of the overall affiliate growth until 2014. But, yes, I mean, we've kicked off the cycle, so to speak, in terms of affiliate deals. And we've got a number of them coming up before the end of the year. But as I said, just at the risk of repeating myself, we feel good about the hand we've got, we feel good about the value that the networks have with respect to affiliates and consumers. And we have every confidence that we're going to succeed in what we're trying to do.","Jeffrey L. Bewkes","Doug, on your question, I think it's a good question. Look, it's for Disney, News Corp. and NBC to talk about what they're doing with Hulu and why. But having said that, I think our view of what they're doing, and it makes sense to us, is more about supporting the value of their networks and their programming across platforms than it is particularly about the discrete business of broadband-only delivery at Hulu. I think those things can be complementary and I think they're searching to get there. It seems like a good decision. What we're doing and to answer your question, we think that the best place for us for now is essentially emphasizing the very large wholesale networks and the packages over both the video plan and increasingly the broadband plan. Because as you know, we've been very -- well, we've said it over and over again. We think the move of television to an on-demand service on television and on broadband devices is a major move to support the value of TV networks, TV programs. We think it's huge. We see it all over the world. And as we look at the ways that we're going to distribute our shows and our networks across the world, we essentially try to optimize the distribution opportunity in whichever country. In the United States, it's a very powerful penetration of the giant packages of TV networks. In certain other countries, there are times when you're actually better off going really broadband-delivered. We did it recently in the Nordic countries. But it's this kind of a case-by-case thing at this point. I think it will all converge. And the key point, I think, is not which platform, it's essentially getting everything to be VOD with an interface that consumers love. And there should be deservedly and there is a lot of attention on the kind of excitement consumers and viewers have for on-demand programming. Some of it from broadband-delivered sources, but most of it from television network sources that are becoming on-demand programs and networks like HBO, which I think is probably the leader across the world in delivering the largest package of on-demand programming in all -- well, all the hemisphere. There's just 2 hemispheres. We're thinking of a third hemisphere, but we haven't gone there yet.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Morris from Davenport & Company.","Michael C. Morris - Davenport & Company, LLC, Research Division","Two topics. First is on \u00e0 la carte or unbundling of networks. I think most of us have assumed it's a bit of a nonstarter as long as the content companies and your distribution partners were both against the concept of unbundling the pay TV package. But in the last few days, you've had more commentary from Cablevision. Time Warner Cable offering to CBS to go \u00e0 la carte. So I guess my question is -- or are, number one, do you see this as an actual shift and increasing the likelihood that we would move to \u00e0 la carte, or how something like that would happen? And how do you view your network's position, would it -- does it change your strategy at all, or do you like your positioning regardless of how that plays out? And then I have one on HBO.","Jeffrey L. Bewkes","Okay. We don't think it results a big change yet. And we do think we're very well-positioned. If there is a chance, I don't think it goes to \u00e0 la carte. We think it probably would move, if it does, to smaller bundles of kind of appropriately placed together kinds of networks. We do think we'd be really well-positioned in that scenario. What would happen is there would be more money for the biggest networks like ours. And in fact, of all the programming groups out there, Turner Time Warner has the highest proportion of our networks among the top 4. And that's just on the Turner side. If you add HBO, it's more. We'd also have the highest proportion of our affiliate fees from our biggest networks. We have about 85% to 90% from our top 4 networks. And those networks would be highly likely to be in any base package that anybody's going to create. So we don't believe we'd be vulnerable. It will probably, actually, increase our relative advantage. It would be good for HBO because lower-priced packages would effectively make HBO even more affordable. So that's how we look at it. We doubt that it will happen, but if it happens, it probably helps us. We do think there would be some of the weaker networks or weaker network groups that would fail, which would reduce the diversity of voices out there. It's not necessarily in the public interest. We don't really think that many legislators have shown any desire to take up this issue. And there's been a lot of misstatement and misinformation around it. So that's why we don't think it's probably going to take off. But if it does, it will probably happen in a way that helps us. You have a question on HBO?","Michael C. Morris - Davenport & Company, LLC, Research Division","Yes. And just quickly, John. You mentioned the mix of HBO subs being a little bit of, I guess, maybe a drag sequentially from the first quarter on the affiliate growth rate. My question is, as you go into these negotiations, we've been very focused on Turner, but is there an opportunity to change the terms of HBO to perhaps get a bit more of the economics in the future?","Jeffrey L. Bewkes","Yes, let me answer it. We don't think that's optimal for us. We've been -- really, the design of HBO affiliate rate structures are very much the -- our creation and very much in the interest of HBO. And as -- due to the nature of them, typically, distributors that have been performing better are more likely to have a higher proportion of non-revenue-generating subs because they've got incentive to have more subs and average down there effective per sub rate because they have higher penetration. That means we get a full ride on our rate increases, which are fairly strong. The poor-performing affiliates, once they get below that benchmark, as they lose subs, they basically lose revenue-generating subs for us. Of course, they're also losing revenue-generating subs for themselves and their average rate goes up. So we think it's the kind of an effective tool. We focus on a combination of penetration from different distributors. Remember, satellite, telco and cable distributors compete with each other in given geographic areas and we find this an effective tool to motivate or incentivize the appropriate competition between them to sell HBO. And as you know, HBO's the anchor service for all high-value packages. There are no high-value packages out there that don't have HBO in them. So we think it's working fine for us. And the way to look at it, essentially, the earnings growth at HBO, what we would do to improve it is we're always working with our affiliates. We have some things underway right now which I won't talk about specifically, because some affiliates are performing better than others that are going to, essentially, incentivize the underperforming affiliates to do better. And that's upside for us.","Operator","Our next question comes from Anthony DiClemente from Barclays.","Anthony J. DiClemente - Barclays Capital, Research Division","My question is on the new affiliate deal and how that pertains to the NBA. So I'm assuming, or presumably, the new affiliate deal extends beyond the 2016. I don't know if you can confirm that, but if we could assume that the duration of the new deal goes beyond the duration of your current NBA deal, which I think ends in the middle of the 2016 season, I guess my question is, do the affiliates see NBA as being a must-have piece of content for Turner as part of that deal? And so does that really put the onus on you guys to renew and negotiate a sooner time period with the NBA? And so for us as investors, I guess the question would be that given how crucial the NBA presumably is, how are you thinking about maintaining financial and economic discipline as you go into that renegotiation with the NBA?","John K. Martin","Anthony, it's John. You know what, unfortunately, and I hope you can understand this, I mean, we're not going to comment specifically on the duration of the deal that we did. But Jeff may have something to say about the NBA specifically.","Jeffrey L. Bewkes","Yes, which is not much more. It's one of the longest and strongest partnerships we have with any league. And we do have the right, as you said, through the 2015, '16 season. We not only license the content, but we manage both NBA TV and the NBA digital properties for the league. We're confident this relationship will continue for many years to come. And we all know, it's in your question, that sports rates are going up. We feel pretty good about our position there and our ability to pay that and continue to have the earnings growth we've been showing you. And we really don't want to, obviously, say much more about it because we're talking about significant amounts of money. And I think you would want us to just go off and keep securing the programming that we judge it wise to have.","John K. Martin","The only thing I would add to that, Anthony, just to keep in mind, and this is by design, the entertainment networks at Turner are hybrid networks, right? And the programming falls into different buckets, whether it's originals, which is getting an increasing percentage of the schedule, or sports, or acquired TV shows and movies. So I think last year, it was about 70% acquired, 20% originals, 10% sports. And it's moving much more towards originals. But just think about, sports is incredibly important, but I think the NBA represents 3% of our overall programming in terms of hours. So we have a lot of other programming that's extremely valuable to the affiliates and extremely valuable to consumers. So the NBA is important, but we're going to be okay no matter what.","Operator","Our next question comes from Vasily Karasyov from Sterne Agee.","Vasily Karasyov - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","I have a two-part question on margins at the Networks. I think a couple of years ago, you guys laid out at your Analyst Day, the HBO margin expansion pass where the non-programming costs will be contained and the revenue growth will lead to that. So I was wondering if HBO margins have been expanding in recent years? And then if it's still the trajectory that you see in the next 2 or 3 years? And then with the Turner affiliate fee accelerating, should we also expect an incremental margin expansion, that is -- or do you think all of the incremental revenue will be absorbed and spent into -- on programming?","John K. Martin","Thanks for the question. Look, I think if you look back over the last 5 to 7 years at the Networks group, and this would be true for each of HBO and Turner, in any given year, margins expand roughly 100 basis points a year. And that could be a little bit more in some years, a little bit less in other years. And I think the best indicator of the future is probably looking at the past because I think that's kind of a trend and that sort of a trajectory should continue. All of the elements of the HBO margin story that we laid out in the Analyst Day from a number of years ago, those are absolutely still intact. But it's not just an HBO margin expansion story, the same thing's happening at Turner. And if you look at this quarter, as just an indication, we had at the Networks group, I think 7% revenue growth, 4% expense growth. But if you look at the expense growth and decompose it, in this quarter, we had 8% programming expense growth. That means all of the rest of the expenses at the Networks group were down. And that doesn't come easily. That comes by hard work. But nevertheless, we have a lot of control over our nonstrategic expenses. And our goal is to hold those to growth in any given year of no more than low single-digits. And we think programming costs are going to grow in any given year of no more than mid to high single-digits. So that means overall expenses in any given year at the Networks should grow mid single-digits and we think revenue growth is going to outpace that each and every year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jason Bazinet from Citi.","Jason B. Bazinet - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I know you mentioned on the call that the timing spend is getting pushed out a little bit. I was wondering, have you guys established the capital structure that you intend to put on Time Inc. once it spins out?","John K. Martin","Jason, it's John, I'll just take it. The answer is no. There's a considerable amount of work that's going on and there's lots of different work streams associated with all aspects of the spin. With Joe just being named as a CEO and a new CFO being named, I think as recently as 2 days ago, we look forward to a collaborative process working with them and the rest of the team. One of the things I think we've said is, is we want the capital structure of Time Inc. to represent or provide Time Inc. with the best possible path to success. And we want the equity of the spun company to be attractive. So we're going to be looking very closely at the amount of debt that we think is optimal for the Time Inc. company and some sort of a dividend policy that we think will be optimal. And anything that we would likely do, because we haven't made a decision, will leave Time Warner remain co as a leverage ratio that should be similar to where we are today, is another way to think about it.","Operator","Our next question comes from Barton Crockett from Lazard Capital Markets.","Barton E. Crockett - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","I wanted to ask just a follow-up to the discussion of the acceleration of the Turner affiliate fees, 2014 to 2016. How much of that drops to the bottom line? In other words, when you look out to this revenue acceleration, do you also in your mind think can I give this a bucket to invest more in things like programming maybe for a sports rights feed, or is it really kind of purely incremental profit?","Jeffrey L. Bewkes","Can I start? All of it, I guess, is the short answer. It's an increase in marginal revenue and so it's discretionary whether you want to spend and all of it went to the bottom line, or whether we took -- we obviously have some percentage of total revenue that goes to costs we decide to make. But you want to ask it in a different way?","Barton E. Crockett - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","[indiscernible]","Jeffrey L. Bewkes","What did you say, I'm sorry?","Barton E. Crockett - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Okay. I think you answered it. Yes, I think you're saying there's no change in your expense trend as you get that boost in revenue, so it does drop to the bottom line.","John K. Martin","Yes, I mean, any of the investments we would choose to make would be discretionary. And I would just sort of mention for context, we already spend an awful lot of money on programming. So we've got meaningful scale. And so we'll make the decisions based on the competitive dynamics. But to have extra money in revenue is a nice thing to have.","Barton E. Crockett - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then just one other question, if I can. I was wondering if you could comment on the discussion of new over-the-top services, like Intel has been in the press with things they look to launch. So without talking specifically about things like Intel, but the general kind of category of new multi-channel over-the-top services, how do you gauge the probability of something meaningful coming to you in revenues in terms of like minimum guarantees for these new services over the next few quarters or the next few years?","Jeffrey L. Bewkes","Well, okay. No one showed up on the horizon with anything that looks like that yet. We've had conversations across our businesses with many technology companies, vendors, others that want to be distributors, some of them over-the-top. And we'll evaluate each business and opportunity within the context, number one, of our overall business; and number two, of what we would think might be the sustainability of what some of these new entrants are proposing. We're not philosophically opposed to it. We just -- we don't see it as being viable through any of the suspects -- usual suspects yet. Take some examples, Intel hasn't launched yet. So I don't know what they're going to do or whether they're going to do that. Apple, we talk to all the time, and there's none that we know of that are interesting opportunities, in our view.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Bank from RBC Capital Markets.","David Bank - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","So, Jeff, you've obviously made some pretty meaningful leadership changes across the business, most recently at the Turner networks. And when you gave the job to John to run the networks and, I guess, and David did work for him, what essentially were the -- like, what's the mandate to take this great business, what is it that they are supposed to do? What did you say was -- you expected of them? What is like the 1 or 2 key goals that you expect to see them execute as the new leadership team or leadership?","Jeffrey L. Bewkes","Well, I want to start by saying I'm very happy. And all companies from the top management of the divisions, the corporate, the board, we're all really excited about the team that we have across all the divisions. And I think that -- I'm personally really excited and happy about how smoothly all the transitions went, how much of a bench we've got and how we were able to promote from within in pretty much all of these cases. So there's an -- there's a body of both relationships and knowledge that are working together in a way that Time Warner hasn't had in previous years. In terms of the specifics at Turner, Phil and the management at Turner, which certainly David Levy, who's picking up some new responsibilities, working closer with Steve Koonin and Stu Snyder now and their jobs as TBS, TNT, Turner Classic Movies and truTV gets stronger and they become a bigger part of a kind of programming evolution in the entire network business, not just in our company but across the industry; but also the regeneration of momentum at CNN with Jeff Zucker. The tremendous moves and the real fast growth that Gerhard Zeiler is making in all our international businesses, including a new cooperation and level of kind of joint action between HBO and Turner and Warners all over the world. These are all the things that got under way. Phil put a lot of these people in place, not just Phil but this whole team has got tremendous initiatives under way. I think Turner is the leading company on digital transformation of its networks, to VOD and to broadband-delivered TV Everywhere. We have fuller offerings and more deals in place than anybody else. So what John is going to do is go and join that momentum and continue to evolve it as it has been. That's pretty similar to what Kevin's doing at Warner's with a great team there. The team at HBO, with Richard and Eric, has continued to just move forward. So it's really the same answer across the company. It's just a new generation that has been here, which is reaching the point in their careers where they can take the next step.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tuna Amobi from S&P Capital IQ.","Tuna N. Amobi - S&P Capital IQ Equity Research","So first question for John. The numbers you threw out in terms of the 5-year record of your return allocation between share buybacks and dividends, I think if my math is correct, that kind of forks out to north of 130% return rate, which I have to say is pretty remarkable. So I guess, the question is, is there any reason why you think that this kind of momentum or rate may not be sustainable after the spinoff? I mean, if anything, I would imagine it would probably even trend higher than that. So any kind of color around that would be helpful. And separately for Jeff, so Game of Thrones, obviously has had a phenomenal performance. But one other issue that has also come up with regard to that title is the online piracy, I think, by all accounts, one of the highest-pirated show and I'm not aware what you guys have done to kind of address that. It almost seems like you've kind of viewed that as kind of a compliment in terms of just kind of looking the other way. So I'm not sure if that's kind of the right thinking. Is that a paradigm shift in terms of how you kind of look at some -- the piracy and its impact on some of the shows that's going forward? If you can touch on that and what you've done, that would be helpful.","John K. Martin","So, Tuna, I'll start with respect to your first question. I think it's true to say that for at least 5, 5.5 years, we've had a very, very consistent policy as it relates to managing the balance sheet, capital structure and capital allocation. And we have believed and continue to believe, that having a balanced approach of delivering shareholder returns in many forms through earnings growth and a direct dividend and supplemented with share repurchases opportunistically, coupled with maintaining a balance sheet that remains strong and provides adequate strategic flexibility, that, that policy has served the company well. And we have been able to deploy a lot of capital over the last 5 years. And as you appropriately pointed out, more than 100% of what was generated. The only thing I would say, looking backwards, is we did go through a period where we took up the balance sheet leverage. When we spun off Time Warner Cable and we received the $9.25 billion dividend, the company was underlevered and we used that opportunity to more appropriately optimize the capital structure. So now, the 2.5x leverage ratio will be basically the governor, at least for the near term, as it relates to what we will do and how we'll allocate capital. And as I said in my proactive remarks, we ended the quarter a little bit below that, about 2.3x. I do think, though, as you think about Time Warner post the Time Inc. spin, the spun company will be the company that probably is the least predictable in terms of free cash flow generation over the next several years. So what will remain at Time Warner is, essentially, 90% of the company is from the TV ecosystem, which is incredibly predictable, incredibly robust. And we'll feel really good and really confident about our free cash flow generation for the foreseeable future. So we need to take that into consideration as we think about capital allocation going forward. But I don't think we're contemplating, at this point, steering away from what we've done. I think what we've done and how we've managed the company has served us well.","Jeffrey L. Bewkes","Tuna, on Game of Thrones at HBO. I have to confess, I think you're right. I admit, our first reaction to it, to how much people want to watch it -- now, first of all, it's got ratings of 14 million, 15 million. A lot of it is VOD on your TV system, a fair amount, an increasing amount of it is VOD on your GO service. So it's really strengthening not just the image and the engagement of our subs with HBO programming, it's also getting them familiar and very involved in using the Video on Demand capabilities of HBO. And don't forget the television part, the part where you go to your house and you turn on that big screen TV and you're watching it over the video plan. Also, the HBO GO service, which the Game of Thrones is the leading introduction manual for how to use HBO GO, which more and more millions of people are doing. If you then go to people watching it that aren't subs, it's a tremendous word-of-mouth thing. The issue would be if they were doing it and because they could get it, not subscribing. We don't see much of that. Basically we've been dealing with this issue for years at HBO, where, literally, 20, 30 years, where people have always been running wires down the back of apartment buildings and sharing with their neighbors. Our experience is, it all leads to more penetration, more paying subs and more health for HBO, less reliance on having to do paid advertising. We don't do a lot of paid advertising on HBO. We let the programming and the reviews talk for us. And it seems to be working. If you go around the world, I think you're right, that Game of Thrones is the most pirated show in the world. Now that's better than an Emmy.","Douglas Shapiro","All right. Dawn, I think we're actually out of time here.

Bewkes - Time Warner, Inc.","Thanks, Jessica, and thanks, everybody, for listening in this morning. We had an outstanding fourth quarter, topping off a very successful year in 2016. And for the year, our revenues increased 4% to $29.3 billion and adjusted operating income grew 10% to $7.6 billion with record results in each of our divisions.","Adjusted EPS was up 23% to $5.86 per share. That's our eighth consecutive year of double-digit growth in adjusted EPS. Now looking at the fourth quarter, revenues grew 11% to $7.9 billion, with increases in each of our divisions. And adjusted operating income increased 25% to $1.8 billion. We generated a record $4.4 billion in free cash flow and we returned close to $3.6 billion to shareholders in share repurchases and dividends over the course of the year.","What's driving these results is the same combination of strong execution, continued investment in our businesses and disciplined capital allocation that's enabled us to provide superior long-term returns to our shareholders. Our strategy starts, as you all know, with investing in and creating the world's most compelling video content. We then ensure that it can be accessed and enjoyed by consumers wherever, whenever and on whatever device they want it, all around the world.","And increasingly, that means working with both our distribution partners and on our own to ensure great experiences that connect consumers with our content and our brands. You can see the success of this strategy across each of our businesses last year.","Let me share a few highlights and I'll start at the networks. In 2016, Turner made terrific progress on its goal of transforming its leading portfolio of entertainment, news, sports and kids brands, investing in each of its businesses to make them ever more powerful and engaging for audiences.","For the year, among adults 18 to 49 in prime time, we held three of the top five slots among ad supported Cable Networks with TBS, TNT and Adult Swim. And, in fact, TBS was the number one entertainment network in prime for the fourth consecutive year, showcasing a great mix of fresh originals, sports and acquired content. Early last year, we began introducing a lineup of bold new comedies that includes Angie Tribeca, The Detour and Wrecked. We've also had a breakout success in Full Frontal with Samantha Bee, which during the summer began outpacing The Daily Show and continued to do so in the fourth quarter. We also added two new comedies in People of Earth and Search Party, which debuted to strong critical reviews. All of the freshman shows have been renewed.","And if you haven't seen them, we've made the entire seasons available On Demand to binge view, as with all the latest Turner original series all On Demand.","Well, if 2016 was TBS's year, we expect 2017 to belong to TNT. It's just underway in its refresh process, but it's already off to an encouraging start with newcomers: Animal Kingdom, produced by Warner Bros.; and Good Behavior, both of which have also been renewed. And this year, we're rolling out a slate that includes exciting new series like The Alienist, Will and Claws. Add in compelling franchise movies, which include those from DC Universe and the entire Star Wars library and recent Marvel movies, and you can see why we're very confident in TNT's future as the home for great drama.","Another part of Turner's success, a critical part, and \u2013 well, basically a vital part, is our success in sports and our rights to the NCAA tournament, the NBA and Major League Baseball. Last year, we aired the NCAA Men's Basketball Championship game for the first time ever, and we generated record revenues across our March Madness properties. This is such a strong relationship for us that we, along with CBS, renewed our deal with the NCAA through 2032.","Our NBA package also continues to deliver tremendous results, and that was highlighted by game seven of last season's Western Conference Finals. It became the most-watched telecast ever in the history of TNT. We also launched our ELEAGUE gaming network in partnership with WME | IMG, and that's off to a promising start. And it's already bringing new younger viewers to TBS.","Speaking of younger viewers, I have to mention Adult Swim again and its leading position with millennial audiences. In 2016, it was the number one network among 18 to 34 year olds for the 12th year in a row.","Now, what a year for CNN, the number one news network among adults 18 to 49 in prime time; let's just say that again: the number one news network among adults 18 to 49 in prime time, and the number one digital news destination in 2016. CNN capped off its most-watched year ever with a record-setting election night, ranked number one in prime that evening across all cable and broadcast networks.","With the historic U.S. Presidential election behind us and the new administration in place, we have every confidence that CNN will continue to reinforce its reputation as not only the source the world turns to for trusted news coverage, but also as a destination for compelling original series and documentaries.","And internationally, Turner launched a dozen new networks, while holding its position as the number one portfolio of pay-TV networks across Latin America.","Whether it's content, advertising or distribution, Turner is making important progress evolving its business in ways that recognize the changing media habits and that put the consumer first.","Last year, Turner continued to build on the successful 2015 launches of short form news site Great Big Story and digital studio Super Deluxe. And in November, Turner Classic Movies launched FilmStruck, a new over-the-top service for lovers of art house movies.","And in distribution, Turner has demonstrated the value of its portfolio by being an anchor tenant on each of the new virtual MVPD services that have launched as well as on Hulu's upcoming new service.","Now, let's move to the gold standard in premium video, Home Box Office. HBO had another great year, while making investments for an even stronger original programming lineup. Once again, 2016 brought more primetime Emmy awards to HBO than any other network, and that's for the 15th straight year. Game of Thrones' sixth season hit record viewership of 26 million people per episode. That's about a 50 rating on HBO \u2013 actually, more than that on a sub base. And we also had the biggest launch of a new series in HBO history with Westworld. It's produced by Warner Bros., and it surpassed even the Game of Thrones first season.","I want to pause on that and say that even with the explosion of new outlets and choices in this golden age of video, HBO remains singular in its ability to attract artists who push the boundaries of what's creatively possible. And that's the case whether it's on an epic scale of a show like Westworld or on a human scale with a show like Girls, which begins its sixth and final season this weekend.","You'll also see that in our upcoming limited series Big Little Lies, with a stellar cast including Nicole Kidman and Reese Witherspoon, which follows last year's acclaimed series, The Night Of.","In 2016 at HBO, we also premiered the well-received freshman seasons of Insecure, Divorce, Vice Principals and High Maintenance, and those ran alongside returning comedy powerhouses Veep, Silicon Valley and Ballers. Of course, HBO offers much more than its original programming. It's got the best lineup of recent Hollywood films, hit films, available anywhere. And they account for a significant amount of HBOs viewership.","When you add in great documentaries, sports and late-night powerhouses like Last Week Tonight with John Oliver, or Real Time with Bill Maher, both of which experienced record viewership last year, as well as our new nightly series, VICE News Tonight, you can see why HBO stands out from the pack and why we're very confident about the growth opportunities ahead.","HBO has also been blazing the trail in conducting with consumers through its streaming product, which added distribution on Microsoft's Xbox, on Samsung's Smart TVs, Sony's PlayStation and Amazon Prime channels in 2016.","In total, HBO recently surpassed 2 million domestic over-the-top subscribers, so we're really pleased with the progress. And HBO is just as focused on reaching consumers abroad, with over-the-top lunches in Spain, Brazil and Argentina in 2016.","Finally, let's turn to Warner Bros., the global entertainment leader. Warner's had another record year with strong results in television and film and a growing consumer products business that ties into its focus on franchise properties.","In movies, we reached nearly $5 billion in global box office. That's the second best year in our history, and it was driven across a range of hits led by our franchise releases Batman versus Superman, Suicide Squad, and Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them. But the depth and diversity of our slate was also on display with strong performances from movies like Central Intelligence, Lights Out, The Conjuring 2 and Sully.","We are just as excited about 2017, with a lineup that starts with The LEGO Batman Movie, which opened, by the way, this weekend. And we also have the highly anticipated next installments in our DC slate with Wonder Woman in June and Justice League in November.","In television, at Warner's, we were the number one supplier to broadcast networks again. This is now for the eighth year in a row, with at least four shows on each network this season. And that includes: the number one overall series on television, The Big Bang Theory; and the number one non-scripted series on television, The Voice; as well as newcomers like Lethal Weapon and Riverdale.","We've mentioned before that our DC franchise has been one of our most important priorities at Warner's. And you can see the results, not just at the box office, but also: in the 10 DC-based shows we have on TV, in the $4.5 billion consumers spent on DC merchandise last year, contributing to our record performance in consumer products, and finally, in our hit videogame franchises, including Injustice 2, which will release this coming May.","Similar to Turner and HBO, Warner Bros. also continues to make strides in developing direct-to-consumer capabilities to serve its fans in today's evolving environment. We created the Warner Bros. Digital Networks division and we closed deals to buy Machinima, giving us a platform to connect to coveted and hard-to-reach young gamers, and DramaFever, which gives us the capability to launch and operate new over-the-top broadband VOD services.","Across our company, we had a very active and successful year. And we're inspired by the future of media that we're helping to shape. As we have said many times before, connecting more directly with consumers as our businesses evolve, both within and outside the existing ecosystem, is one of our most important strategic priorities. And we're making a lot of progress.","We believe our deal to be acquired by AT&T, which we announced on October 22, will further enhance our ability to innovate and thrive. The special meeting of shareholders to vote on the transaction will be held a week from today. The regulatory review process is underway and we remain confident that the deal will be approved later this year.","Once that happens, we're very excited about the potential of combining AT&T's great strength in mobile and video distribution and its fantastic customer relationships, with the world's greatest storyteller, and the value we can create together by accelerating the evolution of our company and our industries for the benefit of consumers.","In the meantime, we remain very confident in our ability to continue to lead the industry, both creatively and financially, not just for 2017, but for many years to come. Thanks again for listening.","And, with that, let me turn it over to Howard.","Howard M. Averill - Time Warner, Inc.","Thanks, Jeff, and good morning. I'll begin by referring to the first slide of our presentation, which is now available on our website. Starting with consolidated results, we finished 2016 with a great fourth quarter. Revenues increased 11%. Adjusted operating income was up a very strong 25%, with growth across all divisions. And adjusted EPS grew 18%.","We also had strong results for the full year, with revenue up 4%, adjusted operating income up 10% and each of our divisions posted record profits, leading to our eighth consecutive year of double-digit growth in adjusted EPS. Margins expanded over 100 basis points for the year, even as we increased our investment in content and marketing across the company to over $15 billion. And we continue to remain focused on tightly managing overhead costs and operating efficiently to help fund these investments.","Adjusted EPS increased 23% to $5.86 for the year, which included a $0.29 net tax benefit related to a tax accounting method change that we recognized in the third quarter. Excluding the tax benefit, adjusted EPS would have increased a robust 17% to $5.57, led by our strong operating performance as well as a lower share count.","In 2016, we repurchased $2.3 billion of our stock prior to discontinuing share repurchases in October as a result of the pending merger with AT&T. And combined with our dividend, we returned close to $3.6 billion to shareholders during the year. So we delivered strong financial results in 2016, while continuing to make investments across our businesses to sustain attractive growth over the long-term. And we expect to carry that momentum into 2017.","Looking ahead, in order to better reflect our operating performance and given the volatility in certain below-the-line items that impact our adjusted EPS, we are providing 2017 guidance for adjusted operating income, which we expect will grow in the high single-digits based on current exchange rates. I'll provide more context on the key drivers across our businesses throughout my presentation.","Now, turning to the segments, I'll start at Turner, where we closed out a record year with another quarter of strong profit growth, as we continue to benefit from our domestic affiliate renewals. Subscription revenues increased 14% in the fourth quarter and were up 12% for the year, including 150 basis point FX headwind.","Domestic subscription revenues grew 15% in the quarter and we finished 2016 up over 14%, on the higher end of what we expected coming into the year. So we're really pleased with the outcome of our affiliate renewals, and we remain confident in our outlook for solid double-digit domestic subscription revenue growth in 2017. International subscription revenue was up in the high single digits in the quarter, and that included a 300 basis point drag from FX.","Advertising revenue was down 2% in the fourth quarter. That was a bit below our expectations because of a slowdown in certain international regions. As a result, international advertising declined mid-single digits, excluding about a 350 basis point drag from FX. However, we still believe secular trends internationally remain strong.","Domestically, we face a 300 basis point headwind from the comparison to last year's record Major League Baseball post-season performance. Even so, advertising was flat in the quarter. That capped off a strong year for domestic advertising, which increased mid-single digits. The growth was led by the record performance at our news business, as it benefited from the presidential election coverage as well as healthy demand for premium sports properties.","Looking at the first quarter, we expect total advertising revenue to be flat to up low single digits. The scatter market remains healthy, with pricing up double digits versus the upfront at our domestic entertainment network. And we expect our sports and news businesses to be the key drivers and international trends to improve.","Moving on, Turner's strong revenue trends resulted in adjusted operating income growth of 9% in the fourth quarter and 8% for the year, and we achieved that while continuing to make significant investments at programming, marketing and new digital initiatives. Programming expenses were flat in the fourth quarter and up low single digits, excluding programming charges from both periods. For the full year, programming was up 5%, primarily related to higher sports costs and CNN's election coverage.","Marketing costs increased around 20% both for the quarter and the year, as we invested in the rebrands at TNT and TBS, including support for our new original series. Overall, Turner delivered great financial results in 2016 and has a lot of operating momentum. And with the strength of our brands and the investments we're making across the business, we believe we're very well-positioned to continue delivering attractive growth for the long-term.","Turning now to HBO, where our investments in high quality programming contributed to double-digit profit growth in the fourth quarter and out-positioned HBO to capitalize on the big global opportunity for subscription services. Domestic subscription revenue was up in the mid-single digits for the quarter and the year. Similar to recent quarters, we continue to see subscriber headwinds at our traditional affiliates, especially those involved in M&A integration. As a result, despite very strong growth in digital subscribers, total domestic subs across HBO and Cinemax were essentially flat for the year.","Looking forward, we believe HBO has a big untapped subscriber opportunity in the U.S. And capitalizing on that is our most important long-term growth driver. So on the deals we've recently signed, we're emphasizing subscriber growth. That means as our partners grow HBO subs, it will benefit our subscription revenue growth. And while it takes time to implement new deals, we're very encouraged with the initial progress on the deals we've closed. However, finishing this affiliate cycle has taken longer than anticipated, and we're still in the midst of renewing some deals. So we do not expect sequential improvement in subscription revenue growth in the first quarter. But we do anticipate that sub revenue trends will improve as the year progresses, especially in the second half of 2017 as we complete affiliate negotiations and continue to expand our digital distribution.","We've seen a nice pickup in OTT sub growth recently. And our goal is to add more digital partners later this year. Along with a return to Subscription growth in our traditional business, that should contribute to a solid increase in total subs for the year. And taking all these factors into account, we anticipate high single-digit growth in Subscription revenue for the year.","Moving on, Content and other revenues were up 7% for the quarter, mainly due to higher home video revenue. For the year, Content and other revenues grew 2%, primarily reflecting healthy growth in international licensing as demand for HBO's original content remains robust. Across HBO's international networks, including unconsolidated JVs, revenues were up double digits for the year, excluding FX, and that's a result of strong trends in the Nordics and LatAm.","Adjusted operating income was up 10% for the quarter and 3% for the year. Programming expenses declined 2% in the fourth quarter, given the comparison to last year's programming charges. Excluding the charges from both periods and the benefit from reduced amortization this year, programming costs were up double digits in the quarter and the year.","That's a result of our continued investments in original programming, including new series like Westworld, Divorce, The Night Of and Insecure. So we continued to make progress on our strategic initiatives in 2016 and we have a lot of momentum on the content side. With global demand for HBO's distinctive premium content only growing and Subscription revenue trends improving, we're confident HBO can deliver healthy growth for years to come.","Now looking at Warner Bros., where our theatrical business continues to perform exceptionally well, thanks to our franchise-led film slate. And that resulted in significant profit growth, including record adjusted operating income for both the quarter and the year. Coming into the year, we planned for theatrical to be the primary driver at Warner's and that's exactly what played out. Our two DC movies and first Fantastic Beasts installment led a very strong, diverse slate that drove high single-digit growth in theatrical revenues in 2016. And we more than doubled theatrical profits, making this our most profitable film slate in close to a decade.","The success of the film slate is also contributing to healthy growth in our consumer products business, where revenue increased close to 40% last year. So we're already benefiting from the new strategy we put in place and think we have a big opportunity to keep growing our consumer products business over the next few years.","In TV, we had difficult comparisons on the licensing side, but total revenues were up in the quarter and for the year, mainly due to double-digit growth in initial telecast revenue. That's a result of increased production, reflecting Warner's continued expansion at the cable, premium and SVOD production. Additionally, we continue to benefit from strong international licensing demand for Warner's TV content.","As we discussed, we also had difficult comparison from games after record results in 2015 and no franchise console releases last year. So as expected, revenues declined significantly. Looking to 2017, we have a strong lineup, anchored by two franchise console releases and several mobile games, so we're set up for a great year in games.","Across theatrical and TV, home entertainment revenues were down double digits for the year, primarily due to fewer releases and a softer home video release schedule, but revenue did grow starting in the second half of 2016 as our franchise titles started to move into the home entertainment window. We also remain encouraged by EST which was up double digits for the year. And digital now represents about half of our home entertainment profits, so we're encouraged as we head into 2017, when we expect to grow both home entertainment revenue and profit.","Overall, Warner Bros. had another terrific year, thanks to great execution of its strategy focused on monetizing key global franchises across all its businesses. And with a tremendous multi-year film slate, healthy trends in the TV business and upcoming franchise games releases, Warner is positioned to deliver strong growth in adjusted operating income in 2017 and beyond.","Turning to the next slide, we also had a great year for free cash flow, which increased 22% to a record $4.4 billion. So we converted 94% of our earnings into cash, continuing our strong track record of conversion.","We benefited from a strong growth in adjusted operating income as well as lower cash taxes related to the tax accounting change I mentioned earlier. Looking to 2017, while we certainly have difficult comparisons, especially on cash taxes, we expect strong conversion and another year of healthy free cash flow.","Moving on to our balance sheet, we ended 2016 with $22.8 billion of net debt. That's up from 2015, mainly due to our share repurchases and dividends. It also reflects about $1 billion in debt redemption premiums and costs associated with our tender offers in December. We expect about $800 million on M&A for the year, largely related to the investment in Hulu we made in August. So we ended the year right around our leverage target of 2.75 times. And with share repurchases discontinued, we continue to expect our net leverage ratio to decline as we progress through 2017.","So on the whole, we had a great year in 2016, and we believe we're set up for a strong 2017. And I'll touch on some of the key items for the year ahead. Starting at Turner, we anticipate solid double-digit domestic subscription revenue growth as we continue to benefit from our affiliate renewals. At the same time, as we planned for, we expect programming costs to grow in the double digits, primarily due to new MBA, deal which will account for approximately $400 million of incremental costs in the first half of 2017.","And similar to the past few years, Turner remains focused on constraining overhead costs to help fund these investments in great content and new growth opportunities. So that should add up to another year of healthy revenue trends and solid profit growth at Turner.","At HBO, as I mentioned, we expect Subscription revenue growth to be in the high-single digits in 2017. That growth should step up through the year as we complete additional affiliate deals, continue to make progress implementing our new deals and expand digital distribution. The improvement in Subscription revenue trends should translate to attractive adjusted operating income growth in 2017.","At Warner's, we're also poised for healthy growth in adjusted operating income, led by our theatrical and videogame businesses. Our franchise slate continues in 2017 with two more DC films as well as The LEGO Batman Movie. And we expect other businesses like home entertainment, consumer products and TV licensing will benefit from the strong film slate and recent theatrical success. I already mentioned our strong games slate this year. We also continue to see healthy demand in our TV business and expect another year of solid results as we further expand production.","So we're positioned to deliver attractive financial results at all of our businesses, and that's reflected in our expectation for 2017 adjusted operating income growth to be in the high single digits. Given the NBA deal cost in the first half, the timing of improvement in HBO sub revenue trends and the cadence of the film and games slate at Warner Bros., at this point, we anticipate that growth will be heavily weighted to the second half of the year.","Overall, we're very pleased about how we're executing across the company and the progress we're making on key initiatives. And we expect to deliver healthy growth in 2017, even as we continue to make important investments in high-quality video content and new business models that should position us to sustain attractive growth trends well into the future.","With that, let me turn it back to Jessica to start the Q&A.","Jessica L. Holscott - Time Warner, Inc.","Great, thanks, Howard. Rob, do you want to open up the queue and take the first question, please?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Yes. Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of John Janedis with Jefferies. Please proceed with your questions.","John Janedis - Jefferies LLC","Thank you. Jeff, understanding many of the virtual MVPDs haven't launched yet, based on what you're seeing or expecting, can you update us on your view to what extent you think they'll be incremental to the ecosystem? And do you think that'll be clear by the end of this year or is that more of a multi-year story in terms of playing out?","Jeff L. Bewkes - Time Warner, Inc.","And I'll start and go to John. Look, there's a lot of them that have different price points, as we all know. There is also a fair degree of variation in the reach of some of these virtual MVPDs in terms of their sub bases and platform. So, all that's a very healthy development as we've been predicting. You have new entrants coming in all the time; Amazon, Hulu, et cetera.","Given the range of all of these things, I think, it's safe to say that what they're going to help do is invigorate consumer interest everywhere in watching networks on demand, watching them on-the-go in mobile devices, and a whole range of offerings, which is what I think we'd all like to see. And what that's doing is fueling production \u2013 increases in production spending across the network industry. So, terrific and, of course, Warner's, as the biggest supplier to all networks, is part of that.","I think it's too early to say, if you're asking for timing, what the relative size of the virtual MVPD sub growth is, let's say, in 2017 versus what the continued slope of the at-home ecosystem sub count turns out to be. So I don't have a specific answer for that. And, John, let me turn it to you, put the pressure on you if you have one.","John K. Martin - Time Warner, Inc.","Yeah. No, look, I don't have a lot to add to that. But I would say that our outlook doesn't assume a material benefit this year from virtual MVPD. So that's important when you think about the guidance we've given for Subscription revenues. But certainly, there's an opportunity for that. Between DIRECTV NOW, Sling and Sony, each of them have really started to gain traction very recently, proving that there is consumer demand for smaller video packages with top networks at lower prices.","I think if you aggregate the number of subscribers for the three, we're approaching 2 million now in the United States. And if new OTT offerings can combine attractive pricing and packaging with great on-demand content, better interfaces and easier navigation, we think that we can attract new subs into the ecosystem. And, importantly, we think a lot of these subs are not cannibalizing existing subscribers. So that's a great opportunity for Turner to take share, since we're in all the major virtual MVPDs that have launched to-date. And we expect to be in those packages with wide consumer appeal.","John Janedis - Jefferies LLC","That's helpful. Thanks, guys. Maybe, Howard, quickly, you talked about the affiliate fee growth in the U.S. coming in at the top end of the expectation for the year. Can you talk about the drivers of that? Did the sub declines come in better for the year or was there some sort of positive mix to highlight?","Howard M. Averill - Time Warner, Inc.","I think sub declines have been what we've expected. I mean, we've always talked about the fact that in any given quarter, you can see some minor adjustments and that's why we have focused overall on the full year. But there's nothing in particular that's driving that, John.","John Janedis - Jefferies LLC","All right. Thank you.","Jeff L. Bewkes - Time Warner, Inc.","Yeah. I mean, there were some minor adjustments that went our way, effectively. Yeah.","Howard M. Averill - Time Warner, Inc.","Yeah.","Jessica L. Holscott - Time Warner, Inc.","Thanks, John. We're ready for the next question.","Operator","Next question is from the line of Michael Morris with Guggenheim Securities.","Michael Morris - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Thank you. Good morning. Two topics, first on HBO, the 2 million domestic over-the-top subs is an impressive number. But to your point, it doesn't seem to be additive yet and you're focused on the subscriber growth next year. Can you talk in a little more detail about how in your renegotiations you're able to move to that subscriber growth that you're anticipating? Anything to help us on the mechanics there would be great. And then, second, you have made some big investments in basketball. We've seen weakness in ratings at football over the past year and that's caused some concern about these sports rights. Could you just tell us what you're seeing in basketball and why you feel optimistic about the value of those contracts? Thanks.","Richard L. Plepler - Time Warner, Inc.","Mike, hi. It's Richard. Thank you for your question. The deals that we completed already, I think, are very indicative of why we're so encouraged and why we're looking optimistically and confidently to sub revenue acceleration second half of the year. Look, the blended penetration on the two deals that we completed is less than 50% of what the acquired company's penetration is. And we built incentives into those deals to drive that blended penetration up not only to where the acquired companies are, which are in the high 30%s, low 40%s, but beyond that.","So as we look forward with those partners, the nature of the packaging, the nature of the marketing makes us very comfortable that we're going to see that sub acceleration, number one. Number two, in the deals, couple of deals that we have remaining, I think they, too, are going to see the opportunity before them to grow penetration beyond where they are now. And in some of our higher performing affiliates, I think, there's an opportunity to go even further.","So we like the deals that we've completed. We'll finish the rest of our deals in the coming months. And I would say about our OTT business, it's very, very dynamic. It's actually 3X of the number that we reported at the end of 2015. And I think that shows not only the robust demand for HBO, but the opportunity we have out there not only in the traditional ecosystem but outside of it. So we're looking very confidently to this year. These deals take time. The integration takes time. In one of our major deals, they're just beginning to put us into the packaging that we've codified into the deal at the end of this month. And so, that's really what the lag is, but it will kick in in the second half of the year.","Jeff L. Bewkes - Time Warner, Inc.","And, John, do basketball.","John K. Martin - Time Warner, Inc.","Yeah. So, Mike, listen, I feel really confident in the sports that we're in. And if you look across the industry, ratings, in general, have improved recently, as we've moved past the election. We've seen better match-ups and more competitive games. So I think that indicates that the declines that were occurring back in the summer and the early fall are not really necessarily indicative of secular trends. And we're seeing very strong advertiser demand for both the NBA and the NCAA Men's Basketball Championship.","So we continue to feel really good about our premium sports properties, but just to amplify one more thing, you can't forget about the importance of match-ups in competitive games. And when we look at the season, whether it's Cleveland versus Golden State or Oklahoma versus the Clippers or the Lakers versus Portland, those games all performed extremely well, with us growing year-over-year. So I think we're going to continue to hope for competitive games, but we love the advertiser demand and we are optimistic that we're going to be able to continue to grow our ratings for these properties.","Michael Morris - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Great. Thank you.","Jessica L. Holscott - Time Warner, Inc.","We're ready for the next question.","Operator","And next question is from the line of Vasily Karasyov with CLSA. Please go ahead with your questions.","Jessica L. Holscott - Time Warner, Inc.","Vasily, are you there?","Vasily Karasyov - CLSA Americas LLC","I'm here. Sorry. My question is for Kevin. Kevin, you had a fantastic couple of years at Warner Bros. But if one was to look forward, you're already the number one supplier in TV. The international box office, which fueled growth for many in the past decade, is not growing anymore as fast. Games come and go. What gives you confidence that you can continue to deliver growth from this very high base at this point? Can you just give us an idea what the drivers are maybe a little longer-term than 2017, what Howard outlined? Thank you very much.","Kevin Tsujihara - Time Warner, Inc.","Great. Thank you for the question. I think that, as Howard mentioned both for 2017 and beyond, we still believe that there's growth in the theatrical business. Our franchise strategy is off to a great start. We think we're going to continue that in 2017. Then, when we look at what we have in 2018 and 2019, and we feel very good about it. We also feel that we could still grow on television. And while the growth won't occur primarily in broadcast, where we've been number one for a long time, we do feel that there are opportunities in premium, in pay and in cable. And I feel really good about the fact that we did Westworld with HBO and Richard this year and Animal Kingdom with John. And we had some really big hits for Netflix with Fuller House and Gilmore Girls as well. So that is a business that we think that we can grow, and continue to grow.","Games, again, it's a business while it's lumpy, we feel like we can create more sustainable pipeline as we get more to scale there on the console side. We have two big console games this year. And it's our goal to be able to put out a more consistent path with those games, but also grow mobile, which doesn't have that lumpiness.","So if you look at those three big drivers on the content side, that creates opportunities for consumer products. And geography-wise, we think that there's big opportunity in China. We continue to develop a SVOD service. It's doing very well with our partner, Tencent. And we also believe that our partnership to create local language content, as well as export content into China is going create a big a growth opportunity for the company in the coming years. So we think that we feel good about 2017 and, more importantly, we feel about the growth trajectory going forward","Jeff L. Bewkes - Time Warner, Inc.","Vasily, this is Jeff. I just want to thank you for asking a question to Kevin, flew all the way here from L.A. It's 5:00 in the morning for him, and for pointing out that Warner's doing so well. Thank you.","Vasily Karasyov - CLSA Americas LLC","My pleasure. Thank you.","Kevin Tsujihara - Time Warner, Inc.","I'll send you the studio tour tickets later.","Jessica L. Holscott - Time Warner, Inc.","Operator, the next question.","Operator","Oh, Yes. The next question is from the line of Benjamin Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your questions.","Ryan Fiftal - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. It's actually Ryan Fiftal on for Ben. So if there are any tickets left, I'll ask one for Kevin, and then I have one for Richard as well, if I may. So, Kevin, on your early VOD, can you give us any update on progress you're making constructing a new window there? And then, maybe on, I guess, on your list of strategic priorities, how high does premium VOD rank as something you think can move the needle for Warner's?","Kevin Tsujihara - Time Warner, Inc.","I was talking to Jeff about this yesterday. I think that we're making a lot of progress, because part of the reason that's driving us is consumers, and the economics of the film business. Because I think what you're seeing is, we talk a lot about these franchises, but the middle of the market in the theatrical business has gotten extremely tough. And we do think that having products like this, that are giving movies to consumers who want them earlier in the home, is a big opportunity. So we've been aggressively working with exhibitors to talk about models that will grow the market versus cannibalize the market.","And we think that we're making a lot of progress on that end, because, ultimately, it's not really about business model per se, but it's really about giving consumers what they want, because if we don't give it to them, they're going to go to the pirated version.","So this is very high on our list, and I think that it has the potential to change some of the economics of some of the films, the adult dramas that we're having problems with right now on the theatrical side, which is really important for a company like ours that creates a real broad slate every year.","Jessica L. Holscott - Time Warner, Inc.","What was your second question? I didn't catch it","Ryan Fiftal - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Oh, no. I haven't asked it. So thank you, Kevin. And, Richard, it sounds like your HBO's OTT business has accelerated quite a bit. So can you give any sense of how important distribution through Amazon has been to that growth? I think it's only been a few months, if I'm right there, that you've been on that platform. But any color on the early results and performance there would be helpful. Thank you.","Richard L. Plepler - Time Warner, Inc.","Sure. We're thrilled with it. It's accelerated very quickly. And I think it shows what we've said all along, which is the more opportunities we have to distribute HBO through a multitude of different distribution services and give our consumer the option to get it however and wherever they want, the better it is for our brand. So they've been a terrific new partner. There will be other digital partners that you will see announced in the coming weeks and months. And that's why we're so optimistic not only about our traditional business, but about our OTT business as well","Ryan Fiftal - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","All right. Thank you.","Jessica L. Holscott - Time Warner, Inc.","We're ready for the next question.","Operator","Yes. The next question is coming from the line of Alexia Quadrani with JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question.","Alexia S. Quadrani - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you. Two questions, please, first on Warner Bros., Kevin, given the rapid demand that we've seen in original content or demand for TV series, there's clearly been, obviously, a big benefit for Warner Bros., but sort of digging in to that a bit further, beyond just having higher demand, we're hearing that the terms have become much more favorable to the producers of these TV series, in terms of guaranteed pickup of an entire series or better pricing and such. Is that a real notable change in the sense are you seeing, I mean, is it more like just chatter about it or you're actually seeing real benefits from that sort of shift in leverage to the studio side?","Kevin Tsujihara - Time Warner, Inc.","I think there's a shift in leverage in the high-quality shows that really break out and the bifurcation that we're seeing on the theatrical side, where a disproportionate share of the revenue's going to the bigger movies. These big franchise movies are taking a bigger and bigger share. The big television shows, like Westworld, that break out are more valuable than ever, because there's more original content out there, but there's less things as a result because there's more competitions for things that really break out. And so when you have those and you have AAA talent who typically garner that kind of attention, I think it is more valuable and there is a little bit more leverage on that side.","Alexia S. Quadrani - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And then, just a quick question on Turner, if I can, I think you guys have previously said, if I remember correctly, that CNN should have record profitability in 2017. And I guess with such the news frenzy that has sustained, which is obviously good news for viewership, given the new administration and all the chaos there, can costs really come down, I guess, significantly this year? Just any color on that would be great.","John K. Martin - Time Warner, Inc.","Well, CNN had started the year with a continuing amount of significant momentum that it took outside of last year. As Jeff said, it's the most-watched year ever in the history of CNN. It was closer to Fox News than it's been in eight years and had the greatest advantage over MSNBC since 2009. And the strategy this year, we fully expect that linear ratings for the entire year are not going to be able to stay at last year's record levels, so we could have some difficult advertising comps, but CNN still has great momentum thanks to its strategy, which is multi-pronged. It's going all-in on covering big stories. It's adding originals. There'll be more hours of originals this year than in the past, which brings younger viewers to the network and usually garners big audiences. And it's investing in digital, which we expect is going to keep growing. It's been growing at revenue double digits.","Digital now represents 25% of all CNN's overall ad revenue and last year, had its best year ever overtaking Yahoo! News. So I think CNN is positioned for another record year of profit growth in 2017. We're highly confident that we're going to be able to achieve that. And that's going to be led by a healthy increase in affiliate revenues and absolutely lower election expenses.","Alexia S. Quadrani - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you very much.","Jessica L. Holscott - Time Warner, Inc.","Thanks, Alexia. We're ready for the next question.","Operator","Yes. Our next question is from the line of Kannan Venkateshwar with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Kannan Venkateshwar - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you. Jeff, just one question on BAMTech, recently, you guys decided to walk away from BAMTech and focus on a JV with NBC. Given the focus on digital distribution, just want to understand the thought process behind that. And, Howard, just one question on amort on HBO, I think this quarter again some of the programming amortization lifetime was changed. I think this was the second quarter over the last year, just wanted to understand the thought process behind that. Thanks.","Jeff L. Bewkes - Time Warner, Inc.","All right. Do you want to do...?","Richard L. Plepler - Time Warner, Inc.","It's Richard. Let me answer your BAMTech question. First of all, our deal with BAM goes through the end of this year, so we're still working very closely with them. We obviously partnered with them to help launch HBO NOW, but, at the same time, we were parallel processing building our own tech stack, which I will remind you was in place and enabled us to launch HBO GO. So we've always had it in mind that we would create the ability to blend the tech stacks for GO and NOW, build one global platform and have our own capacity to launch streaming services all over the world. That's what we've done. They've been absolutely an enhanced part of our strategy. And we will continue to work with them, I expect, over the years, but we also are going to move forward doing it on our own.","Jeff L. Bewkes - Time Warner, Inc.","Let me just add \u2013 this as Jeff \u2013 before Howard can get to amort. John, you've got iStreamPlanet.","John K. Martin - Time Warner, Inc.","Yes.","Jeff L. Bewkes - Time Warner, Inc.","Kevin, you've got FilmStruck. We have platforms like that across the company and AT&T has it also. So bear that in mind as you think about essentially the building capabilities across the company to deliver direct-to-consumer variety of products, SVOD platforms and other kinds of direct consumer platforms.","John K. Martin - Time Warner, Inc.","And right now a lot of the technology stacks that you were just referring to have complementary capabilities. Some are better with live streaming. Some are better with VOD. Some have customer care capabilities. And the goal would be for us to work more collaboratively over time to rationalize the overall technology footprint. And, as you said, really excited to see how AT&T can help super-charge that.","Jeff L. Bewkes - Time Warner, Inc.","Kevin, do you want to add?","Kevin Tsujihara - Time Warner, Inc.","No, I think that we're looking at a number of things between Turner and Warner Bros. where we're doing exactly that because -","Jeff L. Bewkes - Time Warner, Inc.","The kids -","Kevin Tsujihara - Time Warner, Inc.","We haven't announced. But they're things that we're doing to take advantage, exactly what you said, that there's certain things that we all do that are slightly different. And the key thing is just taking the best of the best.","Jeff L. Bewkes - Time Warner, Inc.","Yes.","Kevin Tsujihara - Time Warner, Inc.","Do you want to do the amort?","Howard M. Averill - Time Warner, Inc.","On the amortization, so back in the second quarter, we did make a change in our amortization, which really was a reflection of how our programming is being used, particularly with a lot of On Demand and HBO GO. The programming is \u2013 it does have a longer life. And so we did make an adjustment. But just to be clear, it's still significantly accelerated, as it was before, where the vast majority of the costs are incurred upfront. But we did have a benefit. Most of the benefit, by the way, came in the second quarter when we made the change. We did have about $20 million of benefit in the fourth quarter. And as we look ahead to next year, we don't see any net benefit from that as we look ahead to 2017.","Kannan Venkateshwar - Barclays Capital, Inc.","All right. Thank you.","Jessica L. Holscott - Time Warner, Inc.","Great. Thanks. We're ready for the next question.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Bryan Kraft with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Bryan Kraft - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning. Wanted to ask a couple questions on HBO. I guess, first, how are you thinking about using the incremental margin that will be generated by the acceleration in affiliate growth? Are you thinking of reinvesting it to expand into content slate, marketing, to drive more sub growth or will we see some of that flow to the bottom line and expand margins? And then, also just wanted to ask if you could comment just on the behavior that you've seen in terms of churn. Obviously around big content releases like Game of Thrones or Westworld, you're going to see higher gross adds. And just curious if you can comment on what you've seen after people have consumed those series, whether they stick around. Thanks.","Richard L. Plepler - Time Warner, Inc.","Sure. Thank you. Yeah. Let me do the second first. On churn, particularly over the last few months, we've seen the lowest churn in \u2013 really, since the beginning of introducing HBO NOW and our OTT product. That, I think, is a result of two things. Number one, as our subscriber base ages, there's, of course, less churn. Number two, I think it speaks to the quality of the content and the range of the content. I think it's important to remember when you look at the usage on digital platforms and On Demand you see the usage going across a wide range of categories. It's not just Westworld and Game of Thrones and The Night Of. It's comedies. It's late night. It's documentaries. It's sports programming. It's important to punctuate that the usage of HBO programming is across a wide range of genres. And we're in the business, of course, of curating great content. So we're very encouraged by what we've seen on churn.","Your question about investment, yes, we're going to take those margins and we are going to invest a lot of it in what we do for a living, which is trying to make the best content and curate the best content across a lot of different genres of our programming. And the exciting thing is the amount of talent that continues to come to the door with new projects, literally on a weekly basis, gives us no shortage; in fact, gives us an embarrassment of riches to choose from. And we're very excited about the announcement that you'll see in the coming weeks for 2018. And the investment that we're going to make robustly in programming speaks to, I think, the best of the brand.","Bryan Kraft - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thanks, Richard.","Richard L. Plepler - Time Warner, Inc.","All right.","Jessica L. Holscott - Time Warner, Inc.","Rob, I think, we have time for just one more question now.","Operator","Yes. That question will be coming from the line of Doug Mitchelson with UBS. Please go ahead with your question.","Doug Mitchelson - UBS Securities LLC","Snuck in. I wanted to throw my hat in the ring for tickets as well. So, Kevin, is there a meaningful incremental revenue opportunity for in-season stacking rights, or has that been captured already? And since it's a new year, any evolution that we should expect in SVOD licensing strategy, especially since Time Warner, obviously, last year joined Hulu as a minority shareholder? And for Jeff, there's been a lot of discussion on over-the-top and direct-to-consumer on this call and others in media.","I was curious. Do you look at the TV network business as ultimately continuing to be a regional business or developing into a global network business? And the reason I ask is there's an argument that TV networks are going global and direct-to-consumer and that those economics will be superior and more sustainable. And Netflix and Amazon are there. Fox is headed there quickly. You've got CNN globally, but many of your other networks are regional. So I'm just curious. How do you see the marketplace evolving and what it might mean, if anything, for Time Warner in that regard? Thanks.","Jeff L. Bewkes - Time Warner, Inc.","For the product sales side -","Kevin Tsujihara - Time Warner, Inc.","Well, on the stacking rights, I think, that we're confident that we're going to be able to reach stacking rights agreements with everyone. And all the networks that we do business with will have the capability to be able to offer a range of product with stacking rights, because we think it's great for the consumer. And you're looking at what the viewing trends are and they need to be able to do that.","As it relates to any change in the way that we kind of view SVOD and our licensing strategy, I think, that we continue to look at it on a product-by-product basis and we continue to evaluate it. And we're going to continue doing that. But the marketplace is evolving, both domestically and internationally. And I think that you're going to continue to see everyone look at and evaluate each piece of content going forward.","Doug Mitchelson - UBS Securities LLC","And, Kevin, just to be clear, is the new season stacking rights pulling forward syndication revenue or do you think it's a net increase in the monetization of your TV products?","Jeff L. Bewkes - Time Warner, Inc.","Net increase.","Kevin Tsujihara - Time Warner, Inc.","Yes. It's a net increase of the license fee, the existing license fee, for that run. It's not seen as a syndication piece.","Jeff L. Bewkes - Time Warner, Inc.","Well, you can do it both ways.","Kevin Tsujihara - Time Warner, Inc.","You could, but primarily driven that way.","Jeff L. Bewkes - Time Warner, Inc.","So I think you're asking about national networks and SVOD services, say, across the United States versus global across 7 billion people. Is that what you're asking?","Doug Mitchelson - UBS Securities LLC","Yeah. I was asking if you think the world is headed that way and if it has any implications for Time Warner.","Jeff L. Bewkes - Time Warner, Inc.","Okay. Well, yeah, the world is heading, as we all know, towards more global access by people to either a given show or a given network, and as you see the development of that \u2013 I know you were referencing some brands that started in the tech world. If you think of something like either CNN or HBO and then you can expand that out to other networks, things like CNN and HBO are global brands. They've got global distribution now.","What we've been doing over the years is we've essentially tried to capitalize on these SVOD and linear network opportunities going global in terms of territory and going digital in terms of VOD across platforms, so not just TV but mobile devices. The bulk of people in an India or Brazil are watching differently on different device set-ups than, say, those in Western Europe or the United States.","So we've been pursuing essentially that strategy of distribution for our networks that optimizes the reach of whatever distribution is in place. So there's a combination. HBO is an easy way to describe it because it started VOD and it started more global distribution, as did CNN, so we've got places where HBO is over-the-top direct as a network. We just launched a few in Western Europe, Spain. We are launching in Latin America. We have things in Eastern Europe like that.","We also have HBO in Western Europe licensed into other SVOD like Sky and other sorts of platforms if they have superior reach and can therefore get our programming, which is usually branded as HBO Neighborhood Programming, and it then creates a choice as time goes on of whether we decide to move to direct network full schedule or whether we continue to license to optimize the value of the network name and the programming associated with it.","You've got examples of Turner doing that at FilmStruck. You've got examples of Warner's doing it in China with \u2013 what are we, the second largest SVOD service in China?","Kevin Tsujihara - Time Warner, Inc.","Yes.","Jeff L. Bewkes - Time Warner, Inc.","And HBO was right alongside of that, licensed into that service.","So, yes, of course, everybody that has programming and that can support a network will try to create optimal reach either for the shows or the network, and to the extent you can fill it out to a full network, that's a valuable asset. And we're moving in that direction where we can. And we're moving to supply those networks that have the reach, and can collect the money for us, where those conditions don't apply.","Jessica L. Holscott - Time Warner, Inc.","Great. Thanks, Jeff.","Doug Mitchelson - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. That was very helpful. Thank you.","Jessica L. Holscott - Time Warner, Inc.","So thank you, everyone, for joining. That just concludes the earnings call. So thank you.","Operator","Thank you. You may now disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation."]}}
