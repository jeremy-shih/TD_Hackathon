And welcome to the Third Quarter 2014 Concho Resources Earnings Conference Call. My name is Lisa, and I will be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.","I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Ms. Megan Hays, Director of Investor Relations. Please proceed.","Megan Hays","Thank you. Good morning, and thank you for joining Concho's Third Quarter Conference Call. I'd like to take a minute to direct your attention to the disclaimers, including the forward-looking statement disclaimer contained in our press release.","The disclaimer says that statements in our press release and on this conference call regarding the company's or management's expectations or predictions of the future are forward-looking statements intended to be covered by the safe harbor provisions under federal securities laws. There are many factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations, including those we've described in the press release, our 10-K and our other filings with the SEC.","In addition, we will reference certain non-GAAP measures. Please see the reconciliations in our earnings release.","I'd also like to point out that in addition to our earnings release, we have posted a presentation, which can be found on our website at concho.com.","On today's call, Tim Leach, our Chairman, President and CEO, will review our results for the quarter and discuss our outlook for '15. Following Tim's comments, we'll turn the call over for Q&A. [Operator Instructions]","With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Tim.","Timothy A. Leach","Good morning. Concho had a great third quarter from both an operational and a financial perspective. Our performance this quarter is a result of our long-held strategy to develop high-margin, high-return projects.","Looking at the third quarter's results, I'm going to start on Slide 3. Total company production surpassed 10 million barrels in the third quarter and averaged nearly 114,000 barrels per day. Third quarter's production grew 20% year-over-year and 6% quarter-over-quarter. Our total crude oil production was up 23% year-over-year and marked our 19th consecutive quarter of oil production growth from continuing operations. Horizontal production from the Delaware Basin is leading the way, with average daily production just over 55,000 barrels a day, up 12% quarter-over-quarter.","During late September, along -- areas along the Pecos River in the Northern Delaware Basin received anywhere from 50% to 100% of annual rainfall over the course of a week causing floods, production downtime, road closures and drilling and completion delays. While our team's quick response and the flexibility to redeploy drilling and frac crews to unaffected areas minimized shut-ins and delays, third quarter production was impacted by approximately 2,000 barrels per day. Without the weather, third quarter production would have hit the high end of our guidance range.","Despite the headwind this quarter, we achieved excellent results across our assets and delivered year-over-year increases in earnings, EBITDA, and adjusted cash flow.","In the third quarter, EBITDA increased 18% over third quarter '13. Year-to-date, we generated $1.3 billion in adjusted cash flow, up 39% over the same period last year. We're running 37 rigs, including 31 horizontal rigs, which represents the largest horizontal rig program in the Permian.","And we are executing efficiently. During the third quarter, we completed 46% more stages than in the second quarter, and compared to a year ago, we more than doubled the number of stages. Horizontal drilling technology and the evolution of completion design are changing everything we do and dramatically improving operational and capital efficiencies.","Our focus is on execution and where the key drivers of good execution is our profitability. If you'll turn to Slide 4, you will see our cash margin has been resilient despite volatility in the Mid-Cush differential over the past several quarters.","The crude oil content of the barrels we produce enhances our cash margin. For the third quarter, we're 64% crude oil, which is at the high end of our full year '14 outlook. Crude oil content and low-cost supported consistently strong margin. The Mid-Cush differential averaged $10 per barrel in the third quarter, that recently traded below $3 as BridgeTex and other regional systems have come online. We've added to our basis hedges to help protect our cash flows. We currently have 11 million barrels hedged at $3.73 per barrel for '15.","Now, let's discuss the recent activity on our core assets. Our Northern Delaware Basin acreage position is on Slide 5. We got all the horizontal wells we drilled located on this map, and the total is approximately 350, more than any other operator. We're on the forefront of development in the Northern Delaware, that includes targeting multiple zones, drilling long laterals everywhere we can, applying enhanced completion techniques.","You'll see that we're continuing to post top-tier well results. We added 40 new wells, a quarterly record, with an average 30-day peak rate of 115 barrels per day and average initial production rate of 1,576 barrels per day from an average 4,700-foot lateral. We're running 18 rigs, all drilling horizontal wells.","We're continuing to increase our activity in the Southern Delaware Basin as you can see on Slide 6. We're focused on our continued effort to delineate and test well spacing, staggered lateral development and various completion improvements. During the quarter, we added 9 new wells, 5 of which were extended laterals. The average peak 30-day rate for these 9 wells was 991 barrels per day, the average 24-hour rate was 1,427 barrels per day from wells with an average length of 5,600 feet. Here we're running 6 rigs, all drilling all horizontal wells.","Moving to the Midland Basin on Slide 7. We have 5 horizontal rigs running here. We're optimizing our completion design including fluid systems and cluster spacing in conjunction with testing the multiple zone potential. During the quarter, we added 9 wells targeting the Upper Wolfcamp, with an average peak 30-day rate of 805 barrels per day and an average 24-hour rate of 1,019 barrels per day from an average 5,900-foot well. We recently completed our first lower Spraberry. We're planning to add additional tests in the Spraberry and the Wolfcamp C and D zones.","Jumping over to the New Mexico Shelf on Slide 8. We haven't talked a lot about this shelf for a couple of years, as takeaway and processing constraints restricted our development of this world-class asset. So I'm glad we have an update to share with you today. The constraints are behind us and we're beginning to stand up rigs. We're also extending the play boundaries through horizontal development and having great success.","During the third quarter, we completed 12 horizontal Yeso wells, with an average peak 30-day rate of 336 barrels per day and 24-hour rate of 469 barrels per day from an average 4,200-foot well. These are shallow horizontals with well costs of approximately $3.5 million, making the economics of these wells among the best in our portfolio.","Across essentially all of our assets, we're optimizing our well designs. Those methods include longer laterals, more stages, tighter cluster spacing and increased profit concentration, but that will vary depending on the asset and the targeted zone.","On Slide 9, we're highlighting the performance of the second Bone Spring in the Northern Delaware, where we drilled more than 200 wells and have significant production history. Over the last 18 months, we've been testing upsized completions by pumping, on average, 1.5x to 2x more profit as compared to our earlier completions. The chart on the right highlights the production increase we're seeing from our upsized completions over the base completion.","Based on the average performance of our 24 upsized wells, we're seeing more than a 75% improvement in cumulative production after 180 days, which is translating into a doubling of the rate of return. Improvements like these drive capital efficiency. And while we like what we're seeing, I'll remind that we're in the early innings and caution you against extrapolating this uplift across all zones in all areas. I have a lot of confidence though that we'll have more results to highlight across our portfolio in the quarters ahead.","We generated a lot of momentum in '14, giving us a running start as we head into '15.","Let's turn now to the '15 capital program on Slide 10, which I'll discuss in the context of the current price environment and our Two-by-Three Growth Plan. Concho has built a big scalable business with low-cost operations, high return projects, a solid balance sheet and competitive hedge position. This is our strategy. It helps us navigate commodity price cycles.","We historically planned for oil prices to range from $80 to $100 and we've seen the price go outside that range multiple times, though we've always managed to build a capital program that's capable of adapting to changing market conditions. Program for '15 is no different. If we see today's oil price persist through the first quarter, we'll look to recalibrate the capital plan in the second quarter.","The current program targets production growth between 28% and 32%, and totals $3 billion, with $2.7 billion allocated for drilling and completions and $300 million for facilities, leasehold acquisitions, midstream and G&G. We'll direct more than 90% of drilling and completion capital to horizontal development.","Across the assets, we plan to allocate $1.7 billion to the Delaware Basin, $600 million to the Midland Basin, $380 million to the New Mexico Shelf. The budget will generate approximately a 50% rate of return at $85 oil, and at $75 oil, will generate over 35% rate of return, underscoring the quality of our assets. And it's important to note that the budget assumes the current cost environment. However, during commodity price cycles, we've historically seen economics adjust through cost relief.","Cash flow for '15 is fairly well-protected, thanks to our hedge position. We've hedged approximately 45% of our projected oil volumes at approximately $88 WTI. So a $5 swing in oil price has less than a 5% impact on EBITDA. We're closely monitoring the market and have a sharp eye on our balance sheet. If conditions warrant, we can dial back the capital program and still achieve strong production growth. We can target a '15 capital program that approximates annual cash flow and deliver over 20% annual production growth. We're well-positioned to deliver growth and preserve our balance sheet despite the current commodity price environment. This differentiates Concho.","Turning to Slide 11. When we launched the Two-by-Three Growth Plan in late '13, we discussed a steady ramp on our rig count. So I mentioned earlier, we're capturing efficiencies and seeing better well performance.","Putting this in perspective, we believe we can achieve the same production targets we outlined a year ago, with fewer rigs and fewer wells than originally planned. We're maintaining a steady rig count in '15 compared with the fourth quarter of '14. With fewer rigs and wells required to hit the growth targets, we're improving our recoveries and extending the life of our inventory.","And we believe we'll continue to execute more efficiently in '15. Under the current program, we're estimating we'll complete 70% more stages year-over-year. This highlights the benefit of the operational efficiencies we're realizing through enhanced completions.","Our team is focused on a slate of initiatives across the portfolio aimed at maximizing recoveries and reducing costs. They've also dedicated a significant amount of time securing the supplies and resources we'll need to execute this program. We have a leading position with a deep inventory of high return locations in the Delaware Basin, the Midland Basin and the Shelf. We launched the Two-by-Three Growth Plan a year ago. We're having even -- we're in an even better position today because of the progress we've made across the board. We're executing well, delivering strong results and expanding our resource. The efficiency gains keep improving our business. We're in a position to leverage our execution strength to take advantage of the opportunities that will come our way in the Permian.","So thanks for participating in the call. We'll now go to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Scott Hanold with RBC Capital Markets.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I thought the operational update looked pretty good. And more specific that, I guess, you all are running, what, 18 rigs in the Northern Delaware Basin?","Timothy A. Leach","Right.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Can you -- it sounds like -- how many of those rigs are focused on the second Bone Spring formation and doing the enhanced completion design?","Timothy A. Leach","Yes, it's a majority of the program up there. I guess, probably around 2\/3 of what we're doing is in the second Bone Spring, and a majority of what we're doing is focused on enhanced completion design.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And would you envision that like if, obviously, oil prices continue to be a little bit more weak, would you, for lack of a better term, high-grade your portfolio and do more of that. It seems like those provide some of the better rates to return in your portfolio?","Timothy A. Leach","Yes, sure. Clearly, those are over 100% rate of return projects and if you have to go in and rationalize your capital budget, we'll cut out the things with the lower rate of return.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And moving down to the Southern Delaware Basin. Can you discuss what well costs are looking in that area? And then, specifically in the southern part of that basin, the South Harpoon area, it doesn't look like there's been a lot of drilling in there recently. What are your current thoughts in testing that?","Timothy A. Leach","We have a rig running down there right now testing the -- and we're still trying to find the boundaries of the productive zones down there. So we've got a rig drilling down in Pecos County now, and it's just a slow march, I guess, trying to delineate the productive boundaries in the south.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And what are the well costs, I guess, in the North Harpoon and Big Chief running right now?","Timothy A. Leach","For -- in most of what we're doing down there are longer laterals, and those run, I think, from $10 million to $12 million.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay, so pretty consistent as to what you'd said before, is that right?","Timothy A. Leach","That's right.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","You mentioned in your remarks the potential to dial things back versus this outlook if conditions warrant to protect the balance sheet. Given what you said about hedges and rates of return, what conditions would warrant that? What are you looking for to determine whether this will remain the appropriate budgeting growth outlook versus something more conservative or more aggressive? Is that based on an oil price, the cash flow, or the debt-to-EBITDA? Can you just give us some color there?","Timothy A. Leach","Yes. I think our intention is, even under current conditions with the plan we've laid out, our debt-to-EBITDA would end the year at the same level as it is today. And so, I think that's one of the key drivers.","But I think, as we move into next year, we don't expect these prices to remain where they are. And that if we move into next year and they have remained down in the mid 70s through the first quarter, we'll start tapping on the brake in the second quarter and dial our capital spending back so that we maintain a debt-to-EBITDA and maintain a strong balance sheet.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Great, that was very clear. And then as a follow-up, going to the Northern Delaware Basin. I wondered if you could update us on just a couple of the zones. One is the Wolfcamp zone, which you guys have talked about in -- and on Slide 15, it shows up as still a bit of gas year zone, but there's some greater discussion of some oil year pockets in the Northern Delaware Basin. I wondered if you could talk to that? And then, just an update on the Brushy Canyon as well?","Timothy A. Leach","Yes. On the Wolfcamp, it's a zone that we've been excited about for quite some time. It's a widespread zone that appears in most of our acreage. There has been some great success in the Northern Delaware Basin completing Wolfcamp wells. We're very excited about that as well.","And in the Brushy Canyon, most of our dollars have been going into the second Bone Spring completion. We've got a few more at Brushy Canyon. We'll have more to talk about at the end of the year on that. But that's still looking real strong as well.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Do you see that 41% oil for the Wolfcamp holding or is there upside to that?","Timothy A. Leach","Yes. We think there is probably upside.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Freeman with Raymond James.","John Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","I was looking at the 2015 joint program. It looks like the incremental horizontal rigs from the current level are going to be primarily in the Midland Basin. You all, obviously, had a really big uptick in your 30-day rates in the Midland this quarter. I'm just curious if that rig allocation, is that different than you would envision like 6 months ago? Or is that kind of it was always the plan?","Timothy A. Leach","No, I think, that was always the plan. We have a lot of potential in the Midland Basin. And given the right commodity price and the right budget, I mean, we would -- you'd see a steady increase in the Midland Basin.","John Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","And then, if I shift over. It had been a while since we'd gotten an update on the New Mexico Shelf. And the last time that we did, the EUR that we were given at that time was a 250,000 EUR. These 30-day rates look a little better than the last update that we like got. I'm just curious if that's still a good number to kind of use?","Timothy A. Leach","We're going to biased to the upside on those. We're really excited about the New Mexico Shelf. There's a lot of oil in place. These completion techniques we're using are extending the boundaries of that field. But even going internal in the field and in-field drilling, we're having good results. So we're pretty positive about that big old world-class field.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Drew Venker with Morgan Stanley.","Andrew Venker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I was hoping you could provide a little bit more color on the capital budgeting process for 2015. Most specifically, have you changed the way you're forecasting production? In the past, it's my understanding you forecasted production based on your published type curves. Is that still the case? Or are you now forecasting based on higher EUR as you -- like you mentioned with the Bone Spring on bigger completions?","Timothy A. Leach","Well, our activity, internally, is very engineering-driven. So we build the plan around our engineering program and what we believe to be are reasonable estimates of how these wells are going to perform. Sometimes, we publish type curves so you can see them, sometimes we don't. But this plan is driven by internal engineering.","Andrew Venker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And you mentioned in your prepared remarks that you could grow about 20%, over 20% on a CapEx spend at approximated cash flow. What price assumptions were built into that?","Timothy A. Leach","That's much lower. I mean, we could spend with any cash flow and grow 20% at -- the bottom of it is $70 oil or something like that.","Andrew Venker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","On a NYMEX basis?","Timothy A. Leach","Yes, I want to put that out there as kind of a not that's what we're planning to do, but that's kind of a worst case scenario that -- what we're trying to do is we have so much opportunity in front of us. We're focused on our balance sheet to keep our leverage position where our balance sheet remains strong. But the same time, we're trying to bring as much of this inventory forward as possible and develop all these different core asset areas.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Oatman with SunTrust.","Ryan Oatman - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Looking out maybe a little too far to 2016. You reiterated the plan to double production from 2013 levels. I was wondering if you can help us with the capital spending side of the equation there, kind of what sort of spending levels you think would be necessary to deliver that growth in 2016?","Timothy A. Leach","Yes. I think, I mean, the best way to get to -- we haven't put out a plan for 2016. We haven't got into it yet. But the growth required to get to the doubling in 2016 is less than the growth that we're delivering in 2015. And so I think that the amount of capital required is -- I mean, you take our balance sheet and look at our leverage metric and kind of see that kind of steady as she goes drilling budget, it gets you there with room to spare.","Ryan Oatman - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","The steady as she goes with '15 or kind of the same sort of ramp that you saw in '15 versus '14?","Timothy A. Leach","No, the steady as she go as you see in '15.","Ryan Oatman - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Got you, got you. And then, it sounds like there's several packages on the market in the Permian and Delaware Basin specifically. I was wondering how you think about acquisitions in this oil price environment?","Timothy A. Leach","Yes. We've talked many times about the companies that have the big drilling machines being the logical place for these assets to reside. And within our core areas, we're seeing lots of opportunities and -- but also, like we said before, we got plenty of really good inventory today. And so, I think, because of our drilling machine, we'll be a participant in the consolidation that's going on in the Permian. And -- but again, our focus is on our balance sheet and when you see us do things like that, it's going to be with an eye toward keeping a strong balance sheet and our leverage approximately in the range it is today.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Pearce Hammond with Simmons & Company.","Pearce W. Hammond - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Tim, what level of flexibility do you have regarding service contracts, rigs, frac spreads, et cetera, if you do need to adjust activity in a lower oil price environment?","Timothy A. Leach","We have ultimate leverage. I mean, we are very flexible, both on the drilling side and on the completion side. I mean, it's kind of a big battleship, so you can't -- it's not like flipping a light switch, but you can move this thing pretty rapidly.","Pearce W. Hammond - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Do you mainly have a lot of staggered contracts on your rigs?","Timothy A. Leach","Most of our stuff is less than one year, and a lot of it is well-to-well.","Pearce W. Hammond - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","And then staying on that theme, if oil prices were to weaken further, what level of HBP requirements do you have that could influence the minimum amount of rigs that you need to run?","Timothy A. Leach","Yes. I don't know the exact number, but it's a small number.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Hall of Heikkinen Energy Partners.","Michael A. Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors, LLC","I just wanted to, I guess, circle back a little bit on the completion enhancements and just trying to understand a little bit more as to how those are factored into the outlook. I guess, number one, how broad has been the application of these completion enhancements throughout the portfolio? And are you seeing similar type results in the other areas in plays relative to what you showed in the slide for the second Bone Spring and the Northern Del? Are those sorts of results included or implied within the guidance or not?","Timothy A. Leach","I included a cautionary statement about not applying it to all areas. All these zones are different. They require different styles of completion. We have had success in improving all the areas and optimizing all the areas. And it's early data that we're looking at. But based on what we feel confident in projecting, we've included that in our capital plans and updates, but they are constantly improving. There's still a lot of room to make these things better.","Michael A. Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors, LLC","Okay. Would it be fair to assume or say that the cost impacts are fully loaded into the outlook whereas the production impacts are maybe more risked?","Timothy A. Leach","I think I know what you mean, and I think, yes, generally, that's a accurate statement.","Michael A. Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors, LLC","Okay. And then -- sorry, go ahead.","Timothy A. Leach","I didn't say anything.","Michael A. Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors, LLC","Okay, sorry. And then in the -- on the A&D side, if you look across the big broad Permian Basin landscape, are there any of your subareas that are more or less opportunistic at present from your perspective in Northern Del, Southern Del or Midland Basin?","Timothy A. Leach","We've said before, the Midland Basin is pretty competitive and expensive. The Northern Delaware Basin, we own a big chunk of it, so the opportunity is there. We've continued to add to our position in Northern Delaware, but they're usually smaller type of acquisitions. And we've said before, in the Southern Delaware Basin, we were hesitant to give out too much information because we thought there was a lot of upside there and a lot of proprietary information, and we like the Southern Delaware.","Michael A. Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors, LLC","Okay, fair enough. Then a last one on my end, just on the cost front. We've heard some, I'd say, conflicting info out of various operators around Permian cost environment. Obviously, with oil prices moving the way they have, that's very dynamic. I was just curious on your perspectives on -- on the incoming cost?","Timothy A. Leach","Right. I'll say again that this capital budget was prepared using current costs. So that's what's in the plan. And the other thing I would say is I think there is still a great advantage of being a large operator with lots of scale.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt Portillo with TPH.","Matthew Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Just 2 quick questions for me. I guess, first is as you guys look across your portfolio and you setup for 2015 and beyond, can you talk a little bit about your views on lateral length progression? We've noticed that the lateral lengths continue to expand here and that seems to be highly accretive to rates of return. So just trying to get a better picture of how that could progress over the next few years?","Timothy A. Leach","Yes. I think, in almost all areas, we think longer lateral lengths are more efficient. I'll tell you though that the growth in lateral length is not going to be a smooth curve. It's very dependent upon what area you're in, where the capital is going, and what your lease configuration looks like.","So as I said in the statements, where we can, we're extending these things out to cover a couple of sections.","Matthew Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And just a second follow-up. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the Bone Springs opportunity that you're seeing potentially in your Southern Delaware Basin, in particular around your North Harpoon and Big Chief assets? And then, I guess separately, if you see any prospectivity in your Pecos County position?","Timothy A. Leach","Sorry, I'm not going to talk about that. You can ask me another question though.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Tameron with Wells Fargo.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I was going to ask about Midland, but I know the answer to that. But let me just jump to the Northern Delaware, and maybe I missed it in your prepared remarks, but I mean, Devon put out some big numbers yesterday as far as 450-plus EURs. Have you guys quantified any EUR impact or kind of -- I know you quantified it because it's up x percent, but have you quantified what that level of EUR you're expecting today is?","Timothy A. Leach","We've quantified it internally, but we haven't put anything out. I mean, I don't disagree with what's out there in the public right now.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sven Del Pozzo with IHS.","Sven Del Pozzo - IHS Herold, Inc.","I know you've had those Yeso horizontal locations in your 10-K for several years now, and it sounds like, for the first time, that you're speaking about it with more confidence. Would you able to tell me what changed your view there, if you've had some kind of breakthrough?","Timothy A. Leach","Well, we've drilled more of them, that's one thing. And the second thing is some of this completion design that we're using in other areas, we can take what we're learning there and apply it to the Yeso. And there is just a whole lot of oil in that strat column. So we've had good results. We're making high rate of return wells. And we're having success in places we didn't really expect to have success. So that's -- I think, we took -- that old property is back on the learning curve and there's a whole lot to learn about that formation.","Sven Del Pozzo - IHS Herold, Inc.","So the completion technique that is being utilized there. I mean, you said before, you're going to use different completion techniques depending on the area. I guess how much of what you've learned in your main areas in the Southeast and New Mexico might be applied to that particular area? I mean, how much of it is staying the same in terms of the completion technique and how repeatable might the process be?","Timothy A. Leach","From that zone in the Yeso, I mean, that's the key characteristic of the Yeso formation is repeatability and how a unit form -- that formation is across a wide area. The completion designs are very, very different than what we're doing in the Delaware Basin, but are a result of what we're learning in the Delaware Basin.","Sven Del Pozzo - IHS Herold, Inc.","Is that logically some place where if oil prices do stay where they are with the lower upfront CapEx, that you might allocate more of your capital budget to that particular area since the well costs are lower?","Timothy A. Leach","Yes. But I mean, the rate of return there is very competitive, and I don't really think about that area as being the place you send your first extra dollar necessarily.","Sven Del Pozzo - IHS Herold, Inc.","Okay. And then lastly, still on the enhanced completions. I know, it's the early innings, like you said. But on the 24 wells that you've drilled, with about 180 days of production history, I'm comparing it to other areas in the U.S. where they've had an enhanced completions and -- I mean, you said more proppant. It seems like we're getting the best results in the areas where the rock quality was the best to begin with. But in my mind, it seems like the size of the prize, or what's left on the table will be areas that are non-core, where you might be able to do these bigger fracs. But thus far, it seems like most of the best results have been in the areas that have the best rock quality. So could I just have your opinion on that?","Timothy A. Leach","Yes. Well, I think, naturally, this kind of work started in the areas where the rock quality was the best because that's where you had the highest confidence. But we've applied it in areas where the rock quality was not that good and saw improvement as well. So -- and I wouldn't characterize the change in design as one thing. It's not just sand. It's not just fluid. It's not just cluster spacing. It all depends on what kind of rock you're in.","And so to answer to your question, yes, I think you have lots of examples in areas where the rock quality was really good to start with, but you're going to see more and more improvement in all areas, I believe.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joe Allman with JPMorgan.","Joseph D. Allman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Tim, if we could focus on Slide 9. And I know you -- on the left part of that slide, you show the increase in the number of stages per well and the average profit per well. But could you just give us some more details on the base and the new -- so for example, on that -- the base of 139 wells, what's approximately the average lateral length of the base versus the new?","Timothy A. Leach","Yes. They're about the same. So the lateral length is not a -- that's not the point we're trying to make there.","Joe, we're normalizing for any differences between laterals here on this page.","Joseph D. Allman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, okay. So this 75% increase in production over the first 180 days, you're normalizing for lateral length?","Timothy A. Leach","That's right.","Joseph D. Allman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then, in the base set of wells, what's the average EUR there?","Timothy A. Leach","We haven't really put that out, Joe.","Joseph D. Allman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, got it. How about the distance in the new wells -- the 24 new wells upsized? What's the distance between the furthest wells?","Timothy A. Leach","Let's see, 4 per section. Yes, we're still running 4 per section, aren't we? There is additional testing to do on downspacing, but these are kind of the traditional spaced wells.","Joseph D. Allman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. I'm sorry, what I actually meant was are you -- in this set of 24 wells across a wide area?","Timothy A. Leach","Yes, yes. It's across a wide area.","Joseph D. Allman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then, what sort of the -- what's the distance between the furthest wells?","Timothy A. Leach","It's the size of the Northern Delaware Basin. It goes all the way from the state line all the way up to Lusk up in the north.","Joseph D. Allman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, got you. And then, how many locations you have left in your inventory for the second Bone Spring?","Timothy A. Leach","There is still more work to be done on that, but I think we got 6,000 Bone Spring locations. And in the second, it's about half of that.","Joseph D. Allman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then just lastly, so these parameters you're showing on the left side of the slide, the average stages per well and the average proppant per well, do you think those are the key changes that are impacting the increase in production the most?","Timothy A. Leach","Yes, that's why we put it on there. It was to try to indicate that -- and that applies only to the second Bone Spring, I would say. But the intensity of the frac design and of -- and I would also say that this is not accelerated oil. This is new oil. So I think the implications on resource potential and things like that is substantial.","Joseph D. Allman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. Maybe just one more just in response to what you just said. What are the measures that indicate to you that it is truly an increase in EUR versus just acceleration?","Timothy A. Leach","We're not seeing the effects in offsetting the wells in general.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of James Sullivan with Alembic Global Advisors.","James Sullivan - Alembic Global Advisors","Just what -- are you guys disclosing your budgeted contribution to the Alpha Crude corridor for '15?","Timothy A. Leach","Yes. We -- it was -- our share of that project, our half was about $100 million and we're about halfway there through '14.","James Sullivan - Alembic Global Advisors","And '14, so about another $50 million for '15?","Timothy A. Leach","Right, right.","James Sullivan - Alembic Global Advisors","Okay. So just following up on that. For the '15 budget, obviously, with the caveats you guys included about the oil price, that includes a reasonable bump in the drilling CapEx, 15% or 17% whatever it was. But the other slides, the $300 million stayed consistent between the 2 years. Just want to get a sense on where you guys are in terms of meeting the broader infrastructure needs that you're going to -- want to have in place to support the 2x production target? And I'm thinking here broadly everything, I mean, crude gathering above [ph] water, tank batteries, gas processing, roads, the local systems, everything. Where are you in that and how does that translate into midstream spending upside risk?","Timothy A. Leach","Yes. Well, we've got 4 different core areas. And all of them have a little bit different infrastructure existing and needs for the future. We kind of been building this stuff as we go, and we think we have plenty of infrastructure to complete this plan we described.","But having said that, there are opportunities to invest in midstream systems in almost all our core areas. So we look at that as an opportunity and an improvement on either the price we get or the performance. So there's still a lot of infrastructure that can built at a profit.","James Sullivan - Alembic Global Advisors","Okay. And I mean, so the -- in terms of the actual CapEx creep risk though, it would be -- you view it as something with a pretty short payback and...","Timothy A. Leach","Or that we would finance outside of this system we're talking about.","Operator","And your last question comes from the line of John Nelson with Citigroup.","John C. Nelson - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I wanted to explore that sort of bear case scenario that you brought about and potentially adjusting the capital budget in 2Q. Can you talk to what areas you would reduce spending in, in that case?","Timothy A. Leach","No. We don't -- I mean, we've started that plan, but we don't really have anything to rollout on how we dial it back. I mentioned earlier in the call that we'd knock off some of the lower rate of return stuff first obviously, and so that's...","John C. Nelson - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And so on that, I think you were sort of mentioning the New Mexico Shelf. Would it be fair to say that, that sort of increasing mix of the capital might revert? Is that maybe one way to think about it? Or we'd just have to wait?","Timothy A. Leach","No. I think we would -- if we start trimming, we'll trim a little bit out of all the areas. And again, with an eye toward keeping our debt-to-EBITDA in the same range that it is today.","Unknown Analyst","Fair enough. And then, just wanted to ask for updated thoughts on maybe basin-wide takeaway infrastructure or gas processing infrastructure, overall. And then specifically, if you could comment on net gas takeaway? I know a few of your peers have maybe mentioned that more recently as a potential industry issue. So given your size, any potential thoughts, I think, might be helpful.","Timothy A. Leach","No. I mean, I think, it seems like we're flaring less gas today than we have historically. Generally, the takeaway capacity out of the Permian seems like it's improving rapidly. And I don't have any specific comments on natural gas takeaway.","Operator","This concludes the Q&A portion of today's event. I would now like to turn the presentation over to Mr. Tim Leach for closing remarks.","Timothy A. Leach","Again, thank you for participating in the call. We're very excited about the results of this quarter. We're very excited about how '15 is looking like it was set up for us. And I look forward to talking to you more in the future.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Ms. Megan Hays, Director, Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin.","Megan P. Hays - Director, Investor Relations","Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to our Third Quarter 2015 Earnings Call. On the call with me today in Midland is Tim Leach, Chairman, President and CEO; and members of the Concho senior management team. We issued the earnings release yesterday after market close. In addition, we have prepared slides to supplement our comments to this conference call. The earnings release and presentation slides are both posted on our website.","Please be reminded that we will make forward-looking statements this morning. Please refer to the forward-looking statements and other disclaimers contained in our earnings release and on slide 2 of today's presentation.","Also, some of our comments may reference non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are contained in our earnings release and in the presentation.","With that, I'll turn the call, now, over to Tim.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you. Good morning. Thanks for joining us this morning. I'll start by covering highlights for the third quarter on slide 3.","During the quarter, the company once again delivered impressive results. Total production for the quarter averaged 149,000 BOEs per day, above the high end of our guidance and up more than 30% year-over-year. Strong operational performance in the quarter was a result of continued improvement in well results across our asset base. This was driven by long laterals and enhanced completions. Our operational success this quarter was accompanied by solid financial results as we continue to focus on our cost structure. Per unit cost for LOE, DD&A and G&A were each lower year-over-year, and we've again raised our 2015 guidance for production growth. We expect to increase production by 27% to 28% year-over-year while spending within our capital budget.","We're approaching 2016 with a focus on funding the capital budget within cash flow, preserving a strong balance sheet and building upon our operational success, which we believe sets Concho up to continue generating differentiated value for our shareholders.","Turning now to slide 4, overall production growth was led by our horizontal drilling program in the Delaware Basin. We continue to drill great wells and core up our position in the Delaware. Record production volumes were achieved with an eye on cost control. Combined, cash expenses for LOE and G&A per barrel were 13% lower than last year.","Moving to slide 5, we have a track record of consolidating high-quality acreage and making that acreage more valuable with our execution machine. We've been disciplined and focused on blocking and tackling in our core areas. So far this year, we've been successful at adding 25,000 net acres at attractive prices. These acquisitions, shown in dark green on the maps, increase our exposure to some of the best parts within our core areas, are prospective for multi-zone potential, and provide for more efficient long-lateral development.","Turning now to the 2015 capital budget on slide 6, we carry a great deal of momentum from 2014 into 2015, and we've steered the program to balance capital and cash flow in the second half of the year. For the third quarter, we've averaged 15 rigs and cost incurred, excluding acquisitions, was 50% lower than the second quarter this year and well within cash flow of $436 million.","A key theme emerged as we moved through the year. We can deploy less capital and fewer rigs and still achieve our production goals. This is a function of several factors, including lower service cost, faster cycle times, long laterals and completion intensity. With no long-term contracts and a strong hedge position, we also retain significant operational flexibility to adjust the rig count when weak prices weigh on our industry. Today, we're running 13 rigs compared to almost 40 rigs a year ago.","Under the initial budget for 2015, we planned to invest $3 billion and grow at least 28%. We responded quickly to fast-moving commodity prices and reduced the budget to $2 billion. And at that time, we thought that our annual growth would slip to less than 20%. However, our ability to adapt to challenging conditions and push for greater efficiencies drove better well productivity all across our assets. As a result, we're on track to deliver 27% to 28% production growth on $1 billion less capital than the original budget.","Looking ahead to 2016 on slide 7, we expect oil price volatility to continue. We've built a base budget that will allow us to maintain our high production levels achieved in 2015 and to preserve significant dry powder for additional opportunities. Growth's never been a problem for us and it won't be now. With a flattening PDP decline curve and the flexibility to ramp up drilling quickly when conditions warrant, we can protect our balance sheet and make high-return capital allocations at the same time.","We expect to fund the capital budget within cash flow and maintain a leverage ratio that's less than two times, and at the same time continue to advance operational efficiencies and our understanding of the upside across our asset base. It's hard to predict the duration of the commodity price down cycle, but our execution machine, our financial strength and capital allocation will continue to demonstrate the quality of our assets and our commitment to a strategy that builds long-term value in any commodity price environment.","Now, let's move to asset performance, turning to slide 8. I'll start with the Northern Delaware Basin, where we're running eight rigs today. We show the Alpha Crude Connector, or ACC, on the asset map along with our activity during the quarter, highlighting the strategic fit of this gathering and transportation system relative to our operations. ACC is expected to begin operations at year-end.","The reach and capacity of the system's substantial and supports our long-term development outlook for the area. Initial capacity is approximately 100,000 barrels of crude oil per day with flexibility to expand the capacity. We expect to transport a substantial portion of our crude oil from the Northern Delaware on ACC, which will provide for better price realizations and performance in 2016.","Last quarter, we turned the spotlight on the Avalon Shale. On slide 9, the updated production plot includes recent well results. Our results in the Avalon Shale continue to generate some of the best returns in our portfolio. We're on pace to drill more than 25 wells in the Avalon this year. We're working to delineate multi-zone potential and determine optimal well spacing.","In the Southern Delaware Basin shown on slide 10, we're running two rigs. Overall efficiency is improved, with drilling days down 20% year-over-year. In addition, we continue to deliver industry-leading well results.","And we're also having success in the Midland Basin, where we're running two rigs, shown on slide 11. We're drilling faster and longer wells in the Midland Basin, with drilling days down 30% and average lateral length up 15% year-over-year. We're also realizing completion efficiencies. As a result of optimizing development in the Midland Basin, our well results have been consistently strong, providing confidence to position this asset for large scale development.","Moving to slide 12, our large contiguous acreage position in the Midland Basin allows for efficient long-lateral development. Since launching the horizontal program in 2013, our average lateral length has increased 35%. And we'll look to further increase the average lateral length with our 2016 program where we plan to primarily target two-mile laterals.","Optimized lateral lengths and completion designs allow us to more efficiently develop our acreage. As shown in the chart on the right, plotting six-month cum oil production per 1,000 feet of lateral, over the first six months we're recovering two times the oil compared to 1 mile lateral at about 1.5 times the 1 mile lateral cost.","Moving now to the New Mexico Shelf on slide 13, we're running one rig on the shelf. The asset continues to produce solid results from horizontal drilling. We're also testing longer laterals here. We recently completed a 5,200-foot lateral targeting the Paddock zone with encouraging results. This asset continues to produce more cash flow than it consumes, making it relatively easy to hold production and acreage.","So to recap, the macro headwinds facing the energy industry is challenging to overcome. Concho's value drivers are unique. Our operational performance this year has been outstanding and highlights the strength of our team and our assets. Long laterals, lateral placement, zone delineation, completion techniques, each of these developments are transforming our inventory. We've been successful at acquiring and developing some of the highest quality assets in our industry. The acreage we've acquired year-to-date is consistent with our focus on the best parts of the Permian. Our strategic investments in midstream, like the ACC pipeline, protect our upstream business, provide better price realizations at the wellhead, and offer optionality.","The commodity price environment is uncertain, but we believe that we can continue to build value through the cycle by keeping a strong balance sheet and prudently investing in our business and staying disciplined.","I appreciate your continued confidence in Concho. So now, let me turn it back over to the moderator and take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And our first question comes from John Freeman from Raymond James. Your line is now open.","John A. Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Good morning, guys.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, John.","John A. Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","You kind of went through in detail, Tim, about how, when you entered this year, you thought you needed $3 billion to grow 28%, and ended up being able to achieve that with basically a billion dollar less budget. So when I look out to 2016, I guess I'm trying to get a sense for how much additional kind of efficiency gains or productivity improvements are embedded in that guidance versus sort of taking the current costs, current wells and just flat-lining them.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. John, we're using current cost and our current estimates of well performance. So we haven't really baked in any of the continued efficiency gains into the 2016 program. I think that's part of the upside.","John A. Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. And then my follow-up question, when I'm looking at the 2016 budget, it looks like sort of the non-D&C part of the budget is a lot larger percentage of the total budget than we typically see, where, typically, that kind of runs high-single digit, 10% range. And I'm wondering if that's another source of maybe just some conservatism there?","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. And I was careful to call this a base budget, so it starts at $1.4 billion, but the D&C portion is $1.2 billion. And in that difference, we've left room for acquisitions, ACC projects, midstream projects and other unallocated capital that can go to leasehold or back to drilling.","So I wouldn't call it a conservative approach to budgeting, but it's our \u2013 you know, last year we put out a budget in November and then we modified it before we got into January. This year we're kind of setting a base and we're going to watch conditions as we roll forward, but I hope it gives you a good indication of where we think we can start.","John A. Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","It's very helpful. Thanks, Tim.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Thanks, John.","Operator","And our next question comes from Pearce Hammond from Simmons & Company. Your line is now open.","Pearce Wheless Hammond - Simmons & Company International","Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Tim, when you look out at the potential acquisition opportunities available to you in the Permian, do you think that that bid-ask spread has narrowed? Are the sellers becoming more realistic, or is it still kind of a tough environment to get things done, especially on larger transactions?","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, as you might expect, it's all over the board. But I would emphasize that the blocking and tackling that we've talked about at the end of this quarter, and the real high quality acreage we were able to add in our core areas at really good prices, that's the kind of activity we're going to continue to stay focused on. And, I mean, we live in the Permian Basin, so we think we're aware of everything that's going on out here. And the A&D market is quite robust right now, but I would tell you that our day-to-day business is this focus on our core areas and the smaller stuff.","Pearce Wheless Hammond - Simmons & Company International","Thank you. And then my follow up, I know you haven't done anything in a while in the Brushy Canyon, but I wanted to get your latest thoughts on that particular horizon in the Delaware Basin.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. The Brushy Canyon is the shallowest zone in that strat column, so it's generally all held by production. As we've reduced our activity, we haven't really announced any Brushy Canyon results just because we're focusing on the deeper stuff.","Pearce Wheless Hammond - Simmons & Company International","Thank you, Tim.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","And our next question comes from David Tameron from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Yeah. Good morning. Tim, can you talk about \u2013 I'm not trying to get numbers for 2016, but I'm just trying to figure out where we're at in the lifecycle, if you will. With costs coming down, with the operational efficiencies kind of \u2013 for this period of the cycle, are we two-thirds of the way through that, are we three-fourths of the way through that as far as seeing improving \u2013 assuming oil stays plus or minus where it's at today. How would you characterize that?","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, first of all, I'd start out by telling you that the 2016 budget has as robust economics embedded in it as anything we've done in the past, which I think is very encouraging. It's driven \u2013 as I pointed out in my prepared remarks, it's driven by longer laterals and increased frac concentration.","So I still think we're in the fairly early innings of driving efficiency in our business, and that efficiency is also driven in large measure by the volatility of the business that we find ourselves in. So I still think there's lots of room for improvement, but we've tried to give you, in this starting point on 2016, something that kind of reflects current conditions.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And let me go back to the \u2013 you guys have that stack \u2013 that chart in the appendix, that first chart, that shows the different formations, different well counts, 30-day rates, et cetera. And it looks like for the Avalon versus last quarter, which you gave us, up eight absolute well count. The 30-day average moved up considerably considering for eight wells and the oil percentage increased. Are you \u2013 is that a different formation, different completion, different area? Can you give us any color as to \u2013 or is that just kind of the typical noise you get as you grow this program?","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","No. I think they're getting better, I mean, as we expand geographically. But I'd tell you it's relatively a handful of new wells, and we've planned in 2016 to drill quite a few more wells there. So I think we'll get more data, but it's encouraging. We like it.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And just on that last \u2013 the current Avalon Shale wells, are they coming in at \u2013 I mean, to tick up the oil percentage from 4% overall, that indicates those recent wells are pretty robust on the oil side. Can you give me an oil percentage or a split?","Jack F. Harper - Executive Vice President","Yeah. David, this is Jack. It's just a reflection of the chart in the main part of the presentation, and those oil percentages are in the kind of 70% range.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks, guys. I appreciate it.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Michael Hall from Heikkinen Energy Advisors. Your line is now open.","Michael A. Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","Thanks. I guess just one thing I wanted to ask around was how are your thoughts around pad development? Are you evolving in this environment from a \u2013 recollection hasn't necessarily been a big feature of the plan historically. I'm just wondering if, particularly, also, as you got the ACC system up, if that plus the lower commodity environment and trying to drive better and better efficiencies, has driven any evolution on thinking on that front?","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Pad development is becoming more and more of what we do. So I think it's about one-third of the wells we drill are on some kind of pad development right now. We talked about how the Midland Basin is getting more oriented toward full-scale development. We can deliver enough water now for our operations so that we can actually do a multi-well pad.","And so, yeah, in one of the previous calls, we talked about it still being early innings on efficiency. I think that's one of the areas that will increasingly become more important, not just to Concho, but all the companies developing the Permian assets.","Michael A. Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","Okay. That's helpful. And I guess it sounds like maybe then the Midland Basin the furthest along on that front, and then maybe Northern Delaware and Southern Delaware in that order? Is that right?","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. That's probably right, directionally. Yes.","Michael A. Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","And you kind of alluded to it maybe a little bit, but I was just wondering about infrastructure investment in 2016. Are there any plans to do any ACC-like systems in the South \u2013 in Southern Del?","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, you know, I'm not going to talk about any specific deal that we're working on. But yeah, there's part of our budget that was allocated toward things like that, and that's a really powerful tool to improve our economics.","Michael A. Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","All right. Okay. And then, last on my end is just curious on your thoughts on what kind of gets you playing more offense, if you will, with the drill bit maybe outspending a little \u2013 just getting a little more aggressive. What sort of commodity price environment do you think is needed for that from your perspective?","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","You know, the comments we made here were kind of around the current circumstance, the strip and around $50 oil, let's say, and anything above that would be recycled back into our activity. So we will become more active.","We have that flexibility that I mentioned to deploy a lot more capital. So I think any move higher than the current strip, you'll see more activity from us. And I will tell you we are playing offense already.","Michael A. Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","Yeah. I know that.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So don't put me in the defensive camp, all right?","Michael A. Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","Yeah. No. As I said that, I re-thought that. That's terrific. I appreciate the color. I appreciate it. Thanks very much.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","All right. Thanks.","Operator","And our next question comes from Brian Singer from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Brian A. Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. Good morning.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Morning, Brian.","Brian A. Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","I wanted to follow up just on that last point with regards to how you think about flexing up in the event commodity prices move higher. Is it a goal to keep CapEx in line with cash flow or is that a function of the environment that we're in now? And so, to the degree that we saw $55, $60 oil, would that be enough of a signal to kind of go back to growth rates that are perhaps consistent with your former three-year plan and a level of outspend just to make that happen, or, again, are you more trying to keep cash flow balanced with CapEx more secularly?","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I think balancing cash flow and CapEx is something that we're going to be kind of focused on. But I will point out that we've grown. Our CAGR for the last two years is 25%. So, we've been able to deliver high growth rates. I mentioned that I don't think growth is a problem for us. I think we can grow dramatically within cash flow going forward. But coming off this two years at 25% growth and, at the same time, having declining capital budgets, I still think that our growth will be robust when you put it in that context.","Brian A. Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thanks. And as a follow-up, wanted to just ask a question on the Avalon Shale zone here, just looking at your slides here versus your last quarter slides, it seems like there's been an improvement in well performance from a handful of wells and an increase in the oil mix there. And I wonder if you could add any color if that's something that is temporary, geographic-related or something more secular.","Jack F. Harper - Executive Vice President","Oh, Brian, it's just a continuation of the program and learning as we go and enhancing the completions, just similar to what's been done in the Second Bone Spring and other zones as well. So, it's really just a continuation.","Brian A. Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","I mean, this has the reputation of being more of a gassy zone. Is that still likely the case, or is there some change? Granted, this is only a handful of wells here, but is there any change in your thought process on that zone?","Jack F. Harper - Executive Vice President","Yeah. As you move east over there into Lea County, it's much more oily. In fact, as we were saying before, about 70% plus or minus. So that's what's driving the activity and the economics over there right now.","Brian A. Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Mike Scialla from Stifel. Your line is now open.","Michael Scialla - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yeah. Good morning. You addressed this, to some extent, on the 2016 spending plans. I was curious as to acquisitions, in particular. Your base plan in, say, the $50 and $2.50 oil and gas price environment, what level of acquisitions would you be comfortable with? I guess you have some room built-in there in the base plan, but what level of acquisition spending would you be comfortable with putting on the balance sheet, or is the 2 times debt-to-EBITDA kind of a guiding metric there?","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think the 2 times is a guiding metric with a little bit of room for maneuverability. We also \u2013 I think I've mentioned in past conference calls and things like that that there's also asset rationalization. So as we continue to buy things, we might sell a few things to create additional \u2013 so we don't lever our balance sheet. I don't think you'll see us putting any more leverage on our balance sheet for acquisitions. We've created enough room in this base budget, and we have the ability to continue to high grade our assets.","Michael Scialla - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","In terms of that high grade, would you still keep the \u2013 kind of the four core areas, or is one of those areas potentially (26:09)?","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","No, no, no. Yeah. Yeah. I think having these core areas where we \u2013 those core areas are really key to allocating our capital efficiently. We've got four core areas that all provide very high rates of return. And so, those things are kind of key to our operation.","Michael Scialla - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yes. Okay. And then, in terms of the longer lateral lengths, you gave some detail on the Midland Basin. It looks like you're seeing a lot of benefit from going as long as you possibly can there. I wanted to explore that and your other areas. And have you seen anything approaching the limits of where the benefits don't make sense or (26:55)?","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think with where we are now with technology that two miles is kind of \u2013 I don't know if optimal is the right word, but that \u2013 we'd like to go two miles almost everywhere if we could, but most of that is dictated by lease configurations.","Michael Scialla - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. And then, similarly on the sand concentration side, have you hit the limit there?","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","No. Every zone's different. We are constantly improving and experimenting. And so, that's \u2013 I think we will continue to improve as we drill wells.","Michael Scialla - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thanks, Tim.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from James Sullivan from Alembic Global Advisors. Your line is now open.","James Sullivan - Alembic Global Advisors LLC","Hey. Good morning, guys.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Morning.","James Sullivan - Alembic Global Advisors LLC","Just very quick question. So I don't know if you guys have given this number out or if you could give something a little bit less specific on it, but the PDP decline that you guys talked about moderating in 2016, do you guys have that number \u2013 what you guys work with on that number? Or could you, if you can \u2013 if you don't want to give that, could you give any sense of the, I guess \u2013 the order of magnitude, I guess, of the decline in the decline, if you like?","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. We've said in other venues that in the past the first 12 month decline rate was in the high 30%s. That was the hill we had to climb up. It appears like now going forward, it's probably more like in the high 20%s.","James Sullivan - Alembic Global Advisors LLC","Okay. Sounds great. Thank you for that. Switching over a little bit, obviously, the drilling cost efficiency and the cyclical savings have been pretty \u2013 a nice tailwind for you guys. Can you comment just a little bit on the completion side of the market and whether \u2013 what you guys are seeing as you do contracting out there and whether there is more savings to be captured over there from materials and pressure pumping rates and all that.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","In this environment, we would like to send a message to our service providers that there always is a need to reduce cost. But I think a lot of that cost reduction comes through efficiency, through running crews 24 hours a day and efficiently moving equipment and scheduling and things like that. So, we would always \u2013 especially now, I think that service costs need to come down a bit more, but we think running a program the way we do it makes it easier for us to achieve those efficiencies, maybe, than others.","James Sullivan - Alembic Global Advisors LLC","Okay. Great. So not necessarily a differential opportunity there versus the drilling side?","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I'd tell you, in general, that the information we've put out has costs as they appear today. We don't have any aspirational cost reductions built into them.","James Sullivan - Alembic Global Advisors LLC","Okay. Great. That's good. And then, just one quick last one. Can you guys just comment on your philosophy \u2013 this is a little more high level \u2013 about holding cash on the balance sheet? Obviously, you guys did the raise at the beginning of the quarter here and, if you zero that out, you got maybe $350 million left. And then, you guys have talked about maybe there's $100 million of acquisition cash on \u2013 to close, and then some ACC and some incremental midstream.","But if you work all that out on the math, you probably are left with maybe $100 million or $140 million, or somewhere in that kind of range, on the balance sheet, of which you guys have talked about wanting as a cushion or as optionality if there are incremental bolt-on deals to do. But are you \u2013 you guys have not typically carried that kind of cash balance on the sheet. Is there any change in philosophy on that just as we think about how you guys want to move through the environment here?","Jack F. Harper - Executive Vice President","Yeah. I mean, our philosophy is centered on the leverage ratios that we've talked about, and we're opportunistic. But I would say in the near term, we're focused on the leverage ratios that we've described.","James Sullivan - Alembic Global Advisors LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks, guys.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Jason Smith from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.","Jason Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey. Good morning, everyone.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Jason Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Tim, so, as with the Avalon, your results in the Wolfcamp in the Northern Delaware also seem to continue to improve; maybe not as much as the Avalon, but still it looks like they're getting better. So just trying to get a sense, first, how that fits into your capital allocation process for next year.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. We're not really talking \u2013 we'll give you more insight into capital allocation when we get on the call at the end of the year. But the Wolfcamp is improving. There's lots of companies that are drilling Wolfcamp wells. Our acreage up there is very well-positioned for Wolfcamp. We just haven't drilled as many Wolfcamp wells as we've focused on other things, like the Bone Spring and the Avalon.","Jason Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And I guess your acreage in Culberson is still checkerboarded, so, I mean, just also wondering if you've had any discussions with the offset operator to potentially enable for longer laterals.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Nothing I'd want to report right now.","Jason Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Fair enough. On the well backlog, just can you remind us where your DUCs are today, maybe how that fits into your plan for your next year, if you assume within the $1.4 billion that some of that is completing some of your backlog?","Jack F. Harper - Executive Vice President","Yeah. Jason, we're in the plus or minus 30 wells waiting on completion. And to the extent that those carry into next year, we've assumed that in our budget.","Jason Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks, Jack. I'll leave it there.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Richard Tullis from Capital One Securities. Your line is now open.","Richard M. Tullis - Capital One Securities, Inc.","Hey. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Just a couple of quick questions, Tim, so it looked like the completions in the quarter in the Midland Basin probably showed the best quarter-over-quarter well improvement, at least on a lateral foot basis, while still maintaining the high oil mix. Is this area improving, in your eyes, the Midland Basin, and how does it rank, say, rate of return now versus the other areas, in particular Second Bone Spring in the Northern Delaware?","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. We've been really pleased with our results in the Midland Basin. We talked in previous quarters about allocating more capital over there in the future, but the good thing about our asset base is that the rates of return we're doing in all of the different core areas are really competitive with each other. So, when we allocate capital, we can think about other factors because we have very high rates of return on all our core areas. So we can use some different factors to differentiate our projects.","Richard M. Tullis - Capital One Securities, Inc.","Okay. Were any of the completions in the quarter in the Lower Spraberry in the Midland?","Jack F. Harper - Executive Vice President","Oh, we're really not breaking that out this quarter.","Richard M. Tullis - Capital One Securities, Inc.","Okay, but are you able to comment at all on your Lower Spraberry results to-date in the Midland?","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I don't think we have enough data to really \u2013 other operators are doing more in the Spraberry \u2013 if we think it has a great future. We haven't really drilled enough of them yet to come out with the type curves and information and stuff like that.","Richard M. Tullis - Capital One Securities, Inc.","Okay. Well, that's all for me, appreciate it, Tim.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","All right. Thank you.","Operator","And our last question comes from Pearce Hammond from Simmons & Company. Your line is now open.","Pearce Wheless Hammond - Simmons & Company International","Yeah. Tim, regarding your acquisitions made year-to-date, can you provide any additional color? Like, for example, what excites you the most with these acquisitions and what might investors not fully appreciate about them?","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Well, I think the power of long laterals is pretty exciting to us. And I mentioned that if you're comparing two miles to one mile, you can get two times the oil for 1.5 times the cost, and especially in this environment, that really drives important efficiencies. And a lot of our acquisitions set us up for longer laterals. The acquisitions that we made were very core asset-oriented and also capture multi-zone potential, where we're in areas where we're testing one zone, but you think you got prospectivity in many more.","So, I really think that the focus on the core areas and \u2013 as an operator we're able to drill pretty good wells pretty efficiently, and that \u2013 in these smaller deals, oftentimes the seller will want to keep an interest in the well and let us drill them. That's good for both of us, and I think that will probably continue to drive activity.","Pearce Wheless Hammond - Simmons & Company International","Thank you, Tim.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","And I'm showing no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back to Tim Leach for any further remarks.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Once again, I really appreciate you supporting our company and I think that we're excited about what the future holds for us, and we're excited about our capital budget and look forward to talking to you in the near future.

My name is Lucy, and I will be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the call over to Price Moncrief, Vice President of Capital Markets and Strategy. Please proceed.","L. Price Moncrief","Good morning. Thank you for joining Concho's second quarter conference call. I'd like to take a minute to direct your attention to the disclaimers, including the forward-looking disclaimer contained in our press release.","The disclaimer says that statements in our press release and on this conference call regarding the company's or management's expectations or predictions of the future are forward-looking statements intended to be covered by the Safe Harbor provisions under the Federal securities laws. There are many factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations, including those we've described in our press release, our 10-K and our other filings with the SEC. In addition, we will reference certain non-GAAP measures, so please see the reconciliations in our earnings release.","I'd also like to point out that in addition to our earnings release, we have posted a presentation to accompany this conference call, which can be found on our website at concho.com.","Before I turn this call over to Tim Leach, our Chairman and CEO, I'd like to officially welcome Megan Hays to the Concho team as Director of Investor Relations. Many of you know Megan, and we look forward to her contribution to the development and implementation of our IR strategy.","On the agenda today, Tim will discuss second quarter results, our Two-by-Three Growth Plan and provide an operations update.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Tim.","Timothy A. Leach","Good morning. If you'll follow along with me in our earnings presentation, I'm going to start on Slide 4.","The second quarter was another great quarter that demonstrated the continued execution strength of our team. Through the first half of the year, we're right on track to accomplish our Two-by-Three Growth Plan, which doubles our production in 3 years.","Second quarter production averaged 108,000 Boes per day, representing 6% growth over the previous quarter and landing at the high end of our quarterly guidance range. We still see annual production growth of 20% to 24% over '13 and expect third quarter volumes to average between 113,000 and 116,000 Boes per day.","Reinvesting high-margin cash flow remains a core strategy and source of success. During the second quarter, we reported record EBITDAX of over $504 million, with a robust unhedged cash margin of 75% despite continued weakness in the Mid-Cush differential.","From an execution standpoint, there's much to be excited about at Concho. Through the first half of '14, we deployed $1.1 billion of capital, excluding acquisitions, and are well on our way to achieving our annual plan growth. The advantage of running one of the Permian's largest horizontal drilling machines is translating into operational efficiencies and improved returns. We're now seeing greater capital productivity as we continue to enhance well design and stimulation techniques.","These optimization efforts are driving the success of our drilling program in both the Delaware and Midland Basins. We continue to deliver industry-leading results in the northern and southern portions of the Delaware Basin. We've also made significant progress derisking our horizontal Wolfcamp play in the Midland Basin.","Back in May, we completed our first equity offering since 2010. I felt the timing of that offering was critical to position Concho with greater flexibility to execute our long-term growth plan. As you'll recall, that capital raise will enable us to increase our '14 capital budget, fund our midstream JV and opportunistically pursue strategic acquisitions.","Since our May equity offering, we've entered into new agreements to acquire 13,000 net acres in the Northern Delaware Basin for aggregate consideration of approximately $95 million. This acreage complements existing leasehold. We're increasing our acreage footprint and more importantly, we're adding more extended lateral opportunities across our acreage position. Year-to-date, we've agreed to acquire over 22,000 net acres, and we continued to look at opportunities that will fit well in our existing portfolio.","Finally, our first Midstream joint venture, the Alpha Crude Connector, is underway. By the end of '15, we expect this gathering system to connect to a majority of our tank batteries in the Northern Delaware, as well as to other third-party shippers. This JV is an exciting opportunity because it provides us with additional marketing optionality and gets our crude off our trucks on the highway.","Let's turn to Slide 5 for a quick update on our Two-by-Three Growth Plan. For the last 6 months, we've talked about execution as a key to success in the Permian. And after another quarter of strong production growth, I'm very pleased with the way Concho is executing.","For '14, we're right on track to deploy our $2.6 billion upstream capital budget and achieve our annual growth target. Our message this quarter is the same as it was last quarter. Doubling production in 3 years while delivering is very much within our sights. The only difference today is that we're beginning to realize greater operational and capital efficiencies.","Turning to Slide 6. This slide focuses on the Northern Delaware Basin where we're allocating over half of our '14 drilling budget and have now drilled over 300 horizontal wells since 2010. As we noted last quarter, our average drilling days are going down. But at the same time, we're drilling longer laterals and completing wells with larger fracs. As a result, the productivity of our wells is increasing. With all these improvements, we're still in optimization mode in the Northern Delaware Basin, and we're working toward driving similar improvements across all of our core areas.","Slide 7 updates our well performance for the most recent quarter in the Northern Delaware and illustrates the success we're having in the play. The most recent 31 wells recorded an average 30-day IP rate of 931 Boes per day and averaged over 81% crude oil, both new records for the company. This is also the first quarter that our average lateral extended beyond 5,000 feet.","Part of our optimization effort involves longer laterals in the Northern Delaware. A key initiative for Concho is to increase our ability to drill more extended laterals through either acreage swaps with neighboring operators or bolt-on acquisitions. As I mentioned earlier on this call, we've had great success over the last 3 months adding new bolt-on leases, and we'll continue to be very active in this area.","Let's move to the Southern Delaware Basin on Slide 8. We're running 6 rigs here and added 8 new wells with 30-day rates during the second quarter. While we had another solid quarter of well results, the notable update in the Southern Delaware is that our average lateral was 5,400 feet, more than 20% higher than in the first quarter.","Most of our longer lateral development is taking place in our Big Chief prospect, where we're also testing closer well spacing and targeting multiple zones, which we believe will drive further growth. In fact, we plan to spud our first 3-well pad testing increased density and staggered laterals in the Wolfcamp during the third quarter of '14.","Slide 9 highlights our progress in the Midland Basin. Just like in the Delaware, we're moving the needle with longer laterals. The lateral length of the 6 new wells from the second quarter increased 20% over the previous quarter, plus our wells are responding to our reduced cluster spacing, with increased EURs and economics.","Our efforts to optimize our frac design are ongoing, but we made significant progress on derisking our core Wolfcamp play. We also just drilled our first Spraberry horizontal well and plan to drill a few more by the end of the year.","I'd like to conclude on Slide 10 with a discussion of our midstream strategy. It wasn't long ago that our strategic focus was solely on drilling our wells and selling our volumes at the lease. But the game has changed in the U.S., and the Permian's no exception.","There are over 550 drilling rigs across the Permian, representing nearly a third of all U.S. onshore rigs. And over 60% of those Permian rigs are drilling horizontal wells, targeting up to 8 different zones. All production in the Permian has doubled in 7 years, following a 4-year decline. As a result of this robust activity and growth, it's not uncommon for the Mid-Cush basis differential to be volatile to fall in refinery outage or a curtailed pipeline. Mid-Cush for the month of August just settled above $10 per barrel.","It's clearly a fragile market but additional pipeline capacity is coming. BridgeTex and another Longhorn expansion phase should begin flowing very soon, while Permian Express II and Cactus should start flowing in the first half of '15. The takeaway capacity of those pipes is over 750,000 barrels per day. But the challenge to producers doesn't end there. Refineries are running at record utilization rates and in some cases, are retrofitting to handle a wave of light sweet crude.","Implementing the long-term midstream strategy in such a complex environment is a challenge. As one of the Permian's largest producers, we have the advantage of using our size, scale and crude quality to develop a comprehensive midstream solution. We believe this is critical to building long-term value. This is our top priority. Our midstream strategy, its primary objectives are to secure physical transportation to the best markets and improve the prices we realize at the wellhead.","Our first midstream JV consists of 400 miles of crude oil gathering pipelines and storage in the Northern Delaware and is on track to be operational before the end of '15, with initial capacity of 100,000 barrels per day. This new pipe accomplishes both of our strategic midstream objectives and also provides significant value to our core upstream business in the Northern Delaware Basin, where we currently rely on trucks to haul our crude oil to scattered delivery points. We've set a very high bar for future direct midstream investments, but we continue to evaluate additional opportunities.","To conclude, the depth and breadth of our portfolio in the Permian basin is nearly unmatched. With key assets in both the Delaware Basin as well as the Midland Basin, we're succeeding in both and maximizing our well performance across the portfolio. The oil pipeline JV supports our accelerated development plan with efficient transportation of our crude oil to multiple markets and now, we're well positioned to execute on the Two-by-Three Growth Plan.","So at this point, I'd like to turn the call back over to the moderator, and I look forward to taking your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Brian Singer of Goldman Sachs.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Appreciate all the disclosure with regards to the initial production rates, 30-day rates and the lateral lengths and how that evolves. So if you look at the Delaware Basin, particularly in the Bone Spring zones, but also in the Avalon, can you just talk to, as your lateral lengths increases, how one should expect the trajectory of EURs and production rates and what you're seeing now?","Timothy A. Leach","Yes. I've got my team here with me, and I'll defer to them on many of these questions, but this is what I can answer. I think that -- we believe that as the lateral lengths increase, you're going to have a linear relationship on EURs. So twice as long wellbore will equal a twice as big EUR. I don't think we believe that the initial production is linear though, that a 2-mile long well won't necessarily flow 2x as high on the 30-day IP, but you will get a doubling of the EUR.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And why is it and where is it within the decline curve where you see the adjustment if you're not seeing it from the initial rate? And then what's the reason for that?","Timothy A. Leach","I think it's at the front end of the decline curve, and it's just because of the capacity to flow that much volume of that size of pipe.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. Great. And separately, can you just characterize the acquisition opportunities that you see in the Delaware and Midland Basins and where your interest currently lies on consolidation?","Timothy A. Leach","Yes. I mean, we talked about this a lot, that we're focused on our core area and properties in and around our core area. The Delaware Basin still has a lot of private opportunities and smaller tracts of acreage, and that's really what we've been focused on.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. And should we expect anything as part of the second half strategy or more for 2015?","Timothy A. Leach","I think you should expect just a continuation of what you've seen in the first half of the year. That will be our blocking and tackling.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Nelson of Citigroup.","John C. Nelson - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I just wanted to touch on the capital efficiencies and if we are maybe in the early innings of sort of realizing this. What is your preference, so to speak, for sort of how best to allocate those synergies? And what I'm getting at is, obviously, rig count will go up, but will the rig count continue to go up from that increased savings? Or to some degree, do you maybe look at more delevering or adding to the inventory through acreage opportunities?","Timothy A. Leach","Well, I think our acreage opportunities, I mean, I still think about that as using my balance sheet and my dry powder for acquisitions. And I think to the extent that we generate additional cash flow, I think you'll see us put that back in the ground and with the drill bit. And when we talk about these increased efficiencies, it's really longer laterals and bigger frac jobs. So you won't necessarily see as big a rig count increase as what you might have seen 2 or 3 years ago because we're getting so much more out of these longer laterals and more stages on the frac jobs.","John C. Nelson - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Great. And then you hit a little bit on the basis differential tightness. Can you maybe just speak to other areas in the Permian where you might be seeing industry tightness given high industry operating levels?","Timothy A. Leach","Yes. I think I'll turn that over to Jack and Joe and talk about the differentials and supply in the Permian?","Jack F. Harper","Yes. I mean, this is Jack. As you know, the industry has been waiting on BridgeTex pipeline that should begin flowing here relatively quickly. I think we think though, until the additional projects come on in the first half of next year that will be when we think we would start seeing some relief on that Mid-Cush differential over and above where you see in the futures market today.","John C. Nelson - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And any sort of service change, pumping services, anything along those lines that you guys are starting to see increased tightness in?","E. Joseph Wright","No. Of course, the big factor is always stimulation and pressure pumping. We've added 2 crews in the last 30 days at the same cost we were running for, so really haven't seen anything like that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Natasha Labranche [ph] of Tuohy Brothers.","Unknown Analyst","My first question is, in the second quarter, you completed 13% less wells but 16% more were horizontal completions and production outperformed guidance. Going forward, what percentage of completions do you target to be horizontals?","Timothy A. Leach","I can answer that one. I think almost -- I mean, it's not 100%, but it's pretty close. Today, I think we're running 34 rigs and 30 of them are horizontal. That trend will kind of hold as we continue to drill. It's almost everything we're doing now and the capitals weighted even more towards horizontal than vertical.","Jack F. Harper","Yes. 70% of our wells that we competed in the second quarter were horizontal. We'd expect that to increase going forward.","Unknown Analyst","Great. And my second question is, in the state line area, why do you prefer to target the Wolfcamp D first instead of higher Wolfcamp zones as some industry peers are drilling?","Timothy A. Leach","One part of that reason is as you move down into Texas, as you have lease obligations where you can hold all the acreage from the D up that well.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Drew Venker of Morgan Stanley.","Andrew Venker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","You discussed pushing out lateral lengths longer, I think, meaningfully longer this quarter than in prior quarters. Could you just remind us of how long you think you can push those average laterals in the Northern Delaware?","Timothy A. Leach","I think the first constraint is just the lease configurations. So we will generally -- and almost all our areas drill as long a lateral as we can within the lease boundaries up to -- for us, it's -- probably 2 miles would be the ideal link that we're comfortable with today. We drilled some longer than that, but to the extent we have leases that allow us to do it, so 2 miles or I'd say 7,000 to 8,000 feet, and then you've seen our average is just above 5,000, so you can get a sense of the restrictions we have within our leases.","Andrew Venker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And then, Tim, as you get to those longer and longer laterals, do you have any issues getting to that kind of length, the 2-mile lateral, just given the depth of the well? I guess, it's a typical issue in other place where you're not very, very deep.","Timothy A. Leach","No. I mean, the size rigs that we're running in most of these areas, the 1,500-horsepower rigs, are adequate to go out a couple of miles. And so no, not really. I mean, getting the well turned is kind of the trick when once you get it horizontal, drilling sideways is not the hard part of the curve.","Andrew Venker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And on the longer laterals, can you give us a comparison of well costs between a shorter lateral and a longer lateral, just maybe a sense of the incremental cost?","Timothy A. Leach","Joe, why don't you...","E. Joseph Wright","Yes. A good example of that would be on our state line Bone Spring where our 1-mile laterals are about $5 million and our 2-mile laterals are about $8 million.","Operator","Your next question is from Pearce Hammond of Simmons & Co.","Pearce W. Hammond - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Following up on the prior question, I wanted to get a sense of where well costs are now in the Northern Delaware Basin and the Southern Delaware Basin and the Midland Basin for horizontal wells. I know you just quoted the 1- and 2-mile lateral costs for the state line area.","Timothy A. Leach","Yes. I think the best way to -- that's a good example between those 2 to give you a feel for what costs are. Then on the Southern Delaware, we really are pretty flat with our costs. We haven't seen a real reduction down there. We're still trying to work through some problems in the shallow hole and to drive some costs down there. And the rest of North Delaware Basin, the costs are -- have been fairly flat as well to down as we've looked at some of our stimulation costs.","Pearce W. Hammond - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","And then what about the Midland Basin, what are your costs right now?","Timothy A. Leach","Midland is still moving a little bit because we're changing our frac design there. So it's hard to put an exact number on the Midland Basin. But in terms of just -- the cost of services are very similar to the North Delaware Basin.","Pearce W. Hammond - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","And then my follow-up is how much more sand do you estimate you're using per well in the Northern Delaware Basin than you were just 1 or 2 years ago?","Timothy A. Leach","Let me answer it a little different. We're certainly using more sand across the board. So as you think about all the areas that we're working, we're using more sand. The industry itself is using more sand out here. That's one of the reasons we stay with Halliburton and Baker Hughes and kind of the big providers is because they do a good job from a logistics standpoint, as well as a supply standpoint. There's been a lot of chatter around sand shortages, it's really more of a transportation of sand, a distribution of sand. We've experienced a little bit of delay in the last 10 days. And when I say a little bit of the magnitude of hours, not days or weeks, it's just been a few hours. I think that's probably going to persist a little bit over the next 30 days. But it seems to look like it's improving actually over the last 10 days. So I think we're -- our expectation is it will last about another 30 days.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Freeman of Raymond James.","John Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","The first question on -- a little bit more on the midstream. Once the -- that Alpha Crude Connector is in place, you mentioned, Tim, that the majority of the oil in the North would then start being moved via pipe versus today where it's all truck. And I'm just -- if you could just sort of ballpark, maybe quantify how you think about the cost difference in terms of kind of what it's costing you now to kind of move it via truck versus what it would be once you're able to move it via the pipe at the end of '15.","Timothy A. Leach","Yes. I think just that part of it, just the difference of getting off truck and getting on pipe, well, say the trucking charge of between $1 and $2, and there are other efficiencies that you pick up just from not having to handle that oil so much. And having it aggregated at one place where you can market it all together is also -- it adds value to it.","John Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","And then how long would it take -- assuming eventually, you all make the decision to do the expansion from the 120,000, how long would that expansion kind of take, just ballpark?","Jack F. Harper","Yes. John, this is Jack. We're going to have that expansion capability from the beginning, and so it would not take very long. It would just take additional volumes.","John Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then just last question for me. It wasn't clear that acreage acquisition that you all did -- the 13,000 net acres in the North. In relation to the kind of 4 prospect areas you all have, where was that located?","Jack F. Harper","Yes. John, it's Jack again. That was kind of all over the Northern Delaware, some focus on the East side, some more to the West. So as Tim mentioned in answering that earlier question, that's the kind of thing we're going to be looking to do more of, just strategic and tactical acquisitions where we can drill longer laterals and just operate more efficiently. And so...","Timothy A. Leach","Yes. A lot of these have allowed us to use our drilling machine to kind of drill our way into other acreage position, so -- and make better wells. So that's -- I think the offset operators sees that as a positive and so do we.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Hall of Heikkinen Energy Advisors.","Michael A. Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors, LLC","You all mentioned you're kind of pushing the size of your fracs and kind of like tinkering with reduced costs or spacings in different parts of the portfolio. Just curious if you could provide any additional color around other sorts of completion, refinements that you're running throughout the portfolio and how some of those results might be looking?","Timothy A. Leach","I think what we've talked about in terms of the frac size and the sand and the cluster spacing and the lateral length, that's most of the story, and there continues to be improvements on fluids. And one of the things that we're finding -- everybody wants an answer that kind of one-size-fits-all, but all these zones are different, there are different thicknesses, there are different rock qualities and they require different frac designs. So it's really hard to say, \"Okay, here's the way we're doing a frac,\" because we have a lot of science, we drill so many wells, we've got a lot of data and every frac in every area and every rock is a little bit different.","Michael A. Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors, LLC","Yes. Fair enough. Makes sense. It's a big basin. I guess, then, maybe drilling down a little bit. In the Southern Delaware, what sort of sand loadings per foot are you putting on those wells in the Wolfcamp?","E. Joseph Wright","Yes. This is Joe. Again, the thing -- those things keep evolving, trying to find that right optimization. I'd really rather not get in to exactly what's going on down there. I think that's going to change a lot plus I think there's a little bit of competitiveness in how those jobs are designed.","Michael A. Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors, LLC","Fair enough. I guess, then, moving on the marketing side. What's -- can you kind of provide some thoughts or any of the outlook for -- either basin-wide or specific to Concho, the ability to get volumes out to the East and West Coasts as opposed to down to the Gulf Coast? Obviously, the big major pipeline expansion are headed South, but any commentary at around those lines?","Jack F. Harper","Yes. This is Jack again. Short of rail, I think, today, things are going down to the Gulf Coast, and then there are potential ways to get to East Coast from there. But at the moment, direct to the East Coast is not a publicly stated project.","Michael A. Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors, LLC","It's feasible, right? And so I guess, on the rail side, I was just curious if there's any developments on that front, how you guys see that market evolving for the Permian Basin.","Jack F. Harper","There are barrels that are being railed that -- and that -- in the public, 50,000 to 100,000 on the high end a day out of here, but that's typically not the best option.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jason Smith of Bank of America.","Jason Smith - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So your IP per lateral foot in the Southern Delaware looks in line to slightly better than the Northern Delaware, and I'm assuming infrastructure is probably what's keeping you from ramping faster there. So maybe just to follow-up on Michael's question, can you give an update on kind of where infrastructure stands in the South today?","Jack F. Harper","This is Jack again. It's a -- the infrastructure is getting better in both the North and the South and North by virtue of our project in the South. There are continual projects, but there's no necessarily limitations on moving. It's the costs of moving the product at this point.","Jason Smith - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And so given you guys you have the Alpha Crude Connector already in the North, should we assume that your next strategic project is more than likely in the Southern Delaware?","Jack F. Harper","I wouldn't make that assumption. We're -- as we said in the prepared remarks, the Northern project set a very high bar for accomplishing all the things that we would like to accomplish in one of those projects. So I wouldn't predict it right now.","Jason Smith - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then, it looks like most of your activity in Big Chief has been towards the northern part of the acreage. Are there any plans to test towards the southern part of that acreage?","E. Joseph Wright","Yes, this is Joe. We'll be testing certainly to the South and as well as the East and West on that acreage block this year.","Jason Smith - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then one more follow-up. Just coming back to the earlier question, the Wolfcamp D in Culberson, one of your peers has obviously drilled some really big long lateral wells. Do you guys have the ability today to drill 10,000-foot laterals in Culberson on the Wolfcamp or not yet?","E. Joseph Wright","Yes, we have the capability to drill those, since we drilled well over that in Eddy County. So yes, we can drill that long lateral.","Jason Smith - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And do you guys have plans to test that at all this year.","E. Joseph Wright","We are going to test the Wolfcamp -- further test in the Wolfcamp down in that state line area, yes.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of James Sullivan of Alembic Global Advisors.","James Sullivan - Alembic Global Advisors","I apologize if you addressed this already, but you guys did disclose that you had drilled 5 Brushy wells in the quarter. But I think you didn't disclose the results and you took the average Brushy numbers off the presentation. Could you just talk about those wells and what they look like and if there's anything to read into those things?","E. Joseph Wright","No, don't -- this is Joe again. Don't read anything into the fact we've taken it off the presentation. We're still moving forward with that program. It's -- we added one well in the quarter from a standpoint of 30 days. It's just really -- we don't have enough information yet. So we're continuing to drill and complete in the Brushy throughout that acreage position.","James Sullivan - Alembic Global Advisors","Okay. So those -- some of the initial stuff on those or the initial results, so you have one, I guess, those -- maybe a lack of data, but initial results, the 24 results on the other 4 were -- look pretty promising, I mean, or at least in line generally?","E. Joseph Wright","In the next quarter call, I think we'll have certainly more information as we'll have more completed. We'll talk about those more.","James Sullivan - Alembic Global Advisors","Okay, great. So second thing I just wanted to touch on was the midstream. So could you guys just remind us what -- I know, obviously, you've taken stuff off of lease by truck, but what is the general takeaway capacity by pipe out of the area of the Northern Delaware right now that you guys are using? And what's the likelihood of worsening bottlenecks for oil takeaway before ACC comes on, second half of '15?","Jack F. Harper","Yes, there's not any large pipe to speak of coming out of the Northern Delaware directly today. So...","James Sullivan - Alembic Global Advisors","Your trucks out that.","Jack F. Harper","Yes, we're primarily trucking out today.","James Sullivan - Alembic Global Advisors","Okay, great. And then just the last thing is, what does the gas processing situation look like there, and what's the -- what would bottlenecking risks look like for that in Delaware? And would that be something maybe that you contemplate in terms of a next midstream project out there?","Jack F. Harper","Yes. The gas processing looks pretty good today, and there are a handful of new projects coming on as well. So we will look at those the same way we look at the ACC project and others.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joe Magner of Macquarie.","Joseph Patrick Magner - Macquarie Research","I just wanted to follow-up on your comments earlier about expectations with longer laterals, you should see increasing recoveries. In the Southern Delaware Basin, while the IP per 1,000 feet of lateral is in line with the Northern, if it dropped quarter-over-quarter even though the lateral link increased, is there any explanation for what took place or what mix of wells were brought on during the quarter down there?","Timothy A. Leach","Yes, I think the number was almost the same number. So I just think about that as scattering of data from quarter-to-quarter. So we think that the wells we just put on are every bit as good as the ones in the previous quarter and -- so I wouldn't read anything into that quarter-to-quarter data.","Joseph Patrick Magner - Macquarie Research","Okay. And then another one. You made a comment about -- with longer laterals and larger frac jobs, improving productivity that we shouldn't necessarily expect to see meaningful ramp-up in rig count or as much of a ramp-up in rig count. Should we still think about constantly -- eventually getting to 50 rigs over time and what's the latest plan?","Timothy A. Leach","Sure. Well, we don't have a plan to get to 50 rigs necessarily. We have a plan to reinvest our cash flow and double our production. I guess, my point was, it's not going to take as many rigs to do that as we thought it was going to take a year ago because of the length of the laterals and the number of stages that we're completing in those wells. So that's all good. I still think, as we continue to grow and this plan stretches into years beyond the 3 years, we're going to have a lot more rigs running, and Concho is really well positioned to run a big machine.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Tameron of Wells Fargo.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","If -- I'm just thinking about the Midland Basin. And I mean, does that have a long-term place in your portfolio or -- I know, right now, there's some limits on how fast you can go on the Delaware side. But is that something that strategically you look at 2 to 3 years down the road and think about this won't be here anymore and we'll be more cored up in Delaware? What place does that have in your portfolio?","Timothy A. Leach","It has a dear place in my heart. And I think it's more likely, 2 or 3 years from now, be 2 or 3 times as big as nonexistent. So if I would have to express a bias, I'm biased toward having more of it.","Operator","Thank you. I'd now like to turn the call over to Tim Leach for closing remarks.","Timothy A. Leach","All right. Again, it was a busy time for you guys, I know, I appreciate your interest in Concho and taking this call. Things are going great here, so look forward to talking to you in another quarter.

[Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today\u2019s conference call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]","I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker, Ms. Megan Hays, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Megan Hays","Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to Concho's fourth quarter 2019 earnings call. Our earnings release and corporate presentation are available on our website, and we plan to file our annual report on Form 10-K today after market close. Participants on today's call will make forward-looking statements based on current expectations. They are subject to risks and uncertainties, forward-looking statement and other disclaimers are provided in the earnings release and presentation.","Our comments today may also reference non-GAAP financial measures. You'll find the appropriate reconciliations in our earnings materials. I'm joined today in Midland by Tim Leach, our Chairman and CEO; along with President, Jack Harper; Chief Operating Officer, Will Giraud, and members of the Concho senior management team. Following our prepared remarks, we will host a question-and-answer session. Please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up.","Now let me turn the call over to Tim.","Tim Leach","Thanks, Megan. Good morning. I'm very pleased with the fourth quarter, and the reasons to be a concho shareholder continue to be compelling. We're growing margins, growing free cash flow, growing distributions to shareholders and doing this while advancing sustainability. We've assembled a top tier Permian asset base in our own backyard with multiple decades of project inventory that strengthens our ability to generate free cash flow and increase returns to shareholders.","In this dynamic environment, we'll continue to focus on disciplined reinvestment, controlling costs and maintaining a strong financial position. Since our third quarter of 2019 earnings call, we've seen oil prices rollercoaster between $50 and $60, and we've been both places twice. Despite the commodity price volatility and many uncertainties, our business model is designed to deliver free cash flow across a wide range of commodity prices.","Last year, we identified six key areas for improvement, which included reducing well cost. Our well cost continue to move in the right direction as a result of safely drilling and completing wells faster. We're also transitioning to next-generation frac equipment that is more efficient and provides cost savings and emission reductions.","Second, lowering our cost structure. For the fourth quarter of 2019, controllable costs were 17% lower year-over-year, and we're well below our target of $9 per BOE. Third, selling noncore assets. We closed the New Mexico Shelf asset sale on November 1, bringing full year 2019 sales proceeds to $1.3 billion. Fourth, delivering profitable growth. Fourth quarter oil volumes increased 4% quarter-over-quarter in spite of the production impact resulting from the New Mexico Shelf asset sale.","Fifth, reducing debt, with the proceeds from the shelf sale, we ended the year with no bank debt and $70 million of cash on the balance sheet. And finally, increasing returns to shareholders. In 2019, we paid $100 million of dividends and repurchased $250 million of stock.","Going forward, we recognize that both asset quality and execution are necessary to the success of our business. We made real progress toward our goals in the second half of the year, and I'm proud of our employees for their performance. Their efforts are directly benefiting our bottom line and driving the inflection in free cash flow that we delivered in the fourth quarter.","Now turning to 2020. Jack will speak to the specific numbers, but I want to summarize our high-level strategy for the year. We're focused on four things. First, growing margins. We have several ways within our control to grow margins, including cost reductions and a better capital program. We also stand to benefit from better oil price realizations, as Permian barrels are now pricing at a premium.","Second, growing free cash flow. We expect lower well cost and our focus on smaller projects and wider spacing will result in better well productivity, which supports growing free cash flow. And we have the inventory and operational capability to support our commitment to free cash flow over the long-term. Third, growing distributions. Yesterday, we announced a 60% increase to our dividend. The dividend raise demonstrates our confidence in the cash flow potential of our business.","Also in the fourth quarter of 2019, we initiated a $1.5 billion share repurchase program. We were active in the fourth quarter and bought back 3.3 million shares at an average price of $76 per share. Fourth, advancing sustainability. Our stakeholders are seeking greater transparency regarding sustainability and we take this seriously. Our flared volumes averaged 1.6% of gross in 2019 compared to 2.7% in 2018. We've published a two-degree scenario report, and we're working on the sustainability report to detail our progress.","This set of priorities and the results of our drilling in 2019 guided our capital allocation and development strategy for 2020 and beyond. We're developing the assets with wider spacing and have multiple decades of inventory. Additionally, we're looking to optimize our acreage position through trades with adjacent operators. Our portfolio management efforts in 2019, increased the average lateral length of our inventory by 7% and our working interest by 2%.","Our inventory is a key advantage that enables us to deliver attractive long-term returns. We've talked about the evolution of the E&P business model from pure growth to restrain growth, greater free cash flow and higher returns. We've built momentum over the last two quarters, delivering on strategic focus that we laid out last year and providing a plan for 2020 that we believe makes a compelling investment case for the future.","With that, I'll turn it over to Jack.","Jack Harper","Thanks, Tim, and good morning. I am proud of the results and increase in cash flow the team delivered in the fourth quarter. We continue to prioritize financial discipline and cost management, and our performance over the past two quarters enhances our competitiveness, improves our platform for continued growth and strengthens the investment case for Concho.","Reviewing the fourth quarter specifically, oil volumes totaled 215,000 barrels per day, which exceeded the high end of our guidance range. It also represented an 8% increase from the same period last year. On the cost side, we made significant progress as well. Controllable costs, which includes lease operating, cash G&A and interest expense totaled $8.43 per unit, achieving our $9 target ahead of schedule. Also, during the final quarter of the year, we reinforced our investment-grade balance sheet by eliminating our revolver balance.","Now to the key metric, free cash flow. We generated $187 million in free cash flow for the quarter, which reflects the difference between operating cash flow before changes in working capital of $801 million and exploration and development cost incurred of $614 million. There are two important drivers for the cash flow growth. Our high cash margin production and improving efficiencies across our drilling and completion operations.","For 2019, average drilling, completion and equipment costs per foot were just below $1,000, which reflects an 18% decrease compared to 2018. Despite all the movement during 2019, we stayed within our guided capital budget and grew oil production 25% year-over-year. We also moved to a steadier drilling program in the second half of 2019, which carries into 2020 and will lead to a more efficient capital program.","For 2020, we are planning a $2.6 billion to $2.8 billion capital budget with our activity equally split between the Delaware and Midland basins. We expect this level of investment will result in drilling, completing and turning online approximately 300 wells during the year. The average project size will be six wells, and our average well spacing will be 700 to 800 feet as compared to approximately 550 feet last year.","Rolling our cost improvements in faster cycle times together, we expect to spend approximately 10% less year-over-year, while completing about 10% more lateral feet. Our activity is expected to generate 10% to 12% oil production growth, which represents 217,000 to 221,000 barrels of oil per day compared to pro forma 2019 volumes of 197,000 barrels per day.","Gas and NGL prices have fallen since our third quarter 2019 call, but our hedge book has this in a position to deliver on the priorities and targets that we've previously discussed. We expect to fund the capital program and generate $350 million of free cash flow at $50 oil and current prices for gas and NGLs due to lower well cost, a lower cost structure and beneficial hedges that provide stability in a volatile market.","After our third quarter call, we layered on hedges at $57 WTI. So while they limit our upside and a $60 scenario, they are substantially above market in today's $50 environment. Our forecast for $650 million of free cash flow at $60 oil, includes the new hedges as well as current NGL prices. We see the potential to deliver $750 million in free cash flow with strong execution and an NGL environment consistent with $60 crude.","So again, 2020 is off to a great start, and we will continue to focus on growing margins, growing free cash flow, growing distributions and advancing sustainability. These priorities will support our performance. We also have a very strong commitment to capital discipline because we believe it's key to maintaining a strong balance sheet and growing long-term value through the cycles.","We'll now turn the call back over to the moderator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan.","Arun Jayaram","Yes. Good morning. My first question is related to the improvement in cash margins that we saw in 4Q. In 4Q, your controllable cash costs LOE, G&A and interest were $8.43 per BOE, and that did include some of the impact from your higher cost, New Mexico Shelf assets. The 2020 guide, using the midpoints, looks like it's $9.17 per barrel. If you use the low end of the guidance range, it's around 9%. So just wondered if you could help us reconcile the 4Q run rate in the cost structure versus the 2020 guide?","Jack Harper","Yes, Arun, this is Jack. The fourth quarter had a couple of things in there. First off, strong production. We also had a couple of onetime items that will not be recurring. But as we look forward to 2020, our midpoint of our guide, as you say, is just above $9, I hope with strong performance and execution throughout the year, we can make our way towards that bottom end.","Arun Jayaram","Great. And just on the oil differentials, we're also tighter than your guidance, which obviously drove the cash margin uptick in the fourth quarter. What's your thoughts on diffs into 2020?","Jack Harper","Yes. Well, going back a little bit in time, we're glad that we were patient thing that Midland pricing was coming to us, and that has happened. And so that has been very beneficial to price a barrel in Midland, and we see it like that out for the next couple of years.","Arun Jayaram","Great. And just my follow-up, Jack. What stood out to us as the fact that you're completing 20 more wells than you're placing under production this year. What is driving that delta? And could this have some positive implications for 2021 as well?","Jack Harper","Sure. The way I would really characterize the entire 2020 program is steady. We're going to run about the same number of rigs and completion crews throughout the year. So it really should be roughly equal during the year, wells drilled and then \u2013 and put on.","Arun Jayaram","Okay. Fair enough. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs.","Brian Singer","Thank you. Good morning.","Jack Harper","Good morning.","Brian Singer","Given some of the movement in terms of how the reserves that have been added and the cost of reserves and F&D cost to add reserves. With a better program focused on wider spacing in 2020, what would be your expectations for what the 2020 capital program would deliver from a reserve replacement perspective based on kind of what your expectations are for F&D costs on the wider space program?","Jack Harper","Yes. Good morning, Brian, it\u2019s Jack. I would expect the go-forward 2020 and beyond F&D and reserve replacement to look a lot more like the past. We had some well-documented issues in 2019 with some spacing tests. But going forward, with the space program and the efficiency we're seeing in our drilling program, I feel that we will look more like the past.","Brian Singer","Great, thanks. And then on Slide 8, you talk about your expectations for lateral length moving up to about 10,000 feet in 2020 versus 9,000 feet. Can you add a bit more color on how you see the Midland Basin varying from the Delaware Basin? And then can you also talk to where you see, if at all, any maximum lateral lengths or at least any limitations on lateral lengths from a technology perspective or just a risking perspective?","Will Giraud","Brian, it's Will. Yes, pushing that average lateral length up to 10,000 feet is really a result of the team's doing a good job trading around and blocking up our acreage position. So I think that's a positive driver into 2020. As to \u2013 between the different basins, the way you get to that 10,000 on average is a blend of a little bit higher than that on the Midland Basin, then a little bit less than that on the Delaware Basin. But broadly in both places, we are getting the 2 miles as our base lateral length in the Midland Basin. We pushed to 2.5 and then even some examples recently 3. But from an acreage position, 2 miles is really a good number to use.","Brian Singer","And do you think that there is \u2013 or do you see an opportunity to add more acreage for the purposes of increasing the lateral length beyond the 2 miles? Or is that something that will be part of how you would think about use of capital to further improve efficiencies?","Will Giraud","I mean, I think there's opportunity to do that. When you ask about use of capital, I think the best way to do that is with noncore assets as currency in these trades. So that's really what we're using to lengthen laterals and kind of continue to block up our position.","Brian Singer","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Derrick Whitfield with Stifel.","Derrick Whitfield","Good morning, all. Congrats on a strong year-end update.","Jack Harper","Thank you.","Will Giraud","Thanks.","Derrick Whitfield","Beginning with your capital efficiency chart on Page 8, the year-over-year sequential improvement is quite impressive. Could you comment on what degree of improved well productivity year-over-year is implied in your forecast?","Jack Harper","Hey, Derrick, it's Jack. Good morning. Yes, we \u2013 with the up space program and our \u2013 the well cost coming down, 2020 does imply a more efficient program, no doubt, but it's driven both by the cost and the expected performance.","Derrick Whitfield","Okay. Thanks. And as my follow-up, I'd like to focus on sustainability and would certainly want to commend you and your team on the sustainability initiatives and your positive recognition in yesterday's Texas Railroad Commission on flaring study. Perhaps for Tim or Will or Jack, could you guys elaborate on your efforts to expand water recycling firm-wide, as you referenced on Page 12 of the deck?","Will Giraud","Sure. Hey, Derrick, it's Will. Yes, water recycling is a big push right now. And for ourselves and for industry to get to higher and higher percentages of water recycling, it's going to require big trunk line, shared third-party infrastructure. So that's been one of the drivers behind some of these transactions you've seen us do on the water side, so that we can source more recycled water and also recycle an increasing percentage of our own.","Derrick Whitfield","Very helpful, guys. Thanks for your time.","Will Giraud","Thank you, Derrick.","Jack Harper","Thank you, Derrick.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Cheng with Scotiabank. Paul, your line is open. Please go ahead. Okay. We\u2019ll take our next question from Doug Leggate with Bank of America.","Doug Leggate","Thank you. Good morning, everybody. Guys, I wonder if I could just had one housekeeping question and one detailed question on inventory. My housekeeping question is that the GP&T guidance is obviously up a little bit. My guess is that's related to Gulf Coast sales. Can you just walk us through how you expect that to trend? What your current Gulf Coast exposure looks like and whether you would consider changing the absolute volumes committed at the cost at some point?","Will Giraud","Sure. Hi, Doug. this is Will. Yes, the driver there, we\u2019ve talked about that waterborne pricing deal we did on about 50,000 barrels of oil gross a day, and so that\u2019s what\u2019s pushing GP&T up. There\u2019s also an offsetting increase in the price we realized for that. And as Jack mentioned earlier, just in terms of thinking about how that may change over time. We did that transaction to get access to waterborne pricing to kind of build that portfolio of pricing points. But as we sit here today, we like the blend we have of kind of Midland-based pricing for a majority of it and some exposure to water point pricing for the rest.","Doug Leggate","So, the 50,000 is a good number going forward for what duration, Will?","Will Giraud","It\u2019s kind of a five-or-so year deal.","Doug Leggate","Okay. Like I said, this was just really more about the realization that goes on the other side, and that\u2019s where I was trying to get to. So, thank you for that. My follow-up is really is, you defined in your deck as you\u2019ve done many, many times that you\u2019ve got decades of inventory. I think you guys have done a pretty good job, as you\u2019ve probably seen in our work at least of emphasizing free cash flow, which we think is about the only reasonable way to value any E&P nowadays. The other set of that, however, is what the sustaining capital as it goes along with its free cash flow and inventory numbers.","So, I\u2019m wondering if you can walk us through where that stands today, your maintenance capital, if you like, and how you think it evolves as your portfolio. I assume there\u2019s 10%-plus growth rate as the new normal. How does that sustaining capital evolve? And I\u2019ll leave it there.","Jack Harper","Yes, Doug. The way we see it today, our sustaining capital is about $2 billion. That over a longer period of time, we think the base decline rate will moderate somewhat. So, my expectation is that number would \u2013 could improve over time and yield more free cash flow.","Doug Leggate","Okay. I guess, if I may just offer an observation, I think, in order to compare an E&P with the broader market, some visibility on those numbers is what we would thought would be more consistent disclosure. So, do you guys could give out some thought, it would be much appreciated?","Jack Harper","Okay. One other thing I would add is, the focus in 2020 and then the $50 environment is more tilted towards rate of return as we\u2019ve spoken about. You asked about our inventory, and so that does have implications on the inventory. But the good news is, I think we see strong opportunities for as far out as we can see that will allow for the way I described our capital over \u2013 in the future.","Doug Leggate","I appreciate the answer, guys. Thanks, again.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Neal Dingmann with SunTrust.","Neal Dingmann","Good morning, guys. My first question is on growth and yields. I\u2019m just wondering, you definitely now have very compelling oil-drilled free cash flow yield and dividend yield. I\u2019m just wondering, how much do you think about Tim prioritizing these if you had to going forward?","Tim Leach","Yes. We spend a lot of time talking about that. We\u2019ve talked about that on this call from the past that we want the dividend to be a meaningful part of the investment consideration. We took a big step in this quarter to get there. And that\u2019s our first priority and call on cash flow. And so as I think about returning capital to shareholders, I think a growing dividend is the highest priority way. And \u2013 but we\u2019ve also demonstrated that at different pricing levels, we\u2019ll generate different amounts of free cash flow that will be available to also return to shareholders. And that way, we would do primarily through share repurchases at the right time.","Neal Dingmann","No, that certainly makes that certainly makes sense. I like the combination. And then my second question is on the flexibility for 2020 program. I\u2019m just wondering how actively will you move around those 18-or-so rigs that you have throughout your Northern and Southern Midland and Delaware positions this year? Or is it kind of set of where they might operate?","Will Giraud","Neal, it\u2019s Will. I think the way Jack characterized the program steady is a good way to think about the activity level of those rigs as they move around different parts of the basin.","Neal Dingmann","Will, does that include \u2013 if I could, just one follow-up. Does that include \u2013 you certainly have seemed to have one of the more stable or steadier programs, I think, almost the same rigs since late August now. Is that even in this environment, you\u2019re pretty comfortable with running around that same type of program throughout this year?","Will Giraud","For sure. I mean, I think that was a big part of our 2020 budget was to budget around a conservative oil price and plan to run that activity, not foolishly if we see something dramatically lower. But one of the big lessons from last year is the benefits of running a steady, consistent program.","Neal Dingmann","Very noticeable. Thanks, guys.","Will Giraud","Thank you.","Tim Leach","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from John Freeman with Raymond James.","John Freeman","Good morning, guys.","Will Giraud","Good morning, John.","John Freeman","Just looking again, at the really big improvement on the cycle times, especially from 3Q 2019 to 4Q 2019, with another 10% improvement, is there any way to drill down a little bit more into that, just in terms of what drove that big of an increase? I mean, any few things that you could point to?","Jack Harper","Sure. It\u2019s \u2013 that steadiness. It\u2019s staying in the same areas and really focusing on doing the same well types over and over again. We also did, I think, improve our overall well design over the course of the back half of 2019, and then just \u2013 we\u2019ve had really good run times and overall efficiencies with our different partners.","John Freeman","And then last quarter, you broke out sort of what was driving some of the savings in the Northern Delaware, and it pointed out that water was about 30% of the savings in the Delaware. What\u2019s sort of the just big high-level ballpark sort of estimates on the Midland side, in terms of you\u2019re breaking out similar to how you did the Northern Delaware last quarter?","Jack Harper","Yes. It probably doesn\u2019t look that different, like we talked about earlier, increasing the amount of recycled water we use. There\u2019s a savings element in that. Clearly, the \u2013 to the extent, sand costs have improved, that applies to both sides of the basin. And then the Midland is probably where we\u2019ve been able to continue to push lateral lengths past that two-mile piece, which helps you meaningfully on a dollar per foot basis.","John Freeman","Great. Thanks, guys. Appreciate it.","Will Giraud","Thanks, John.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from Scott Hanold with RBC Capital Markets.","Scott Hanold","Thanks. Good morning. If I wouldn\u2019t \u2013 could drive into the resources that you all have. I mean, in past, you guys have talked about your resource base a little bit. I think the prior one last year was 26,000 locations at about 12 billion BOE. When you look at your new spacing configuration and how you view as premium inventory \u2013 I know you talked about having plenty of length in that. But do you have some numbers you can help kind of quantify for us with that?","Jack Harper","Yes. Scott, the way I would characterize that is just to say that we have prioritized rate of return in the back half of 2019 and going forward in 2020. And we have as many years of that as we can see looking forward in a very similar disbursement of rates of return in our assets. So while it\u2019s still measured in decades. If rate of return remains the focus in this commodity price, it will not be as many as the highest it once was, but it will be measured in decades.","Will Giraud","I think it\u2019s good to remind you that, in previous conversations, we talked about the balance of rate of return and recoveries. And as Jack said that in this environment, in 2020, we\u2019re \u2013 we\u2019ve got a spacing program that\u2019s focused on rate of return, and we have ample inventory around that spacing design, but it\u2019s flexible. And those two things are related: the resource base and the economics based on the spacing design.","Scott Hanold","So, when you step back and look at it, I mean \u2013 and you talked about decades of inventory, and certainly, I think you\u2019ve got that good visibility with your footprint on a map, but do you sense that the inventory is adequate? Or do you think it\u2019s maybe a little bit too much where you\u2019d still look at some select larger monetizations, stuff you may not get to for a while? Or is it just more blocking and tackling today?","Jack Harper","Yes. Scott, we certainly have \u2013 we\u2019re happy with the amount of inventory we have. If you look at what we\u2019ve done over the last two or three years in terms of monetizing assets, both midstream and upstream, I hope that\u2019s an indication of our willingness to sell things that are at the back end of our priority from a capital allocation standpoint, and we will continue looking at our portfolio through that same lens.","Scott Hanold","Understood. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from Leo Mariani with KeyBanc.","Leo Mariani","Just a question here around oil cut. If I\u2019m looking at this right, in terms of your 2020 guidance, I\u2019m seeing about a 66% oil cut this year. It looked like it\u2019d be about 64% in Q4, and again, about 64% in the first quarter. So just wanted to get a sense of how that sort of evolves throughout the year and what\u2019s kind of driving that improvement?","Jack Harper","Yes, the mid-60s, plus or minus, is due to our capital allocation across the basin is what we see, and it should be pretty steady at that level.","Will Giraud","Selling the shelf was a gassy asset.","Leo Mariani","Okay. And I guess, just from the perspective of looking at our 2020 production guidance and comparing that with kind of where you guys were in the fourth quarter. If I kind of back out the shelf sale in the fourth quarter of 2019, I mean, it looks like 2020 is kind of expected to be sort of flattish with fourth quarter, but I guess down a little bit in the first quarter of 2020. Just kind of wanted to get a little color on that. I mean, I guess do you guys just see production starting to pick up in terms of the growth coming in, in the second quarter? And I guess, just overall, I mean, looking at that kind of level there? It seemed like maybe there was a little conservatism in those numbers?","Tim Leach","Sure, Leo. Yes, just to kind of recap, I mean, if you take the shelf out of the year. For 2019, we\u2019re projecting to grow our oil rates in 2020 a little more than 10%. And so that \u2013 I think your question really is about the cadence of that growth because you point correctly to that fourth quarter number, we reported 215 MBoepd. If you take the shelf out, then it\u2019s about 210 MBoepd.","And our first quarter guide at the high end is essentially flat with that number, so I wouldn\u2019t read too much into that. There\u2019s a little bit just inter-quarter noise around the first quarter. There\u2019s probably more completion or more wells put on production in the back half of the quarter than the front. But as Jack has mentioned, the theme of steady should be the way you think about 2020\u2019s growth.","Leo Mariani","Okay. That\u2019s helpful color. And I guess, just on your dividend versus buyback, you guys had a pretty significant buyback activity in the fourth quarter. I know part of that was driven by the shelf sale. You\u2019ve obviously boosted the dividend aggressively here in 2020, which is great to see. You should have quite a bit of other free cash flow. Are you guys going to still stay aggressive on the buyback here in 2020? Or do you guys kind of view that high fourth quarter buyback as a little bit more onetime in nature?","Jack Harper","Well, we talked about using the proceeds from the sale of the Shelf to fund buybacks, and we did that. And I would say that we also talked about the various levels of free cash flow that are possible between $50 and $60 oil. And one of the greatest uses of that amount of free cash flow will be opportunistic stock buybacks. So\u2026","Leo Mariani","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Jack Harper","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from Bob Brackett with Bernstein Research.","Bob Brackett","Hey, good morning. I\u2019m intrigued by Slide 15 in the deck where you talk about your horizontal wells drilled by zone and formation. And there\u2019s a bit of two questions here. One is there\u2019s a mix shift between, say, your pre-2018 program and the current program, for example, in the Delaware, from the second Bone Springs into the Wolfcamp A; and for the Midland, from the Wolfcamp A into the Lower Spraberry. Question is, what drives that shift, assuming that you\u2019re trying to maximize the IRR of every well you drill?","Will Giraud","Sure, Bob. I mean, there\u2019s a variety of things driving that. In the Delaware, one of them is just trying to target the oiliest zones with the backdrop we have in terms of natural gas pricing and NGL pricing. So there\u2019s some aspect of that, but also, it\u2019s just \u2013 in the Midland Basin, as you talk about this different Spraberry intervals, the rates of return there have been superior for us than many of the Wolfcamp zones in the Midland Basin, so capital has moved that way as well.","Bob Brackett","And how do I think about prospectivity? Should I use sort of the level of activity in the last couple of years as a measure of how good the zones are? Or is that too simplistic?","Jack Harper","I think that\u2019s probably too simplistic. I mean, part of this is, as Tim has talked about before, over the last couple of years, there\u2019s always been an element of exploration in our program, where we\u2019ve tried to continue testing other zones with the knowledge that if you don\u2019t go get them now, you may or may not be able to get them in the same way later.","And so we continue to kind of try and figure out the exact right answer on that. I think one lesson from 2019 is especially in a $50-oil environment, we\u2019re going to have less risk tolerance in terms of doing that here in 2020, but it\u2019s still an important question to answer for the long-term.","Bob Brackett","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from Jeffrey Campbell with Tuohy Brothers.","Jeffrey Campbell","Good morning and congratulations on the quarter and the year. I noticed with interest in CapEx is now split 50-50 between the Delaware Basin and Midland Basin as opposed to 60-40 in 2019. I just wondered what was driving the increased capital allocation to the Midland Basin?","Tim Leach","Hey, Jeffrey. I wouldn\u2019t read too much into that. I mean, our capital allocation process definitely looks a lot like what we have done in previous years, which is that the teams compete with each other for capital, based on a rate of return basis and also kind of the long-term ROI. And so 60-40, 50-50, are generally similar numbers to me.","Jeffrey Campbell","Okay. Thank you. I appreciate that. And on Slide 12, going back to the flaring. Obviously, a lot of improvement there. I just wondered, is there a physical constraint to further reducing the flaring? And if so, how is that going to be resolved?","Tim Leach","That\u2019s the result of a very intentional effort on our part. There\u2019s a lot of push, obviously, on the industry and from within the industry to continue to move that number down. So that\u2019s a big focal point here.","Jeffrey Campbell","Well, I guess what I was asking was, do we need any further pipeline development to reduce the flaring? I mean, is there some specific physical constraint or physical catalyst that\u2019s going to help push that down any further?","Jack Harper","Yes. We are \u2013 to answer your one question, yes, there does need to be additional pipeline development, and there are, fortunately, a couple in the queue. As for now, we are happy with our providers and our agreements, and we are moving all of our guests. And we don\u2019t anticipate any change to our program in 2020 based on constraints.","Jeffrey Campbell","Okay, great. Thank you. I appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from David Deckelbaum with Cowen.","David Deckelbaum","Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to just go \u2013 just wanted to go back real quickly to the conversation around the split or allocation between Midland and Delaware. Did that capital allocation process change in 2020 versus what it was in 2019 being that sort of team-driven model? And I guess, as we think beyond 2020 \u2013 I know you said you don\u2019t see a big difference between 60-40 and 50-50. Does that change precipitously over time as we get into 2021 and beyond?","Tim Leach","I don\u2019t think so. This is Tim. I mean, we\u2019re constantly learning new things about the program and our assets through the science that we\u2019re doing and that informs and drives how we build future programs. And we\u2019ve had great success on the Midland Basin side in certain zones that make those zones more competitive for capital. So \u2013 but I like having a balance between the two areas and the ability to move capital back and forth. Our New Mexico area still has some of the best rock in the entire world. And we\u2019ll continue to get a large amount of capital allocated to it.","David Deckelbaum","I appreciate that. Are there specific areas that you drilled in 2019 that you are shifting capital away from \u2013 in 2020 in the Delaware?","Jack Harper","Not really. The only thing that\u2019s shifting is the style of development and the spacing of the wells. But other than that, no.","David Deckelbaum","Okay. And just the last one I had, I know you guys have increased your \u2013 the number of locations, the lateral lengths on average by 7% this year, and you\u2019re drilling a program in 2020 with averages of 10,000 feet. What does \u2013 how long does that sort of 10,000 foot average lateral length program extends for?","Will Giraud","Well, it\u2019s dynamic. As we sit here today, you\u2019ve got a lot of it still to do. But I think one of the challenges to our team is to continue to do the work on the asset side with acreage swaps, and otherwise, to extend that runway out as far as we can see.","David Deckelbaum","Got it. But as we stand today, if we were to allocate like a 2021 program, it would be somewhat similar, I guess?","Will Giraud","Yes. I mean, I don\u2019t want to get into modeling it, but we should be able to do 10,000 foot laterals for a long time.","David Deckelbaum","Thank you, guys.","Will Giraud","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from Matt Portillo with TPH.","Matt Portillo","Good morning, all.","Tim Leach","Good morning.","Matt Portillo","Tim, just a follow-up question on the dividend policy going forward, assuming crude generally holds around $50 to $60 WTI. Is there a framework with which investors should be thinking about the dividend as it relates to progression and growth?","Jack Harper","Well, yes, I would say that the difference between $50 and $60 and free cash flow is large, but as I\u2019ve stated, we view our \u2013 the dividend is the first call on our cash flow and capital, and that we want to grow that dividend in a compelling and competitive way. So as the company is able to grow, I think that dividend, you got to expect it to grow over time as well.","Matt Portillo","Perfect. And then a follow-up question as it relates to the shift in the business model that you mentioned over the last few years, targeting in more of a moderated growth program with growing free cash flow over time. Could you potentially talk about any directional color on how CapEx might progress over the next few years if crude is to stay at or above $50 a barrel?","Jack Harper","Yes. I think that one of the important things, and we\u2019ve said it several times on this call is that steady means efficiency. And so the growth of the capital spend, I think, will be very restrained. And in fact, this year\u2019s capital spend is less than last year\u2019s, and we\u2019re getting more from that capital that we\u2019re spending, more lateral feet. It\u2019s a tremendous driver in efficiency and in our margins and things like that. So I think that \u2013 and expect that the capital program going forward will \u2013 the growth of that will be very muted, and \u2013 but the results you see from it ought to grow.","Matt Portillo","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from Paul Cheng with Scotiabank.","Paul Cheng","Thank you. Can you hear me?","Jack Harper","We can.","Paul Cheng","Okay, thank you. Sorry, that \u2013 I think last time I had some problem with the phone. I have to apologize first because I missed the first six or seven minutes of the call. So if my question has already been addressed, please let me know. If I look at longer term, I think a lot of investors, especially in the value side, they would like to have a more clear road map in terms of how the future cash flow is being used. So wondering that as the company shifts more towards into the free cash flow and the return model, do you have a target how much is the percent or the ratio of your cash flow you\u2019re going to reinvest in the business? And how much do you expect that to return to the shareholder?","Jack Harper","Sure. We\u2019ve laid out our framework in a slide pretty well here that we expect a $50 oil, plus or minus, to be able to grow our business and generate increasing amounts of free cash flow. But the points in the cycle, when the price goes above that, not chasing that price and letting all the free cash come back to see the shareholders either in the form of a dividend or a buyback. And so that\u2019s the underlying framework that I think you should expect. And as Tim just mentioned, that can improve with better efficiencies and getting more for less.","Paul Cheng","At $50, do you have a, say, target? How much is the free cash that you want to generate over time as a percentage?","Tim Leach","Well, you can see what we\u2019re doing in 2020 at $50, and my expectation is that we should be able to improve from that level going forward.","Paul Cheng","Okay. So $350 million is the baseline that we should use and assume that you\u2019re going to do better in the future and then that bank lenient to what is the CapEx that you may use.","Jack Harper","Okay.","Paul Cheng","Long-term, do you have a target production growth now. I think at one point in the past that you\u2019re talking about 15%. And for this year, that, say, 10% to 12% oil growth, 6% to 8% on the total volume growth, is that a reasonable target growth rate in the future on the longer term?","Jack Harper","Yes. As we\u2019ve described many times, we\u2019re searching for that optimal mix of growth in free cash flow. You can see what the output of that is in 2020. And beyond that, we will see what the circumstances hold.","Paul Cheng","Yes. Thank you. I would just make one comment then. I think for the investors, they would want to see a higher free cash flow than a higher growth rate, given the growth, the investors are no longer here. I don\u2019t think that the market will want any company going, say, call it, beyond 10% and more? Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from Gail Nicholson with Stephens.","Gail Nicholson","Good morning. Just a standpoint of the hedge book, you guys have a very healthy hedge book this year. With the continued volatility that we have experienced in the commodity, has your hedging strategy changed at all, in the standpoint of what you feel is needed from a hedge protection on a go-forward basis?","Jack Harper","Our strategy really hasn\u2019t changed. I mean, the basis of this strategy is hedging the PDP volumes out for a couple of cycles, for 12 to 24 months. That\u2019s the basis. The tactics have changed, where we\u2019ve got the waterborne volumes that you hedge that a little bit differently. We\u2019ve talked about \u2013 in the past, we didn\u2019t hedge gas and NGL so much. You\u2019ve seen us being more active with that, thankfully. And so \u2013 but the basic strategy is still the same. And it\u2019s not to assume that we know which direction commodity prices are going. It\u2019s just to take some of the risk and volatility of our cash flow in the short-term.","Gail Nicholson","Great, thank you. And then in regards to LOE, when we look at potential future improvements, is that more water cost savings driven? Is there incremental savings from electricity that\u2019s being put in, a switch from EPS to gas lift? Or just can you talk about just kind of some of the projects that are being implemented in 2020 to further improve the LOE cost?","Will Giraud","Sure. I mean, the water piece is probably a net neutral. To the extent we\u2019re doing those transactions, it\u2019s at a market rate. And so it shouldn\u2019t have much of an impact either way on LOE. As it relates to just broader improvement in LOE, I would say that it\u2019s going to come through the aggregation of a whole lot of small efforts as opposed to any one big gain. I mean, as compasses and electrical infrastructure is built out, you need less generators as time passes and technology helps you improve things on the productivity side with automation and otherwise. There\u2019s definitely long-term opportunity there, but it\u2019s going to be a grind.","Gail Nicholson","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from Josh Silverstein with Wolfe Research.","Josh Silverstein","Thanks. Good morning, guys. Just on the capital budget for this year, maybe just a clarification there. Is the $2.6 billion to $2.8 billion all in? I\u2019m asking because you guys have historically put some capital into midstream projects, have added some \u2013 or spent some dollars on the acreage additions? So just wanted to see if we should be thinking about any additional capital beyond that level?","Jack Harper","Yes, the \u2013 any additional capital beyond that should be pretty minimal. So I think that\u2019s the way you should look at it. In terms of the specific items you have mentioned, the same percentages hold that we\u2019ve talked about in the past for infrastructure and non-exploration and development capital. They are included in that number, the $2.6 billion to $2.8 billion.","Josh Silverstein","Got it. So like, they are roughly 150-ish or so that you spent over the last couple of years, that\u2019s in that number for this year now?","Will Giraud","Yes, it\u2019s kind of that 7% to 10% of the total.","Josh Silverstein","Got it. Okay. Thanks for that. And then just on the cost structure, but between the two basins, obviously, there\u2019s a big decline expected in the Delaware this year. Just curious where the leading edge is right now? And is there any reason to think why the Delaware couldn\u2019t get below the Midland entering 2021?","Will Giraud","Well, I do think the forward guidance we\u2019re giving there on the DC&E per foot reflects kind of the environment as we see it in 4Q and projects it as being steady across 2020. I think if you looked at the breakout between that number. The Delaware Basin is probably $100 a foot higher on average and the Midland Basin is about $100 a foot lower on average. And while they have had similar drivers in terms of causing that number to come down over time and there has been dramatic improvement in the Delaware, especially around some of our things we\u2019re doing on the drill side, I do expect the Delaware number just structurally to stay higher because of depths and pressures.","Josh Silverstein","Got it. Thanks, guys.","Will Giraud","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Noel Parks with Coker & Palmer.","Noel Parks","Good morning. Can you hear me?","Jack Harper","Yes, good morning.","Noel Parks","Okay, great. Thanks. In your comments earlier today, you were talking about next-gen frac equipment. And I was curious, do you view the sort of next stage of efficiency more being on the equipment side as opposed to the frac recipe side going forward?","Jack Harper","Well, I\u2019ll let Will jump in on this in detail. But I would say efficiencies come in small bites everywhere. And that\u2019s been the case for a long time. So I would expect everything to get more efficient over time.","Will Giraud","Yes. No, that\u2019s \u2013 I agree. And what we\u2019re really trying to highlight there is just the move to this dual fuel, including 1 Tier for a fleet. We think that\u2019s another opportunity to keep driving costs down to the extent you\u2019re burning compressed natural gas or even field gas in your fleet instead. And so we\u2019re pushing on that side pretty hard.","Noel Parks","Great. And you\u2019ve done a lot as far as lateral lengths as you\u2019ve described. But I\u2019m wondering, for those remaining areas where you \u2013 your leases leave you having to do short lateral, how much of a compromise in returns or efficiency do you have at this point with a shorter lateral?","Will Giraud","I mean, we\u2019re trying pretty hard to not drill one-mile laterals. But I mean, the uptick from going to one-mile to two is very significant. I mean, on order of magnitude, it can double the rate of return.","Noel Parks","Okay. And are there any differences, and I guess, stimulation effect in this or anything? I\u2019m thinking about \u2013 with the longer laterals, of course, you have a sort of more complex completion. You have the issues that some things happen at the tow, the welcome here to on a shorter lateral, are those factored at all?","Will Giraud","I mean, I wouldn\u2019t say just flat no, but technology is fixed, most of the big problems using dissolvable plugs to the extents you\u2019re going beyond two miles for the tow and some of those types of things. But broadly, the answer is no. The effectiveness is the same.","Noel Parks","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Richard Tullis with Capital One Securities.","Richard Tullis","Thanks, good morning. Most of my questions have been asked, but just one last one for Tim or Jack. It\u2019s been, I guess, a little more than a year since the RSP acquisition closed, any one or two items stand out at this point that may have surprised to the upside or maybe even cause some disappointment compared to the initial thoughts at the time of the acquisition?","Tim Leach","No, it\u2019s a great combination of like assets. I still think size, scale and blockiness of our acreage position is very important. And you can see that through the efficiency numbers that we\u2019re continuing to gain. It also allowed us the sale of the shelf and continued to high-grade our properties just makes us better company.","Richard Tullis","Thank you. That\u2019s helpful. And lastly, just thanks for the detail in the presentation on the different cost components. I think that\u2019s helpful. That\u2019s all for me.","Tim Leach","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our final question will come from Jeanine Wai with Barclays.","Jeanine Wai","Hi, good morning, everyone.","Tim Leach","Good morning.","Jeanine Wai","Good morning. I wanted to follow up on some of the dividend questions. You announced that nice dividend increase. And in terms of just understanding it a little better, for the dividend coverage, at what oil price are you comfortable with? You\u2019ve got a really strong hedge book program this year that puts a lot of protection. And on the downside, it also makes the breakeven pretty low, at five below $50 WTI. But what about unhedged and maybe as a follow-up to that going forward, since this strip is pretty flat at 51% for hedging purposes, where do you feel comfortable for 2021 and 2022 coverage?","Jack Harper","Yes. And starting in 2020, we feel comfortable that sub-$45 oil, we can cover our capital plan and that dividend. So that gives us comfort this year to whether anything that may come. And if oil looks like it\u2019s going to be lower for longer, below that price, we will modify our capital plan. Going forward, I think, just philosophically, the way to think about the dividend is that it should represent an increasing percentage of our cash flow, and it should most likely outpace our growth in production.","Jeanine Wai","Okay, great. Thank you for taking my questions.","Operator","Thank you. I\u2019m showing no further questions in the queue at this time. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Tim Leach for any further remarks.","Tim Leach","Right. Thank you. I know that this was a busy morning. There\u2019s lots of companies reporting this morning. I appreciate all the good questions and interest in our company. We look forward to talking to you next quarter. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for your participation.

My name is Leanne, and I will be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Price Moncrief, Vice President of Capital Markets and Strategy. Please go ahead.","L. Price Moncrief","Good morning. Thank you for joining us today for Concho's second quarter conference call. I'd like to take a minute to direct your attention to the forward-looking statement disclaimer contained in the press release. In summary, it states that statements in last night's press release and on this conference call that state the company's or management's expectations or predictions of the future are forward-looking statements intended to be covered by the Safe Harbor provisions under the federal securities laws. There are many factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations, including those we described in the press release, our 10-K and our other filings with the SEC.","In addition, we will reference certain non-GAAP measures, so be sure to see the reconciliations in our earnings release.","On today's call, I'm joined by Tim Leach, our Chairman, President and CEO, as well as other members of our management team who will be available to take questions.","Before we get started, I'd like to point out that in addition to our earnings release, we have posted a slide deck to accompany this conference call, which can be found in our website at concho.com.","On the agenda today, Tim will cover our second quarter results and highlights before getting into an operations update. We'll conclude with an outlook on our expected drilling activity for the remainder of the year and then move to Q&A.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Tim.","Timothy A. Leach","Good morning. I hope everyone has had a chance to download the earnings call presentation and can follow along starting on Slide #3. The second quarter was an outstanding quarter for Concho. Production, cash flow and earnings all grew meaningfully over the previous quarter due in large part to a solid jump in crude oil volume. Additionally, the team executed well, completing about 175 operated wells, including a record number of horizontal wells in a single quarter.","You may have heard me say this before, but it's a great time to be a Permian-focused company. Slide 4 really makes that case. We accomplished quite a bit during the second quarter. Our cash margin, which is a critical component of our growth strategy, rebounded following a period of Permian oil takeaway challenges that affected our realizations.","In the Delaware Basin, we achieved 2 major milestones. For the first time, the Delaware Basin eclipsed the New Mexico Shelf as our largest core area in terms of production. That's an amazing accomplishment when you consider this core area is just a little over 2 years old.","Another notable milestone is that our horizontal production in the Delaware Basin grew 37% over the previous quarter, which represents our highest quarter-over-quarter growth to date, not an easy task considering the size of the production base. With respect to overall production growth, it's important to note that our growth is crude oil-driven. Over the last 4 quarters, crude oil has increased 22% and now represents 63% of our overall mix, the highest crude oil mix for Concho in 2 years.","Another encouraging thing is that our oil growth is coming from the Delaware Basin, which is our fastest-growing area. Our rapid growth in the Delaware is directly related to the strength of our operations and technical teams. They are best in the Permian. In the Northern Delaware Basin, we brought on 35 new wells with average rates that continue to set records. And our de-risking effort in the Southern Delaware Basin is paying off. Following some solid early wells, we've identified an initial set of horizontal location 6 months ahead of schedule. The Delaware Basin is truly a remarkable asset, and I expect we'll be busy there for many decades.","For those of you who have been focused on the excitement in the Midland Basin, let me remind you that we have a significant position there, too. In fact, our early horizontal Wolfcamp results in the Wolfberry play are among the best in the industry. So we're planning to expand our activity there through the rest of '13.","Finally, we've clearly had lots of horizontal success over the last few months, and later on this call, I will outline our plan for the rest of '13 with respect to capital allocation within our $1.6 billion budget.","Let's turn now to Slide #5. I mentioned earlier that cash margin is a critical component of our growth, so it's worth looking at this a little closer. Our cash margin has returned to its historic level following an unprecedented widening of the Midland-to-Cushing basis differential. We have the highest cash margin in one of the lowest cost structures among all of our Permian peers. No one in the Permian is capable of recycling cash as efficiently and quickly as Concho. What sets us apart from the pack is our crude oil weighted production mix and our focus on keeping costs as low as possible for a growing organization. This is a key measure of our success.","Let's shift gears and move on to an operational update starting on Slide #6. The New Mexico Shelf has been and remains a key asset for Concho, having drilled over 1,500 wells there and identified over 1,700 remaining high rate of return drilling opportunities. It was this asset base that allowed us to go public exactly 6 years ago, and it's the platform that has enabled us to go in other parts of the Permian, including the Delaware and Midland Basins. Given the high-quality nature of these assets and its manufacturing-like operation, industry activities reached a level that current midstream infrastructure struggles to support. Historically, we've been able to account for things like extended plant turnarounds and high line pressures in our production guidance, but the challenges today are beyond those risk assumptions.","As an example, a 15-mile high pressure gas line operated by Frontier Field Services failed after only a few years of service. That line is in a critical area of our shelf asset and was moving about 25% of our shelf volume. In addition, new plant expansions have been delayed. We estimate that the impact to our production due to midstream challenges was approximately 375,000 Boes year-to-date. And if these conditions persists, we expect the full year impact of approximately 700,000 equivalent barrels.","Our midstream service providers are working diligently to resolve these issues. However, until we see meaningful relief in the system, we will continue to operate at a restricted level. We're currently running one horizontal rig in the Yeso, down from 5 during the first half of the year, and we're reallocating Yeso drilling dollars to our horizontal drilling operations in the Delaware and Midland Basins.","With respect to our ability to grow overall production, I don't see these midstream challenges as an issue we can't overcome. Over the last couple of years, we've actively allocated bigger -- a bigger component of our capital budget to areas like the Delaware, which is our most significant growth driver.","So let's turn to Slide 7 and talk about the Delaware Basin, which is performing like the most prolific oil basin in the Permian. There seems to be a lot of focus these days on big initial rates and big resource capture, yet it seems to us that it's time to talk about execution and real and measurable results. I'm going to talk about big rates in just a few minutes, but I want to start off by talking about the results.","Exactly 1 year ago, during the second quarter 2012 conference call, I outlined a plan that called for a strategic shift in our drilling program to accelerate the development of our more capital-efficient, higher rate of return horizontal operations in the Delaware Basin. We laid down some vertical rigs in our legacy Yeso and Wolfberry plays and stayed on budget through the end of 2012. And in just 1 year, we have more than doubled our horizontal Delaware Basin production, which now stands at 32,000 Boes per day. Our quarter-over-quarter growth from the horizontal Delaware Basin has never been as high as it was this most recent quarter at 37%. But the most notable trend here is the progression of our crude oil production mix. A year ago, crude oil represented about 50% of our production from this asset and now stands at 63%. So while our horizontal Delaware production more than doubled in a year, our oil production nearly tripled.","The performance of this asset continues to exceed our expectations. Not only is the Delaware production compensating for the midstream challenges in the shelf, but it's also carrying the overall growth of the company. We're not adjusting our full year production guidance at this time as we expect to finish the year within our range. However, 700,000 Boe impact to production in the shelf is not immaterial and can be the difference between finishing at the high end or the low end of our guidance.","I promised I would talk to you about rates, so let's turn to Slide 8 and take a look at what's driving our results in the Northern Delaware Basin. At Concho, we continue to emphasize the relevance of 30-day initial rates as an indicator of well performance. But for those of you that track and compare 24-hour rates, we now have something for you, too. Let me start off by putting this slide into context. Since 2011, Concho has drilled and completed 184 horizontal wells in the Northern Delaware with an average lateral length of 4,193 feet. The average 30-day rate of all those wells is 739 Boes per day, 67% oil. And the average 24-hour peak rate on those same wells is 1,224 Boes per day. Again, that's over 1,200 Boes per day from 184 wells with 4,200-foot laterals. And as you can see from this slide, our well productivity and oil mix has consistently improved quarter-over-quarter since 2012.","Now I'm going to rattle off a whole bunch of statistics that I think you'll find interesting. If you don't keep up, don't worry, I'll be happy to repeat myself in the Q&A. During our most recent quarter, we added 35 new wells with an average 30-day rate of 857 Boes per day, 77% oil, and an average 24-hour peak rate of just over 1,400 Boes per day. Both of those average rates represent the highest rates we've achieved in a single quarter. Those wells included 3 extended length laterals and 1 dual lateral, but the average lateral length of all 35 was a little over 4,400 feet. 31 of those 35 most recent wells had 24-hour peak rates of at least 1,000 Boes per day, and 20 of those same 35 wells had a 24-hour peak crude oil rate alone of at least 1,000 barrels per day.","The majority of our success has come in the Bone Spring sand. However, as you can see from the table at the bottom the slide, we've had great success across all zones, including the shallower Brushy Canyon zone. Our first 2 Brushy Canyon wells look good. We plan to drill around 8 more before the end of the year. As a reminder, our entire Northern Delaware inventory at year-end '12 consisted primarily of Avalon, Bone Spring and Wolfcamp. I think we're just beginning to appreciate the productive capacity of the Northern Delaware. It's not hype. It's based on consistently better well performance and proven results.","Let's move on to Slide 9 and talk about the Southern Delaware where we've had some very encouraging results on our first 11 horizontal wells. As you can see on the slide, those wells had an average 30-day rate of 691 Boes per day, 78% oil, and an average 24-hour peak rate of 1,082 Boes per day. Our average lateral length was 4,182 feet. The map illustrates where our wells are located, and based on that data, we feel that we de-risked about 20% of our total net acreage in the Southern Delaware for the Upper Wolfcamp zone.","I know we've been saying that our plan was to get to the end of the year before talking about drilling inventory in the South, but we're going to get a headstart on it now. The team has identified 200 gross locations on our de-risked acreage in North Harpoon and Big Chief, all of which are targeting the Upper Wolfcamp. Over half those locations assume longer laterals of approximately 8,000 feet. Our cost in EURs are dependent on prospect area and lateral length, and you can see our range is roughly 500,000 to 700,000 equivalent barrels, 75% oil at $8.5 million to $10.5 million per well. For the balance of the year, we will continue to test the productive extent of our acreages as well as other prospective zones like the Delaware sands, the Avalon, Bone Spring and Middle Wolfcamp.","Let's move on to Slide 10 and talk about the Midland Basin and our horizontal Wolfberry program. Four of our horizontal Wolfberry wells are currently producing. We're very pleased with the early results. They had an average 30-day rate of 742 Boes per day, 74% oil, and an average 24-hour peak rate of 1,010 Boes per day. The average lateral length was only 3,975 feet. So these wells are among the best in the Midland Basin. I'd like to point out that 2 of our horizontal producers were drilled across vertical Wolfberry, 20-acre in-fill locations. This is just one of the concepts we're testing across our core Wolfberry position. All of our existing wells landed in the Wolfcamp A or B, but we'll also test other zones in the Wolfcamp and even the Spraberry for horizontal development. We're also planning to push outside of Upton County and test Ector, Andrews and possibly Midland counties before the end of the year. In total, I expect we will have 15 or 16 horizontal Wolfberry wells by year end.","Let's turn to Slide 11 now and quickly take a look at our planned activity level and how we expect to spend the remainder of our '13 capital budget. As you can see, we expect to average 10 fewer rigs in the second half of the year than we averaged during the second quarter. However, that drop in rig count is all vertical. In fact, we will average one more horizontal rig in the second half, and our rig count mix will be over 80% horizontal. We've already dropped our rig count in the New Mexico Shelf in response to the midstream challenges and dropped our vertical rig count in the Texas Permian. We're picking up horizontal rigs in the Delaware Basin and the Texas Permian. This plan should allow for us to land our '13 capital budget and position us for future horizontal growth in our key strategic core areas.","Let me wrap up on Slide 12. It's a great time to be in the Permian Basin. There's so much activity and new ideas that are being tested all over this oil-rich region, and the widespread success has put the Permian back on the map. And I've never been more convinced that we have the best assets and people in the Permian. We have significant resource exposure in both the Delaware and Midland Basins. Besides having the highest-quality assets across the Permian, the key differentiating factor for Concho is our ability to execute and deliver exceptional growth year after year.","The fact that we drill many of the best IPs in both the Delaware and the Midland Basins is noteworthy. However, we're especially proud of our production growth and cash margin. The next few years will be very exciting for Concho. We have the perfect combination of an opportunity-rich asset base and unmatched profitability, which provides us with significant flexibility on how we chose to execute our plan. So clearly, we're well positioned to grow our drilling operations and firmly establish ourselves as a leading Permian Basin operator.","I appreciate your continued interest in Concho, and now I'd like to turn this call back over to the moderator and take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Scott Hanold from RBC.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Can you talk in terms of -- when you look at the Northern Delaware Basin, obviously, Wolfcamp is present there and you've got, I guess, roughly about a dozen wells there. And correct me if I'm wrong, there is some more parts of that trend that are a little bit more oily. Can you tell us if you do see some of that on your acreage and if there are a variety of ventures [ph] within the Wolfcamp that's also prospective in the Northern Delaware?","Timothy A. Leach","Yes. Well, let me remind you that what we're drilling in the South, Scott, is all Wolfcamp, and it's very oily. The wells that we've drilled up in the Northern Delaware tend to have a higher gas content but are prolific as well. So I think that we have lots of opportunity in Wolfcamp. We're just focusing more on the second Bone Spring at this time, and that seems to have the highest oil content than anything we're doing up there.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay, okay, fair enough. And just as a follow-up. On some of the long laterals that you all are drilling, can you talk in terms of like relative performance of long laterals from the history you have? I mean, do you see -- based on the well cost, if that optimally the way you think that you can -- you're going to try to develop it if you can?","Timothy A. Leach","Yes. I think our technical teams believe on all of our 4 core assets drilling long laterals is the most efficient way to produce the oil. And so where we have the land position and where we can, we're going to drill extended length laterals. And we think that you're getting the 2x, the production at maybe 1.5x the cost, and it raises the rate of return and has a smaller surface footprint.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","So if you're getting that kind of improvement for the cost, I mean, what does that mean for IRRs if -- I forget. Is it like mid-40s for your base kind of well case there? Does that get it up into the 60s?","Timothy A. Leach","60s or higher.","Operator","Your next question comes from Drew Venker from Morgan Stanley.","Andrew Venker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I was hoping -- you've obviously had good results on both sides of the Permian. I was hoping you could discuss your thinking on the Midland side. I think in the past, you maybe have been considering some [ph] depletion in your Wolfberry area from your existing drilling. Does the results you've seen so far in that in-fill area kind of change your mind there? Or do you want to see more production history?","Timothy A. Leach","Yes. Let me say that the success we've had with the horizontal in the Midland Basin was one of the reasons we laid down so many of our vertical rigs. And I think we're concluding that where we can, drilling horizontal may be the most effective way to harvest those properties. On our vertical drilling program, as we talked to you in the past about going from 80s to 40s to 20-acre spacing, there was an assumption about drainage as you down space and that as we went into this horizontal program, and that's why I mentioned that we laid this horizontal down, down a row of 20-acre space locations. So the big question was, were you going to see any drainage? And the answer is we haven't seen any drainage yet. Admittedly, it's early times. But the offset wells didn't -- haven't been affected, and the horizontal didn't appear to be drained. And I'll just remind you, I mean, we're laying this horizontal down in one zone. The verticals are completed in multi-zones. So if you're talking about drainage, it would be in one zone alone.","Andrew Venker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And Tim, how long has that well been on production?","Timothy A. Leach","One month.","Unknown Executive","One year.","Timothy A. Leach","No, no, no. I'm sorry, one year.","Andrew Venker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. So consistent so far with other horizontals that you guys have drilled?","Timothy A. Leach","We're encouraged enough that we're stopping vertical program to a large extent, and we plan to drill a lot more horizontal wells.","Andrew Venker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. Do see any opportunity to expand your position there? Or is that something you're interested in?","Timothy A. Leach","I'm always interested in expanding my position.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Deckelbaum from KeyBanc.","David Deckelbaum - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Specifically, Tim, you mentioned earlier that you're a little bit early in terms of talking about location count here. Can you elaborate a little bit more on why you chose to talk about it now versus the end of the year? Do you feel is it more a sense that you've de-risked most of your horizontal locations across the acreage? And I guess should we expect -- I guess, going forward now, obviously, you've high graded horizontal side. As we go into 2014, should we think about that more of a year that includes minimal de-risking activity?","Timothy A. Leach","No. I think there will continue to be a lot of de-risking. We have a large acreage position. We've said before, part of our caution about talking about the South was, one, we wanted to understand it first. And two, it was competitive situation. A lot -- we've drilled a lot of wells down there. I think I talked about 11 wells. A lot of that production is coming out in public information now. So I think it's appropriate at this time to provide some commentary to help you -- give you some insight on how we're thinking about it and to help you think about it. That whole area is not fully de-risked, but we've had a lot of great success down there. The original concept was that the Southern Delaware Basin would have production characteristics like the North. We think that's -- that theory is proving out. We're encouraged by it.","David Deckelbaum - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Sure. I appreciate that. I guess -- obviously, you've reduced your rig count along the shelf due to facility constraints. In your experience so far with the horizontal Yeso, how do you view those wells in terms of how they've progressed relative to the Delaware and Midland opportunities?","Timothy A. Leach","Yes. Well, on the shelf, the shelf had been drilled vertically to a pretty dense pattern. So the places we're applying horizontals were in extension areas primarily or in areas where we didn't have all the zones present that we were capturing vertically. The horizontals on the shelf have worked great, and we just -- we're in the early stages of applying that technology on the shelf. That was kind of the last place we started drilling horizontals.","David Deckelbaum - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Sure. And then my last question is just in relation to CapEx, you guys have obviously been running a bit ahead of the budget of $1.6 billion so far. Now you're reworking the rig count a little bit, but you are adding some net horizontal rigs. As you go through the rest of the year, could you sort of walk us through how you see CapEx trending? And are there well cost savings baked into that, less science work? Or is there a more of a gradual decline into the fourth quarter in terms of completions?","Timothy A. Leach","Yes, yes. Those were a lot of questions strung together. Let me kind of give you just my stream of consciousness on our capital budget. As we went into '13, it was very similar to '12 and '11. As we plan out our activity, we tend to front-end load the year and get as much done in the first half of the year as we can so that you leave yourself room to make midyear corrections, either to increase or decrease the pace based on changing conditions. That's no different than it has been in the past. This year, we're seeing improved efficiencies. The wells are getting drilled faster and cheaper. The cost savings are driven both by the efficiencies we're seeing in drilling the wells and just overall costs coming down. We may be, since the first of the year, on cost, down 15%, which is helpful. So the second half of the year -- the wells that we drilled in the first half of the year, the activity we had in the first half of the year really sets up the second half of the year well for production. You get all those wells online. We've been completing a lot of wells each quarter. So the second half of the year still will be dominated by horizontal drilling, and it's kind of a planned landing of our capital budget where we said we're going to land it, and I think we're going to be pleased with the production that comes from all of these big wells we're drilling.","Operator","Your next question comes from Phillip Jungwirth from BMO Capital Markets.","Phillip Jungwirth - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Given the high number of wells completed in the second quarter and the reallocation of rig count, dropping verticals, adding horizontals, how many wells, both vertical and horizontal, do you think you'll be able to complete and bring on production by year end?","Timothy A. Leach","You mean for the full year?","Phillip Jungwirth - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Just second half. Or for the full year.","Timothy A. Leach","Second half?","Phillip Jungwirth - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Yes, second half.","Timothy A. Leach","Let me look around the table, see if anybody's got that data. I don't have the data at hand in terms of how many total wells we'll complete between now and the end of the year. But also keep in mind, as we lay those rigs down, we've still got to complete the wells that they drilled. Our completion numbers per quarter may not be as high as it was in the second quarter, but it's still going to be very high as we kind of finish up. The fourth quarter, we'll probably be down . That will be the quarter you'll start seeing some reduced completion on those vertical -- that we won't have the -- to complete the vertical wells.","Phillip Jungwirth - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","And can you tell us what the base decline rate is on the New Mexico Shelf? And then you talked about eventually resuming normal drilling. When do you think that will be? And then how many rigs would you consider to be normal drilling up there, given all the horizontal opportunity you now have?","Timothy A. Leach","When you're in this condition with restricted takeaway, the base decline rate, it's kind of a complicated answer that I'm going to give you. But we've been constrained up there, so we haven't really -- the natural decline rate has been masked by shut-ins and restrictions. So -- and quite frankly, that's the reason to lay rigs down. There's no reason to add productive capacity up there if you can't move it at the moment. Now we think all of that is going to resolve itself fairly quickly, and I think that's the upside for the year. When you think about where we're going to land production for the year, it's going to be -- I mean, the Delaware Basin has really been performing well, and it's even made up for the production restrictions we've had on the shelf. When the shelf comes back on, I think that's going to be the swing factor for how well the year turns out.","Phillip Jungwirth - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","And then last question, on the Southern Delaware, how did the decline rate on the 11 wells that you have on production compare to what you've experienced in the Northern Delaware to date?","Timothy A. Leach","About the same.","Operator","And your next question comes from John Freeman from Raymond James.","John Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","On the Northern Delaware Basin, your original sort of Bone Spring EUR guidance was based on a 650 barrel a day 30-day average. And just looking at these recent wells, they're closer to, call it, 850, and that's even before the benefit of more of these extended reach laterals that you've only done a few of on so far. I'm just trying to get a sense of when you think you'd have enough data to where maybe you'd want to revisit, kind of update the guidance on the EURs in that area.","Timothy A. Leach","Yes, probably end of the year. And I mean, we're clearly upwardly biased on that kind of early time data. But we'll go through that process with our third-party engineers, and those things, I would expect them to be changing toward the end of the year.","Unknown Executive","John, none of those type curves in the Northern Delaware contemplate extended length laterals either.","John Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Right. And along those lines, could you give me just sort of some color for maybe how the mix changes and maybe like the third quarter? Like if this quarter, if you exclude the dual laterals, you had, call it, just a few -- 3 of these extended reach laterals. Like kind of just ballpark, how many of those are you doing in the third quarter?","E. Joseph Wright","This is Joe. About 20% of our horizontal drilling is extended lateral. So when you think about kind of that makeup, I'd look around 20% today. Everything in the South Delaware, we're really moving towards full 2-mile laterals down there. So that will go up slightly.","Timothy A. Leach","And about 20% in the North.","John Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","I'm sorry, was it -- did you say 20% kind of just across the board, it was 20% in the north as well?","Timothy A. Leach","He was saying 20% in the North and 100% in the South.","John Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay, got it. And then last question for me. I'll turn it over to somebody else. Just what's the current spud to sales times running in the Northern Delaware?","E. Joseph Wright","90 days, a little less. We use 90 days when we do our projections.","Operator","And your next question comes from Pearce Hammond from Simmons & Company.","Pearce W. Hammond - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Tim, I wanted to get some thoughts from you on the Brushy Canyon. 2 good wells there. If you can provide a little more color. Do you think this extends across your acreage throughout the Northern Delaware Basin?","Timothy A. Leach","One of the good things about Concho is we have a big acreage position in the Northern Delaware. The Brushy in places in New Mexico has been completed prolifically vertically. So there's some Brushy Canyon fields that are vertical developments and historic fields. I think our thinking is that in -- it will be more -- isolated location is not the right word, but it's going to have something to do with structure and stratigraphy as opposed to an unconventional type of reservoir.","Pearce W. Hammond - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","And then my follow-up...","Timothy A. Leach","Let me say, though, I think it's going to be important to us. I don't think this is just a one-off type of opportunity. I think it's going to be important to us. It's going to be a little bit different than the other zones.","Pearce W. Hammond - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Great. And then my follow-up is as you start your budgeting process for 2014, given the level of interest within the industry for both the Midland the Delaware Basin, how do you see service costs trending for next year?","Timothy A. Leach","I think they're trending downward. And there's 2 components. There's service cost, what is one-stage frac cost; and then there's just how efficient are you, how long does it take you to drill that well, how does it take you to -- how efficient are you at moving around those frac spreads. But I think the trend is downward.","Operator","Your next question comes from Matt Portillo from Tudor, Pickering, Holt.","Matthew Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Just 2 quick questions for me. In terms of the Midland Basin, I was hoping you could give us a little bit of breakdown on your acreage exposure in the Wolfcamp in particular. And then just a second question, as you guys have drilled some sort of laterals here, the industry looks like they're moving towards longer lateral completion in the Midland. And I was hoping that you could give us some color on your plans to potentially extend laterals on the Midland side as well.","Timothy A. Leach","Okay. Our acreage position in the Midland Basin for the horizontal Wolfcamp is about 170,000 gross acres, and our ownership is a little bit over 50%, on average. And the laterals we're drilling, I guess, most of those have been relatively short laterals. It's all -- we would drill as long as a lateral is possible. It's all dictated by the shape of your leases and can you pull these things together. But I don't think that we're going to drill as many long laterals in the Midland Basin as what we do in the Southern Delaware, for sure, and maybe in the Northern Delaware.","Matthew Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Great. And just to clarify, that 170, that's primarily in Upton, Midland and Andrews County?","Timothy A. Leach","That's correct.","Matthew Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Perfect. And then just in terms of your well cost in the Southern Delaware, kind of the $8.5 million to $10 million well cost. We've obviously seen the industry and yourselves do a great job of driving down costs over time. I was hoping you may give a little color in terms of how those well costs may trend over time and how you think about maybe the technical limitations to bringing down those costs?","Timothy A. Leach","That's always a hard prediction to make since you're promising things from other people. But I mean, historically, as infrastructures improve, technologies improve, we don't have do drill a pilot hole for every well. We get a better understanding of all the surface conditions on drilling a shallow hole. You'd hope you'll be able -- I mean, you can look at other areas and kind of draw an analogy from other areas, and maybe 10% to 15% more over time as it turns into a manufacturing operation.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ryan Todd from Deutsche Bank.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","A couple of quick ones. In the Midland Basin, we haven't talked much about the Eastern part of your acreage over in Glasscock and Irion. Any thoughts on what you've seen over there in activity levels? And then as we look into 2014, given the level of inventory that you have, particularly in the Delaware Basin, any thoughts about the potential, how you think about acceleration of activity level? Or is it purely going to be driven by operating cash flow?","Timothy A. Leach","Okay. Yes, I don't have any new news this quarter on our Eastern Midland Basin activity. We're still continuing to work both those areas, both in Glasscock County and in Irion County. We've got rigs running in both areas. It hasn't really -- we don't have the acreage position or the momentum there to really have that as a core area. But it's a good place to really observe what's going on in the East with the Wolfcamp and the Cline. And I really don't have any new information this quarter on that. As we go into 2014, I'll refer to some in my prepared comments about the flexibility that we see we have. Our balance sheet is strengthening. We're going to try to do as much activity as this Concho machine will allow us to do. And we have lots of good inventory to go invest and drill wells. So there's a lot of moving parts in our industry right now, though. I mean, lots of folks on this call are calling for much lower oil prices in '14. We'll watch that very carefully. We'll plan a budget that leaves us -- I mean, we hedge and do all that to try to protect our cash flow. But I think that barring that oil price falling out from under us, I think we're pretty feeling pretty good about what we're doing and kind of feeling that it's time to step on the accelerator.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","That's great. And I mean, we've obviously seen improvements on the crude side. And how much this infrastructure at this point figure into your thoughts around acceleration? And are you still seeing many issues, infrastructure related, particularly in the Delaware Basin?","Timothy A. Leach","No. I mean, the infrastructure is doing a good job keeping up in the Delaware, and there's more competition for infrastructure in the Delaware Basin. And so that's been a good thing. And the nature of those wells allows us, if we choose, to invest a big part of our capital budget over there. So the issue we've seen in takeaway capacity on the shelf, we're in a good position where we can pretty quickly switch capital from one area to another. And again, we haven't seen those same kind of problems in the Delaware Basin.","Operator","Your next question comes from Mike Kelly from Global Hunter Securities.","Michael Kelly - Global Hunter Securities, LLC, Research Division","I was hoping to follow up on some of the earlier questions regarding your move to drill longer laterals. Really, I'd like to hear your expectations for 30-day rates in the Northern Delaware for wells that are drilled at 8,000 feet plus on the laterals. I guess I'm trying to translate what 857 Boe per day rate on the 4,000 lateral would compare to a lateral that's twice that length.","E. Joseph Wright","Certainly, our longest lateral that we've drilled hadn't been completed yet. So I wish I could give you a real good number from that. But generally, when you think about those lateral lengths, you can go anywhere from a 1.7x to 2x as you think about your EURs. Your IPs maybe a little bit -- a little different because just from a flow capacity kind of issues, service equipment and being able to lift that much fluid. But you will see somewhere between that 1.5x and 2x on an IP, I believe.","L. Price Moncrief","Mike, this is Price. Our most recent long laterals was a little over 8,000 feet. And it was about 2x kind of that average rate, 2x those average rates we quoted.","Michael Kelly - Global Hunter Securities, LLC, Research Division","All right, great. And a follow-up on that, just on costs, on the 4,000-foot lateral type of well versus one twice that.","E. Joseph Wright","Yes, I'd say usually what we'll see is 1.4x to 1.5x.","Michael Kelly - Global Hunter Securities, LLC, Research Division","Got it, all right, great. In the Southern Delaware, the 200 wells that you've laid out here is -- there was inventory there. I was hoping you could break that up between the North Harpoon area and Big Chief.","E. Joseph Wright","The majority -- it's about half and half. And we have high interest in both of them. So when you think about a net, it's kind of 100% of Big Chief. It's probably about half and half.","Michael Kelly - Global Hunter Securities, LLC, Research Division","Got it. If I could sneak one more in. As it pertains to the infrastructure constraints in the shelf, as that alleviates, is there potential to see production pop back pretty nicely, let's call it, maybe early 2014?","Timothy A. Leach","We're not banking on it, but it could happen sooner than that.","Operator","Your next question comes from Arun Jayaram from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Arun Jayaram - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Tim, I just wanted to ask you a little bit about as you shift towards more horizontal drilling from vertical drilling, does it bring any near-term challenges in terms of production just given longer spud to pop times for horizontal wells in general? Or is that baked in, in terms of your guidance, that shift?","Timothy A. Leach","Yes. Well, I think that is within the estimating accuracy. So it's baked in. And I mean, think -- in the entire industry and for Concho specifically, I mean, the drill times and the spud to -- all of that is getting much more efficient. So all those days are coming down.","Arun Jayaram - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. But in terms of your overall well count on horizontal side, how many more wells are you going to do with the new program versus your previous guidance? I think it was 175 range.","Timothy A. Leach","Do you know the answer to that?","L. Price Moncrief","Yes. I think when we think of horizontally the last half, we'll be well over 100. We'll be about 110 to 120 more completions within that.","Arun Jayaram - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. Just a clarification. Tim, I appreciate the additional disclosure. You talked a little bit about decline rates in Northern Delaware being similar to Southern Delaware. You have pretty similar IPs, 30-day rates for the Bone Spring versus the initial 11 wells in the South. Yet, the EURs are quite a bit different. Can you just maybe reconcile that or talk to us a little bit about maybe that delta there? I think your initial guidance for the Bone Spring was around 360 or so.","Timothy A. Leach","Yes. Well, it's early days to really be talking about EURs. And as you've seen our models go up, the EURs continue to increase. So as you think about ultimate recoveries, at least the way we're modeling it out and the way we look at the rocks, in the South, we got the South in hopes that it would be as good as the North. We think there's more oil in place in the South than there is in the North. Now, like I say, it's early time. And when you look at those EUR models, those things -- EURs change over time. And the decline rates -- I still -- the way I would think about all of that is I still think it's true that you get about 1\/3 of your total EUR out in the first 2 or 3 years. To answer your question directly, the South, we're putting more in oil in the ground there, modeling-wise, as we've got in the North. That's one of the big attractions.","Arun Jayaram - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Fair enough. And Just my last question was, Tim, the DD&A rate guidance went up a little bit. Is that just reflecting lower production given the infrastructure challenges on the shelf?","Timothy A. Leach","No, not really. that's not the big -- the big factor is all this horizontal drilling across the basin and specifically in the Southern Delaware, the amount of science and the amount of early time work you do kind of pops that DD&A.","Operator","Your next question comes from Irene Haas from Wunderlich Securities.","Mostafa Dahhane - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","Yes. This is Mo Dahhane in for Irene. I have 2 quick questions about Southern Delaware Basin. First question, do you see any consistency from the 11 Wolfcamp wells in Reeves County in terms of flow rates decline and oil and gas mix?","Timothy A. Leach","Did we see any -- what was it [ph]? Yes, yes, that's -- yes, we do. We're happy about consistency.","Mostafa Dahhane - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","Okay. Second question, what spacing have you assumed for the 200 locations for the Wolfcamp?","Timothy A. Leach","Well, on those long laterals, it's a little bit tricky to talk about spacing. But for modeling, I'd say 100 -- I would say 4 per section or a 160-acre spacing per zone.","Operator","Your next question comes from Joe Allman from JPMorgan.","Joseph D. Allman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","With the midstream issues on the shelf, Tim, is it just restricted to the New Frontier gas line? Or are there any other issues?","Timothy A. Leach","No, that's about it. Well, pressure has always been an issue, but I would tell you that DCP has done a great job on compression, and the big issue is just that one line.","Joseph D. Allman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then in your guidance, what's the assumption about a recovery of those volumes?","Timothy A. Leach","Well, I mean, I kind of gave you the range. With no recovery, it's going to affect us a little bit over 700,000 barrels. And it's affected us 375,000 barrels so far through the first half of the year. They're working like crazy trying to get that thing fixed. And I think they're making good progress.","Joseph D. Allman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. So the full year production guidance assumes a recovery at what point?","Timothy A. Leach","We're not assuming a recovery. It's -- our production guidance, the low end of the range is about 15% growth, and the high end of the range is about 20%. And we feel pretty confident we'll land in there.","Joseph D. Allman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, I got you, okay. And then with Midland horizontal Wolfberry program, remind us how many wells. I think you're talking about 4 wells in your presentation. Are you seeing differences in productivity between the A and the B?","Timothy A. Leach","Oh, we haven't really drilled enough to draw any conclusions. We're going to have 15 to 16 more wells by the end of the year. But -- so I'd say, no, we don't have enough data to draw any conclusions about differences between those zones.","Joseph D. Allman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then as you indicated earlier in the call, your verticals perforated different formations, and in your presentation, you indicated you're going to potentially try horizontals there. Do you see this potentially as an exclusive horizontal program for the different formations? Or do you think you're going to mix some horizontals with some verticals for some other zones?","Timothy A. Leach","It's complicated because some of the leases you have make it more difficult to drill horizontally. I think there will always be a mixture of horizontal and vertical. But I think with the enhancement in rate of return, I think us and the industry will try to drill horizontal wells as often as we can.","Joseph D. Allman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then lastly, Tim, I think earlier you said that the lateral length in the Midland probably won't be as long as that in the Delaware Basin. So just confirm that that's what you said. And is that just because of just the lease configuration and your inability likely to block it up a whole lot more?","E. Joseph Wright","Yes, this is Joe. The Midland -- the thing about the Midland Basin and our Wolfberry acreage, it's very blocked up. But it's just going to take a little more land work for us to do extended laterals there. We will be doing some extended laterals there eventually. It's just going to take a little more work from the land side.","Joseph D. Allman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So to put it in general, you think the laterals are going to be longer in the Delaware Basin versus the Midland?","E. Joseph Wright","I think Midland will be just as long as the North Delaware Basin.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jason Smith from Bank of America.","Jason Smith - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I know we covered a lot of grounds so far today. But I just wanted to touch on -- in the Southern Delaware, can you just remind us again what you guys -- how many rigs you guys need to run in order to hold your acreage there? And then maybe any other acreage issues you might have within the portfolio? I know you guys don't obviously talk much about the Northern Midland anymore. I mean, are you probably going to let that acreage expire? Or do you see yourself eventually going up there and trying to drill that up as well?","Timothy A. Leach","The Northern Midland is an exploration idea, and we are drilling and completing the well up there as we speak. So it's still -- I still think of that as an exploration idea. In the South, we've got how many?","E. Joseph Wright","We have 4 horizontals running in the South Delaware Basin. That is plenty of rigs to run for the North Harpoon and South Harpoon or what we call North Harpoon and Big G [ph]. That will cover any exploration there. And we're still working our further Southern acreage position down in Pecos, which now we've got 5 or 6 wells, a horizontal and some vertical wells in that. And we will continue to work that. It will require a few more rigs ultimately, but we have some time left on our leases there.","Operator","Your next question comes from Louis Baltimore from Macquarie.","Louis Baltimore - Macquarie Research","I've just got one question and a quick follow-up. Can you comment about any water production issues that you may have encountered, either in different formations or across the aerial extent of your acreage, maybe specifically in horizon above the Bone Spring? I think some other operators have talked about encountering issues with water hurting the economics despite strong oil production.","Timothy A. Leach","No, I don't really have a comment on that other than to say the way we're cored up and the way we have core areas, the cost of disposing the produced water is always an issue. And we think a big part of our program, and you can see in our capital budget, how much we allocate to facilities. Those facilities are predominantly saltwater disposal facilities. So we think that you need to be in the water disposal business as well as the oil production business in all of the areas. But I don't have a comment about -- if you're talking about above the Bone Spring, you'd be talking about the Delaware sands or part of the Avalon, I don't have a comment on water production there.","Louis Baltimore - Macquarie Research","Okay, great. And then I guess as far as vertical versus horizontal drilling goes, are there any continuous development clause, issues with leases that would limit your ability to transition further from vertical to horizontal, I guess, specifically maybe in the Midland Basin?","Timothy A. Leach","Yes, I mean, in all areas, there are leases with -- leases designed for vertical drilling with continuous development clauses, those you either have to continue to develop the way you are or renegotiate different terms. That's -- so the answer is technically yes. But I mean, it's not a huge part of our business. And that's why we've been able to lay down so many vertical rigs, because that's not a big factor.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Tameron from Wells Fargo.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Can I step back? A couple of bigger picture questions. Tim, you've always been candid about the M&A market. Can you just comment on where that is relative to 6 months ago or even a year ago? Just give us any highlights on that. And then I've got a follow-up.","Timothy A. Leach","Yes. I think the big forces that you and I talked about being at work in the past are still there, the consolidation forces and the importance of having the companies that have the ability to execute and drill all these wells. So there's a lot of things in the market. There's a lot of properties that are owned by companies that really aren't and never were intended to be the ones that fully develop these assets. So it implies over time that there's going to have to be a lot of consolidation. The bid-ask spread is just enormous right now, and I think that slows down transactions. And as everybody is trying to figure things out, one of the reasons the bid-ask spread is so large is that most of the traditional acquirers have plenty of inventory right now. So the need to add inventory at a high cost is kind of low. And so there's kind of a disconnect right now, I think, in the M&A market.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then second, there's a lot of talk about your long-term growth rate, you can't hit what you used to, and then I hear you're saying, \"step on the accelerator.\" Can you just -- if you care to comment on...","Timothy A. Leach","All those rumors you mentioned are just a bunch of bull. That's my first comment. Our ability to grow through the drillbit is as good as it's ever been, maybe better.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Are you still at that 15% to 20% kind of long-term target, is that where we're at?","Timothy A. Leach","I think with the kind of a productivity we have, if we can't do better than that, there's something wrong with us.","Operator","Your next question comes from Brian Singer from Goldman Sachs.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","In the Delaware Basin, the production mix looks like it has become a bit more oilier here and that it looks like it was the driver of total company oil production becoming a bit more oily. And it seems like it might have been above and beyond just drilling offsetting the Three Rivers acquisition when we look at your IPs from some of your Northern Delaware horizontal wells that have seen greater oil content. Is there any secular factors that are driving this? And then should we expect your oil mix to move back down slightly towards the midpoint of your guidance?","Timothy A. Leach","I think the answer to all that is no. We're drilling a lot of big oil wells. And I'll also point out that when we talk about our oil mix being at 63% that's crude oil. If you add in the natural gas liquids, we're still like a 90% liquids company. So, no. I mean, what's driving the company's growth in oil is all this drilling we're doing in the Delaware Basin. I don't see that changing. It will probably continue to decline.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. The Delaware wells themselves look like they've gotten oilier. Is that just temporary on the IPs? Or do you see anything unique to the horizontal Delaware wells you're drilling where they're oilier than you expected? Or is it just geographically timing issues?","Timothy A. Leach","Well, if you remember, if you've been following us, when we started 2012 and when this play really started, the first wells were Western Avalon Shale wells or Wolfcamp wells, and those were gassy. So I mean, the first kind of half of 2012, we brought on some pretty big gas wells. We moved away from that, went to other zones. And so there are some zones that are gassy. The economics still may be pretty good in those zones, but for now, we're really focusing on the oil zones.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","That's great. And then shifting to the Midland Basin. What do you expect or what should we expect of the impact, the net impacts to be from the drop that you're planning of your vertical rigs and the increase you're planning from the horizontal rigs on your production? And when we think about how you've gotten more positive here, is that just a function of the well results that you've seen yourself drill or from industry as well?","Timothy A. Leach","No. As far as that portion of our business, they've been running ahead of schedule. They've been doing a great job. Even as we drop rigs, with the addition of these horizontals, they'll stay on plan, if not ahead of plan. And it's hard to overstate the impact of drilling a 1,500 barrel a day well and having a big interest in it and having a lot of those to do. So that's why we're excited about our opportunities going forward, and that's why we think instead of drilling a bunch of vertical small wells, these bigger wells can really drive our growth.","Operator","We have a question from David Deckelbaum from KeyBanc.","David Deckelbaum - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Tim, I just have a quick follow-up. You talked about the Northern Midland Delaware -- sorry, Northern Midland Basin sort of still in exploration mode. I know at one time you all were considering looking at a JV partner there. Is that still on the table at all? Or are there any other areas that you'd prefer to have a JV partner in to sort of defray some of the exploration risk?","Timothy A.

Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Megan Hays. Ms. Hays, you may begin.","Megan P. Hays - Concho Resources, Inc.","Thank you. Good morning and welcome to Concho's first quarter 2018 earnings call. I'm joined today in Midland by Tim Leach, Chairman and CEO; Jack Harper, President and CFO; Will Giraud, Executive Vice President; and members of the Concho's senior management team.","Our earnings release and corporate presentation are available on our website and we plan to file our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q today after market close. Please note that our call today is neither an offering of security nor a solicitation of a proxy vote in connection with our announced transaction with RSP.","The information discussed today is qualified in its entirety by the registration statement and preliminary joint proxy statement that Concho and RSP have filed with the SEC in connection with our proposed transaction.","The information in the preliminary joint proxy statement is not complete and may be changed. The definitive joint proxy statement will be sent to the stockholders of both Concho and RSP. The shareholders of Concho and RSP are urged to read the registration statement, the preliminary joint proxy statement and the definitive joint proxy statement when it becomes available, because they contain important information about the proposed transaction between Concho and RSP.","Additionally, please note that we will make forward-looking statements this morning that reflect our current views related to our future financial performance, future events and industry and market conditions and forward-looking statements related to the proposed transaction, including the expected financial projection, synergies, financing and the timing for the completion of the transaction.

Please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. As a reminder, the purpose of today's call is to discuss our first quarter and we ask that you keep your questions focused on those results.","Thank you. Now, let me turn the call over to Tim.","Timothy A. Leach - Concho Resources, Inc.","Thanks, Megan. Good morning. First quarter results build upon our solid performance in 2017 and demonstrate our ability to deliver significant organic growth and strong financial performance. From operational, financial and asset-building perspectives, I can't recall a more important quarter in Concho history.","We achieved record production of 228,000 Boes per day, which exceeded the high-end of our guidance range. Oil volumes increased by 14,000 barrels a day from the fourth quarter of 2017. This represents record quarter-over-quarter oil growth. The momentum and performance of our portfolio makes us comfortable with the high-end of our full-year guidance range.","We had an active quarter blocking up core acreage and increasing working interest through trades. We executed five trades, including the swap with a large integrated company that we discussed on last quarter's call.","We also sold non-core leasehold that was not strategic to our development plans. And the biggest transaction to-date is our pending acquisition of RSP Permian. RSP is a compelling opportunity for our company. It will reinforce Concho's leadership position and strengthen our platform for delivering growth and returns. Upon closing, which we expect in the third quarter, Concho will run the largest drilling program in the Permian. Increased scale, combined with our execution strength, will drive significant efficiencies across a broader portfolio.","The scale isn't static. Large amounts of capital heading for the Permian, we believe there's a great deal of industrial logic for acquiring the best assets today. As a result of this transaction, Concho will be a stronger company, better positioned for continued growth and value creation in this competitive operating environment. As we said when we announced the transaction, consolidating RSP is consistent with our core strategy.","Over the past decade, we've emphasized the importance of our team, assets, returns and balance sheet. And that's evident in how we have invested our capital and the strategic diversified position we've built in the Permian. I believe the combination of two great companies, Concho and RSP, will improve the overall execution of our strategy as we continue high grading our portfolio and capital allocation and the efforts of the combined teams applied to our assets should drive meaningful enhancement of shareholder value.","Together, our portfolios are a natural fit with contiguous and highly complementary acreage. The addition of RSP will expand our position to approximately 640,000 net acres and will provide us with 2.2 billion barrels of additional resource potential, of which more than two-thirds is premium resource. By folding RSP's premium position and resource into our development machine, we expect to unlock significant value for all shareholders.","We see opportunities to create more than $2 billion in present value through large-scale, long-lateral development and corporate level savings as a result of the transaction. I want to focus on the value-creating opportunities driven by a large-scale development. We believe this type of development is important to maximize recoveries, drive economies of scale and deliver attractive, economic returns predictably and consistently over the long term.","Upon closing, we will direct capital to manufacturing style projects and utilize shared infrastructure across the combined acreage position. We believe our development approach will require less capital, increase recoveries, shorten the payout period and improve the rate of return in NPV per drilling unit. As we demonstrate on page 16 in the investor slides, long-lateral project development increases the NPV per drilling unit by approximately 45%, assuming eight wells per section in a single zone.","We believe this is repeatable over a large scale across RSP's portfolio and creates a lot of value. It exceeds anything we've talked about and that's why we're so excited about this transaction. And an additional benefit of this combination is smoother, more predictable growth. We'll spread this over a bigger base with a stronger financial foundation. This is what drives consolidation. It makes a big difference in what scale, a strong balance sheet and an operational machine can do to maximize the impact of every dollar we invest. Since announcing the transaction, we spent a great deal of time planning and organizing our integration efforts, so that we'll be in a position to hit the ground running with a team and growth platform nearly unmatched across our sector.","2018 is off to a great start as we run our play, delivering results and building for the future. Our portfolio management is reinforcing our competitiveness and affording us a real opportunity to redefine the E&P business model and we're well-positioned to capitalize on this opportunity.","Now, Jack will discuss the quarter in more detail.","Jack F. Harper - Concho Resources, Inc.","Thank you, Tim. By nearly any metric, Concho has never been stronger, which is reflected in our results for the first quarter. Production of 228,000 Boes per day exceeded the high-end of our guidance range and represented 8% growth over the previous quarter. And as Tim mentioned, we also delivered solid oil growth.","Oil volumes averaged 144,000 barrels per day, an 11% increase from the fourth quarter of 2017. We continue to hold the line on controllable cash costs. Slight increases in per unit LOE and cash G&A over the previous quarter were partially offset by a decrease in interest expense. In the first quarter, adjusted net income per share was $1 and we generated $570 million of the EBITDAX.","Drilling and completion capital for the first quarter was approximately $450 million and for 10 out of the last 11 quarters, we've comfortably funded the capital program inside of operating cash flow and have generated more than $0.5 billion in free cash flow. A disciplined capital program, non-core asset sales and a cash distribution from our equity investment in Oryx were the primary drivers behind the $320 million reduction in total debt during the first quarter.","In the past, we've discussed moving the leverage goalpost from 1.5 times to 2 times down to 1 times to 1.5 times debt to EBITDAX. Not only have we moved the goalpost lower, but our leverage ratio of 1.2 times at March 31 is at the low-end of this new range.","Returning to Oryx for a moment, over the past decade, we've made strategic investments in infrastructure. These investments are intended to protect our upstream business by ensuring operational continuity and maximizing efficiency. Today, more than 85% of our oil is on pipe. This is another example of our scale advantage.","Aggregating our barrels and transporting them on regional gathering systems with multiple offtake points provides significant flexibility for long-haul takeaway and to regional refineries. And we mitigate the financial risk of the Midland-Cushing differential with basis hedges. We have a substantial portion of our standalone oil volumes hedged through 2020.","The regional oil system that we're invested in such as ACC in the Northern Delaware and Oryx in the Southern Delaware have the added benefit of generating high-quality returns for our shareholders.","During the first quarter, the Oryx team received an $800 million term loan, the proceeds from which were used to fund a cash distribution to its equity holders. We received $157 million in cash due to our equity investment in Oryx, which represents the 3.5 times return on invested capital, and we retain our roughly 24% ownership stake.","Turning to our operational results, our teams delivered an outstanding quarter. During the quarter, we set new records in the Delaware Basin and continued to advance large-scale projects across the portfolio.","In the Northern Delaware, we added 12 wells with a record 30-day performance. 10 out of the 12 wells were extended laterals which drove a record average lateral length of approximately 8,500 feet. That's 2,000 feet longer than the previous record set by the team. And we advanced our efforts in the lower 2nd Bone Spring formation in Eddy County with two successful wells.","The Craig Federal and the Road Runner Federal each produced at an average 30-day peak rate of approximately 2,500 Boes, of which 74% was oil. Importantly, these wells were part of a stack development pattern in the 2nd Bone Spring, which included our traditional target and the lower landing 500-feet below.","In the Southern Delaware Basin, we're constantly fine-tuning our lateral placement and completion design to enhance returns. During the first quarter, we added 21 wells. These wells set a record performance with 30-day peak rate of about 2,200 Boes from an average lateral length of 9,200 feet. We added 20 wells in the Midland Basin in the first quarter. Notably, all 20 wells were part of multi-well projects, which reflects our focus on large-scale multi-zone development.","Last quarter, we highlighted the early results from the Mabee Ranch project in the Northern Midland Basin. This project includes 13 wells drilled to an average lateral length of 2 miles, within one-half section. During the first quarter, the project averaged 30-day and 60-day rate of approximately 15,000 and 14,000 Boe, respectively.","For the second quarter, we expect production volumes to average 226,000 to 230,000 Boes per day. We currently have 20 rigs running. 13 of these rigs are working on large-scale projects and 4 out of our 6 frac crews are working on these types of projects.","As we've discussed in the past, large-scale project development will drive the quarterly production growth trajectory. And with a great start to the year, we've raised our full-year 2018 production outlook. We've also updated our full-year outlook for crude oil price realizations.","The new range reflects pricing deductions, but does not include the Midland-Cushing differential as it has moved around quite a bit lately. And, as I mentioned earlier, while our barrels are priced off of Midland, we have basis swaps covering a substantial portion of our oil production through 2020.","Before I turn it over to Q&A, I want to thank our team. We've accomplished a lot in 2018 and we're only one quarter in. Together, we're building a strong company and cultivating competitive advantages, execution strength, scale and a strong financial position to drive returns and differentiated performance over the long term.","With that, I'll turn it over to the operator.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Arun Jayaram of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good morning. Tim, you went through really the industrial logic for the RSP merger. The one question I wanted to ask you is a little bit about \u2013 there's been a decent amount of focus on the per-acre valuation that you paid for RSP. Just wondering if you think that per-acre kind of valuation metric is relevant and just what your thoughts are on the overall valuation of the transaction and just general confidence in the synergies.","Timothy A. Leach - Concho Resources, Inc.","Yeah. Well, I hope I expressed a lot of confidence in the synergies. And we talked about the combination and how we felt about last quarter, where you put two really good companies together that have two premier sets of assets. So, the allocation to the acreage value was just that and we feel really good about it. And I think we're going to create a whole lot of value.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Fair enough. Just shifting gears a little bit, I was wondering about some of the key learnings from the Mabee Ranch development. I think you did 13 wells, 4 Middle Spraberry, 4 Lower Spraberry, 1 Wolfcamp B and 2 Wolfcamp As. And I know you had some fiber down. I was wondering if you could give us some of the key learnings from that key development project.","Timothy A. Leach - Concho Resources, Inc.","One of the things is our Midland Basin asset team is really doing a great job and knocking the cover off the ball. I think almost every well we drill we learn something and the fiber optics project was a real breakthrough for us. We've learned lots of things about how the rocks frac, how they produce, how our completions work. So, I think that's something that will continue in other areas and what we learn there will spread to other parts of our asset portfolio.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","All right. Thanks a lot, Tim.","Timothy A. Leach - Concho Resources, Inc.","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from John Freeman of Raymond James. Your line is now open.","John A. Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Good morning, guys.","Timothy A. Leach - Concho Resources, Inc.","Hey, John.","John A. Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey. The first question I had, you have always valued maintaining flexibility with the service providers versus lock in longer-term contracts. And obviously, your scale has allowed that to be a very successful model. Jack, when you were talking about sort of the midstream at the moment, you mentioned the word flexibility when talking about that as well. So, I'm just curious if we should sort of think longer term that the way you all sort of view firm transport is kind of similarly to how you all viewed kind of services. Just that scale and the flexibility is sort of more important.","Jack F. Harper - Concho Resources, Inc.","Yeah. We mentioned in the prepared remarks the two regional gathering systems that we've invested in and I think those show an evolution in our strategy. And I think, from here, it will continue to evolve, but we're sure glad we did that. They gave us a lot of optionality, as I said, for multiple offtake points and we're happy with what we have there and don't feel that we're disadvantaged compared to anybody else in the basin right now.","John A. Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Great. And then, my one follow-up question, all three areas, the Northern and Southern Delaware and the Midland, all of them not only did you have record results in the Delaware, but all three areas got meaningfully oilier with the wells that you all were bringing online, especially the Northern Delaware and I'm just curious if there is anything in particular you could point to that drove that.","Jack F. Harper - Concho Resources, Inc.","Well, it's well mix and the landings. We had a great quarter, especially out of the Southern Delaware and Midland Basins, which tend to be a little bit oilier, but it just has to do with well mix and making good wells.","John A. Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","It was a great quarter, guys. Thanks a lot.","Timothy A. Leach - Concho Resources, Inc.","Thank you, John.","Jack F. Harper - Concho Resources, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Hall of Heikkinen Energy Advisors. Your line is now open.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Thanks. Good morning and I'll echo the congrats on the quarter. I guess, first, just to follow up on the midstream side a little bit, I'm just curious, what if any sort of contractual flow assurance do you have in place beyond the ACC and Oryx pipes? So, as you get off those pipes into the Midland markets, how are you setting up \u2013 how do you think about flow assurance from that point forward to get out of the basin?","Jack F. Harper - Concho Resources, Inc.","Yeah. We have assurance that we're partner with the largest transporters out of the basin. And so, we have a mutually beneficial relationship with them.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Okay. Fair enough. And then, as we think about the updated guidance, just curious, you left the oil growth guidance in place. You had a really strong quarter as it relates to oil volumes. What would you need to see to take that higher from here and kind of what are some of the key projects this year that will be influencing that in the context of the project timing commentary that you made?","Jack F. Harper - Concho Resources, Inc.","Sure. The year is off to a great start. And as we signaled with our change in guidance, we're confident in the upper-end of our original production range and I think that's where you want to start the year and we have a lot of months left in the year.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Okay. Are there any key projects over the course of the year that we ought to keep our eyes on, I guess, as it relates to influencing performance for the rest of the year?","Jack F. Harper - Concho Resources, Inc.","I don't think any particular project is worth focusing on. I would just focus on the continued move to this large-scale development where we have two-thirds of our capital being spent on that type of project. And I think if you look at our results over the last several quarters, as we've made that transition, the results have been very strong.","Timothy A. Leach - Concho Resources, Inc.","And when we close the RSP transaction, it will be a natural time for us to give you more insight to the rest of the year.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Understood. Well, nice start to the year, guys. Thanks.","Timothy A. Leach - Concho Resources, Inc.","Thank you.","Jack F. Harper - Concho Resources, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Kelly of Seaport Global Securities. Your line is now open.","Michael Dugan Kelly - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Hey, guys. Good morning. I was hoping you could give us a sense maybe for what's on the docket on the asset swap and non-core monetization front. And I guess I'm really curious if the effort accelerates really on kind of both fronts there, post the RSP deal closing. Thanks.","Jack F. Harper - Concho Resources, Inc.","Sure. Hey, Mike. Yeah, if you look at the last few years, we've increased our activity in swaps and sales and, in general, just active portfolio management and that's here to stay. So, yes, the integration of RSP will enhance our already strong hand. And so, I would expect to see more of that as we go.","Timothy A. Leach - Concho Resources, Inc.","Yeah. And I think that's enhanced by the additional assets we'll have. We have more cards to play and at the same time, we demonstrated how important it is to drill long-laterals and have high ownership. So, trading to make that happen is even more important than it has been in the past.","Michael Dugan Kelly - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Yeah. Great. And then, on the long-lateral front, the 30% jump we saw sequentially in the lateral lengths in Northern Delaware in particular, just curious if that's what we could expect that you guys going forward or is that kind of more one-time in nature for Q1. Thanks.","Jack F. Harper - Concho Resources, Inc.","Sure. We see the annual average on that theme averaging a little below where it was in the first quarter, but I think it's indicative of what Tim just mentioned that asset swaps and trades, where we can increase that lateral length, is something we're very focused on. And just a few years ago, all the wells were 1-mile wells in the Northern Delaware. So, we've made some pretty big strides and we'll keep trying in that regard.","Michael Dugan Kelly - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Thanks, guys. Great quarter.","Jack F. Harper - Concho Resources, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Drew Venker of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Drew Venker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good morning, everyone. In your prepared remarks, Tim, you mentioned that you've lowered that leverage target range already and you're already in the lower half of that range. On our numbers, you get to be at the very low-end, 1 times, by the end of this year. And you're talking about generating free cash flow on a mid-$50 oil price. So, just thinking ahead to next year and maybe you can talk about whether there's a potential leverage target to move down further. And maybe I'm missing something with the RSP merger pending, but is there the potential for some other use of free cash flow beyond that 1 times leverage target?","Timothy A. Leach - Concho Resources, Inc.","I think that leverage range that we give is more upper-end and where we start to feel uncomfortable that you have too much leverage. So, if we dip below the bottom-end of the range, I think I would expect that would just be a natural thing as the company strengthens.","And then, your question about, well, okay then, what do you do with excess cash flow, that's something we're daily talking to our shareholders about, our board about and I think that is the \u2013 when I refer to a new business model in our industry, I think it's the model where you can grow, you can achieve high growth and achieve high free cash flow all at the same time. And I think that's where we're steering the ship.","Drew Venker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks for that, Tim. I guess there's a lot of moving parts to it, the RSP merger pending, but I think the potential for return of cash or just use of free cash flow is on a lot of investors' minds. Can you work those two processes concurrently or is there just a lot of potential variables that are hard to predict with that merger where you might want to wait before making a firm decision on use of free cash?","Timothy A. Leach - Concho Resources, Inc.","I just think the RSP deal accelerates and strengthens the company. So, anything that we would be able to do in regard as you're talking about is accelerated. We're running a great business that only gets stronger over time and we have all the options laid out in front of us. And we're going to be in a position to guide this to the maximum value creation for our shareholders.","Drew Venker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks, Tim.","Timothy A. Leach - Concho Resources, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Neal Dingmann of SunTrust. Your line is now open.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Good morning. Tim for you or Jack, you've obviously had some very successful wells, I should say lower 2nd Bone Spring wells in that Eddy and Northern Del, kind of on the plan or cadence going forward now, I forget how many more now have you accelerated, maybe the type \u2013 the amount of the 2nd Bone you'll drill now versus some of the Wolfcamp and others, given the success that you've seen.","Timothy A. Leach - Concho Resources, Inc.","Let me start with that and then turn over to Will to talk about in more detail maybe. But that's what's great about the Permian is that there's always new zones to talk about. In both the Delaware and the Midland Basin, there's new things going on all the time and it's what makes the way we're positioned with the acreage we have so valuable.","And you want to address this?","C. William Giraud - Concho Resources, Inc.","Sure. No. I think we're excited by what we've seen out of the 2nd Bone. I mean a couple quarters ago, I think we highlighted some stack wells that we were doing in the 2nd Bone over in Lake County and then, this quarter, we're highlighting the work we're doing drilling multiple targets over in Eddy County and then, also I think you've seen some of our peers report some pretty eye-popping results over in Lake County as well. So, just very excited about what we got there and excited to continue to work multi-zone development of this big pad projects.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Great. And then, just on takeaway, I mean you guys have some great things going on with Oryx and, I think, ACC and some of these others, noticed this morning looked like there was another diff blowout because of this Delator refinery (28:24) going down. So, I'm just wondering what options or optionality you have as different things like this is just, I guess, Tim, is the question will you continue to partner with some of these as your production continues to materially grow or what's the easiest way to plan for this optionality?","Timothy A. Leach - Concho Resources, Inc.","Yeah. When you look at our company and the amount of new oil we're going to be bringing on every year, it puts us in a position where we're a great partner for any of these long-haul pipes. But the earlier question about our philosophy, our philosophy hasn't changed that flexibility is very important to us.","And when you look at the new pipelines that are coming on, most of them are headed to Corpus Christi. And I think the flexibility that we're trying to preserve is whether we go to Cushing, Houston, Corpus, all that changes from time to time and it has served us well over the last decade or so, being able to move in different directions and move quickly. So, I think we're going to work to try to preserve that.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Very good. Thanks for the details, guys.","Timothy A. Leach - Concho Resources, Inc.","Right. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Josh Silverstein of Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.","Josh Silverstein - Wolfe Research LLC","Yeah. Thanks. Good morning, guys. You kind of talked about moving from the 2 to 4 well pads to 8 to 10, but you guys are testing upwards of 20 wells at one of these pads. Can you talk about maybe what the sweet spot maybe? Is it 8 to 10? Does 20 make sense just for cash sources and uses?","Timothy A. Leach - Concho Resources, Inc.","Well, I mean when you talk about pads, it's a little bit more complicated than that. I think it's better to think about it as a project, a drilling project. Sometimes we'll have four actual pads on the same project just so we can have rigs working at the same time. So, we've been talking in terms mainly of half section development. And we will have up to five landing zones in some of these areas. And if you're going eight across on a section, so that's four wells and each landing times five. So, in a drilling project, you may have 20 wells and a half section, but then when we go to full section development, it's twice of that.","So, I think the answer to your question is these kind of drilling projects are going to grow in wells and the project over time and grow dramatically and that drives a lot of value creation as you can see on that slide 16.","Josh Silverstein - Wolfe Research LLC","Great. Thanks for that. And, Tim, just given your comments as far as how RSP gets integrated, it's really no shift in capital just how it gets deployed across their acreage. I was curious if this changes the growth profile of what RSP was laying out before kind of the 30%-plus rate for the next couple of years. Does that change at all from how you guys are looking to put the capital to work on that asset?","Jack F. Harper - Concho Resources, Inc.","Well, Josh, this is Jack. As we integrate those assets after close, we'll work quickly to form our first budget with those assets and we'll give some guidance for the rest of this year at that time, but \u2013 so, hard to say. All I can say is that we think it's very additive to what we have and we're excited about putting together a budget with both great asset bases put together.","Josh Silverstein - Wolfe Research LLC","Great. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Derrick Whitfield of Stifel. Your line is now open.","Derrick Whitfield - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Good morning all, and congrats on a strong start to 2018.","Timothy A. Leach - Concho Resources, Inc.","Thank you.","Derrick Whitfield - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Regarding the new lower 2nd Bone Spring formation in Eddy, how would you characterize the interval from a lithology and resource perspective?","Timothy A. Leach - Concho Resources, Inc.","I don't know that we're going to get into that level of detail on the call here. But clearly, it's a very thick interval and so we've continued to test different ways from these pad projects to go after it.","Derrick Whitfield - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","And perhaps could you comment on the horizontal separation relative to the existing uphole wells?","Timothy A. Leach - Concho Resources, Inc.","I think the spacing there was about 500-feet between the two different landings in the 2nd Bone.","Derrick Whitfield - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Both vertically and horizontally.","Timothy A. Leach - Concho Resources, Inc.","They were stacked. So, it's vertical.","Derrick Whitfield - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Got it. All right. And then, referencing page 16 of your PowerPoint, could you comment directionally on how much of the NPV uplift is due to minimizing downtime and parent-child performance issues?","Jack F. Harper - Concho Resources, Inc.","Yeah. There is a multiple number of factors there. It's the cost driven by drilling time. It's the speed. And so, there is a lot of factors that go in there and, also, as you mentioned, the lack of creating child well. So, all of those things factor into a much better economic return.","Derrick Whitfield - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Got it. Thanks. That's all for me, guys.","Timothy A. Leach - Concho Resources, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. Tim, good morning. Yeah, I wonder if I could go back to one of the earlier questions, the technology downhole issues. I mean it seems to us at least that \u2013 and I guess this kind of related to the Eddy County wells as well. It seems that you might be going through a little bit of an evolution on things like landing, overall well efficiency and so on. Am I reading too much into that or are we likely to see that the quality or the rates of change of your well results is on a steady sort of upward growth trajectory as a result of some of these efforts? I'm just wondering if there's a subtlety there that we're all kind of overlooking.","Timothy A. Leach - Concho Resources, Inc.","I don't think it's that subtle.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yeah, for sure.","Timothy A. Leach - Concho Resources, Inc.","Yeah. We've been talking every quarter about \u2013 you always get asked what inning are you in? What inning are you in or we were in early innings? And I think because we're in the early innings, performance is getting better all the time. And we are learning a lot as we collect more data. And so, I think we have a great property set. So, we're feeding in that regard because of our property set and our technology, but the entire industry is getting better. And it's very encouraging and I don't think of it as a step-change. I just think of it as steady progress.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. I guess we'll keep watching as it's obviously \u2013 I guess most folks are kind of in the hold steady type of mood when they're looking at the model as opposed to looking at an upward trajectory. So, any guidance here would be appreciated.","My follow-up is really a mix question. I'm just wondering if you could speak a little bit to how you see the oil-gas cut evolving. It seems that in the guide at least that the gas is coming up a little bit. So, just curious if there's anything meaningful changing there or if it's just timing issues and I'll leave it there. Thank you.","Jack F. Harper - Concho Resources, Inc.","Well, we still expect our oil growth to outpace the overall growth. And so, that has not changed. It's influenced from quarter-to-quarter depending on the timing of projects in the mix, but you saw it tick up this quarter and will \u2013 but the rest of the quarters play out.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","All right. Thanks, guys.","Timothy A. Leach - Concho Resources, Inc.","Thank you.","Jack F. Harper - Concho Resources, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeffrey Campbell of Tuohy Brothers. Your line is now open.","Jeffrey Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Good morning and I'll add my congratulations as well. Operationally, one thing that really stuck out to me this quarter was the shallow declines from the 30 to 60-day rates, particularly since they are high oil cut wells that were used to slow declines as long-laterals unload, but this looks different. Is there a flow-back management effect in place here or could we be seeing some additional upside from the multi-zone completion in the behavior of these wells?","Timothy A. Leach - Concho Resources, Inc.","I think it depends on what area you're talking about for sure, but we talked about in past quarters of trying to optimize the value by sizing the surface locations, so that 24-hour rates and 30-day rates are not as meaningful as they used to be. But on the other hand, some of these zones build over time and don't reach their peaks until they get out the 90-day time period. So, yeah, in some areas, the 60-day, 30-day are all very close.","Jeffrey Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","And kind of in that if \u2013 there's a follow-up to that, when I talked with you last night, the lower 2nd Bone Spring wells that were so outstanding those were actually completed in pair with upper 2nd Bone Spring wells. I guess one thing I'm wondering is with this well \u2013 do you think these wells would behave the same way if you just did one zone or do you think you're getting some kind of uplift because you're doing two at one time?","Timothy A. Leach - Concho Resources, Inc.","I just think we're seeing good effective completions as we move into these larger scale project developments. So, it's the combination of all these things we're talking about, longer laterals, these larger projects and then also the zones that we're targeting.","Jeffrey Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Okay. Yeah. That's helpful. And second question, just I noticed that you're adding a rig in the New Mexico shelf which has traditionally been a good cash generator. I'm just wondering if you're going to do anything differently operationally than the last time you drilled there.","Jack F. Harper - Concho Resources, Inc.","No. The answer is no other than anything incremental we've learned in other areas that we can apply, but generally speaking, no.","Jeffrey Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Okay. That's fine. Thank you.","Timothy A. Leach - Concho Resources, Inc.","Thanks.","Jack F. Harper - Concho Resources, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Richard Tullis of Capital One. Your line is now open.","Richard Merlin Tullis - Capital One Securities, Inc.","Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Tim or Jack, on the well cost front, have you been seeing much in the way of cost pressures in recent AFEs, now with oil in the mid-60s maybe on a lateral-foot basis?","Jack F. Harper - Concho Resources, Inc.","Hey, Richard. Yeah, the cost \u2013 clearly, when you move up in rig count as quickly as we have, there are pressures, however, right now, we have not seen anything outside of kind of what we had planned for as we put together the budget. So, there are pressures, but nothing that would cause us to change our outlook at this point.","Richard Merlin Tullis - Capital One Securities, Inc.","Okay, Jack. Thank you. And just lastly, Tim, when you look at the projected synergies and corporate savings related to the RSP transaction, just generally speaking, how quickly do you think you would begin to realize, say, the overall $2 billion in synergies? And I think it was around $60 million in corporate savings.","Timothy A. Leach - Concho Resources, Inc.","Yeah. The corporate savings are kind of things that happen pretty quickly, but as far as operationally in capital budget, I think that'll be more apparent in the 2019 capital budget.","Richard Merlin Tullis - Capital One Securities, Inc.","All right. Well, that's all for me. Thanks. You had a (39:53) great quarter.","Timothy A. Leach - Concho Resources, Inc.","All right. Thank you. Thanks, Richard.","Jack F. Harper - Concho Resources, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from David Deckelbaum of KeyBanc. Your line is now open.","David A. Deckelbaum - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Morning, Tim and Jack. Thanks for taking my questions and nice job in the first quarter here.","Timothy A. Leach - Concho Resources, Inc.","Thanks, David.","David A. Deckelbaum - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","I wanted to clarify a few things about slide 16 in the context of how you've discussed your 2018 program. I think you said this year that two-thirds of the activity will be on large projects, but sort of the large-scale projects that you illustrate on slide 16, that would be kind of a different model than what you might be doing this year.","Timothy A. Leach - Concho Resources, Inc.","We have some projects that are doing exactly what is demonstrated on slide 16. I mean the main point of slide 16 is that that's what we would propose doing on the RSP assets primarily and it speaks to the value creation when you do that.","David A. Deckelbaum - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","And the impact of moving from that small scale to large scale on that RSP acreage, what's the difference in ultimately the sort of the spud-to-sales times?","Jack F. Harper - Concho Resources, Inc.","It's compressed quite a bit, David, by using two rigs in the illustration we've shown here and that is a big driver of the PV uplift.","David A. Deckelbaum - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. I appreciate that. And then, I guess, theoretically, with what you've picked up now, is it still at the point now where \u2013 or what percentage of what has been acquired is now holistically ready for this large-scale development or how quickly can this be implemented?","Jack F. Harper - Concho Resources, Inc.","Well, of course, we still have a ways to go to make it to closing, But if you just look at their assets on the map, the great majority of their position sets up very well for this kind of development.","David A. Deckelbaum - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Fair enough. Thanks, guys.","Jack F. Harper - Concho Resources, Inc.","Yeah. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Hall of Heikkinen Energy Advisors. Your line is now open.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Thanks for the follow-up. I was just curious if you would be willing to provide current well cost by region, maybe a standard \u2013 some sort of standard length basis.","Jack F. Harper - Concho Resources, Inc.","Oh, I'm not sure that's a great use of time on this call, but is there one in particular that you're thinking about, Michael?","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","I guess the Southern Del maybe specifically there. Let's start there.","Jack F. Harper - Concho Resources, Inc.","Yeah. Well, like most of our areas, there are different lateral lengths and different zones that have different costs, but in the Southern Delaware, we have costs ranging from $8 million to $12 million depending on those factors I just mentioned.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Okay. I'll follow-up for more details. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our final question comes from Brian Singer of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you. Good morning.","Timothy A. Leach - Concho Resources, Inc.","Good morning.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Apologies if this was already discussed, but could you add some greater color on the Upton County asset swap and specifically the benefits and the timing of achieving the more noticeable impact from the result of that swap?","Jack F. Harper - Concho Resources, Inc.","Sure. That swap is indicative of what we want to do in all of our areas. That one in particular is an area where we've operated for a long time. We were able to increase our working interest, which makes us much more interested in that area. So, what it will mean is we will be more likely to drill wells there sooner.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. And can you talk about the ease of achieving that and then how implications for further potential asset swap is both in the Midland and the Delaware Basin?","Jack F. Harper - Concho Resources, Inc.","That asset swap was a long time in the making. So, it took a while, but, again, very happy to have it. And our team is doing multiple asset swaps each month. And I think that is a real competitive advantage we have, because that is not easy work.","Timothy A. Leach - Concho Resources, Inc.","I think it's going to pick up speed, because the second swap with the same company is always easier than the first swap.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we'll have a question-and-answer session, and instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Ms. Megan Hays. Ma'am, you may begin.","Megan P. Hays - Concho Resources, Inc.","Thank you. Good morning, welcome to Concho's third quarter 2016 earnings call. On the call with me today in Midland is Tim Leach, Chairman, President and CEO, and Jack Harper, Executive Vice President and CFO, and members of the Concho's senior management team. Our third quarter earnings release and corporate presentation are both available on our website.","Please note that we will make forward-looking statements based on current expectations this morning. Also, some of our comments may reference non-GAAP financial measures. Forward-looking statements and other disclaimers as well as reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are provided in the earnings release and corporate presentation and can be found at Concho's website.","Now I'll turn the call over to Tim.","Timothy A. Leach - Concho Resources, Inc.","Thank you, good morning. Thanks for joining, I'm sure it was a late night for everybody on the call.","Over the past year, we've emphasized the four philosophies of our strategy, our people, assets, returns, and balance sheet. Our commitment to this strategy has driven exceptional performance, as reflected by our operational and financial results for the third quarter.","The quarter also demonstrated that we don't just talk about capital discipline, we actually employ it. Cash flow exceeded capital spending for the fifth consecutive quarter. And excluding acquisitions, we're on track to underspend our cash flow by over $100 million for full-year 2016.","Production for the third quarter was very strong and exceeded the high end of our guidance. We're building a great deal of momentum as we head toward the end of the year and are increasing our 2016 growth outlook to 5% from the previous range of 1% to 3%. Importantly, we expect to land our capital budget within our range of $1.3 billion, again, all of which will be funded comfortably within cash flow.","Looking ahead to 2017 and beyond, we expect to deliver peer-leading growth. We're targeting 20% annualized growth through 2019, within cash flow at the current commodity price outlook. Our asset base, financial discipline, and operational excellence fuel our confidence in what we believe is a truly differentiated long-term outlook.","Jack will outline our plans for 2017 and the 3-year outlook in more detail, but first I want to give you some of the highlights across our assets. As we improve our drilling and completing technology, our capital efficiency continues to get better. Each of our operating areas illustrates this. The entire portfolio is performing extremely well and contributing to accelerated growth.","In both the Northern and Southern Delaware Basin, our team delivered record 30-day production rates and we achieved record average lateral length across all assets. The resource potential in the Northern Delaware Basin is abundant. And with more than 350,000 gross acres, we have significant leverage to the STACK resource. Since 2015, we've completed more than 225 horizontal wells, targeting nine different zones. Our activity over the past two years represents only a third of the horizontal wells we've drilled in the Northern Delaware since 2011.","Our top priority today is optimizing well spacing, lateral placement, lateral length, and completion design. This focus is improving recoveries and returns. The Avalon Shale is an excellent example. The four-well development pad in the Red Hills area, highlighted on slide 10 of the earnings deck, continues to outpace expectations and supports tighter well spacing as well as our completion technique.","Also on slide 10, we highlight the Wolfcamp zone in Red Hills. I've described the Wolfcamp as the next big play for Concho, and we recently completed two wells targeting the Upper Wolfcamp sands. These two wells came online at an average 30-day peak rate of 2,000 barrels of oil per day. The results from the Avalon and Wolfcamp illustrate both the quality of our acreage position and the technical expertise of our team.","In the Southern Delaware Basin, we continued to delineate the Third Bone Spring sand play, bringing two strong wells online during the quarter. For 2017, we plan to optimize the development of the Third Bone Spring and the Wolfcamp A.","At the time of our last call, we were completing an eight-well stacked test in the Midland Basin. The Windham test, which is referred to on slide 13, includes four wells targeting the Lower Spraberry and four wells targeting the Wolfcamp B. These wells were drilled with long laterals spaced at approximately 660 feet between wells in the same zone, and represent some of the best results that we've achieved in the play. In the first 30 days, these wells produced a cumulative 260,000 barrels of oil equivalent, of which 85% was oil. And for the past 10 days, they produced at an average daily rate of more than 11,000 BOEs per day, also made up of 85% oil.","Additionally, our drilling team is constantly working the drill wells faster and longer by using the latest technology. They recently set a record by drilling a 2-mile Lower Spraberry well from spud to TD in less than 12 days. And over on the New Mexico shelf, we're targeting longer laterals while maintaining productivity per 1,000 feet of lateral and cost around $2.5 million per well.","Investing in high-quality assets in the Permian is key to our strategy. During the third quarter, we announced the acquisition of 40,000 core net acres in the Midland Basin. The acquisition closed in October, and we're running one rig on these assets today, with plans to add a second rig early in 2017. This transaction is a great example of the high bar we've set for acquisitions. It's value-accretive, enhances our drilling inventory, and we believe our drilling machine can make it even better.","We also find considerable value in owning large, blocky positions. This allows us to capture the growth and economic advantage of scale. While we continue to see a great deal of consolidation opportunities in the basin, we remain committed to active portfolio management. This includes a disciplined strategy of pursuing the right acquisitions to build for the future, and selling projects that have a hard time competing for capital within our portfolio.","It's hard to imagine that it's been nearly two years since Black Thursday OPEC meeting that sent oil prices lower. Our industry has adapted well to lower oil prices, but Concho's track record has been excellent. Year to date, we've increased our production growth target from down 5% at the start of the year to up 5%. We've reduced our capital budget to $1.3 billion from the initial $1.4 billion. We've demonstrated capital discipline by spending within cash flow. We've significantly reduced our annual cash cost by more than $100 million. We've reduced long-term debt by more than $1 billion. We've consolidated more than $2 billion of core assets. We've enhanced the quality of our inventory, and we've delivered leading debt-adjusted production growth per share.","It's amazing that this success overlaps with the longest running oil price down cycle in more than 30 years. I'm excited about our momentum, and even more pleased about the long-term outlook for our company.","Thanks again for your attention this morning. Now let me turn it over to Jack.","Jack F. Harper - Concho Resources, Inc.","Thanks, Tim.","All around, it was an exceptional quarter that supports our focus strategy and the dedication of our team to operational excellence. Good capital allocation, cost control, and a strong simple financial position are the three pillars of Concho's financial strategy. First, we believe that in order to build a leading energy company that excels in any environment, it starts with directing capital to the best assets and constantly working to improve performance.","On the first quarter earnings call, we outlined the inflection point in capital efficiency that's occurring in 2016. Our transition to long laterals and multi-well pads, combined with improving well productivity through new completion design, is enhancing the quality of our inventory. These drilling opportunities are a powerful engine for multiyear growth within cash flow.","Cost control is the second component of Concho's financial strategy. We continue to work our cash cost lower. We lowered guidance for lease operating expense to $6.00 per BOE from the prior range of $6.50 to $7.00. Additionally, during the third quarter, we redeemed $600 million of 7% senior notes, further strengthening the balance sheet and reducing cash interest burden, which leads me to the third component of our financial strategy. A strong simple balance sheet continues to serve Concho well, and provides significant flexibility. One goal we had for Concho was to come out of this cycle in a stronger financial position than when we started, and we've done that. We have significantly reduced our absolute debt and are within our leverage comfort level based on debt to EBITDA.","As we approach budget season, we again find ourselves planning for the long term in an uncertain price environment. Depending on commodity prices and resulting cash flow, we expect to invest between $1.4 billion and $1.6 billion in 2017 and grow oil volumes by more than 20% year over year. Total company production is expected to be 17% to 20% over 2016's increasingly strong base. We're at 18 rigs today and plan to run 18 rigs on average next year, so the rigs are ready to deliver on our growth target.","We will continue to capture efficiencies as we increase long lateral and multi-well pad development. The average lateral length of the program is expected to increase 20% as compared to 2016. Additionally, we expect more than 70% of the program to utilize multi-well pads, up from approximately 50% in 2016 and 15% two years ago.","We've drilled over 1,000 horizontal wells in the Permian, providing us with a significant amount of data and discovery. But there's still an incredible amount of running room in terms of delineating zones, well spacing, and overall drilling and completion optimization. We like to think of it as a big science experiment. So in addition to advancing efficiencies across the plays in 2017, the drilling program will also help answer important questions about optimal development of this world-class resource.","We're excited about the outlook for next year, but ultimately Concho is a growth company capable of raising the industry bar for delivering differentiated performance over the long term. And even in this commodity price environment, our long-term growth outlook is robust. Over the next three years, at current strip price, we expect to generate 20% annualized production growth within cash flow, with our leverage ratio further improving as it trends to one times over this 3-year period.","The plan is simple. There are no assumptions for a higher price outlook or greater efficiencies than where we stand today. Our combined effort is in 2016 to expand profitability and improve capital productivity enhance the impact of each dollar we redeploy in the drilling program. This is how we were able to deliver differentiated growth within cash flow relative to the field.","Our consistent execution provides a strong foundation for creating value for shareholders over the long term. Operational excellence, structural cost improvement, and a fortress balance sheet will continue to set Concho apart. And as we look to the balance of the year and beyond, we are more focused than ever on enhancing capital productivity and translating that into sustainable capital-efficient growth per share for our shareholders.","With that, we'll now open up the call for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from the line of Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good morning, gentlemen. I was wondering. Thank you for the longer-term outlook within cash flow. I just wanted to see if you could comment on your expectations for oil growth over this 3-year period relative to your 20% per annum BOE growth target, including gas.","Jack F. Harper - Concho Resources, Inc.","Sure, Arun. What we've laid out is oil growth that we plan to exceed the overall 20% growth, so that's what we've said at this point.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. So over this period, you'd expect your oil mix to increase over this time period. Is that fair?","Jack F. Harper - Concho Resources, Inc.","That's correct.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great, great. And just my follow-up is I'm wondering, guys, if you could just maybe comment a bit more on the density pilot, the Windham density pilot in the Midland Basin for the eight wells. If I heard correctly, those wells are now producing, is it 11,000 BOEs a day? And how does this shape your future development activities given what looks to be a pretty successful test in the Wolfcamp B and Lower Spraberry?","Jack F. Harper - Concho Resources, Inc.","It's all part of the big science experiment that we talked about in the script. And it excites us and emboldens our thinking about what we've got laid out. And the Midland Basin is going to be a big part along with the Delaware Basin of that growth.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And just what was the location of this? Was this in Midland County in terms of this pilot?","Jack F. Harper - Concho Resources, Inc.","Yes, it's in Midland County. That's correct.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, all right. Thanks a lot, Jack.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Freeman with Raymond James. Your line is open.","John A. Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Good morning, guys.","Timothy A. Leach - Concho Resources, Inc.","Hi, John.","John A. Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","When we're looking at the 3-year growth outlook you've got, can you provide any color on what that would assume for rig activity in 2018 and 2019?","Timothy A. Leach - Concho Resources, Inc.","Hey, John. We talked about \u2013 today we're running 18 rigs. Our 2017 plan contemplates averaging about 18, and then it would be a steady increase from that but not to exceed levels where we've already been running rigs. So we think it's very doable within the scope of what we've got.","John A. Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay, and then just one follow-up on that. When I'm looking at the current rig count versus for 2017's rig count guidance, the Northern Delaware Basin is the one area where the rigs go up, but it's actually the only area where the capital spend actually goes down. Can you just help me connect the dots there?","Timothy A. Leach - Concho Resources, Inc.","Yes, I think all that is just a matter of ownership in the wells.","John A. Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay, that's fine. Thanks, guys. I appreciate it.","Jack F. Harper - Concho Resources, Inc.","Thanks, John.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Deckelbaum at KeyBanc. Your line is open.","David A. Deckelbaum - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Good morning, Tim and Jack. Thanks for taking my questions, and nice quarter.","Timothy A. Leach - Concho Resources, Inc.","Thank you.","Jack F. Harper - Concho Resources, Inc.","Thanks.","David A. Deckelbaum - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","You guys laid out a great three-year plan. I just wanted to get some color on \u2013 you talked about the rig cadence steadily increasing, obviously staying within cash flow. You said that you didn't model additional efficiencies. Does that also mean that, basically that if you have a 20% increase in lateral length in 2017, that you don't have further increases in lateral lengths in 2018 and 2019?","Jack F. Harper - Concho Resources, Inc.","Yes, David. We planned it as we know it today. I think that the trends will continue to be towards long laterals where we can do that, and configure the leases to do that. But I think 2017 is a pretty good proxy for now.","David A. Deckelbaum - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Appreciate that, Jack. And then Tim, you mentioned practicing prudent portfolio management. Can you give us any color on \u2013 are you actively marketing packages right now? And I guess scope-wise, in terms of acreage that would be for sale out there, can you give us a sense of what you might be looking at?","Timothy A. Leach - Concho Resources, Inc.","We've talked about always managing our portfolio. So we're always looking to add bolt-on acreage in these core areas and peel off stuff that's outside the core areas, and that's ongoing.","David A. Deckelbaum - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. Do you have an immediate need to try to sell something now?","Timothy A. Leach - Concho Resources, Inc.","No, no. It's just, I think, prudent asset management. And I think one thing you're going to see in our industry is more trading going on. I also mentioned the blocky acreage and the power of having large blocks of acreage. And so, as you see companies manage their portfolio of assets, I think you're going to see more and more trading around within core areas, just to get blockier acreage.","David A. Deckelbaum - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Understood. Thanks, guys.","Timothy A. Leach - Concho Resources, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Tameron with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning. Tim, how should we think about \u2013 you guys mentioned in the past Alpha Crude Connector and the potential for some type of monetization. Any update there?","Jack F. Harper - Concho Resources, Inc.","David, this is Jack. No, I'd put it in the same category that Tim talked about before on managing our portfolio. That asset is a great asset for the company, and it has and will continue to achieve all the goals that we set out when we started that project, of putting our barrels on pipe, increasing the market access, and increasing netbacks. So we're real happy with that, and we view that, as we do our other properties, in terms of managing them over time.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay, and then, try to figure out where to go with my second one. Let me ask, if I start thinking about these longer laterals, is that able \u2013 do you think that will be able to offset any \u2013 what you guys anticipate as service cost inflation? So I'm thinking about overall well cost and obviously, capital efficiency gets better, but I'm trying to figure what that magnitude looks like in 2017, 2018. How do you think about I guess, Jack, what you guys modeled in the plan as far as service cost expectation, well cost expectation, and the impact of the efficiencies?","Timothy A. Leach - Concho Resources, Inc.","We talked about the plan, the long-term plan, being modeled under the current economic circumstances. And we thought that was the best marker to put out there to show what we could do today, at today's efficiencies and today's cost. And we talked before about how we think that commodity prices will continue to be volatile. And we've also given a range of what we can do while we spend within cash flow. So I do think that it leaves us room for increasing efficiencies as we continue to get better. And so we're not anticipating any capital cost increases and we don't have any in that plan, nor do we have any additional efficiencies. So I think those are upsides for us.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks, Tim.","Timothy A. Leach - Concho Resources, Inc.","Yes.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jeanine Wai with Citigroup. Your line is open.","Jeanine Wai - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hi. Good morning, everyone.","Timothy A. Leach - Concho Resources, Inc.","Good morning.","Jack F. Harper - Concho Resources, Inc.","Good morning.","Jeanine Wai - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","So back to your prepared remarks, you mentioned that you're on track to underspend for the year. I think you've underspent cash flow on an operating cash flow to E&P CapEx basis by roughly 25% on average over the past five quarters. So, with the improving well results and efficiencies, can you just talk about whether or not your 2017 plan could be conservative? And maybe another way to ask that is, what kind of commodity downside testing can your current 2017 plan withstand?","Jack F. Harper - Concho Resources, Inc.","Sure. If you stew on our hedges and you look at the range of capital, the way to think about that is low to mid-$40s up to where the strip is, up to $50-ish. So that's the way I would think about that.","Jeanine Wai - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay, so your current plan is intact into the low $40s?","Jack F. Harper - Concho Resources, Inc.","That's fair enough.","Jeanine Wai - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay, great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Pearce Hammond with Simmons & Company. Your line is open.","Pearce Hammond - Simmons Piper Jaffray","Good morning and thanks for taking my questions. My first question pertains to the long-term production outlook that you put out, which is very helpful, so thank you for that. But as you look out to 2020 and 2019 and all, do you see enough takeaway pipeline capacity within the Permian Basin to move all the oil out? And what are your thoughts on differentials? Could we actually see oil differentials start to widen again like we saw a few years ago and especially given the growth agendas of so many different E&Ps in the Permian Basin? So let me get your thoughts on that.","Timothy A. Leach - Concho Resources, Inc.","I guess my thoughts are there are various scenarios and various consultants that will advise on how much the Permian is going to grow. But I guess from where we sit and what we see, there's ample takeaway capacity out of the Permian and there's additional capacity on the way. So we don't really foresee a pinch point or a problem. And it also highlights the amount of investment that's going into infrastructure in the Permian, and what a great place to build infrastructure. And where else in the world is all this oil production going to come online? And we've seen that with our ACC project, what a great project in southeast New Mexico. So I think we have ample takeaway capacity today. I think the takeaway capacity will keep up with production, and we're not that concerned about a mid-Cush event.","Pearce Hammond - Simmons Piper Jaffray","Excellent, thank you. And then, Tim, my follow-up pertains to service costs. Where do you see those right now? Are you seeing any service cost inflation? And as you look out over the next 12 months, do you anticipate starting to see some of it, and are there any particular areas where it could get a little tight?","Timothy A. Leach - Concho Resources, Inc.","Especially with commodity prices where they are, we're not feeling any pressure on the service side. I think I mentioned in my prepared remarks the power of scale. And I do think for companies like Concho where we're running this many rigs and we're running eight frac spreads, all of them are running 24 hours a day, there are efficiencies built into the system. On the service side, it appears like there is excess capacity, so I think we feel pretty good about how we're sitting right now.","Pearce Hammond - Simmons Piper Jaffray","Thank you very much.","Timothy A. Leach - Concho Resources, Inc.","Yes, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Neal Dingmann with SunTrust. Your line is open.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Good morning, Tim, Jack. My first question, guys, I just couldn't help but notice on your 2017 guidance plan for the rig allocation versus what you currently have running, should we read anything into \u2013 I guess I'm looking specifically at the amount of rigs you're going to be adding in that Northern Delaware Basin play. Maybe just talk about what you laid out for 2017 versus the current plan.","Jack F. Harper - Concho Resources, Inc.","Sure. Like somebody mentioned earlier, the working interest is modestly lower. But yes, the activity is picking up. That's an area that's core to the company. We've drilled over 600 horizontal wells there. And so it's in the pretty consistent capital spending as we've had in the past.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay.","Jack F. Harper - Concho Resources, Inc.","The real positive improvement there is continuing to push out that lateral length and drill more wells on pads.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","And then, Jack, really just my follow-up is still to stay with that Northern Delaware area. How different \u2013 I know you guys don't lay out type curves yet, but how different should we think about if there was type curves when you start to get a little bit further in the central or northern Eddy versus that State Line area? We hear a lot of other peers talk more specifically about just how fantastic the State Line. We maybe don't get as many results starting to trend a little bit further north. I'm just wondering when you look at that area, you've got I guess slides 9 and 10 both laid out pretty well in that area. How much variability do you see there?","Jack F. Harper - Concho Resources, Inc.","We like that area a lot. You can see that the most recent results we've highlighted would get anybody excited. So we like the whole Northern Delaware and we like the optionality we have up there.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Very good, thank you all.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Drew Venker with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Drew E. Venker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good morning, everyone. I was hoping on that 3-year plan, if you could talk more about your spending appetite. And let's say at first it happened to be higher, you would generate significant free cash flow relative to the plan you laid out today at the strip. Is there any target leverage you're hoping to get down to, or is there any appetite at any point to pay a dividend or anything like that?","Timothy A. Leach - Concho Resources, Inc.","I think the answer to most of those questions is no. We're dedicated to running this business within cash flow. And so higher oil prices generate higher cash flow. We have the ability to ramp up or slow down. We've tried to put out a range that we think is a reasonable range to think of over the next year. And then as we go forward, we're flexible. We've always thought that maintaining flexibility was important to our business. So we can slow it down or speed it up if conditions change. But I think we're really well prepared. We can deploy. We have the infrastructure, the properties, the rigs running. We can deploy more capital if that's the right thing to do.","Drew E. Venker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","And I guess, Tim, as a follow-up to that, it sounds like then outspending cash flow is pretty much off the table for foreseeable future then. Do I have that right?","Timothy A. Leach - Concho Resources, Inc.","I think that's right. Now, I would differentiate between reinvesting our cash flow and this property management that we've described, the buying and selling of properties and high-grading our asset base. So we're going to spend within cash flow. We're also going to manage our property base. Those are the two fundamental core activities.","Drew E. Venker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And the results in the Upper Wolfcamp sand that you highlighted looked really great. So I'm just curious how much activity you can have there in 2017, and if you feel like you have sufficient mapping of that reservoir to run a high level of activity next year?","Jack F. Harper - Concho Resources, Inc.","We'll come out with more detail on 2017 next time. But I would think about our spending mix relatively similar in the future as it's been recently.","Drew E. Venker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks, Jack.","Jack F. Harper - Concho Resources, Inc.","You bet.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Hall with Heikkinen Energy Advisors. Your line is open.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Hey, good morning. I'm just curious, actually on that Wolfcamp sands. Can you talk about just how prospective you see that across all your Northern Delaware acreage, if it gets limited to Lea County, or how far west do you see that as potentially being prospective?","Timothy A. Leach - Concho Resources, Inc.","We do not think it's limited to Lea County. And, like all new and emerging plays, we'll learn a lot more as we drill more wells. But we like it, and we're going to progress through it like we have all these other nine zones in the Northern Delaware.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Okay, that's helpful. And thinking about that Northern Delaware program, is there anything that requires you, or do you have any substantial requirements in 2017 to continue drilling down in the Lower Wolfcamp, or will you be focused on higher oil cut areas \u2013 or intervals, rather, in the 2017 program?","Jack F. Harper - Concho Resources, Inc.","We don't have obligations that significantly impact our thinking on spending. So we're able to allocate the money across all four plays, really based on rate of return.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Okay, great. And then last on my end, you talked a good bit about the portfolio management thought process. I'm just curious how you think about, when you say peeling off acreage and parts of the portfolio, just in the context of rapidly changing acreage values in the Permian, how you think about that from a long-term value preservation standpoint, and how you balance need for cash or desire for cash now versus potential value in the future?","Timothy A. Leach - Concho Resources, Inc.","We have a strong balance sheet. We have strong cash flow. Our drilling program is going to provide really good growth. So, I've highlighted the importance of having blocky acreage. So most of our property management is going to be focused on creating bigger blocks of acreage, either through trades or selling stuff and redeploying through acquiring other bolt-on properties.","And so when you look at something and say, well acreage looks expensive, well if you're buying and selling at the same value but improving your blockiness on what you're paying, as long as you're continuing to get ever-increasing quality of acreage, I think that's okay. And we've demonstrated our ability to buy stuff at a good price. So I think we'll continue that as well.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Great, I appreciate the time, and appreciate the long-range outlook as well. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of James Sullivan with Alembic Global Advisors. Your line is open.","James Sullivan - Alembic Global Advisors LLC","Hey. Good morning, guys. I apologize if you already hit this. I've had several calls already (33:03) this morning. But it seems the 2017 guidance you talked about increasing the average lateral length across the portfolio for the 2017 program say maybe (33:12) 300 feet from what I think is about 7,000. Is that baked into the guidance, or is that one of those uncaptured upsides you guys talked about in terms of 2017 numbers?","Jack F. Harper - Concho Resources, Inc.","That is baked into our numbers.","James Sullivan - Alembic Global Advisors LLC","Okay, great. Thanks. That's all I had, thanks so much.","Jack F. Harper - Concho Resources, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jeff Robertson with Barclays. Your line is open.","Jeffrey Robertson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks, good morning. Tim, can you talk about any limitations with respect to lateral length and the size of stimulations that you all \u2013 or the industry is putting in the Permian Basin?","Timothy A. Leach - Concho Resources, Inc.","There are mechanical limitations based on the depth and the type of pipe you're using and all those kinds of things. But the industry is continuing to experiment with different configurations to get longer laterals. I think it's going to become much more standard to get out to 2.5 miles as we continue to push the boundaries based on how wells are configured today.","We told you in past years that the main restriction was just our leases. And as we've worked on our property base, our leases have gotten bigger and we've got blockier positions now that allow us to drill longer. But I mentioned in my prepared remarks that we're really focused on lateral length, well placement in the zone, and the completion style. And those are our priorities on this science experiment of solving for all the different zones. I think we're well up the learning curve, and I think we're zeroing in on optimization on those areas.","Jeffrey Robertson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","So just curious, you talked about 20% increase in average lateral length in 2017. Do you have a rough number for the amount of lateral feet you hope to drill in 2017 versus what you will have done in 2016?","Jack F. Harper - Concho Resources, Inc.","Jeff, we can probably pull that number in a minute. It might take a bit.","Timothy A. Leach - Concho Resources, Inc.","Yes, the stage is number two.","Jack F. Harper - Concho Resources, Inc.","Yes, it's significantly more.","Jeffrey Robertson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay, thanks. Maybe I'll follow up with Megan on that.","Jack F. Harper - Concho Resources, Inc.","I think what we're looking at is almost a 50% increase year over year to north of 1.5 million feet net.","Jeffrey Robertson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay, thank you very much.","Timothy A. Leach - Concho Resources, Inc.","All right, Jeff.","Jack F. Harper - Concho Resources, Inc.","Thanks, Jeff.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jason Smith with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Jason Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, good morning, everyone, and thanks again for all the color on the outlook. So, guys, you talked about optimizing well spacing and development patterns in the Midland Basin in 2017. So I guess just following the Windham pilot, what are the next concepts you want to test in that basin both from a spacing and completion perspective?","Jack F. Harper - Concho Resources, Inc.","Yes, continuing to test spacing, new zones, certainly more activity in the Spraberry, but it's continuation of what you're seeing now.","Jason Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Again, Jack, is 2,200 pounds per foot of sand, is that where you guys want to be, or are you going to look to test bigger jobs?","Jack F. Harper - Concho Resources, Inc.","Plus or minus, that's where we are right now. But like in all the areas, we're not stagnant. We're going to adapt to what yields the best result.","Jason Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it, thanks, and a really quick one. Just where does your DUC count stand today, and is that what's going to drive the uptick in completions in 4Q?","Jack F. Harper - Concho Resources, Inc.","We're at about 30 today, and I think that's roughly where we think we'll end the year. But I do think you'll see the completions pick up in the last quarter.","Jason Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it, that's all I've got. Thanks, guys.","Jack F. Harper - Concho Resources, Inc.","Okay. Thank you, Jason.","Operator","Thank you. And I'm showing no further questions at this time.

Welcome to the Q1 2012 Concho Resources, Inc. Earnings Conference Call. My name is Marita, and I'll be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, this conference is being recorded. I would like to hand the call over to the host for today's call, Ms. Toffee McAlister, Director of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Please go ahead.","Toffee McAlister","Good morning, everyone. We're glad you could join us today for Concho's first quarter 2012 conference call. Before we get started, I would like to direct your attention to the forward-looking statement disclaimer contained in the press release. In summary, it says that statements in the press release and on this conference call that state the company's or management's expectations or predictions of the future are forward-looking statements intended to be covered by the Safe Harbor provisions under federal securities laws. There are many factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations, including those we have discussed in the press release, our 10-K and our other filings with the SEC. In addition, we will reference certain non-GAAP measures, so be sure to see the reconciliation in our earnings release. ","On today's call, I am joined by Tim Leach, our Chairman and CEO; Joe Wright, our Chief Operating Officer; and Steve Pruett, Senior Vice President of Corporate Development who will discuss our first quarter results. We are also joined by other members of our management team who will be available to answer questions later on the call. ","With that, I would like to turn the call over to Tim.","Timothy A. Leach","Good morning, everyone. The Concho team is here with me in Midland, including the newest member of our team, Steve Pruett. Steve recently joined us as Senior Vice President of Corporate Development, coming to us from Legacy Reserves where he served as President and Chief Financial Officer. I'm sure you will all soon get to know Steve and his role here at Concho. And today, I'm going to call on him to review our financial performance with you. We\u2019ll have Q&A at the end, but first, let me make a few comments about the quarter. ","Our first quarter was a good start to what I think\u2019s going to be a great year. We drilled over 200 operated wells in the first quarter, and you will see a steady build in our rig count as we progress through the year. Unlike last year, we were able to complete the first quarter without any weather-related interruptions, producing 6.9 million equivalent barrels, a 6% growth over the fourth quarter and a 36% year-over-year growth from continuing operations, the vast majority of which was organic. ","The company continues to perform well financially even in the face of collapsing gas prices. We produced record cash flow and profits, reflected by the $362 million of EBITDAX that we generated. ","The Permian Basin continues to be the place to be for new opportunity and profitability. The Permian rig count is approaching the historic mark of 500 rigs, and Permian production continues to increase. Concho is now the second largest producer of oil and gas in the Permian, with our gross operated production second only to Oxy. Also, we're one of the leading horizontal drillers, and we're well positioned to capture many of the significant horizontal opportunities, which I think is where most of the growth is coming from in the future. ","When I think about the key achievements for the first quarter, 3 things come to mind: First is our profit margin, which remains best in the industry. The cash margin increased to 78% in the first quarter, generated by a rise in our realized price of $73.39 per Boe, despite a sharp decline in natural gas prices. Our cash flow and margins are significantly tied to oil and liquids as only 5% of our revenue came from dry gas in the period. In addition, per unit LOE [ph] declined 9% quarter-over-quarter. ","Second, we unveiled a new play in the Midland Basin. We've leased about 67,000 gross acres in Terry and Hockley Counties that are prospective for the horizontal Wolfcamp and Cline shales. We believe these rocks should be similar in productive capacity to the same formations in the Southern Midland Basin. We're currently drilling our first well in the play and would expect to see more activity there this year. This is part of our strategy to increase our exposure and activity in the horizontal plays in the Midland Basin. ","And finally, I think we've had significant accomplishments in the Delaware Basin. Not only has our science and our understanding of the potential improved, so is our well performance. The stack pay opportunities that we've been discovering lead us to believe that there will be significant upside to our current location count and a source of sustainable growth for the company. ","Since the beginning of the year, we've added 16 horizontal Delaware Basin wells that now have 30 days of production data, bringing our total count to 71 wells, targeting 5 unique zones. In total, the average 30-day IP rate of those 71 wells remains over 700 Boes per day from single zone completions. This is very encouraging, considering a significant portion of our Delaware Basin drilling is focused on the identification of multizone potential, meaning we often complete in the second or third targets. ","Bone Spring sand -- the work -- this kind of work is paying off. We recently identified an oil-rich second Bone Spring sand zone in Southern Eddy County, where the more gas-weighted Avalon shale has traditionally been considered the primary target. Our first 2 wells, testing the second Bone Spring, are strong, averaging in excess of 1,000 Boes per day and have a higher oil cut. That rate is even more impressive when you consider 2 things: First, these wells are about 60 miles to the south of the core second Bone Spring development area. And second, they're in the same area as the 2 horizontal Wolfcamp wells we discussed last quarter, which had average 30-day initial rates of 1,240 Boes per day each. So as a result, we're pumped about having 410,000 gross acres in an area with 2,500 feet of gross prospective rock with exposure to potentially 7 unique zones. ","And I'm more encouraged than ever that our strategy has positioned Concho as the leader in multizone development. And I'm excited about the implications for our shareholders. Going forward, the key to being successful in this play is going to be having the best science and creating the greatest efficiencies in scale. ","Now let me pass the baton to Joe for an operational update. I look forward to taking your questions at the end of the call.","E. Joseph Wright","First quarter was a solid quarter for Concho from an operational standpoint even as activity levels in the Permian continued to surge. Today's rig count stands at 499 and will soon pass by the record of 500 rigs previously set in the early '80s. A key trend to follow with respect to the Permian rig count is the growth in horizontal rigs. Over the last 5 quarters, the horizontal rig count has grown by 260% and now stands at over 120 rigs in the basin. Of our 37 active rigs, 11 are drilling horizontal targets. And as rigs migrate to the Permian from gas basins across the country, we'll continue to upgrade our fleet with rigs capable of drilling horizontally. ","Although the rig count has steadily increased, we've seen stabilization in the cost of goods and services, and our service providers have done a great job of keeping up with the growth in activity. For example, the number of frac spreads in the Permian Basin increased approximately 30% over the last year. In our view, there still remains some tightness in key completion materials and labor cost, but we are confident that we'll continue to secure supplies and services necessary to execute our plan in 2012. With the growth in production, we remain very focused on takeaway capacity out of the basin. ","The recent Midland\/Cushing Differential [ph] widening is a result of 2 planned turnarounds at local refineries, an unexpected 10-day outage of another refinery and some downtime on a basin pipeline pump station. These interruptions caused an increase in oil inventory in the Permian Basin, but are temporary and are not expected to impact our 2012 annual guidance. ","While we're able to continue to move our oil production, the market is tight and will remain so until projects like the Longhorn Pipeline reversal and the West Texas Gulf Pipe Line are online next year. ","In the Delaware Basin, the team plays 20 new horizontal wells on production since the first of the year. 10 of these wells targeted the Avalon shale, 2 were second Bone Spring sand wells, 2 were Wolfcamp and 1 was a Delaware sand well. The number of productive intervals in the Delaware Basin stands at 7 and reflects our efforts to identify the multizone potential across the acreage position. Currently, we have 7 horizontal rigs operating in the Delaware Basin, which should steadily increase to 10 horizontal rigs by the end of the year. This is consistent with our 2012 annual budget. ","Moving over to the Texas Permian. Our asset team placed its first horizontal well in production in the first quarter. That well is on our Eastern Midland Basin acreage in Glasscock County, and we continue to be pleased with the initial production results. The exploration team is also currently drilling a second horizontal well, targeting the Penn shale on our Terry County acreage in the Northern Midland Basin. In this month, we'll spud our first 2 planned horizontal Wolfcamp wells around our core Wolfberry position in Upton County. Our vertical Wolfberry drilling activity remains robust with 19 rigs, two of which are operating on our recently acquired PDC acreage. ","The New Mexico Shelf team is operating 10 rigs today, 9 rigs targeting the Yeso play and 1 rig targeting the horizontal Abo play. Two of our Yeso rigs are drilling horizontal wells, and we'll be converting a third rig to drill horizontally in the second quarter. In total, we expect to drill approximately 30 horizontal Yeso wells in 2012, primarily on our newest acreage in the southwest extension of our legacy Yeso play, as well as the area to the north of the Yeso fairway. We've been encouraged thus far with the -- with our early results there. ","As you will recall, last quarter, we reported a significant increase in per unit lease operating expense. I'm pleased that we've reduced our first quarter per unit LOE by 9% from the previous quarter. And while we are just above the high end of our 2012 LOE guidance, we are on the right track to finish the full year within our stated range of $6.80 to $7.20 per barrel. ","Overall, I'm very pleased with our operational success in the first quarter. ","I would now like to turn the call over to Steve Pruett to discuss our financial results.","Steven H. Pruett","Thank you, Joe. I would like to highlight certain operational and financial comparisons for the first quarter of 2012 to the fourth quarter of 2011 and the first quarter of 2011. We encourage you to read our press release and its tables carefully, along with our 10-Q, which we filed in the next couple of days. ","Production was 6.9 million barrels equivalent or 76,000 Boes per day, which was a 6% increase from Q4 and 36% increase from continuing operations a year ago. Oil comprised 61% of our volumes, and liquids comprised 95% of our revenues. Operating revenues were $508 million, which increased 6% from Q4 and 41% from Q1 of 2011. ","Prices realized for oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas were $73.39 per Boe compared to $73.24 in Q4. Including the effect of commodity derivatives cash settlements, we realized $68.78 per Boe compared to $72.17 in Q4. ","Our oil differential to NYMEX WTI Cushing was 95%, and our gas differential to NYMEX Henry Hub gas was 230% in the first quarter, compared to 97% and 206%, respectively, in Q4. ","We've not been impacted by delays in gathering our oil. However, we continued to experience increases in gathering system pressure and gas plant downtime in Southeast New Mexico that has impacted both oil and natural gas sales volumes in Q1 and continues to impact Q2. The routine annual maintenance shutdown of one of our primary gas processing plants on the New Mexico Shelf is in progress, but the plant turnaround was expected and we provided for this production curtailment in our annual guidance. ","Lease operating expenses and workover costs, excluding production and ad valorem taxes were $7.28 per Boe in Q1, down 9% from $8.03 per Boe in Q4. ","DD&A was $19.64 per Boe in Q1, an increase from $18.90 per Boe in Q4. This increase relates to the timing of reserve booking in our emerging plays, and our guidance of $18 to $20 per Boe remains intact. ","As of March 31, 2012, our debt was approximately $2.3 billion, of which $185 million was drawn on our reserve base credit facility. This leaves over $1.8 billion available on our $2 billion of commitments from our lending group. Our borrowing base is $2.5 billion, which offers another $500 million of availability should we seek to expand the commitment from our lending group. We priced $600 million of 10-year senior unsecured notes at a rate of 5.5% on March 7, 2012. ","Our debt-to-book capital ratio is approximately 43%, and our debt to EBITDAX ratio is approximately 1.6x as of March 31, 2012. ","During the quarter, we closed the Wolfberry acquisition from PDC for $184 million. We continue to pursue and close acreage acquisitions in our core areas through leasing and property purchases. We have never been more excited about our drilling inventory and our acquisition opportunities in the Permian Basin, and we look forward to providing an update on our continued growth on our second quarter conference call in early August. ","Thank you for your participation today and for your interest in Concho Resources. We\u2019ll be pleased to answer questions at this time.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We've got our first question from John Freeman from Raymond James.","John Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","First question on this newer play, the second oily sort of Bone Spring zone, where you've had the 2 big wells, any thoughts on maybe shifting some of your activity at that area, maybe ahead of what you probably had budgeted before the year started?","Timothy A. Leach","Well, yes, when you look at our budget in the Delaware Basin, 2\/3 of that was going to target Bone Spring sands. So I think the emphasis in that area is going to be on the Bone Spring sand. And those 2 wells in that area were kind of a new development. So we'll continue to try to expand the aerial [ph] extent of that zone. So yes, I think there\u2019ll be some focus on that going forward. It's really exciting to have -- that's the same area we had those 2 Wolfcamp wells we talked about last quarter, and that's the area where the play really started with the Avalon. So we've got some really big zones that have a lot of productive capacity.","John Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","And how far apart where those first 2 wells, Tim?","Timothy A. Leach","Joe says about 1.5 miles.","John Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then, Joe, on the last call, you\u2019d mentioned you all are going to be looking at the -- maybe doing some multilateral completions at some point this year, just any timing on when that may occur and on what specific zones you think you would try it on first?","E. Joseph Wright","We're still working that very hard. I'm hoping that in the third quarter, we'll begin that project. I hate to give you a specific time just because a -- kind of a moving target right now, as well as kind of exactly what intervals that we're going to target or do a lateral. I do feel good that we will start in the third quarter.","John Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","All right. And then I know you all had originally targeted average 35 rigs for the year. It looks -- at least the numbers I'm looking at, it looks like you all are tracking ahead of that number.","E. Joseph Wright","Yes, we are a little bit at this time, especially as we brought on PDC. They had an extra rig that will be leaving us, so that kind of thing. So it's going very well in terms of rig availability and execution of the plan in the first quarter.","John Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","But there\u2019is not like an official change in the CapEx budget at this point?","Steven H. Pruett","Oh, there's not at all.","John Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay, so I might just supposed to read it, maybe cost savings or whatever you're able to maybe run a few more rigs than you originally thought this year, but the CapEx budget is the same?","Steven H. Pruett","Well, we may lay a few of those rigs down in some areas that, as you said, that -- beyond that 35 rig count as we go forward. A lot of that depends on what our net is for those areas and as we look at our capital budgets. So that could happen.","Operator","We've got the next question from Brian Lively, Tudor, Pickering, Holt.","Brian Lively - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Sort of a follow-up to John's question previously. Seems like the production in Q1 is a little ahead of schedule. The wells are -- seem to be coming in as good, if not better than planned. Just wondering what you guys need to see in terms of increasing your full year production guidance range. And with that, are there any other logistical reasons why that trend doesn't continue?","Timothy A. Leach","Well, Brian, it's early in the year -- it's the end of the first quarter. I think as we roll forward in the year and we gauge the pace of our activity, we're going to be watching our cash flow and trying to match our cash flow. But the year is going well. And historically, kind of when we get in the summertime, we kind of reassess where we are and make any course corrections. But right now, I think we're biased toward the upside.","Brian Lively - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","That's great. On the Cline completion in Glasscock, given that, that's on the eastern side of the Midland, you guys, I think, have a pretty small position there. Just wondering what the overall strategy is. Is that a test of concept? Or is this an area that you want to get a bigger foothold?","Timothy A. Leach","I think it's both of those things that -- we have broader a strategy in the Midland Basin that includes all that acreage up to the north that we have acquired. It also includes our historic Wolfberry acreage to the west. And I mean, we're very pumped about the Delaware Basin, as I said, but at the same time, it appears that all this Midland Basin activity is going to work as well and we want to be a major player in that.","Brian Lively - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","That's understandable. The comments on -- I think you said testing 2 horizontal Midland Wolfcamp that -- or wells this year. If those wells work, is there any reason why you can't replicate that over a large percentage of your Wolfberry position?","Timothy A. Leach","No. We\u2019ve said publicly before that we think that a large percentage of our Wolfberry acreage is prospective for horizontal Wolfcamp.","Brian Lively - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then last for me, the 8 Yeso horizontals, it wasn't in the press release, but can you give any rates or early rates, at least on the average of how those wells are performing so far?","Timothy A. Leach","Well, it's certainly early and they're meeting our expectations. We'll continue to watch those and try to understand how that relates back to vertical drilling and where we're growing value in that -- in the horizontal wells since,  so things are going well there, and we'll let you know as we firm up our results.","Operator","We'll go the next question from Brian Singer from Goldman Sachs.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I wanted -- just wanted to make sure we have the right interpretation of the multizone Delaware progress report here. If I'm interpreting it right, you drilled the wells at the second Bone Spring area, approximate to where you've already seen Wolfcamp success. You haven't drilled the Avalon wells there, but it's in an Avalon prospective area\u2026","Timothy A. Leach","No. We started that area by drilling Avalon. So the Avalon was the first successful completions in that area. Those were big wells, but if you'll recall, those are big wells, but they had a higher gas percentage. Then we reported last quarter on the good Wolfcamp wells that we are making and then the second Bone Spring sand wells are on the same area.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So I guess, the way I'll look at it then is that you have formally tested and now deemed commercial 3 non-communicative zones on the same acreage area, and I guess over what percent [ph] portion of your net acreage in the Delaware do you think this specific drilling program has delineated.","Timothy A. Leach","Your first statement is correct. The second statement\u2019s what, we're really working to try to identify. I mean, that -- my comment about a lot of our drilling is targeting maybe not the primary zone but second and third zones, trying to identify the extent of this. We think it's widespread. But as we have laid out maps for you in the past and things like that, you could tell when we first got into this play, the prospective areas were small, where we had primary targets, and over time, they have grown. And I think today, we believe that many of these zones will overlap one another.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Great. And then given that your confidence in the multizone potential increased and, as you said in your comments, you effectively then increased your gross acreage to more than 400,000, does that increase focus on your committing capital organically versus looking at acquisition opportunity?","Timothy A. Leach","I want to make sure I understand your question correctly. Could you ask it one more time?","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Yes. If you\u2019ve effectively raised your resource base organically and effectively raised your acreage position, to get more zones working that's increased your resource life, does that then reduce the need or willingness to look at acquisition opportunities and increase your willingness to commit capital organically?","Timothy A. Leach","Okay, I got it. That's kind of a complicated question because on the -- our business model has stayed the same since the very beginning. We have the ability to stay within cash flow and stay within inventory and grow this company for multiple years just drilling on our existing inventory. At the same time, we have always had an eye on replenishing that inventory and growing it. I think one of the answers to your question is we think our existing acreage position has much more inventory than what we have -- because of the multizone than what we have historically had. But the second part of the answer is that I think we're kind of at the forefront of an understanding of something in the Permian Basin that gives us an advantage. And we think we're going to be one of the leaders in developing these properties. So I don't think our appetite for acquisition has been lessened in any way.","Operator","We've got the next question from Neal Dingmann from SunTrust Company.","Neal Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Just 2 questions. First, just on capacity. You mentioned, I think, and we've talked about this in the last call as well, just I know you continue your plan for being kind of the second biggest operator. What is sort of the plan? How much of the budget do you anticipate, kind of a percentage? Will that continue to increase or not necessarily as far as the buildout on the capacity?","Steven H. Pruett","Are you talking about infrastructure or gathering?","Neal Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Yes, I\u2019m actually -- the second part -- first, I\u2019m interested on the gathering there. I guess my second question kind of tied into that with just -- you mentioned a little bit of downtime that you had on a couple of things, at least this quarter. I was wondering if that's the result of just the increased capacity? Or is that just sort of typical of what happens during the quarter?","Steven H. Pruett","Yes, it's pretty typical. Of course, when you have a lot of your gas coming online it's high pressure and you have mature production that's low pressure, and that creates some disruptions. What's happening right now is the scheduled plant turnaround by a third-party plant. Every 2 years or so, plants have to have a major turnaround that last 2 to 3, sometimes 4 weeks. So part of it, the second quarter event was planned and accounted for, the first quarter event of increasing back pressure as simply the third party gathers trying to add more compression, incremental gathering and just not keeping -- quite keeping up with all the growth in gas production in the area. But in general, we aren't in the gas gathering and processing business, and our gathering partners are investing billions of dollars and have plans to increase capacity, not only in gas gathering and processing but also in crude takeaway and NGL pipelines out of the Permian Basin towards the Gulf Coast.","Timothy A. Leach","One thing, Neal, that I would also add to that is if you remember back in past years, when you think about line -- when we talked about line pressures, we're mainly talking about on the shelf in the Yeso area in New Mexico. And in the summertime, when temperatures heat up, those line pressures kind of naturally go up. And in the spring and fall and the wintertime, the line pressures come down and you'll see a seasonal reaction from our production. It's not hugely dramatic, but it's enough that you notice it. So while I agree with everything Steve said about adding additional capacity compression and we're making more wells out there, at the same time, some of this line pressure increase is seasonal.","Steven H. Pruett","And let me add to it, Tim, as you think about our budget, we do set aside capital for infrastructure. And when you think about oil and gas, that's one of it. But things like SWD, roads, electricity, especially in these new areas as you think about the Bone Spring play pushing further and further south into Texas, those areas need a lot more infrastructure. So we do dedicate capital to that.","Operator","We've got the next question from Mario Barasda [ph] from Dohifrancis [ph].","Unknown Analyst","I just kind of want to build a bit more off the prior question on midstream capacity. If you guys are to proceed and, say, you convert the horizontal Wolfcamp in the Midland Basin from -- you take away some vertical rigs and then you add some more horizontal rigs. I mean, if you're looking to do that, say, if it were to happen late this year or early next year, do you have the sufficient midstream capacity secured from third parties to support something -- a move like this?","Timothy A. Leach","Yes, I mean we've got enough support from our midstream partners to accomplish the plans this year. And I think their capacity will be growing over time. So it's -- well, when you think about the total basin, some of the smaller operators have trouble getting connected and getting their production out, I think we have sufficient capacity to do everything we want to do.","Steven H. Pruett","Yes. It really helps to have contiguous acreage and have a strong position and have the attention as one of the largest producers in the basin from the gas gatherers and processors. And they have committed plans. They have permits. They have projects that are breaking ground. So there's tangible evidence that they're adding to the capacity. And it's a very profitable business for the midstream players with low residue gas prices and high NGL prices. So they're very motivated to stay ahead of our growth.","Unknown Analyst","Okay, all right, I appreciate the color. And then also with the couple of horizontal Wolfcamp test flow that you're looking to drill, I mean, right now, with where oil prices are, are you getting pretty solid returns on the vertical side? What exactly, I mean, would you be looking for to proceed with a horizontal development plan?","Timothy A. Leach","Yes. I think there's 2 things that I'm looking for. One is when you think -- our vertical plan development in the Wolfberry we complete in the Spraberry [ph] and we complete in the Wolfcamp. And it's a very thick section, and we drain all of that with perforations that are spaced certain feet apart and everything. So one of the questions is, when you go horizontal in a Wolfcamp shalier zone, are you draining new oil that you wouldn't have drained from a vertical well? I mean, that's a scientific question. I don't think anyone knows the answer to it right now. The second thing would be an efficiency question. We talked in previous quarters about downspacing and all the locations we have on 20s and things like that. So part of it is going to be, if you go horizontal in the Wolfcamp, can you more efficiently drain some of the oil that you would have to drill more vertical wells to get to in the downspacing situation?","Unknown Analyst","Okay, all right. And also just on the CapEx, when you're saying that you're still on the lookout for acquisitions, are you looking on both sides? Or is there one basin that you're more focusing on? Is Midland the higher priority right now? Are we still looking to possibly extend in that Delaware?","Timothy A. Leach","With all the development in the Permian Basin, I would say that we have seen acquisition opportunities in all parts of the Permian Basin.","Operator","We have the next question from Irene Haas from Wunderlich Securities.","Irene O. Haas - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","I have a question on the Cline shale. If indeed is Pennsylvania in age, I want to ask you, does it behave differently from the Wolfcamp? And what I'm after is thus far, we've seen a cluster of activities, firstly is in Glasscock County, and you guys move to the north to Terry County as such. Was the basin during Pennsylvanian time more segmented compared to during Permian and therefore, the Cline might be more sort of localized, not like the Wolfcamp, which is more basin wide?","Timothy A. Leach","And that is the perfect question for me to turn over to Matt Hyde, who is sitting here. He's got a grin on his face because that's his area of expertise.","Matthew G. Hyde","A good question. As you've seen in some of the releases, industry and specifically companies focused on the Permian are looking at a pretty broad distribution for the Penn shale or Cline equivalent rock. Depositionally [ph] , it is a more -- the term we use is clastic, which means more sand-shale sequence than the Wolfcamp, which is more shale carbonate rich. So they are a little bit different. The rocks are different, but we think they both have wide geographic extent, not only in the Midland Basin but in the greater Permian Basin.","Timothy A. Leach","Would you say, Matt, that the Cline might have a larger extent than the Wolfcamp?","Matthew G. Hyde","There probably are some limitations on the Wolfcamp as we move into the platform shelf areas. But at Penn time, as Tim is alluding to, that distribution of the Cline actually extends beyond those shelf platform margins that we typically ascribe to the Permian rocks.","Irene O. Haas - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","I see. Were there any sort of intrabasin carbonate in the Midland Basin that would actually divide up the basin in 2 parts for Cline? Or, as you say, it's pretty widespread?","Matthew G. Hyde","A little bit. I think actually, the Penn Shale will have a wider distribution than the Wolfcamp ultimately.","Operator","We've got the next question from Adam Lowleaf [ph] from Simmons & Company.","Unknown Analyst","You guys are no longer referring to the vertical Wolfbone and have replaced that with the horizontal Wolfcamp and the southern Delaware Basin. What are you seeing there that made you move away from the vertical Wolfbone? Is that something you\u2019d go back to?","Timothy A. Leach","Well, I think it's just purely economics. I think -- I believe that the horizontal play in that area is going to generally be much more economic than the vertical play.","Operator","We've got the next question from Mike Scialla from Stifel, Nicolaus.","Michael Scialla - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I just want to follow up on the horizontal Yeso. I know it's early. Can you say yet how you think the economics compare there to your vertical? And am I thinking about it right in that you're kind of extending the field there by going horizontally? Or is it just a \u2013 been a choice, where you could have drilled that vertically, but you just think the economics might be better with horizontal?","Timothy A. Leach","Yes. Let me take that. The horizontal wells we're drilling today are predominantly in that southwest extension where the Yeso gets shallower. And one -- if you remember back, the Yeso\u2019s comprised of 2 zones. And as you go to the southwest, I think one of those zones gets more predominant than the other. So it's -- most of that horizontal is trying to process a zone in the Yeso at higher rates and a higher rate of return than the verticals would capture. Now a back around in the more traditional area, we're using horizontals to extend the play, Joe mentioned extending it to the north, and also drilling horizontally in areas where we might only have one zone.","Operator","We have no more questions. [Operator Instructions]","Timothy A. Leach","Well, let me -- since there's no more calls in the queue, let me thank you for dialing in. I know it's a busy day. I appreciate your attention to Concho, and we look forward to talking to you all in the future. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you for your participation in today's conference call.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we'll have a question-and-answer session, and instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Megan Hays. You may begin.","Megan P. Hays - Director-Investor Relations","Thank you. Good morning and welcome to Concho's second quarter 2016 earnings call. On the call with me today in Midland is Tim Leach, Chairman, President and CEO; and members of the Concho's senior management team. Our second quarter earnings release and corporate presentation are both available on our website.","Please note that we will make forward-looking statements based on current expectations this morning. Also, some of our comments may reference non-GAAP financial measures. Forward-looking statements and other disclaimers, as well as reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, are provided in the earnings release and corporate presentation and can be found at Concho's website.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Tim.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning. Thanks for joining us on this busy morning. The second quarter of 2016 was a good one. Once again, it illustrates the power of our assets, the excellent commitment of our people. While the macro environment is dynamic, we're extending our track record of working all angles within our business to deliver strong operational and financial performance and position the company for the future.","Our performance this quarter highlights our ongoing drive to improve capital efficiency with a relentless focus on asset performance, cost savings and capital discipline. Let me start by summarizing the key achievements for the quarter.","Second quarter production increased 4% over the previous quarter and exceeded the high end of our guidance. For 2016, we now expect our annual production to show growth while maintaining our capital budget guidance and under spending cash flow.","Our outlook for double-digit production growth in 2017 also remains unchanged and, in some ways, improves. Double-digit growth in 2017 off a higher production base and a capital program defined by our cash flow at the current strip will be a unique achievement, reflecting the operational momentum and improving capital productivity across our assets.","For the first half of 2016, lease operating expenses averaged approximately $6.50 per barrel, a 12% reduction compared to LOE in the second half of 2015. The decrease in LOE reflects specific actions we're taking to generate sustainable operational efficiencies.","We're making substantial progress in several areas. For example, there is an asset-wide focus on transporting water disposal volumes by pipe rather than truck, which is more efficient and reduces transportation costs.","In addition, our efforts to optimize production in field development have reduced pumping costs. High-grading our inventory also contributes to lower LOE as we acquire assets complementary to our core positions and infrastructure while we're selling lower returning properties.","As a result of ongoing improvements in operations, we reduced our cost guidance for LOE to $6.75 per barrel at the midpoint. We also reduced our guidance for both cash and noncash G&A per barrel. Aggressively managing our cost structure, combined with strong asset performance, accelerates capital productivity gains, which increasingly enables us to do more with less.","In addition to delivering strong production volumes and reducing operating costs, we under spent cash flow for the fourth consecutive quarter, which further strengthened our balance sheet. Our commitment to capital discipline and a strong balance sheet provides us with opportunities to generate differentiated value for our shareholders.","The most impactful way we can affect the value of Concho is by becoming even more efficient, and we're focused on improving the productivity of each capital dollar invested. Each of our core areas is contributing to improved capital productivity.","In the Northern Delaware Basin where we've drilled more than 600 horizontal wells, our drilling team still finds ways to set new records. For example, in the second quarter, average drilling days improved to 19, smashing the prior record by 3 days.","We're also advancing the oil-rich Avalon Shale in Lea County where continued improvement is a direct result of refining lateral placement and completion techniques. This quarter, we highlighted early results from a density test on the Monet wells, and this appears on slide 9 of the earnings presentation.","These four wells targeted the upper Avalon zone on 80-acre spacing with a specific focus on optimizing the fluid system and sand volumes. We're excited about the outstanding performance of these wells as we move into development mode.","The Red Hills area in Lea County is an area where we've targeted bolt-on acquisitions for long lateral development. During the second half of the year, we plan to drill several long lateral wells, targeting the Avalon. And we'll look to replicate our success in the Wolfcamp where we believe significant upside exists.","In the Southern Delaware Basin, we closed the acquisition of 12,000 net acres in our core North Harpoon area at the end of the first quarter. We've added two drilling rigs to this acreage at the start of the second quarter, illustrating that anything we bring into the portfolio must be ready to move to the front of the drilling program.","In the Southern Delaware, we continue to deliver industry-leading well results. In the Upper Wolfcamp, we are continuing to test multi-zone potential. We recently achieved strong results from a 3rd Bone Spring well, with plans to drill additional 3rd Bone Spring wells before the end of the year. We are also quickly advancing our play in the Midland Basin. The Midland Basin represents our largest opportunity to capture efficiencies as we focus on two-mile laterals and multi-well pad development.","Our efforts to optimize development and maximize the value of this project are ongoing. The nine wells we added this quarter were drilled to a shorter lateral length, which is primarily a function of timing. We drilled these wells in 2015, and our shift to two-mile laterals began at the start of this year. We also tested smaller frac jobs on these wells, which provided us valuable information about cost versus well performance that we can use to improve future well economics.","For the balance of the year, our completion techniques will focus on large profit concentrations. We're currently completing an eight-well density test with four wells targeting the Lower Spraberry and four wells targeting the Wolfcamp B. These completions will utilize proppant concentrations of approximately 2,000 pounds per foot.","The New Mexico Shelf continues to outperform. During the quarter, well results for the shelf set another record, the second in as many quarters. With just two rigs running here, we've managed to advance horizontal development of the play and maintain stable production from year-end 2015 volumes.","Our strategy and diversity within the Permian are unique and give us our greatest competitive advantage. We have the ability to allocate capital across our assets and leverage our scale and technical expertise to enhance returns and recoveries and our relentless focus on improving capital efficiency will have an ever increasing impact on Concho. It will enable us to drive profitable debt-adjusted growth per share in the near and long term.","The acquisition market surrounding our core areas is also setting new records, and it's nice to have assets in the hottest zip codes in the industry. We currently have the largest and highest quality inventory in our history. Our consolidation activity must compete with our top tier drilling inventory and strengthen our financial position. While it's a target-rich environment, we will continue to take a disciplined approach in pursuing the right acquisitions to build for the future.","Sentiment is positive among our industry peers, and optimism is a driving force in our industry. At Concho, there's a lot to be excited about, but the outlook for commodity prices isn't much different since the last quarterly update. As a result, we maintain our commitment to spend within cash flow. The momentum we're generating reinforces our 2017 outlook for double-digit production growth while balancing capital and cash flow within the current price outlook.","The mission of Concho has always been to build something unique, to build a leading energy company that excels in any environment that creates shareholder value by investing capital in the best assets with the highest returns, that consistently seeks to improve performance and drive profitable growth per share.","Our vision for delivering on this mission today is simple. We believe that we can be the best by executing a disciplined capital program, delivering operational excellence and high-grading our investment opportunities. Our track record of performance, combined with focused and disciplined execution of our strategy, will enable us to generate value for our shareholders for many years to come.","Thanks for listening, and let me turn it back over to the moderator and take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. One moment while we wait for callers to queue up. And our first question comes from the line of Jason Smith of Bank of America. Your line is open.","Jason Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey. Good morning, everyone.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Jason Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Tim, just on capital allocation. So, you've got six rigs running in the Midland and four in each of the Northern and Southern Delaware. So, I guess, as we look forward, is that a fair reflection of how you want to keep the capital allocated or given the results you saw this quarter in both the Avalon and the Southern Delaware, do you foresee, maybe, increasing the rollout of allocations back towards the Delaware?","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","No. I think one of the things that I was referring to in the comments is that all of our core areas are delivering really good economics for us right now. So, I think, the capital allocation that you see today would be a balanced approach going forward. So, I think you ought to just expect us to continue to allocate capital based on returns and also in areas where we're testing new ideas.","Jason Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. Thanks. And maybe just to follow-up on that, the new ideas. In the Midland, you discussed the proppant you guys are testing. But maybe, when you talk about testing well spacing and development patterns, can you maybe just frame for us what the existing configurations are and what the concepts are that you guys are testing there?","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. It's different depending on which zone you're talking about. But, in general, when we talk about density test, when we talk about our inventory and things like that, we're still eight wells per section in general, so it's not as dense as some of our peers are talking.","But the test involved testing spacing, but also the configuration of wells in the zone, whether it's a wine rack or a Chevron pattern or something like that. Also, lateral length and proppant and concentrate \u2013 there's big experimentation going on as we've discussed in the past. And I think we've got more data and running 16 rigs is one of the leaders in the industry. So, we're gathering data more quickly than most.","Jason Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. I appreciate the color. Thanks.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Freeman of Raymond James.","John A. Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Good morning, guys.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, John.","John A. Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","When I look at the full year production guidance, it's continued to move higher versus your original expectations. When I look at the average lateral length for the first half of the year, it comes in roughly at about 5,200 feet, so about identical to 2015. So, in the second half, obviously, we get the benefit from the longer laterals. And I'm just curious, does your current full year production guidance, does it already account for the anticipated productivity gains you get from those longer laterals or is that potential additional upside?","Jack F. Harper - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer","Yeah. Hey, John. This is Jack. You may be confusing a little bit of completed wells versus drilled wells. I think in the second quarter, we averaged about 7,500 feet on the wells that were drilled. But the plan we have is consistent with what we had in the beginning of the year. And so, we've anticipated the current mix of well lengths.","John A. Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. And then, when I look at the encouraging data on the Avalon with the Upper and the Lower zones that you believe you've delineated, has there been \u2013 I'm just looking for a little bit more color, is there any difference in sort of how those two zones have performed? I mean, are they pretty similar?","Jack F. Harper - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer","Yeah. We've had pretty consistent results in the Upper and the Lower, John.","John A. Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","That's great. I'll turn over to somebody else. Well done, guys.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, John.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Hall of Heikkinen Energy. Your line is open.","Michael A. Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Thanks. Good morning and congrats on the good results. I guess, I wanted to go back a little bit on the proppant loading. I'm just curious, you made the point, Tim, early in the prepared remarks that you do have a unique view on the Permian Basin, given the asset base you have, it really straddles all the different areas. What sort of variation in proppant loading response are you seeing across the different areas? Are some areas more sensitive to proppant loading than others? And I'm just curious what other sort of color you all can provide in that context.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I mean, we've gotten as low, I think, as about 1,000 pounds per foot. And now, we're testing loading at over 2,000 pounds per foot. And as I mentioned on the call, it's \u2013 or in my prepared remarks, it's different by zone. And you're trying to balance that versus drainage, versus the type of fracs you are getting, and the well spacing and configuration that you have, so.","And as you mentioned, we have so many zones and so many of the sub basins that every answer is a little bit different. And generally, of course, the higher the sand loading, the bigger the wells but that doesn't necessarily mean you're optimizing economics that way. So, we've been running experiments on how do we get the best capital efficiency. Long laterals really is driving the answer, and I mentioned placement in the zone and fluid composition, things like that.","So, it's a complex experiment, but I would tell you that the results have been very encouraging in all our areas. And we think we can continue to drive efficiency through the things we're learning about the properties and the zones.","Michael A. Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Okay. Certainly, it seems like you have a lot to learn still. On the completion length, I'm just curious, what sort of lag would you say is a fair way to think about your drilled length versus completed length as we think about the go-forward from a modeling perspective, if it's even able to break down that simply?","Jack F. Harper - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer","In terms of the average lateral length, Michael?","Michael A. Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Yeah. Like the average lateral length of completed wells versus the average lateral length of drilled wells has tended to vary a decent amount. I'm just trying to think through going forward, what sort of lag is there? If we look at what you're drilling today, when is that actually going to get completed?","Jack F. Harper - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer","Yeah. Probably the best way to think about that, Michael, is two quarters from the drill to seeing them on that \u2013 the report the way we track it.","Michael A. Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Okay. That's helpful. And then, on the LOE, very impressive improvements there. It sounds like a lot of that is quite structural. I was wondering, though, if you could comment on the other side, the cyclicality of it all. How are we all thinking about how LOE might behave as we move to the other side of the cycle? Hopefully, at some point here.","Jack F. Harper - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer","Yes. Some of the changes that we're making are going to last. Putting disposal water on pipe versus trucks, changing the lift in the wells, those types of things should last. Cost of goods and services we know move up when there's pressure, but we think some of the important factors are sustainable.","Michael A. Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Is there any way to quantify how much is kind of variable associated with the cyclical environment versus a more structural component?","Jack F. Harper - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer","That's hard. I just watch the rig count and completion count to get a gauge of the industry, but it feels like at least half, if not more, are sustainable.","Michael A. Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Okay. And then, last one on my end is just around the oil mix in the quarter came down a little bit. It sounds like some new plants were coming on. Is there also a component of just GOR shift that's kind of flowing through the system as you slow the activity relative to prior periods and should we expect that to kind of shift back up then as we move forward? How should we think about that mix going forward?","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","The composition of the wells we're drilling is as oily as ever. I mean, you pointed out the quarter we had that Ramsey Plant come back online in the quarter, that had a big effect on gas production. At the same time, as far as timing, when you slow down and you don't drill as much, over time, the GORs go back up. But as our activity increases and we continue to build on what we're doing, I think it's going to certainly be within our guidance.","Michael A. Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Okay. Great. Appreciate the time.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","All right. Thank you.","Our next question comes from the line of Arun Jayaram of JPMorgan.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah. Good morning. Tim, I was wondering, you gave us some outlook comments in terms of growth for 2016 and 2017. And I know you've held with that double-digit forecast. I think you provided that when oil was in the low-$40s. Just wondering if you could help us think about, given some of the well productivity gains, oil has moved a bit, maybe help us think about where you think growth could be in 2017. I think the Street's at 11%. And perhaps \u2013 I don't know if you and Jack have thought about three to five year kind of outlook for Concho, and if you think this double-digit type of growth level is sustainable over the next three to five years within cash flows.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I mean, we're always thinking about the long term. That's kind of how we built the company. We think it's important to be able to talk about how we can grow in the current circumstance with the current price forecast, the current efficiencies that we've gained on our wells and things like that, and then try to make it better.","And so, I think that the areas we're in, the way we're structured, how our cost structure is set up that we will \u2013 for the long term, we'll be able to compete with anybody in the industry on growth. And we're very, very pleased to be able to talk about growth within cash flow. And in fact, we've been underspending cash flow for several quarters and still growing. So, I think we're well-positioned. And our goal is always to surprise you to the upside.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thanks for that, Tim. And I did want to ask you a little bit about the Wolfcamp and some plans in the second half of 2016. It sounds like you may be doing some testing in the Northern Delaware Basin. I was wondering if you could give us some thoughts on some of that delineation activity.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","That Northern Delaware Basin, where you are talking about, I had some prepared comments on that it had some of the best well results in the industry. And I think our acreage is well positioned up there. And most of our activity has been in the Avalon that we talked about. But we are drilling Wolfcamp and that's a real great area. We feel very encouraged by the well results.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And, Tim, do you plan to have some specific well results in the back half of this year or this maybe bleed into 2017?","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","It will probably bleed into 2017. To get 30 days of production history and have enough data that we think is meaningful.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks a lot, Tim.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jeb Bachmann of Scotia Howard Weil. Your line is open.","Jeb Bachmann - Scotia Capital (USA), Inc.","Good morning, everyone.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Jack F. Harper - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer","Hey, Jeb.","Jeb Bachmann - Scotia Capital (USA), Inc.","Tim, just going back to the Avalon quickly, can you remind us how much of your Lea county acreage do you think is going to be prospective for that zone?","Jack F. Harper - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer","Yeah. Jeb, we've kind of talked about it in terms of inventory and we're \u2013 in that oily Avalon, we're probably 750 wells, but the overall Avalon inventory is much larger than that.","Jeb Bachmann - Scotia Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay, Jack. And is that \u2013 do you guys see maybe a potential for a third landing zone, maybe in the Lower Avalon? Is it thick enough for that?","Jack F. Harper - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer","It's a very thick zone, over 1,000 feet. We've only talked about the Upper and the Lower we're actually two zones at this point.","Jeb Bachmann - Scotia Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay. And I guess, last one for me, a question every quarter on M&A, just wondering where you guys have seen the best value right now or in the Basin, either side.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Oh, I mean, there's \u2013 both the Delaware Basin and the Midland Basin really have some outstanding results. And there are opportunities in both basins. And I think we find the best opportunities in areas that are in and around our core and areas that give us opportunities to drill long laterals and get the efficiencies you get from being a large operator with pad drilling and lots of activity.","Jeb Bachmann - Scotia Capital (USA), Inc.","Great. Thanks, Tim.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brian Singer of Goldman Sachs.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. Good morning.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","In the Southern Delaware, can you add more color on the Bone Spring 3? How far south do you think that could extend in future testing including any spacing cuts?","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","We talked about the Southern Delaware a lot as far as having rock characteristics that are similar to the North. And we've highlighted that North Harpoon area as kind of the core of the core, and we feel really good about the prospectivity there. And then, as you move South, we're just going to have to test more to get more data on the extent down to the South.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","And so, what are your next steps, further delineate the South of the Harpoon area or try to drill more within that area and try to figure the spacing and development?","Jack F. Harper - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer","Yes. Brian, we're going to continue in that area for the remainder of this year and then, as Tim said, look to expand beyond that after this year.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Thanks. And then, can you talk a bit more about the Midland opportunity from here? You highlighted in your comments the efficiency gains that you could see. If we look at the well rates adjusted for lateral length, it seems the Delaware Basin is so much larger than the Midland Basin, and I know you've been kind of testing the proppant loadings there. But I just wonder what your expectations are for where well rates adjusted for laterals can go and whether you view the Midland rates of return as equal to or better than the Delaware.","Jack F. Harper - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer","Well, we do have projects in the Midland Basin that compete well with the Delaware Basin just like we do in the New Mexico Shelf. So, in return, it's what we focus on. So, I would just answer that by saying all of the core areas have projects that compete well on a rate of return basis, Midland and Delaware.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","And so, what would be \u2013 would the efficiency gains that you talked to end up driving Midland Basin returns to more widely be competitive with the Delaware or ultimately where the Midland could exceed the Delaware. I'm just trying to think of kind of going back to one of the earlier question on capital allocation and thinking about that over the longer term.","Jack F. Harper - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer","Yeah. I think the enhancements we've seen in the Midland Basin, namely a water delivery system, ability to drill long laterals have allowed that asset to compete with the Delaware. Going forward, when I look at the allocation this year, it's about 25% to the Midland Basin. That's a pretty good proxy going forward. As Tim said, we're looking for a balance between the Midland Basin, the Southern Delaware and the Northern Delaware.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thank you.","Jack F. Harper - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer","You bet.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Tameron of Wells Fargo.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning, Tim.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","A lot has been asked, so let me just go big picture. Oil is sitting at $40, I know you guys are, I guess, you're at 16 rigs and going to stay \u2013 plans were to stay at that level for the rest of the year. I know you're hedged. But if we're $40 in three or four months, does that change the way you \u2013 does that change the activity level or how should we frame that up?","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","No. I mean, we have built our current plan around \u2013 as you said, we are hedged, but we've build it around kind of the current Strip. So, we're operating in an area that we kind of planned for when we put this together at the beginning of the year. So, I think it's kind of steady as she goes. So, that's the way we characterized it when we started this. And I think the results and the economics we're getting are okay at today's oil price.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And I know you've talked about this probably a year ago, but when you start thinking about \u2013 at $100, before it was, hey, we get equivalent returns when oil is at $70 or $60 or whatever the number was on the way down. How should we think about framing up returns? And I guess, in the current environment with service costs where they're at, what you've done on the operational efficiency side. I'm just trying to get a feel for where the breakeven number \u2013 how much that's come down for you guys over the last couple of months.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","One thing, at Concho and at the rest of the industry, we have really been focused on reducing our cost structure. And we had to do that because of the environment that we were in and what was happening with the cash margins. So, we have gotten \u2013 we've had had great progress on LOE, G&A just our total cost burden and that's helped the economics of all the projects and the economics of the company.","I think we told you before that one way Jack would characterize it was that at $50 \u2013 let's see, it was at $50 and above, things work really well; $40 to $50, things were okay; and below $40, things weren't any good. And I'd tell you that because of the efficiency gains and cost reductions and things like that, I think that whole scale has slid now $5 or $10.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. I appreciate it. Thanks.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Drew Venker of Morgan Stanley.","Drew E. Venker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good morning, everyone.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Drew E. Venker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","In the Southern Delaware, we've seen a number of large acquisitions within the industry recently. You guys actually had a nice swap, I guess, late last year. Are you still seeing acquisition opportunities left or the potential to swap sizeable chunks of your acreage to further block it up?","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, we just made a large acquisition in the first quarter there. And so, it was a focus area for us. Yes, there are \u2013 because of the power of long laterals down there, there are opportunities and reasons to block up your acreage.","Drew E. Venker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","And then, North Harpoon has been an area you guys have been focused on for a while. How much delineation do you have left and are you focused more on optimizing your well design at this point since you should have, I think, a decent amount of well control?","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","No, I always would like to have more information. I think there's still a large amount of delineation both aerially to find out where the boundaries are because we have a limited amount of data. And then, how many zones are productive? And you can read anything \u2013 you can come up with as many zones as you want to come up with based on what you read in the press, and \u2013 but frankly, we've gotten really good test results on two zones, and we'll continue to test other zones.","Drew E. Venker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks a lot, Tim. And if we can go over to the Midland Basin for a second, you mentioned a spacing pilot in the Spraberry and Wolfcamp. Do you have other pilots planned this year to evaluate spacing across the position, as it's just a very large position in the Midland Basin.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Well, this was an intense one that we were \u2013 we thought was very interesting to talk about. But as we said in past quarters, almost everything we're doing is some sort of spacing test. And that's true for the Midland Basin especially.","Drew E. Venker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks for the color, Tim.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Campbell of Tuohy Brothers. Your line is open.","Jeffrey Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Good morning. On slide 4, I found it interesting that production declined less in first quarter 2016 on 10 fewer wells, and then it increased in the second quarter 2016 on only five additional wells. And I was just wondering if you could discuss that a little bit. I was thinking maybe larger working interest or a stronger well performance, longer laterals, something else. I thought it was pretty striking.","Jack F. Harper - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer","Yeah. I think it's just the timing of the completion and the style of wells. I wouldn't read a whole lot into that. We've had a pretty steady amount of activity in the first half of the year.","Jeffrey Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Okay. Thank you. On slide 8, the three primary Northern Delaware targets. Just wondering how much per pad multizone potential do you have in your current development plans? Or put it another way, what percentage of it maybe, just attacking one zone versus the ability to attack maybe more than one zone on a pad?","Jack F. Harper - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer","Yeah. So, in general, for the year, more than half of our wells are going to be drilled on pads. Some of those will be drilling wells in the same zones and some of those will be drilling wells in either two zones or multiple members of one zone. So, it's all across the board.","Jeffrey Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Okay. And my last question was on slide 10. I noticed a Big Chief Pecos well on an area that hasn't seen much drilling lately. I'm just wondering if there's any color on resuming activity there.","Jack F. Harper - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer","Yeah. We have a couple of rigs running in that area now. We've drilled as many wells as anybody in that area. So, we're just continuing our work in that part of the Southern Delaware.","Jeffrey Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Okay. Just to be really specific, what I was referring to is I actually saw evidence of a well in Pecos County. It didn't look like \u2013 I went back and looked at some old slides and it didn't look like you'd been that far South in a while. So, I was just wondering. It sounds like it's just part of your regular program.","Jack F. Harper - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer","That's correct.","Jeffrey Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thanks for the color. I appreciate it.","Jack F. Harper - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer","You bet.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Neal Dingmann of SunTrust. Your line is open.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Morning to Tim, Jack. Say, Jack \u2013 all right, for Tim, maybe. When you guys look at sort of drilling, going forward, I guess, for 2017, how do you think that you didn't mention on the HBP. Is that an issue, Tim, or is it mostly just a pure return basis as you were talking about allocation?","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","That's becoming less of an issue over time. It wasn't much of an issue this year. We've talked about in the past how the Midland Basin was pretty much held by production. And there was a portion of our capital budget that was kind of obligation-type things we had to do but it becomes much smaller over time.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. And then just lastly, you didin't mention kind of a return basis. Now, obviously, like the Avalon after the density test and some of the returns you're getting, other parts of the Northern and Southern Delaware, as well as the Midland, does \u2013 I think Jack mentioned this, but I just want to kind of circle back to this. The New Mexico Shelf, with those 30-day rates of just sub-500, is it because of the cost or do the returns compete there with the other three plays? Is that why your still running the rigs there?","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. The returns are really good. The costs are low. I think the costs there was like $2.5 million a well or something like that. And so, those returns compete with anything we're doing. And we just don't have as big an inventory on the shelf as we do in other places. And it's all held by production. But it's a great asset.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","And then, Tim, you did mention, I think, it's slide 7 that shows how much costs have come down since first quarter 2015. It's pretty amazing. Is that now on a go-forward \u2013 I mean, can we think of that continuing in most areas? I guess what I'm alluding to is just basically service cost versus efficiencies. Do you see cost improvements still increasing? And if so \u2013 or is cost still decreasing? And if so, is that more because of continued service cost declining a bit more, or is that more just efficiencies?","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think the majority of cost savings going forward is going to be efficiencies and not service cost providers reducing the cost for specific items. We still have continued to experience lower cost from the service industry. The rig count hit a bottom in the Permian Basin of I think like 130 or 140 rigs, and now it's up to 190. So, we've seen some increasing activity out here.","But at the same time, the Permian Basin's kind of where everybody wants to be. So, there's been equipment and people moving in here from other basins. So, I think we've got plenty of spare capacity in all respects. And so, I don't think we feel any cost pressure on the upside, and there may still be some room to move lower.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Great details, Tim. Thanks.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Deckelbaum of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.","David A. Deckelbaum - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Good morning, Tim and Jack. Just curious if you can provide us with any color on \u2013 as you go ahead into 2017, you've talked sort of about the double digits in cash flow staying within cash flow. What should we expect in terms of a progression of lateral length in your current designs or is that sort of conversation in that guidance? Is that more based on the current lateral lengths that you're drilling with?","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. It's based on the current lateral length. We have found substantial efficiencies in drilling 2-mile laterals everywhere we can. So, where we have the least configurations in the blocky acreage, you will see those kind of lateral lengths. And it's predominantly in the Southern Delaware Basin and in the Midland Basin. But the double-digit production growth that we're talking about is kind of within the system that we see today for how we configure our wells and how we drill them.","David A. Deckelbaum - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thanks, Tim. And can you guys remind me, I'm not sure if you provided this before, but just roughly what percentage of your overall acreage, at least in the Delaware, is amenable to the 2-mile laterals?","Jack F. Harper - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer","David, you can kind of look at the map. It's in the Southern Delaware. It's where the majority of that ability would be. In the Northern, I think you will see us try to move the lateral length up. But we're talking hundreds of feet there of increase, not thousands like you could see in the Southern.","David A. Deckelbaum - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thanks, guys. I appreciate the color.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mike Scialla of Stifel. Your line is open.","Michael Scialla - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Good morning, Tim and Jack. Jack, I think you said in the past that \u2013 and, Tim, you alluded to this, I think, in answering David Tameron's question. I think you've talked about the drilling inventories that maybe 30% of it gives you a 20% IRR or better at $40. And I'm wondering, now with the results out of the Avalon and with the lower cost, has that number changed at all?","Jack F. Harper - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer","Yeah. It certainly has improved significantly since year end with the cost changes, so yes. And I think you could actually raise the bar above 20% and still have multi-decades type of inventory at this year's pace.","Michael Scialla - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","So, maybe more than \u2013 to tie in a fence around it more than 50% of the inventory, maybe, works at a $40 oil price now?","Jack F. Harper - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer","No. No, I don't think that's fair necessarily. But I'd just say if it was 30% before, that number is higher somewhere between 30% and 50%.","Michael Scialla - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. All right. Wondering if you could say anything about where you are in the asset sale process for the Southern Midland properties.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","No. I don't really want to comment on that specific deal. I would tell you, though, that buying things every quarter and selling things every quarter is just kind of the way the machine works. So, we ought to \u2013 as we acquire things, we're going to be selling other parts of our portfolio to try to get more concentrated and cored up. And that's just a normal part of our business.","Michael Scialla - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Fair enough. And last one for me. It just sounds like you're still testing in most of the areas. Is there anywhere in the portfolio that you'd say you're at full field development now as maybe that state line area there or still testing even there?","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","We're still testing all the areas. I mean, we have gotten better and better. The more wells we drill, the more efficiencies we've been able to get out of our program. But I think that will continue. I mean, the experimentation will continue. New technology will continue, trying things all the time. It's been really encouraging.","And I think when somebody starts to say that they've got to crack the code and they got it figured out that's a sign of danger. So, we continue to get better, but I expect every year that we'll show some sort of improvements.","Michael Scialla - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Very good. Thank you.","Timothy A.

Harper - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer","Good morning.","Michael Dugan Kelly - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Concho was, early on recognized the potential merits of the Southern Delaware Basin, and it seems like the rest of the industry is catching up a year, a year-and-a-half later. Tim, I'd love to get your thoughts, really, on \u2013 just to look across the entire Permian right now and what areas of formations in your mind have the potential to exhibit the greatest positive rate of change if we look out a year, a year-and-a-half going forward right now? Thanks.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, the entire Delaware Basin is still in early stages. I mentioned we've drilled 600 horizontal wells in the North. That's probably the highest area of concentration of wells and information gathering, and we're still learning there.","And I think, there, the Wolfcamp zone hasn't been tested as much. It's probably more widespread than anybody recognizes. It holds lots of upside potential. The Southern Delaware Basin is very early as far as getting enough information and wells to delineate all the productive zones. And so, I think there's still a tremendous amount of work to be done there. And so, we like the Delaware Basin, and the top tier areas of the Delaware Basin continue to grow.","And the Midland Basin has \u2013 there's lots of companies with lots of data, and it's probably further along in industry's understanding of what works and what doesn't work and where the Wolfcamp works the best, where the Spraberry works the best. But, in general, I think for both the Midland Basin and the Delaware Basin, it's still early innings.","And everybody's \u2013 the number of wells that companies are drilling have gone down. It's amazing to me that we have more rigs running in the Permian Basin than I think just about anybody. And we're only running 16. We were running almost 40 two years ago. So, lots of things have changed.","Michael Dugan Kelly - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Good color. And then, secondly from me, just correct me if I'm wrong here, but on the long-term strategy, it seems like you guys have shifted somewhat to talk more about staying within cash flow or growth within cash flow. And I'm curious, in years past you've had no problem outspending, and I'm curious on what would get you to kind of go back to that mindset potentially look to outspend and push growth more. Thanks.","Jack F. Harper - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer","I would challenge you a little bit on the we have no problem outspending cash flow because I think that was a onetime moon shot kind of project where we saw our balance sheet was de-levering naturally, acquisitions looked expensive, and we announced that two by three plan where we could double production within three years. That was not kind of our normal way we operate, but those were the conditions at that time. And we had great success in that program. We were well on our way to achieving all those goals.","Today, it just seems like \u2013 in the kind of times we find ourselves in with the volatility, having a strong balance sheet, being able to demonstrate capital discipline and improving capital efficiency is the way you set yourself apart from the rest of the field. And that's what we're focused on. And we think we can show really dramatic results staying within cash flow. And I think we can show growth that's going to be very well received.","Michael Dugan Kelly - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks, guys.","Jack F. Harper - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer","Yeah.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of James Sullivan of Alembic Global Advisors. Your line is open.","James Sullivan - Alembic Global Advisors LLC","Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking \u2013 for the call. Just picking up on the last point about balance sheet. I mean, just looking at various of your leverage metric continue to flow down, I think your total debt to flowing production is down like 20% year-on-year.","Can you just update us on your thinking on investment grade? I know you guys have been very stable with the ratings agencies have been rewarded for your conservatism here. What are the other metrics you guys are focused on? And is that on the front burner for you as you think about the next couple of years?","Jack F. Harper - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer","Yes. I think maintaining our rating in this environment, I think, is very positive and a recognition by the agencies of our business. In terms of investment grade, we think that will be a result of the way we run our business, and it depends on which one you're talking to. The absolute size and reserve base is a big factor. But, again, I think it will just be a result of the way that we run our business.","James Sullivan - Alembic Global Advisors LLC","Okay. Fair enough. And just kind of to follow up on that. I know that one of the things that maybe had been an obstacle or a roadblock had been \"asset diversity\". I know you guys think about yourselves as operating three different areas and maybe some people look at you and say, oh, this is Permian only and that kind of thing. Is that a sole concern or how does that involve this at all?","Jack F. Harper - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer","Oh, it's certainly not a concern of ours. We have four core areas in the Permian across several hundred miles. So, we feel like it's plenty of diversity.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I would just add that the Permian is a big place. And it wasn't that long ago that our biggest concern about the Permian was just takeaway capacity, and that has been solved. And with our ability to export crude oil and our access to different markets, we think if you were going to have concentrated assets, the Permian's the place you'd want them concentrated.","James Sullivan - Alembic Global Advisors LLC","It absolutely makes sense. So, just real quick. You've sort of alluded to this in an answer to another question, but as I look at your 2017 program, you guys talk about doing it within cash flow. And I think your weighted average floor price per hedge is about $55 (49:32) there. And, actually, you guys are just about breakeven there.","But it sounds like you guys are saying that with the cost structure coming down, maybe your unhedged, company-wide cash flow breakeven point might be kind of coming down below $55, maybe to $50 or even the high-$40s. Is that the right way to think about that?","Jack F. Harper - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer","I think that's a fair assessment, yes.","James Sullivan - Alembic Global Advisors LLC","Okay. Perfect. Great. Thanks, guys. That's all I had.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Derrick Whitfield of GMP Securities. Your line is open.","Derrick Whitfield - GMP Securities LLC","Thanks. Good morning, guys.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Derrick Whitfield - GMP Securities LLC","So, Tim, just building on your Southern Delaware comments, we've heard from industry including Anadarko this quarter the potential for four to eight intervals. I would be interested in your take on how you would frame that and how you currently rank your two delineated intervals in terms of returns.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I wouldn't argue that there's potential for four to eight intervals. I would say that we've tested two of them with good results and high productivity. And so, I think the opportunities that are being identified by industry within the Southern Delaware Basin or within the Delaware Basin, we certainly agree with. It's just one thing to talk about potential and then another thing to talk about well results and success.","Derrick Whitfield - GMP Securities LLC","Thanks. And then, just in terms of how you rank your two delineated intervals to-date in terms of returns?","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","They're both very good. I wouldn't say that we would prefer one over the other based on returns, it's just one's \u2013 the upper Wolfcamp was the first thing we started developing. It was the deepest zone that we've started developing and had good results in. And now we've got two, and I think that will continue to expand.","Derrick Whitfield - GMP Securities LLC","Great. And then, lastly, regarding the Avalon, any view on how much of your inventory could be developed through longer laterals?","Jack F. Harper - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer","Yeah. Probably about a quarter of that inventory that I've mentioned earlier has long lateral potential.","Derrick Whitfield - GMP Securities LLC","Very good. That's all for me, guys.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Richard Tullis of Capital One Securities. Your line is open.","Richard Merlin Tullis - Capital One Securities, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning, Tim and Jack. A lot has been asked already, so I'll just keep mine quick. In the Southern Delaware Basin, so the results in the second quarter showed a large increase in the 30-day rate on a per lateral foot basis for the four wells completed compared to the prior quarter. What was the big driver there? Was it the 3rd Bone Spring well in the North Harpoon area or was it something else or a combo?","Jack F. Harper - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer","It certainly wasn't that one well, although that well was included in the mix, Richard. It's just the culmination of all the things we're talking about \u2013 learning more, optimizing the completions, and just the geography of the wells.","Richard Merlin Tullis - Capital One Securities, Inc.","And, Jack, are you able to provide the 30-day on that Bone Spring well?","Jack F. Harper - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer","No. We didn't separate that out. But it is in the totals that we provided.","Richard Merlin Tullis - Capital One Securities, Inc.","Okay. And then, just lastly, you talked a little earlier about drilling longer laterals in the Avalon in the second half. Could you remind us what the average lateral roughly was in the 30-day rates for, say, the Avalon wells drilled over the past couple of quarters?","Jack F. Harper - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer","Well, the ones that we've highlighted this quarter were 1-mile wells.","Richard Merlin Tullis - Capital One Securities, Inc.","Okay.","Jack F. Harper - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer","That's roughly been where we have been in the Avalon.","Richard Merlin Tullis - Capital One Securities, Inc.","Okay. All right. That's all for me. Thank you.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Jon Wolff of Jefferies. Your line is open.","Jonathan D. Wolff - Jefferies LLC","Good morning.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Jack F. Harper - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer","Hey, Jon.","Jonathan D. Wolff - Jefferies LLC","Hi. The rig count in the Midland went up a bunch; it's a gross rig count obviously. Could you talk a little bit where you're drilling in terms of working interest levels, whether it's \u2013 a lot of it's in the 25% area or if it's sort of it's a higher working interest area where, I believe, you said average throughout Midland was kind of low-40%s working interest and I know you operate almost everything.","Jack F. Harper - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer","Yeah. The average over the Midland Basin is a little over 50%, and I think the program this year will average out to something close to that.","Jonathan D. Wolff - Jefferies LLC","Okay. And in terms of going up from one to six rigs, can you help us think about that on a gross, can you help us think about that on a capital basis?","Jack F. Harper - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer","Yeah. The net capital we have allocated to the Midland Basin has stayed about the same, but some of those shifts in rigs due to working interest is what has caused the increase in rig count.","Jonathan D. Wolff - Jefferies LLC","Got it. In the Delaware, gas processing and, obviously, in water and other things or issues on \u2013 should we expect a bit of lumpiness around the gas oil mix? I understand the comments on the GOR rising, but are they sort of \u2013 the plants come on in a lumpy fashion that causes the growth or the trajectory to be kind of uneven?","Jack F. Harper - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer","Jon, going forward, it should \u2013 we should be in good shape the rest of this year and beyond. On the oil mix, we did arrest a decline in oil production this quarter. And as we progress through the remainder of this year and into next year, I expect to see that oil volume as a percentage pick up.","Jonathan D. Wolff - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Thanks, Jack. Last one, maybe for Tim, is the progression of your PDP decline rate, I think it was sort of high 30s a year ago and kind of moved maybe lower 30s. Where are we now?","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. We talked about a year ago it being high 30s and then high 20s. And then, it's probably going to improve a few points, but it flattens as the actively slows down.","Jonathan D. Wolff - Jefferies LLC","Got it. Last, last one, sort of taking us into the thought process of the management on whether to increase CapEx or not because your cost control is unbelievable. I enjoyed your comments about commodity markets staying weak and being weak and not being the right time. Has the thinking evolved over the last two months in terms of whether it makes sense to go faster or slower or same?","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","We think right now that trying to stay within cash flow and showing that discipline, and then showing success within that discipline is a differentiated kind of theme that we have. And we feel very confident we can execute on that. So, that's what you ought to expect from us in the near and long term, I think.","Jonathan D. Wolff - Jefferies LLC","Got it.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time.","I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Ms. Megan Hays, Director, Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin.","Megan P. Hays - Director, Investor Relations","Thank you. Good morning and welcome to our fourth quarter 2015 earnings call. On the call with me today in Midland is Tim Leach, Chairman, President and CEO; and members of the Concho senior management team. Our fourth quarter earnings release and corporate presentation are both available on our website.","Please note that we will make forward-looking statements this morning. Also, some of our comments may reference non-GAAP financial measures. I kindly refer you to the forward-looking statement and other disclaimers as well as reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures contained in both the earnings release and corporate presentation. I understand it's a busy morning, so thank you again for taking the time to listen to our call.","Now, I'll turn it over to Tim.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning. Thanks again for joining us on this busy morning. By now, you've heard many metaphors describing the commodity price environment from choppy waters to rough terrain. The backdrop we find ourselves in is volatile and dynamic but the Concho team has experience succeeding when prices are low.","We're building a company that can thrive at any point in the cycle. We consolidate high-quality properties in the Permian Basin and have an exceptional track record of profitably growing production, reserves and resource.","And while the past year has been challenging, we view the macro environment as an opportunity to extend our lead in the Permian and make our business stronger by focusing on what we can control, and strategically consolidating acreage in our core areas. We believe this approach enables Concho to deliver on our near-term objectives while providing our shareholders with a solid investment for long-term value creation.","From both an operational and a financial perspective, Concho delivered exceptional results for 2015, demonstrating the quality of our team and assets. As oil price continued its volatile and protracted decline, we reduced capital spending from initial budget of $3 billion to $2 billion. And we expected annual production growth to be less than 20%. We ended up delivering more with less.","Daily production volumes for 2015 increased 28%, with crude oil growing back 31%, while exploration and development capital totaled only $1.8 billion for the year. The results of our 2015 program highlight our improved capital efficiency driven by lower service costs, shorter cycle times, long laterals, and completion intensity.","I'm proud of how well that our operational teams performed given all the moving parts. Their focus drove better well performance across all our assets and resulted in per unit cost that were in line or below the low-end of our guidance range.","Proved reserves held steady despite the 50% decline in SEC prices used to calculate proved reserves. And we replaced 290% of production at a drill-bit finding cost of $11.66 per barrel.","We've been focused on the Permian for a long time. It's a resource-rich basin and our teams generate more economic drilling opportunities on our assets each year. Over the past two years, our drilling program has unlocked more resource as we convert vertical drilling locations to horizontal locations, derisk multizone potential, and successfully test denser well spacing.","In total, the captured resource for the company increased by 35% during 2015, to 5 billion BOEs including proved reserves. And we've identified approximately 18,000 horizontal drilling locations. Approximately, 30% of these locations earn a 20% or greater rate of return at a flat $40 oil price. This is a function of moving down the cost curve, refining our drilling and completion techniques, and improving well performance.","Given our focus on acquiring the best assets and development efforts, each of our core areas contributed to expanding our resource potential. In the Northern Delaware Basin, results from our drilling program, optimizing completion techniques and down spacing increased our inventory.","We also made significant progress in the Southern Delaware Basin and in the Midland Basin. In both areas, field infrastructure improved our economics. And in the Southern Delaware we \u2013 derisking the play combined with acreage trades and acquisitions, expanded our long-lateral drilling inventory and increased our confidence in the growth potential of this asset. Our enthusiasm for the New Mexico Shelf hasn't waned. Horizontal results surpassed expectations. These low cost shallow opportunities have some of the best economics in our portfolio.","And while we've had success at defining and expanding our resource base, we're drilling at a slower pace. We reduced our activity level over the course of 2015 such that our cash flow exceeded drilling and completion capital by approximately $225 million in the second half of the year.","With capital activity aligned with the lower commodity price environment, a premier asset base, a robust hedge position, and a strong balance sheet, we're approaching 2016 with confidence that we can continue to take advantage of the current environment. And the strategy we've executed in the second half of 2015 is what you're going to see from us in 2016 as low commodity prices continue to demand capital discipline and patience.","We believe oil prices will ultimately move higher, but for now we remain committed to a plan of balancing our entire capital spend excluding potential acquisitions within estimated cash flow. This is a strategy that's been successful for Concho. It will maintain our financial strength and preserve our high quality inventory through this down cycle.","We've lowered our 2016 capital plan from a base budget of $1.4 billion to a range of $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion. The current capital plan for 2016 represents a 35% reduction compared to 2015.","Our production outlook for 2016 is driven by timing and transitioning to full field development. The last two years we've grown production at a compound rate of 25% annually. In the second half of 2015, we significantly reduced operating activity and will again reduce activity in 2016. Importantly, over the past two years our drilling program successfully defined multi-zone potential broadly across our operating areas resulting in substantial resource discovery.","As we look to further increase the efficiency of our ongoing development program, a substantial portion of our 2016 program will utilize pad drilling and long lateral development. The combined effect of exceptional growth over the past two years followed by a slowdown in activity and transition to pad drilling will have a more pronounced impact on \u2013 in 2016. But we'll continue to demonstrate our ability to deliver capital-efficient growth over the long term.","Based on the current market outlook for commodity prices and continuing to spend within cash flow, we expect to deliver double-digit production growth in 2017. Let me say that again. Based on the current market outlook for commodity prices and continuing to spend within cash flow, we expect to deliver double-digit production growth in 2017. Importantly, our plan is flexible, and we're keeping both hands on the steering wheel as we navigate the volatility. We have a strong track record of delivering growth, and by staying committed to a strong balance sheet and preserving our inventory rather than growing volumes and depleting our resource in a weak price environment, we will be uniquely positioned to grow when conditions improve.","Acquiring high-quality assets in the Permian is a key component of our strategy. Given the capital chasing acreage in the Permian, property values remain high, but our acquisition efforts in 2015 were disciplined, targeted, and privately negotiated. We acquired interest in bolt-on acreage to our core areas. These acquisitions expanded our long lateral drilling inventory and enhanced the overall value of our portfolio.","Our operational expertise in the Permian is a technical advantage when evaluating acquisitions. We couple this expertise with discipline. We're looking to consolidate the right assets at the right price, at the right time. Our team evaluated a lot of opportunities and demonstrated their ability to move on the best deals with the most positive strategic impact.","We have a deep inventory of drilling projects. At today's drilling pace and current environment, we have more than two decades of inventory that generate competitive rates of return and growth. The depth and quality of our inventory sets a high bar for future acquisitions. The opportunities we evaluate have to compete with the best projects in our portfolio. Our recently announced transactions achieved this objective. The acreage trade and asset acquisition coupled with the asset sale in Loving County high-graded our drilling program, increased our exposure to the best part of the Southern Delaware Basin while also strengthening our balance sheet.","Having a strong balance sheet is a key component of our strategy, which continues to serve us well. Recently, our debt ratings were reaffirmed at both S&P and Moody's. I'm also proud to report that Concho was added to the S&P 500 last Friday. Concho's addition to the S&P 500 is a testament to the hard work and dedication of our team. Together, we've grown Concho into a leading E&P company operating in one of the most prolific oil basins in the world.","Despite the uncertain backdrop, our strategy and our team enable Concho to thrive. We've demonstrated our ability to rapidly grow production. We have a great asset base and a great machine. The commodity price environment is uncertain, but we believe we can continue to build value through the cycle by keeping a strong balance sheet, prudently investing in the business, and staying disciplined in order to take advantage of unique opportunities.","I appreciate your continued confidence in Concho. Now, let me turn the call back over to the moderator, and I look forward to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Arun Jayaram from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good morning. I wanted to first start off in the Midland Basin, Tim. It looks like your increasing the mix of spending towards the Midland Basin. I know that historically you've drilled perhaps shorter laterals despite your blocky acreage position. But sound like you're moving towards 10,000 foot laterals. I was wondering if you could perhaps comment on why you're increasing your CapEx here, and just maybe thoughts of your overall Midland Basin acreage, because it seems to be in the core of the core.","Jack F. Harper - Executive Vice President","Yeah, Arun, this is Jack. Thank you. We are increasing our capital allocation to the Midland Basin, and that's a culmination of learnings, infrastructure and our ability to really have a full program with these long laterals. And so I would expect a continuation of that.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And have you done, Jack, any 10,000-foot lateral completions quite yet, or is this on the come as we think about the 2016 program?","Jack F. Harper - Executive Vice President","Yeah, we have.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And any just thoughts on how wells are looking? Just maybe some color around that?","Jack F. Harper - Executive Vice President","Yeah. We're happy with the efficiencies and the results we're seeing from those. It's at or better than our expectations.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I would add there that in previous quarters we talked about allocating more of our capital on a percentage basis to the Midland Basin, and I think this program does that, and will continue to do that.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Fair enough. And just \u2013 obviously a pretty provocative comment on the 2017 growth, double digits within cash flows. So I was just wondering if you could maybe give us a little bit more color around that, because that's quite a bit higher than the Street. Is this just well productivity? You talked a little bit about the DUCs. And also I just wanted to say, is this at the strip? Today, the oil price is $42. As you think about the 2017 strip, or what oil price are you thinking about when talking about double-digit growth in 2017?","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, we were talking about at the strip. And I would tell you, I wanted to add that color because I didn't want 2016 to be misinterpreted. I mean, we're doing some really good things right now in 2016, and as timing is a big effect on when we do, when your time slices and look at the production growth within those time slices. So we're really encouraged by what we're seeing in our field right now.","And 2017 tells you a lot about what's going on in 2016 that you might not be able to see just from looking at production growth in this one year time slice.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Fair enough. If I could sneak one more in. You guys talked about some disruptions in the first quarter regarding weather in Midstream. Is this just a kind of a Q1 impact or could there be any lingering impact as we think about Q2?","Jack F. Harper - Executive Vice President","Yeah, Arun. As we know it today, there may be some modest impact in the second quarter, but really the main impact should be in the first quarter.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you very much, gentlemen.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Singer from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. Good morning.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","When you look at the cost declines and efficiencies that you have seen, and you think about potentially going back to double-digit growth at the strip, do you view the cost declines \u2013 or what percent of the cost declines and efficiencies that you see do you view as secular? And also as you and potentially others in the Permian think about ramping up again, what is your level of confidence that the service infrastructure will be there in full force?","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think that the cost declines that we've seen up to this point \u2013 the scenario we're talking about going forward where oil's at the strip, I think all those cost declines you maintain those throughout that business cycle. And so, I think the cost efficiency that we've achieved \u2013 and I expect it to get better, I think there are still ways that we can improve our cost structure. What was the other question?","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","The services infrastructure, and whether you think that that will be in full force as you and others start to ramp up again if oil prices improve.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I do think that in the service sector there is a large amount of destruction of capacity from smaller companies and smaller operators. And I think that scale is going to be important and that's why I think that we have an advantage by running one of the larger programs and so, I think, the services will be there for the companies that have been there through this cycle.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. And then can you give us any further color on down spacing in both the Midland Basin and the Northern and Southern Delaware Basin? And then what the \u2013 any plans and plans (23:18) for testing that would be here in 2016?","Jack F. Harper - Executive Vice President","Yeah. Brian, we are down spacing in all of the areas. In fact, about 40% of our budget this year is related to some form of down spacing. So, yes, we're continuing what we've done over the last few years.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Can you add any color on the specific spacing that you think could be \u2013 you could come out of the year with greater clarity on in both basins? And whether you expect any communication?","Jack F. Harper - Executive Vice President","Yeah. In terms of the way we're drilling wells and counting inventory, we're not assuming anything more dense than eight wells across at this point.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. And how aggressive do you expect to test this year?","Jack F. Harper - Executive Vice President","Relative to the size of our budget, I feel like it's a pretty aggressive program.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","No. I'm sorry. To what level of spacing? So, if you're eight wells per section now, do you plan to test down to 16, or to what level?","Jack F. Harper - Executive Vice President","Yeah. Eight this year and we'll \u2013 next year, if there's anything to talk about beyond that, we'll talk about it then.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Hall from Heikkinen Energy. Your line is now open.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Thanks. Good morning.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","I was just wondering can perhaps a little more detail around the new disclosures on your resource. You've highlighted 30% of inventory generating greater than 20% RORs at $40 oil. Can you kind of bracket the remaining inventory as to where the returns are at higher oil thresholds?","Jack F. Harper - Executive Vice President","Yeah Michael, this is Jack. I think \u2013 without going into a lot of detail, I think if you get into the $60 a barrel, $70 a barrel range, you'd probably capture most of it. If that's kind of the book-end you're looking for.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Yeah. That's helpful. And if we we're to look at those four regions, sub-regions that you provide, how would those rank in terms of kind of weighted average returns across Northern Delaware, Southern Delaware, Midland, and New Mexico Shelf?","Jack F. Harper - Executive Vice President","Yeah. We're fortunate that we have all four areas have returns that compete and compete down at this price level. So, it's relatively proportionate to the inventory.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Okay. And on the 2017 commentary, one more question around that. What sort of PDP, base PDP declines are assumed within the 2016 and 2017 outlooks?","Jack F. Harper - Executive Vice President","Oh, Michael it's in that high 20 percentage range, plus or minus.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","So, not a material reduction in base, I guess, as we think about 2017 versus 2016?","Jack F. Harper - Executive Vice President","Not material. I mean, maybe modest, but I don't see a material change.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Okay. And then last one on my end was just around M&A generally in the Permian. I'm just curious, we hear a lot about how eager the buy side of the market is given the remaining amounts of capital still looking at the region. But I'm just curious on your perspectives on the seller side. Are you seeing any \u2013 or are you aware of any signs of, let's say emerging distress in the current environment that might help narrow up that bid\/ask after this latest leg down?","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, in this environment I think everybody in distressed.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Relative degrees of distress.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","That's right. I think Concho is \u2013 not all assets are created equal. So we're focused on kind of what we believe are the fairways in the Permian. And I think we have something unique to offer in our ability to offer participation going forward as we did in this last trade, I think we're a pretty good partner.","And so, I think that gives us an advantage. And we've drilled a lot of wells before. We've got strong opinions about where we ought to be drilling. So in general though you're going to see a lot of activity in the Permian basin. There is \u2013 people have started talking about it in terms of tier one, tier two, tier three acreage and things like that. And clearly, I think that we have been focused on accumulating tier one acreage. And that's going to be where our focus is going forward.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Okay. Well, good luck. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Smith from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.","Jason Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey. Good morning, everyone. Tim, so maybe just to follow-on to Michael's question. You talked a lot about being a consolidator in the M&A market. But you also have a pretty big inventory that is economic at fairly low prices. You sold some assets in January. So is that a strategy we should expect you to continue down as well? And if so, are there any specific areas that we would expect you to focus divestitures on?","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Portfolio management is something you ought to expect us to continue to do. And you're aware of where our tier one and sweet spots are. So everything outside of that is on the table for being traded or high graded, I don't know how you want to think about it, but that's the way our portfolio management will look going forward.","Jason Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. And in terms of just HBP requirements in 2016, is there any acreage at this point that you might let go?","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I mean, not just in this period, but throughout our history, there's always acreage that's expiring because we elect not to drill it for one reason or another, so there's always a component of that. If you look at our capital budget though, we have a great amount of flexibility on how we allocate our capital, and a very small amount of our capital budget this year has to be dedicated to things to perpetuate acreage.","Jason Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. Thanks. And last one for me is just in the Yeso, it looks like you saw a pretty big sequential improvement in those well results. Is there anything you guys did on the completion side there, is it just a certain area you drilled geographically. What was driving that big improvement?","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","It's all those things. It's the way we complete the wells and extending the boundaries of the play. So, it's \u2013 we've talked for a long time, that's an exciting area, multi-zone, lots of oil still in the oil column, horizontal drilling is an application that unlocks new oil potential there. So, that's a \u2013 it's a great area.","Jason Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks guys, I appreciate it.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Neal Dingmann from SunTrust. Your line is now open.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Good morning, guys. Say, Tim, if I could just add one more on to the M&A question. I mean you guys did mention about, and I agree with you, about the number distressed companies out there, and certainly you guys have a well-above average financials. Your thoughts not only in the Permian, but would you could consider looking outside at another basin if the price is right or being an accretive acquisition?","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think there's so many opportunities in the Permian and we carry such an advantage here. I think that focusing outside the Permian would be taking our eye off the ball to some extent. We've talked in the past though that sometimes you end up getting some other assets that come with Permian assets, that hasn't really changed. But clearly, we talk about Concho in terms of being a Permian Basin company \u2013 a Permian-Basin-focused company.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","That make sense. And then just one last one if I could. You mentioned about just the progress you're seeing definitely in the Midland, obviously a lot of the extended reaches depend also on that Southern Del. Your thoughts on how much you guys are targeting, specifically more in \u2013 in just in that Northern Harpoon acquisition area that you added not terribly long ago?","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I mean, North Harpoon is some of the best return we're drilling within the company. Locking up acreage is very important there. We've got lots of running room. So, it competes with anything we have. We like that. We've signaled in past quarters that that was an area we liked and we would continue to add to it.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Very good. Thanks for the time Tim.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from David Tameron from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning. I want to ask you, Tim, about selling the Midland.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I remember you.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Question for you. A couple of things. One, you've talked a lot about the costs and people have been focused on the service side. Could you talk about \u2013 and, I think, we talked about this last fall. But as far as all the ancillary services, trucking, I guess, internal wages there, just can you talk about that that side of things as far as G&A. Absent attrition in head count, have you started seeing that pressure? Has that come to the numbers yet or is that just not pertinent?","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I'm going to make Jack answer your question.","Jack F. Harper - Executive Vice President","Yeah, David. I mean, we're focusing on cost all throughout our business. G&A, of course, LOE as well. And I think your question was relative to us but I think the entire industry including the service side is having those same conversations.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. So, I mean, has it started to show up a little bit as far as the trucker \u2013 what we used before was the truckers making $120,000 or whatever that number is. Is he still making that same or has that start to come in a little bit?","Jack F. Harper - Executive Vice President","Yeah. I think you're starting to see that come in a bit in across the service sector as they're competing for less work.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Okay. Just one more follow-up. As we think about the potential ramp on the backend, Tim, if you say tomorrow, hey I want to put additional rig in the field, what's the lead time now before you start to see that production? Just given where we're at today versus a couple years ago, what's that look like?","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","We've always talked about how we didn't think that people well understood the cycle time from how long it took \u2013 from the time you hit the button that said I want to deploy capital to how long it takes for the cash flow to actually show up on your balance sheet.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Yeah.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think that time period is lengthening because pad drilling and other things like longer laterals, all that, the economics are better but the time cycles are lengthened and I think that's an important component that will work its way through all the models and things like that.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","So, I mean if it was three to four months, a few years back, I mean, is it now closer to a six, I think six to nine months.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I don't know if I'd say nine months, but I think directionally you're in the ballpark.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. All right. That's all I got, thanks.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Jack F. Harper - Executive Vice President","Thanks David.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from David Deckelbaum from KeyBanc. Your line is now open.","David A. Deckelbaum - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Morning, Tim and Jack and everyone. Thanks for taking my questions.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Morning.","David A. Deckelbaum - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","A lot of people have asked some good questions on plans especially going into 2017. Just trying to get a sense of how that builds up. Can you outline how many completions you actually intend to do in 2016 and what that cadence looks like throughout the year?","Jack F. Harper - Executive Vice President","Yeah. It's going to be pretty steady with the number of wells drilled. So, that's kind of plus or minus 200 for the year, and I think balanced pretty equally throughout the quarters.","David A. Deckelbaum - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. Thanks for that. And then, on the \u2013 your updated guidance, you're pointing to, I think, 60% to 64% oil mix in 2016. And when I look where you're drilling, it doesn't seem to be a huge shift in the zones that you're targeting or the oil cuts there. Is that more of a function of just a lack of activity at the back half of 2015 and lack of initial completions coming into the beginning of the year that would drive that down? Or are there some other projects that you're working on or other infrastructure constraints that I'm not thinking about?","Jack F. Harper - Executive Vice President","No David, you said it exactly right. It is a function of lower activity, and just beginning to have more new production over the next couple of years should modestly pick that back up.","David A. Deckelbaum - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Got it. And then, the last one from me is just you talked about, I think, the increase in lateral length going to almost 7,000 feet on average in 2016. What's the increase in pad size, or what will be the average pad size that you have in 2016? And in your development plans, does that get a bit larger as you make it through the year going into 2017?","Jack F. Harper - Executive Vice President","Yeah. The average pad is going to be from two to four typically, David. And I think we talked about the progression up to about 40% pad drilling this year compared to less than half of that last year. And so I think you'll continue to see that type of progression.","David A. Deckelbaum - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","All right. Thanks, Jack. That's all for me.","Jack F. Harper - Executive Vice President","You bet.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeffrey Campbell from Tuohy Brothers. Your line is now open.","Jeffrey Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Good morning. I want to go back to the 2017 growth guidance again and just make sure that I understand, completely understand the message. Are we talking about an unhedged strip price and that's sort of a water line for more activity in 2017, or is there something more to it than that?","Jack F. Harper - Executive Vice President","Well, what we're talking about is the current strip price with the benefit of any hedges we have in place.","Jeffrey Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Okay, fine. Thank you, that's helpful. Slide 11 highlighted advancing the Lower Spraberry program. I was just wondering if you could add some color on where you're going to concentrate your drilling within a pretty large portfolio, and also what kind of average lateral lengths you're looking for.","Jack F. Harper - Executive Vice President","Yeah. I mean, the activity is going to be focused in Midland and Upton counties primarily. And average lateral length there is going to be over 9,000 feet for the year.","Jeffrey Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thank you. You mentioned that pad completions are going to affect production timing. I was just wondering, what's the average number of wells that's going to be on a 2016 pad? And are these all going to be a new pads, or will there be some existing production on some of these pads?","Jack F. Harper - Executive Vice President","Yeah. The average number of wells on a pad again is going to \u2013 it's going to range between 2 and 4 this year.","Jeffrey Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Okay. And with regard to the timing, is it \u2013 are there going to be some pads where there's already some pre-existing wells on there and they're going to have to be shut in, or you mainly targeting building new pads?","Jack F. Harper - Executive Vice President","Oh, it's a combination. I mean, we always \u2013 in the course of our normal business, you \u2013 there are wells shut in for completions and things like that. But I don't know that it's any more than normal.","Jeffrey Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Okay. And my last question was, what are the focus zones in the Pecos swap and in the North Harpoon acquisition areas?","Jack F. Harper - Executive Vice President","Our activity there has been primarily focused in the Wolfcamp.","Jeffrey Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Okay. And, I guess, one thing I was curious about is does the North Harpoon have any Bone Spring exposure? Maybe not for 2016, but maybe at some point in the future?","Jack F. Harper - Executive Vice President","That's certainly a zone that other operators and Concho have done some work on. So, the short answer is yes.","Jeffrey Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thanks. I appreciate all the color.","Jack F. Harper - Executive Vice President","You bet.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ryan Oatman from Cowen. Your line is now open.","Ryan Oatman - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Ryan Oatman - Cowen & Co. LLC","Most of my questions have been asked and answered, but I just wanted to get a quick sense on infrastructure and differentials. Gas differentials guided a little bit wider in 2016. Can you just speak to that? And then maybe a little bit broader here on sort of the capital outlay that you have for the Alpha Crude Connector and other infrastructure items? Just remind me of how that trends and how that sort of changes, 2015, 2016 into 2017 and beyond? Thanks.","Jack F. Harper - Executive Vice President","Yeah. Sure. On the gas, differential's really tied to NGL pricing. So, improvement there would lead to better gas price realization. As far as the infrastructure spend on ACC and any other projects, 2016 spending is relatively similar to 2015 as we finish out that project and some other Midstream investment that will result in over 80% of our oil being on pipe. And so, as we look forward beyond that, I don't expect the same level of spending on Midstream into 2017.","Ryan Oatman - Cowen & Co. LLC","Got you. Very helpful. Thanks. That's it.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from James Sullivan from Alembic Global Advisors. Your line is now open.","James Sullivan - Alembic Global Advisors LLC","Hey, guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. If I could go back just very quickly to the 2017 growth, and obviously, I appreciate you guys don't want to go into too much detail on this. But when I think about the things that could drive the growth rate higher, obviously, I'm thinking about moderating base decline. You do have the strip five or six bucks higher, whatever it might be, productivity gains, DUCs rolling off of older service contracts. There's a lot of things, but you guys have said that you don't think base decline, I think in answering an earlier question, would be a major factor, nor DUC's productivity gains might be something. Could you kind of rank order what are the things that are allowing you to grow, given the base decline is not going to be a major factor, grow at so much higher a rate in 2017 versus 2016?","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Let me take a stab at that one, because I do think base decline is a factor. And I wouldn't \u2013 I'm going to say, there's not a major factor, there's a combination of a bunch of things. And we would be growing today at that rate if it weren't for the timing of slowing down at the end of the second half of last year. And so, we're not projecting any change of the circumstance that changes the returns on these wells. So, it's just \u2013 it's a function of timing.","And then as you say, the cash flow's modeled in from the commodity price at the strip, the base decline, the timing of things like the pad drilling and the wells we're going to be drilling yield that kind of growth that we would expect in 2017.","James Sullivan - Alembic Global Advisors LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks. That's good color. Just a very quick modeling question, so from macro to micro here. You guys had suggested on previous calls that with ACC coming on line oil realizations would improve with trucking cost falling. Your guidance for oil realizations was flattish, I think, year-on-year for about $4 off TI. Can you just remind me, is the gathering, the trucking cost or pipe cost, is that reflected in the realization or is that coming out as an expense line item?","Jack F. Harper - Executive Vice President","No. It is reflected in the realization and you will \u2013 as we add more barrels throughout the first half of the year on to that pipeline system, you will see continued benefit from that. One bit of noise going on in a way in the details here is the pricing mechanism used to bring a futures price back to a spot price is negatively impacted when you have a contango market like we do now versus last year where the market was backwardated most of the year and you had a positive benefit. So, that creates a little noise, but we are seeing the benefits from ACC, and will continue to throughout the year.","James Sullivan - Alembic Global Advisors LLC","Okay. Great. So, it's not exactly ratable for the year, it sounds like what you're saying (44:51).","Jack F. Harper - Executive Vice President","That's right.","James Sullivan - Alembic Global Advisors LLC","All right. One just real quick last one, and I think I know the answer to this. But you guys have an op, non-op breakdown in the Southern Delaware. I know that with the consolidation, you guys are in the driver seat where you want to be, but just thinking about the overall position. Do you guys have a rough breakdown on what's non-op over there?","Jack F. Harper - Executive Vice President","Yeah. There is very little if any non-op embedded in our plan right now in the Southern Delaware.","James Sullivan - Alembic Global Advisors LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks, guys. I appreciate the answers.","Jack F. Harper - Executive Vice President","Okay.","Operator","Thank you. And I'm showing no further questions from our phone lines. I would now like the conference back over to Tim Leach for any closing remarks.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","All right. Thank you.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this conference call may be recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Ms. Megan Hays. Ma'am, you may begin.","Megan P. Hays - Concho Resources, Inc.","Thank you. Good morning and welcome to Concho's third quarter 2018 earnings call. Our earnings release and corporate presentation are available on our website, and we plan to file our quarterly report on Form 10-Q today after market close.","Participants on today's call will make forward-looking statements based on current expectations this morning. Also, some of our comments may reference non-GAAP financial measures. Forward-looking statement and other disclaimers, as well as reconciliations to the nearest corresponding GAAP metrics are in our earnings release and corporate presentation.","I'm joined this morning in Midland by Tim Leach, Chairman and CEO; Jack Harper, President and CFO; Will Giraud, Executive Vice President; and members of the Concho senior management team. Following their prepared remarks, we will take your questions.","Now, let me turn the call over to Tim.","Timothy A. Leach - Concho Resources, Inc.","Thanks, Megan. Good morning. Well, the Permian continues to be as busy as ever, November oil production is forecasted to be 3.5 million barrels a day, up 26% year-over-year, and accounting for 60% of the total U.S. production growth this year. Costs have started to stabilize as the industry awaits new long haul pipe capacity before increasing activity.","The basin continues to have the largest U.S. rig count at 490 rigs, but rig additions have slowed. At the same time, the drilled but uncompleted backlog has reached new highs and will likely be a catalyst for activity once the new pipeline projects are completed.","The Midland discount to Cushing's WTI has narrowed as capacity may come online sooner than previously expected. The futures curve indicates that Midland barrels will be priced at a premium WTI in 2020 and beyond. The dynamic backdrop reinforces the advantage of scale, running a big stable program and being headquartered in the middle of the action.","Third quarter was another strong quarter for Concho. Results include partial quarter contribution from the RSP acquisition. As a result, we won't go through the normal comparisons against prior periods as they won't be especially meaningful.","This was a busy quarter. We made investments of approximately $760 million in our high-return inventory and once again fully funded our drilling program within cash flow. Production for the quarter was 287,000 Boes per day, exceeding the high end of our guidance range. Additionally, the RSP transaction was completed in July and the teams are now fully integrated.","We started transitioning the development of these assets to large-scale manufacturing mode in line with the rest of our portfolio. We've previously discussed the significant advantages created by the efficiencies and growth we can achieve through these large-scale projects. Jack will provide more color on this shortly, but the shift in our capital program for next year demonstrates our focus on bringing more large-scale development across our portfolio, including the RSP acreage.","Over the past several years, we've effectively managed our business to best position Concho for future cycles, fuel long-term growth and consistently expand returns to shareholders. This focus has included growing oil production within cash flow, optimizing the development of our resource, reducing our cost structure, and strengthening our asset base with acquisitions, divestitures and trades.","All of this has led to a compelling outlook for free cash flow generation and strong oil growth. There's growth for the sake of growth and then there's value-driven growth. We believe we've delivered value-driven growth over the past decade. Over that period, our business model was to estimate our cash flow and determine our investment level with production growth as an output.","In recent quarters, we've guided you to the evolution of this model. We said that a new model was on horizon for Concho and our industry. RSP accelerates it. We're well-positioned to deliver on a model that provides competitive oil growth, a dividend to our shareholders and free cash flow.","And with the free cash flow, we'll have the flexibility to make additional returns to shareholders, reinforce our balance sheet and play offense. Consistent with this framework, we plan to proceed with disciplined growth of our capital program, easing into larger programs to optimize the reinvestment rate on our assets and maximize corporate returns, all while generating significant free cash flow.","For 2019, the capital outlook is a range of $3.4 billion to $3.6 billion. We used $55 to $60 oil as a starting point to plan activity based on our view that we expect more volatility, not less in oil prices. We think it's better for our people, our partners on the service side and the efficiency of our program to be a steady ship. Planning in this range allows us to prudently step up our capital spend, deliver efficient oil growth, provide shareholders a return of capital and have free cash flow upside.","As part of this plan, we'll make significant progress in moving RSP's assets to large-scale development because this is the most efficient way to deploy capital and it creates the greatest value for our shareholders. And I believe the plan positions the company to deliver significant oil growth in 2019, while setting up an even stronger 2020 for Concho.","Further, our financial strength and outlook for free cash flow drives our plans to initiate a regular quarterly dividend beginning in the first quarter of 2019. The indicated annual rate is $0.50 per share and it signals our confidence in the outlook of our business and the strength of our machine today and confidence in our outlook for us to return additional free cash flow to shareholders as an increasingly meaningful part of our overall investment thesis over the long-term.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Jack to discuss the quarter in more detail.","Jack F. Harper - Concho Resources, Inc.","Thank you, Tim. Third quarter results highlight our ability to deliver profitable growth, while not only integrating the largest acquisition in our history, but also navigating regional headwinds like the Midland-Cushing differential.","Operationally, we're extremely pleased with the execution and efficiency we delivered in the quarter. Production totaled 287,000 Boes per day and oil production averaged 185,000 barrels per day. Controllable cash costs also look good and we continue to demonstrate the momentum of our business with solid earnings and cash flow generation.","In the third quarter, adjusted net income per share was $1.42 and the EBITDAX was $829 million. As Tim highlighted, our capital spending, excluding acquisitions, was fully funded by our cash flow. This is the 12th quarter out of the past 13 quarters where our cash flow exceeded our drilling and completion capital, generating approximately $630 million in free cash flow over this period. Most of that free cash flow was used to reduce debt, and as a result, our balance sheet and leverage ratio are strong, following the RSP acquisition.","We discussed the liability management actions we took regarding RSP's debt last quarter, which reduced annual interest expense by $15 million. At the end of the quarter, our annualized leverage ratio was 1.2 times. It wasn't too long ago that we described an inflection point in our business as we leaned into resource optimization. At that time, the emerging trend was multi-well pad projects and we predicted that a time would come when we would spend most of our capital budget on projects.","On slide 9, we illustrate the three key levers for 2019 development program. First, approximately 80% of capital will be allocated to large-scale projects, up from two-thirds of our capital in 2018. And we're quickly advancing RSP's assets to manufacturing mode. 70% of the activity on RSP acreage will be projects, up from 25% in 2018.","Second, we continue to capture efficiencies through longer laterals. Last year, our program averaged 8,000 feet, but our portfolio high-grading efforts and asset swaps are enabling us to push beyond that, especially in New Mexico. Our average lateral length for the entire program will increase 20% next year to 9,700 feet.","And third, we plan to run approximately 34 rigs and expect to drill more than 400 wells over the course of the year with the activity roughly even between the first and second half of 2019. We currently forecast that more wells will be put on production in the second half of 2019. And as a result, we expect strong 2019 exit rate with fourth quarter 2019 oil production expected to be 25% higher than the fourth quarter of 2018. This is significant as the fourth quarter of 2018 will include a full quarter of RSP activity.","To summarize, in 2019, we plan to allocate more capital to large-scale, long lateral development than ever before, and the results on our production, cash flow and corporate returns is significant. And the key measures for gauging our success will be free cash flow, return on capital employed and production growth per debt-adjusted share. These metrics better define how we're thinking about the next stage of our business, disciplined, high-margin oil growth and capital returns to shareholders.","I'm proud of our performance and the team behind the results. In addition to closing and integrating RSP, the team has delivered some of the best performance in the company's history. They are the reason Concho continues to drive growth and value for our shareholders, and they're all focused on continuing our momentum.","With that, we'll open it up to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And our first question comes from John Freeman from Raymond James. Your line is open.","John A. Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Good morning, guys.","Timothy A. Leach - Concho Resources, Inc.","Morning, John.","John A. Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","First question I've got kind of following up on Jack said, especially on the lateral lengths, big step up of 20% increase in the average lateral length in 2019 versus 2018. And obviously, your 2019 CapEx budget would include that incremental cost. But in terms of the production guidance for 2019, should we assume that it's still based on kind of what the wells are doing on the 2018 program or is it including some uplift from the longer laterals?","Jack F. Harper - Concho Resources, Inc.","Sure. Well, said another way, I think you're asking, does it embed some greater efficiencies than we're seeing in 2018, and the answer is no. The efficiency is in the more large projects and more longer lateral development, which in and of itself is a more efficient way to go about our business. So, in that respect, yes.","John A. Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. And then just the follow-up I've got on looking at the \u2013 this kind of evolution of the model in this \u2013 the 2019-2020 outlook, impressive growth in ROCE, very impressive out in 2020. And I guess I'm just thinking about when you all think about the free cash flow, however, you all want to characterize it in terms of an absolute basis or like a free cash flow yield, how we should sort of think about the balance of that free cash flow in terms of dividend growth versus, as you all kind of phrase it on slide 7, portfolio enhancement because obviously the balance sheet is already in good shape? Just sort of how you all are thinking about that.","Timothy A. Leach - Concho Resources, Inc.","Yeah, John. Well, I think that as we think about the company going out into the future, being able to grow our oil production, deliver capital returns to shareholders and do all of that efficiently, I mean, that's the new business model. So, what do you do with the additional free cash flow that comes in? We kind of outlined the options that will be in front of the company in terms of returning more cash to shareholders in different forms, whether it's special dividends or stock buybacks or increasing the existing dividend. You have all those options in front of you, but also strengthening your balance sheet and continuing to play offense on the buying, selling and trading in and around our big core blocks of assets. All those things are in front of us and I think you'll see us do a little bit of all that.","John A. Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Sounds good. Thanks, Tim. Good job, guys.","Timothy A. Leach - Concho Resources, Inc.","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Hanold from RBC Capital. Your line is open.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks. Good morning.","Timothy A. Leach - Concho Resources, Inc.","Good morning.","Jack F. Harper - Concho Resources, Inc.","Good morning.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Just to follow up a little bit on that last question. When you look at the dividend, can you talk about like your thoughts and the strategy and more specifically, obviously, being a \u2013 one thing not in your control is commodity prices. So is there a point where \u2013 you mentioned special dividends, but are you always going to be careful not to put too much of a high recurring dividend in place just because of that volatility aspect?","Timothy A. Leach - Concho Resources, Inc.","Yeah. I think that as we discussed in the past, we're in a business \u2013 not only have we just discovered one of the largest reserves of oil in the world and that we are working on optimizing how to develop that, that's kind of job number one. But then, describing to our shareholders how they're going to profit from all this is really a big part of our business. So we still have all the things we talked about in the past. We have volatile commodities to deal with. We have the runoff rate of our PDP and all that to manage, but the outlook is so positive that we thought now that sending the signal that we see, growing free cash flow over time, this was the best time to initiate that. But, yeah, we have always valued flexibility and not locking us into anything that damages the company over the long term. We think what we're doing now is very sustainable and well within the balance of what we see going into the future.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Thanks for that. And as a follow-up question, in your outlook for 2019-2020, the thing that stood out to me was how the oil cuts increase over time. And it appears to me, and correct me if I'm wrong, but it goes up into the upper 60% range. And could you talk about what really causes that transition? Is it more focused on some of the RSP assets, which typically are much oilier or is there some gas flaring there that impacts it as well?","C. William Giraud - Concho Resources, Inc.","Hey, Scott. It's Will. It's really more of the former. It's a result of the allocation of capital to our assets, allocation to things that have higher oil cuts and then also an allocation to more of the RSP assets, which typically have a higher oil cut as well.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. That's what I thought. Appreciate it. Thanks.","Timothy A. Leach - Concho Resources, Inc.","Thank you, Scott.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Bob Morris from Citi. Your line is open. Please check that your line is not on mute. And we'll take our next question from Leo Mariani from National Alliance Securities. Your line is open.","Leo P. Mariani - National Alliance Securities LLC","Hey, guys. I just wanted to follow up a little bit on the comments around the CapEx budget. You guys talked about sort of a conservative price deck of $55 to $60 for 2019. I'm assuming that's WTI-Cushing price. And you obviously have the range of $3.4 billion to $3.6 billion. I just wanted to get a sense of how you guys might proceed if we did see further upside in the oil price or maybe we average something closer to the, I mean, 60s to 70s. Would you guys potentially elect to ratchet up that budget? And obviously, you've got the dividend now and you talked about buybacks. Just wanted to get a sense of how you would sort of manage that.","Timothy A. Leach - Concho Resources, Inc.","Yeah. Well, I've used a few key metaphors in my prepared remarks and a steady ship is one of them. And as we plan these larger programs, being a steady ship is what helps you create the highest efficiency. So, I think that if we see a higher oil price, which, quite frankly, we're kind of planning for that, that was the cash flow upside that we see in 2019. So, I guess, the answer is no. We wouldn't plan on changing our capital program based on near-term fluctuations in oil price.","Leo P. Mariani - National Alliance Securities LLC","Okay. So then, I guess uses of incremental cash flow if those were to come to light here in 2019. Is that more for some of the things you mentioned, such as special dividend and buyback? Is that more where that would be directed?","Timothy A. Leach - Concho Resources, Inc.","Exactly.","Leo P. Mariani - National Alliance Securities LLC","Okay, that's helpful. And I guess just wanted to get a better sense of how the RSPP acquisition is going on the integration side. I'm sure there's going to be further synergies and benefits to that over time. Can you maybe just kind of talk about how that process is going, kind of where you're at in the process? Is it still sort of early days? Do you expect to see more cost kind of knocked out as we work our way into next year? What can you tell us about that?","C. William Giraud - Concho Resources, Inc.","Sure. Leo, it's Will again. I think the RSP integration is going great. The team's done a really good job. I think the results you see for the company this quarter reflect that. We integrated the biggest asset and group of people we ever have and kind of kept on chugging. And so, everyone has done a great job. I think the strength of this 2019 and 2020 capital programs we put out reflect the integration of those assets and the strength of the combination.","Leo P. Mariani - National Alliance Securities LLC","All right. Thanks very much.","Timothy A. Leach - Concho Resources, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Drew Venker from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Drew Venker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Morning, everyone. Thank you for all the color. I think it's useful positioning of your new strategy. Thinking now partly about consolidation because the depressed valuation is across Wall Street, but also I think you're in a stronger position now from a cash flow standpoint. And you guys have highlighted portfolio enhancement as one of the prongs for uses of free cash flow. So can you just talk about how you might approach those sort of financing, if you have any appetite for even bolt-ons, but, I guess, also, if bigger acquisitions, do you have any interest, given the right circumstances how that might be funded?","Timothy A. Leach - Concho Resources, Inc.","I think the most important points on that question are to emphasize we got the acquisition we were looking for in the RSP transaction. So we got a very large swath of very blocky acreage all in the right spots. So that really accomplished a lot of goals as far as asset enhancement. And then \u2013 but we talk about a lot of blocking up, buying, selling and trading, and you can see the result of that in these longer laterals that we've been able to announce this year. Our asset base is more in line with this more efficient development. That's really, really important.","And so, going forward, the activity that you'll see from us will continue to be the blocking up, but that's typically kind of a \u2013 you sell some assets, you buy some assets and you trade some assets. It's not really a huge call on capital. And so, I think that's the way to think about it going forward.","Drew Venker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","That's all from me. Thanks, Tim.","Timothy A. Leach - Concho Resources, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Doug Leggate from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. Good morning, everybody.","Timothy A. Leach - Concho Resources, Inc.","Good morning.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Tim, I hate to hark on the cash flow and CapEx question, but I just wonder if I could touch on it a slightly differently way. Obviously, when you think about inflation and operational capability and maintaining efficiency with the rig additions that you've laid out for the next year or two, is there a kind of upside limit that you see to where you would want to spend within as it relates to the oil price to avoid unintended consequences on efficiencies or costs or something like that?","Timothy A. Leach - Concho Resources, Inc.","Okay. I think that's a really important question. I'm glad you asked that. And I think what you're asking about is how do you find the most efficient capital reinvestment rate on these assets. And clearly, the more work we do on it, there's a way to develop these things that optimizes returns, that optimizes recoveries and minimizes the effects of wells on the edge or parent-child relationship. There's a way to do that correctly. And I think we made great strides in the 2019 capital program, the 2018 capital program, and the way we've configured our assets.","So, I mentioned in my comments that we were kind of easing toward that optimal \u2013 trying to find that optimal rate of reinvesting capital in this set of assets. And I think there is a range. It may not be associated with our operational capabilities of how much capital can you go, how many wells can you frac, how many wells can you drill, I think it's more driven by the kind of assets we have. And that's really a key driver in capital allocation as well.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I know it's not an easy question to answer, so I appreciate you let me have another go at it. My follow-up is hopefully a quick one. It's kind of related, I guess, and it wraps together the post few months of having RSP under your belt now. I'm just wondering how you're feeling about the synergy targets that you laid out? And if I could layer into that, is there \u2013 when you talk about potentially using cash for bolt-ons to enhance your portfolio, is there another side to that as well, which is maybe letting some of the non-core acreage go? Just wondering if you could give a general roundup on this situation.","Timothy A. Leach - Concho Resources, Inc.","I think we're ahead of schedule. The whole value creation proposition on RSP was converting these assets to the kind of operational development that we do well as a company, and we're ahead of schedule on that. And so, we're feeling very confident and very pleased with the pace of the RSP integration into our system. So, the value creation that we estimated when we acquired RSP, I think is ahead of our expectations and so we feel very good about that.","Yeah, we've already demonstrated that we will sell assets that aren't strategic to this program going forward. We've sold several groups of outlier assets in our portfolio. Anything that's kind of sitting out by itself, if it can't be traded, or if it can't be blocked up with something else, is a candidate for rationalization.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Appreciate the answers, Tim. Thank you.","Timothy A. Leach - Concho Resources, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Neal Dingmann from SunTrust. Your line is open.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Morning, Tim, Jack, Will. Tim, I really like that slide you have in 12, where you really now just sort of throw out there and show us all the large-scale projects not only in progress but ahead. I guess my question on that is when I look at some of these future ones, let's just use the Taylor one that you have on there, particularly in the Del. Could you talk a bit about are you going to go after \u2013 would you try to do a little more some of the deeper basins that you haven't explored quite as much? I'm just trying to get a sense on, I get kind of what you and Jack were saying about the efficiencies you're seeing on these large projects. But I'm trying to figure out does that include a little bit of delineation around \u2013 in these projects as well as you kind of go after some additional zones.","C. William Giraud - Concho Resources, Inc.","Sure. Neal, it's Will.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Hi, Will.","C. William Giraud - Concho Resources, Inc.","This slide back here is really meant to continue the conversation we introduced last quarter about how we're doing these large scale projects kind of all over the asset base and give you guys a sense of timing. So this, I think, is just an update of those projects we announced last quarter.","Speaking specifically to the Taylor or maybe more broadly to all of these, we are definitely continuing to test additional zones, continuing to test spacing. The Taylor is really designed to test different benches of the Wolfcamp specifically, but there is still a fair amount of delineation and even discovery work to be done on our assets in the Permian. So it's interesting.","Timothy A. Leach - Concho Resources, Inc.","Go ahead.","C. William Giraud - Concho Resources, Inc.","We've talked about moving to the large-scale transition, but we will we will typically sneak an extra well or so into those projects if we can to test a new concept.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Makes a lot of sense. And then lastly, Tim, on your prepared remarks and certainly in some of your comments earlier, doesn't sound like you're too concerned about upcoming service cost. Kind of sounds like maybe perhaps they'll stay in line. I know I've asked you about this in the past. Would you think about \u2013 I know I've talked \u2013 heard, talked to some others that are locking in some rigs on a bit longer term contracts. People seem to be a little more concerned maybe on rig inflation than they are on fracs here in the \u2013 let's call it, for 2019. Could you all maybe just address, the drilling or the completion side, any concerns you might have there?","Timothy A. Leach - Concho Resources, Inc.","No, I think the drilling side of our business is one of the best parts of our business. And I think the way we have approached that in the past will continue. I mean, you can see that it doesn't require that much of a growth in rigs to accomplish all the future, not just for 2019 and 2020, but beyond. So, by drilling longer laterals and the spacing we're using, the efficiency and all that, you can get a whole lot more done. And we do have rigs that now are on six-month contracts or one-year contracts, but we do have kind of a portfolio approach on that, but I don't think you should expect us to \u2013 any change in strategy based on what we're seeing today. And yes, we have \u2013 any kind of estimates of future cost increases or anything like that are all baked into our plan and we feel very comfortable with it.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Great details. Thanks, guys.","Timothy A. Leach - Concho Resources, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Derrick Whitfield from Stifel. Your line is open.","Derrick Whitfield - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thanks. Good morning, all.","Timothy A. Leach - Concho Resources, Inc.","Good morning.","Derrick Whitfield - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Tim or Jack, regarding your 2019 and 2020 outlook, so are there any outsized infrastructure investments in 2019 or 2020 that would invalidate the crude mass of assuming approximately $100 million proppant to rig line in 2020?","Jack F. Harper - Concho Resources, Inc.","No. The infrastructure part of our budget is going to be in the same percentage range that it has always been, somewhere in that 6% to 10% of the capital typically. And so, no, it shouldn't impact the way we've allocated in the past.","Derrick Whitfield - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Got it. And perhaps for Will, with the understanding that you guys are still in the relatively early stages of large scale development, are there any generalizations you can make regarding efficiencies, gain or challenges experienced? I know that you guys recently talked about sequencing and timing in your Barclays presentation.","C. William Giraud - Concho Resources, Inc.","Sure. I mean, we continue to experiment with different completion designs, timing, spacing. There's still a lot of learning to be done there. But I mean, early benefits, I think I think you see it in 2019 and 2020 program and you see it in the confidence of making these average projects sizes bigger over time. We like what we're seeing. We like the benefits we get of efficiency with our vendors of concentrating that much activity in one spot. And we like the results we're getting out of them. So more to come.","Derrick Whitfield - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great. Thanks for taking my questions.","Timothy A. Leach - Concho Resources, Inc.","Thank you.","Jack F. Harper - Concho Resources, Inc.","Thanks, Derrick.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Charles Meade from Johnson Rice. Your line is open.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Good morning, Tim, to you and your team there. I want to kind of take another run at that theme that Derrick had on his last question. So, as you guys are transitioning to these large scale pads, are there \u2013 the efficiencies, I think you guys have done a good job explaining, and I think the market's on top of that. But are there any challenges that are emerging either ones that you anticipated or ones that you didn't anticipate that could lead to some non-obvious outcomes either in your CapEx profile quarter-to-quarter or your production ramp?","Jack F. Harper - Concho Resources, Inc.","Sure. Yes, these large scale projects, they really emphasize planning and planning ahead. And our team has done a good job of that. I think we're out in front, out here in the industry on this. So, yeah, there are midstream considerations, there's water delivery, there's water disposal, there's a lot of considerations, but \u2013 which typically can require up to a year of planning. And again, our team's doing a great job in managing that. And so, while there are challenges, we're up to it. And that is why we're increasing the percentage of capital towards this kind of projects.","Timothy A. Leach - Concho Resources, Inc.","I do think I would add to that that one of the results of this style of development is you can't really take a 12-month time slice and compare capital invested and results of that capital without looking at longer periods of time. And that's one of the reasons I think we just kind of introduced now, talking about two years. And a lot of the results from our 2019 capital investment, you're going to see in 2020 and beyond. And so, I think that's going to be a trend that you see going forward. It's just bigger time slices on these bigger projects.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","That makes sense, Tim. I appreciate that. And then, again, going \u2013 looking at that, the 2020 CapEx piece, and again, Derrick asked this one way. I'll try to ask it another. If we just \u2013 you gave a rig \u2013 average rig, running rigs in 2019 and 2020. If we just said \u2013 if we just took that ratio and applied to your 2019 capital budget, what would we be missing if we just use that simple math?","Jack F. Harper - Concho Resources, Inc.","That's a good starting point. A lot of things will happen between now and next year this time when we roll out our capital budget. So, really, the main items would just be the state of the industry and the state of activity out here. But as a basis, that's a good starting point.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","I appreciate the color. Thank you.","Timothy A. Leach - Concho Resources, Inc.","Thank you.","Jack F. Harper - Concho Resources, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeanine Wai from Barclays. Your line is open.","Jeanine Wai - Barclays","Hi, good morning, everyone.","Timothy A. Leach - Concho Resources, Inc.","Good morning.","Jack F. Harper - Concho Resources, Inc.","Morning.","Jeanine Wai - Barclays","In terms of the forward plan and just following up on some of your comments and some of the prior questions, you're forecasting free cash flow in 2019 and 2020 and you mentioned a few times Concho being more of a steady ship and not changing activity in terms of relation to oil prices, and that makes sense on the upside, but can we just discuss a little bit about the downside? So, for example, if oil prices or service costs, or whatever else, move against you, you prioritizing, preserving whatever amount of free cash flow you've committed to at that $55 to $60 WTI level or do you instead maintain activity and then let kind of their free cash flow float, and the floor is just really staying within cash flow including the dividend.","Jack F. Harper - Concho Resources, Inc.","Well, I think just going back over the last 10 or 11 years as a public company, you've seen the way we've behaved. We've been through a lot of ups and downs with commodity price and capital costs. And so, I think you would see us behave in a similar kind of disciplined and prudent way. Clearly, our dividend is a priority. And so if the consequence of lower price is lower production growth over a year or two, that's fine.","Jeanine Wai - Barclays","Okay. And are you able to ballpark how much free cash flow you're forecasting in 2019 and 2020 at your price deck?","Jack F. Harper - Concho Resources, Inc.","Yes, we can.","Jeanine Wai - Barclays","Okay, great. Keep us guessing. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Hall from Heikkinen Energy. Your line is open.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Thanks. Appreciate the time. Yeah. There continues to be a lot of discussion about impacts of bounded versus unbounded well productivity on these pads in the Permian. What are you guys seeing on that front? And I guess how are you contemplating kind of parent-child relationships in the plan you've laid out? And how might that evolve as you think about moving more and more to these larger scale projects?","C. William Giraud - Concho Resources, Inc.","Sure. Big driver on going to these large scale projects are; one, we think maximizing the resource by minimizing the impact of the parent-child effect; and then also getting the benefits on the capital side from efficiency. So those are kind of the two big drivers behind going to project development.","As it relates to kind of what we're seeing compared to what we're expecting, we have built our type curves and our internal modeling based upon the results we have seen here. So I think everything we've seen has been consistent with what we were expecting and has baked into that outlook that we're talking about for 2019 and 2020.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Okay. And do you have a kind of estimate of \u2013 kind of how you think about or how your programming in the relationship between single-well pad development versus multi-well pad development in that parent-child relationship?","C. William Giraud - Concho Resources, Inc.","Yes. We definitely baked that into all of our plans and our forecast.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Is that something you'd be willing to share.","Timothy A. Leach - Concho Resources, Inc.","It's different by zone and different by area. And it's extremely complicated. And we're developing a program to minimize it. I'm not sure that any company in any location can completely eliminate that because you always have edges of your leases and things like that. But I think with our asset base and the big blocky nature of our assets and the way we're prosecuting our development program, we're in the best position to kind of minimize that effect. And we think we have it estimated very well.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Okay. That's helpful. Makes sense. And then, I guess it's kind of been hit on some level, but just want to kind of revisit this. Just in terms of the planning process and as you thought about the 2019-2020 program, how did you approach optimizing growth relative to free cash flow? And kind of what are the key metrics in arriving at that optimization for the current plan?","Timothy A. Leach - Concho Resources, Inc.","Well, I mean, I think it was a combination of several things. We talked about early on with our shareholders about being careful about planning, so that our plan included this continued optimization of our assets, but also targeting free cash flow. And that's what gave rise to starting with a $55 to $60 range for our planning.","And then also, besides looking out just a year or two, looking out further than that and seeing what the future likely looks like, which is very encouraging, and talking about how do we optimize a business model that gives our shareholders the greatest advantage.","So I still think we have all the options in front of us on how to allocate capital in the future, but we clearly have two very important priorities. And one is to demonstrate that we can grow our oil production and deliver free cash flow and deliver a return of capital to our shareholders, and do all that in a very efficient way as we kind of mechanically mine this asset that we have.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Okay. And just to be clear on that, slide 7, the free cash flow opportunities in orange there, are those prioritized in that order, left to right, or is that just kind of everything that's on the table?","Jack F. Harper - Concho Resources, Inc.","Everything is on the table. It really depends on the landscape at the time. As we mentioned in the prepared remarks, we've worked on the balance sheet in the most recent past. But, yeah, all options are there and it would just really depend on the point in time.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Okay, great. That makes sense. Thanks very much.","Timothy A. Leach - Concho Resources, Inc.","All right. Thank you.","Jack F. Harper - Concho Resources, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Monroe Helm from Barrow, Hanley. Your line is open.","Hiram Monroe Helm - Barrow, Hanley, Mewhinney & Strauss LLC","First of all, congratulations on progressing the asset base to the point where you've got free cash flow that you can share with the shareholders. I think that will probably open up another sort of investors out there that would be interested in the stock. So congratulations on that.","My question has to do with the outlook for your takeaway capacity in 2019. Obviously, there are some parts of the market that don't have access to Gulf Coast and are having pretty \u2013 realizing pretty high differentials. Can you kind of talk about where you sit as we look into 2019 and 2020 as far as oil takeaway capacity on your system?","C. William Giraud - Concho Resources, Inc.","Sure. We've talked a fair amount about oil takeaway here over the last quarter or two, but just to back up and talk a little bit about our strategy. We have partnered historically with the largest players on that side and done deals with them that where they typically gather our barrel and then put it on their pipe and take it out of the Permian. We do historically price our barrels in the Midland market and used financial hedging as a way to insulate ourselves from periodic upsets in the Midland-Cushing differential.","But as the actual flow assurance, we have contracts that give us strong assurance that our barrels will move. We have been able to move our barrels through this type of period. And we feel very confident about our ability to move the barrels kind of \u2013 until you get into the back half of 2019 when all of a sudden a bunch of these new pipeline projects come on. So I would say, if anything, we continue to feel better and better on that issue.","Hiram Monroe Helm - Barrow, Hanley, Mewhinney & Strauss LLC","Great. Thank you.","Timothy A. Leach - Concho Resources, Inc.","Thank you.","C. William Giraud - Concho Resources, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Bob Brackett from Bernstein Research. Your line is open.","Robert Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","By way of talking about parent-child relationships, I'm looking at page 5, where you talk about that Windham B large scale project. You've got four zones you're targeting there. If I assume 660 foot spacing, there could be eight wells per zone, so call it 32 targets. And it looks like you hit 10 of them. What was the thinking in that? Do you go back later and drill child wells or do you cream the 10 best targets? Just any thought on how you develop?","C. William Giraud - Concho Resources, Inc.","Sure. It goes back to the question one of the gentlemen asked earlier about how are we doing on continuing to test additional zones and delineate other zones. And so, that's just a measure of continuing to go back and hit the targets that we like the best and test a few additional other concepts. So, for example, in that pad, we had one Wolfcamp C in there, testing that, that's kind of an emerging zone that others in the Permian have been talking about. We have not talked a whole lot about.","Robert Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","So, then that's four or five wells in the other two targets. And is that the ideal spacing or do those get down-spaced?","C. William Giraud - Concho Resources, Inc.","It's typically as we \u2013 one of the big things we're learning is what's the optimal project size. And so, at the point in time when we're drilling things like the Windham, you're seeing us typically target a 0.5 mile section at a time at that implied eight across our 660 foot spacing. And so, to the extent you're testing additional zone, you can get some odd numbers. But, yes, you're right. And I think that was Tim's point that you're not eliminating the parent-child piece. You are going to have to come in and offset these pads in time. And so, I think that Windham just reflects kind of how we think about the world.","Robert Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","But if you're doing the 0.5 mile, you're eliminating some of the infill issues. You might still have some edge issues. But that's a better world. Yeah.","C. William Giraud - Concho Resources, Inc.","That's right. That's right.","Robert Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you.","C. William Giraud - Concho Resources, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Singer from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you. Good morning. I wanted to follow up on a couple of the earlier questions. First, as it relates to the 2019 and 2020 CapEx budgets, or 2019 CapEx plan specifically, how did you take inflation and labor availability into account? What have you baked in particularly on how you see lateral-adjusted well cost evolving? And what do you see at the upside or downside risks?","Jack F. Harper - Concho Resources, Inc.","Sure. Brian, this is Jack. As Tim mentioned, we used $55 to $60 to lay out this budget. We have embedded some inflation in some of our assumptions and some of our cases. I think the important point is we built the budget around $55 to $60. So in 2019, we see some modest free cash, but more importantly, we see that inflection point in 2020 to more free cash.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","So I guess do you assume then that well cost will rise with the inflation assumption or less so because the price points that you're assuming actually are a little bit below where we are today?","Jack F. Harper - Concho Resources, Inc.","No, the higher the price point, the higher our assumption is for increased activity and inflation. So really, the way to think about it is the commodity price moves up, so does our assumption there.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay, and then -","Jack F. Harper - Concho Resources, Inc.","Again, it's all dependent on activity.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great. And then on well productivity, when you take into account your planned parent-child mitigation efforts, technology innovation, do you see your lateral-adjusted oil rates in the Delaware Basin rising, falling or are holding flat in 2019? Kind of where are we in the maturation or lack of it, just from a well productivity EUR perspective?","Jack F. Harper - Concho Resources, Inc.","Yeah, we see flat or assumed the same type of efficiencies. I think the more important way we're looking at it is, with more large project, long-lateral development, it's overall over a much longer period of time a more efficient way to deploy large chunks of capital.","C. William Giraud - Concho Resources, Inc.","Yeah, Brian, I think we've said before that we're \u2013 the team is really good at finding additional efficiencies. We're not necessarily the best at forecasting them.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you.","Timothy A. Leach - Concho Resources, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Arun Jayaram from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Please check that your line is not on mute.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah. Good morning. On slide 9, you highlight the planned production starts and you do indicate that you have a more second half weighted production profile. I was just wondering if you could give us a sense of first half of 2019 versus second half. How many POPs do you expect to have just roughly in the first half versus second half?","Jack F. Harper - Concho Resources, Inc.","Sure. When you look at that page 9 over on the right side, when I look at that put on production bar, it looks like about a 40\/60 mix to me.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, great. So, a little bit more in the second half. And my follow-up question, Tim, The Wall Street Journal has reported that one of the large privates in the Permian Basin maybe putting itself up for sale. I was just wondering, broadly, if you could comment on the portfolio post-RSP. And also on the disposition side, you guys have been speculated to maybe shopping your big chief assets and some of the half east (48:37) assets. Just wondering broadly if you could discuss the portfolio.","Timothy A. Leach - Concho Resources, Inc.","Yeah, sure. And I'm going to focus on the broadly part of your question. And I would say \u2013 and I've already said once in this call, how happy I am that we bought RSP. Those assets and that fit with our existing portfolio really create a lot of powerful economies. And you can see that in our early implementation of the strategy that we've been talking about for a while. So, I really think we have a great set of assets.","We will be buying, selling and trading outlier properties in and out of our portfolio as just a normal part of our business. I mean, we've got a very large inventory and we will constantly be trying to high-grade that. We also are a Permian Basin focused company. So I think when you ask about what going on in the Permian, we ought to be the experts on what going on in the Permian.","So as properties are bought and sold, our wells are drilled, we are familiar with all that and it's part of our business because that's our focus. And I would just kind of end the very broad question you asked by saying, we never bought anything out of the newspaper. And so, the way we do our business, as you've seen over the years, is very focused and I think you ought to expect that from us in the future.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","That's helpful. If I could sneak in one final question, just broadly, maybe for you Jack, is on a combination with RSP. What type of PDP declines you see on a one-year basis that's kind of embedded in your 2019 guide?","Jack F. Harper - Concho Resources, Inc.","It's low to mid 30s. It's where it's been prior.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. And that does conclude our question-and-answer session for today's conference. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Tim Leach for any closing remarks.","Timothy A. Leach - Concho Resources, Inc.","Great. Thanks. Thank you for all the great questions, and thanks for your interest in Concho. I hope you picked up on this quarter and in previous quarters how excited we are about the prospects for our business, not only in the next year or two, but for the long term.

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the call over to your host for today, Ms. Megan Hays, Director of Investor Relations. Please proceed.","Megan P. Hays - Director, Investor Relations, Concho Resources, Inc.","Thank you. Good morning and thank you for joining Concho's first quarter conference call. Joining me today in Midland is the Concho senior management team. In addition to yesterday's earnings release, we have posted a slide presentation which can be found on our website at concho.com.","We will make forward-looking statements this morning. Please refer to the forward-looking statement and other disclaimers contained in our earnings release and on slide two of today's presentation. Also, we will reference certain non-GAAP measures. How we calculate these measures and reconciliations to the comparable GAAP measures are provided in the earnings release and presentation.","Following our prepared remarks, we'll turn the call over for Q&A. Please limit your questions to one plus a follow-up and then jump back in the queue if you have more questions. With that, I'll turn the call over to Tim.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning. Let's start on slide three, and I'll start by reviewing key highlights for the first quarter and our updated outlook for full-year 2015. The first quarter of 2015 was another strong quarter. Production totaled at a record 132,000 Boes per day, and beat the high end of our guidance. Oil production for the first quarter was nearly 90,000 barrels per day, increasing 38% year-over-year and 9% quarter-over-quarter.","The driver of production growth continues to be consistently strong drilling results across our assets in the Permian Basin and momentum from our drilling program in 2014. Although financial results this quarter were negatively affected by the 50% year-over-year drop in crude oil price, unit cost including lease operating, DD&A and G&A were all lower compared to the first quarter of 2014.","With production exceeding our expectations and improving cost structure, we're off to a great start in 2015. For the second quarter, we expect production to average about 140,000 barrels per day, representing a 30% increase year-over-year and a 6% increase over the first quarter of 2015.","For full year 2015, we raised the midpoint of our production growth target to 20% from 18%. Our current outlook for the capital budget is lower compared to the budget we announced in January and we reduced guidance for LOE and DD&A. Delivering more production growth with less capital, highlights the improving capital efficiency of our drilling program.","Turning to slide four, I'm very pleased with the performance of our team this quarter. Our assets are firing on all cylinders and so are our people. They're drilling faster and cheaper, improving completions and optimizing field operations. As a result, we're delivering profitable growth quarter after quarter. Over in the Delaware Basin, our optimization efforts are making a big impact on our ability to deliver steady growth.","In early 2012, horizontal production averaged only 12,000 barrels per day from these assets. Since then, we've grown production by nearly six-fold and it's still early in the play. During the last couple of quarters, we've highlighted the gains from drilling and completion optimization in the 2nd Bone Spring. We're transferring this success to other zones and throughout all of our assets.","Moving to slide five, we started the year operating nearly 40 rigs. Currently, we've (4:10) reduced that to 18 rigs. We plan to average 18 rigs for the remainder of the year, which is 30% fewer than we originally outlined in January.","At this level of activity, we're on a pace to spend less than our original budget of $2 billion while sticking to the same strategy of allocating capital to high-return projects, managing spending around cash flow, and maintaining a strong balance sheet.","We expect our capital spending to range between $1.8 billion to $2 billion this year, and we'll deliver about 20% production growth at the low end of that capital range with flexibility to increase activity if conditions continue to improve. This outlook is a result of our high-quality drilling inventory, improving capital efficiency and service costs that are decreasing faster than anticipated.","Let me summarize what this means: we expect to deliver higher production growth on a lower capital spend and with fewer rigs. This isn't just the result of a declining service cost environment. Rather, it's the result of running a focused drilling machine on a premier set of assets in the Permian Basin.","Now, let's review asset performance, turning to slide six. In the Northern Delaware Basin, we're running 11 rigs. These assets continue to deliver industry-leading well results from multiple pay zones. A new focus for us is the oil-rich Avalon Shale on the eastern side of the Delaware Basin. Most of our historical results have come from the western side of the basin which tends to be gassier. By extending the play east and refining our completion methods, we're focusing on the oil window of the Avalon Shale.","We're encouraged by our recent results including three completions in the first quarter. The average peak 30-day rate for these wells was about 1,600 barrels per day made up of 77% crude oil and the average 24-hour rate was 2,500 barrels per day.","Enhanced completions in the Bone Spring are a game changer. We noted that our teams are leveraging the results from the 2nd Bone Spring to improve recoveries in other zones. The Avalon Shale is a perfect example of this knowledge transfer. While it's early for the Avalon Shale, we're encouraged by the progress we're making and look forward to sharing more results in the quarter ahead.","Turning to slide seven, we're consistently improving drilling times across our assets and here is an example for the Northern Delaware Basin where we're drilling the wells faster, extending the lateral length and reducing drilling costs. Operational efficiencies like these improve returns and withstand price cycles.","Turning to slide eight, in the Southern Delaware Basin, we're running three rigs. Year-over-year, we're drilling horizontal wells 15 days faster, nearly 20% longer and over 20% cheaper. We're also focused on optimizing well spacing as we transition this asset to development mode.","Over in the Midland Basin on slide nine, we're running two rigs. Our focus in the Midland Basin is on optimizing completion design. We're achieving strong results from reduced cluster spacing within the frac stages. We've worked this area for a long time. Our performance here is a great example of growing production and reserves through vertical development and then managing to unlock even more resource with our horizontal program. We continue to be excited about the development potential that this asset holds.","Over on the New Mexico Shelf on slide 10, we're running two rigs. We're expanding the play boundaries with horizontal development. The average horizontal well cost is now $3 million, down 15% from the fourth quarter. It's exciting to see this legacy asset continue to deliver impressive results and strong returns.","I'd like to conclude on slide 11. For nearly a decade we've carefully assembled a portfolio of some of the highest quality assets in the largest resource-rich basins in North America. The acreage you see on our map was intentional in creating competitive projects in all of our core areas, even at today's commodity prices. And we're making these assets even better, with one of the best teams in the industry, we're executing a development program that's improving well productivity and capital efficiency.","In addition, we're finding more upside in expanding our resource potential. With a strong team and balance sheet, Concho's never been better positioned to execute our strategy, in developing our high quality asset base and opportunistically adding to the portfolio. The result is a solid track record of delivering differentiated growth and profitability. I'm excited about the year ahead, and believe we'll continue to build upon this track record.","So with that, let's go to Q&A and I'll turn the call back over to the moderator.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And our first question comes from the line of Mike Kelly with Global Hunter Securities. Please proceed.","Michael Dugan Kelly - Global Hunter Securities LLC","Hey, guys. Good morning.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Michael Dugan Kelly - Global Hunter Securities LLC","Production first half of 2015 looks to be tracking extremely well and showing nice sequential growth. I was just hoping to get some color on your expectations for the second half. Your full-year guidance seems to imply that you're going to start to see some quarterly declines kick in and I'd just like to hear how you see this playing out. Thanks.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Well, we've given guidance for the full year and we give guidance for the quarter ahead. As we slow our rig count down, the growth in our production's obviously going to slow. But the good thing is that we can continue to grow kind of the industry-leading rates even within cash flow.","Michael Dugan Kelly - Global Hunter Securities LLC","Got it. And if you maybe take that out to 2016 and just talk about the trajectory of production growth, any comments on how you're set up for 2016 and also, Tim, you did state that you've got a lot of flexibility in the program too \u2013 just interested in maybe the trigger points that would get you to increase activity as well. Thanks.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I'm excited about the way 2016 looks. We haven't given guidance on it yet. We haven't come up with our capital budget yet. But we're excited about 2016. I will tell you everybody wants to know at what oil price would you kind of spend more and that's not really the way we think about it. All the conditions kind of factor in, the oil price, the service cost, and our well performance. So that's kind of how we're thinking that 2016 shapes up and we think it looks pretty good.","Michael Dugan Kelly - Global Hunter Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of John Freeman with Raymond James. Please proceed.","John A. Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Good morning.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, John.","John A. Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Just a few things first on the CapEx budget did \u2013 I just want to make sure I heard you right, Tim. So you said that 20% production growth would correspond to the low end of the new CapEx guidance range?","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, roughly.","John A. Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. And then in the new CapEx budget, does that assume any additional cost savings?","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, we've \u2013 the cost savings we anticipated for the first quarter have arrived. The second quarter we'll have a full quarter's benefit from those cost savings. We do believe that if we stay in this kind of environment that we're in today, we'll see further cost savings.","John A. Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. And then just a last one for me on those terrific wells in the Avalon, obviously, you mentioned that you've kind of leveraged what you did in the 2nd Bone Spring. I'm just wondering if we could maybe elaborate a little bit on that, if we could talk about either lateral length, stages per well, anything that we could compare to what you were previously doing in the Avalon for those wells to be that much bigger.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, the Avalon is a shale compared to the Bone Spring, which is more of a conventional reservoir. So we don't want to give away any of our trade secrets, but it's specifically designing those completions to better drain the type of rock you're in. And it has to do with the placement of those stages and how much sand we're pumping and what kind of fluid we're using. But it all kind of stems from the breakthroughs in the learning curve we had starting with the 2nd Bone Spring.","John A. Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Great. Thanks for the answers, Tim. Great quarter.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of David Tameron with Wells Fargo. Please proceed.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning, Tim. Just back on the Avalon, as you think about your acreage, and you talked about moving in the basin to the more oily section, but just if we think about the Avalon, how much of your acreage do you think is prospective for that?","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I mean we've given an inventory count, I think in the Avalon. And it's all over on the eastern side in Lea County, but we've continued to add to our position over there. We talked about the bolt-on acquisitions that we did last year. Some of that was in this area, a large part of that was in this area and that shale is pretty thick, so I think there's upside in the inventory count as well.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And then my typical question about acquisitions, can you just give us big picture \u2013 I know there's a big bid-ask spread but kind of what are you seeing on that front with all the private equity money sitting out there, can you just give us a snapshot?","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I'll make you a deal, you ask your typical question and I'll give you my typical answer. The pipeline's full. We're looking at every deal and every asset that's available in the Permian. We're very focused on the high-quality assets that are in the fairways, for what we have defined for ourselves as where we think the sweet spots in the fairways are, but they're a lot of opportunities and I think with the oil price showing a little bit of firming, I think that the bid-ask spread probably has narrowed somewhat but we still \u2013 I mean we'll talk all day long about the consolidation story within our industry and within the Permian. We still think that's kind of a compelling story.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","All right. Thank you, sir.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Jason Smith with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.","Jason Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey. Good morning, everyone. Tim, so I know you didn't really talk about it in your prepared remarks, but it looks like the two wells you drilled in the Northern Delaware Wolfcamp also saw improved performance. I know it's a bit gassier but are you guys doing anything with the completion there? I'm just trying to figure out how does that fit into your capital allocation again for maybe the 2nd Bone Spring and the Avalon?","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. We're having the same kind of effort and effect in the Wolfcamp, and so as we drill more wells, we hope to roll these kind of stories out quarter-after-quarter about the successes we're having. And the Wolfcamp's a big deal for us as well.","Jason Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. Okay. And then just in terms of the wells waiting on completion, the backlog there, given that you've completed about 45 more wells than you drilled, can you just give us an update to just where that backlog stands and what you're targeting?","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. The backlog kind of built up at the end of last year as we had a little bit of weather during the winter. We've worked that backlog back off to a more normal level and I think we've got, it's about two times our current rig count. So, it's in the 40 wells to 50 wells range.","Jason Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. Okay. I'll leave it there. Thanks.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","All right. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Neal Dingmann with SunTrust. Please proceed.","Neal D. Dingmann - Suntrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Good morning, guys. Say, Tim, just wondering on that you talked about on the east side there, on the Avalon, could you talk about just on takeaway there? I guess are you trucking everything there? And just maybe talk about differentials, I guess it's just simply what's going to be continuing to move over from a bit more oilier from the gassy differentials maybe improving there a bit?","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, those are two my favorite topics. We are trucking that oil right now but our pipeline's about to come on in the first quarter of next year is where we're projecting. And that's going to give us several different types of improvements, both on differentials but also on efficiency, just to not have to truck that oil anymore. So that's going to be a big strategic deal for us, I think, in the Northern Delaware Basin.","Also, the differentials for Permian crude have improved over what we were talking about last year. I think they currently stand at about $1 or less than $1 right now. So the takeaway capacity out of the Permian that we talked about all last year has come on line and is coming on line. So I think we've benefited from having maybe even some spare capacity to move crude out of the Permian.","Neal D. Dingmann - Suntrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Got it. And then just lastly, it looks like 38 Midland rates were just a little bit lower versus the prior quarter. Anything standing out there?","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","No, nothing out \u2013 from quarter-to-quarter, those things kind of bounce around, and it's just an effect of specifically which wells you're drilling and how much are you spreading around and testing the limits of the fairways.","Neal D. Dingmann - Suntrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Got it. Thanks for the details, Tim.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Pearce Hammond with Simmons & Company. Please proceed.","Pearce W. Hammond - Simmons & Co. International","Good morning, Tim. Thanks for taking my questions.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Pearce.","Pearce W. Hammond - Simmons & Co. International","What is your highest rate of return horizon in the Northern Delaware Basin in your estimation right now? Is it the 2nd Bone Spring or the Wolfcamp or the Avalon?","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Yeah. I think, the 2nd Bone Spring is the \u2013 I mean, we have a lot of things that are very competitive. But the 2nd Bone Spring, the way we have it modeled today is kind of at the top of the pile.","Pearce W. Hammond - Simmons & Co. International","Thank you for that. And then my follow-up, I know you mentioned it's not just oil price, it's also service costs, it's also well productivity from Concho. But when you do get the green light that it's time to increase activity, how quickly do you think the service companies can respond, given the layoffs that they have affected within their organizations, et cetera? Do you think this is a fairly quick turnaround or will it take longer to add rigs than it took to drop them?","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","No. I think it will be a quick turnaround in terms of redeploying equipment because the efficiencies have improved so much of what we can do, the drilling days and the frac spreads and things like that. I mean, in some circumstances, we're backing off the 24-hour a day work and just going to daylight work. So you can kind of ramp up the activity without having to add any equipment or people. It's just kind of turning the intensity knob back up. So I think the industry's positioned to respond well when the conditions are right.","Pearce W. Hammond - Simmons & Co. International","Thank you, Tim.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Mike Scialla with Stifel. Please proceed.","Blake W. Donovan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Good morning. This is actually Blake Donovan speaking on behalf of Mike. I appreciate you taking my questions.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure.","Blake W. Donovan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","First off, first quarter oil mix was about 68% of total production, a bit higher than the annual guidance range of 63% to 65%. That indicates that the production mix should get gassier throughout the year. Is this just a result of changing GOR on your base production or drilling different parts of the basin? Could you please shed some light on that?","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. There's some operational reasons that the oil percentage is high in the first quarter. There's also where our rigs are and how we're deploying our capital right now. As far as the guidance range we have given, we're still \u2013 we're kind of biased to the upper end of that guidance range, but I'd say that we hadn't seen enough data yet to let us move that thing up. So it's \u2013 I don't think I would interpret the results as it's going to get gassier in the second half of the year.","Blake W. Donovan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thanks.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Blake W. Donovan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","And then secondly, we've obviously seen some significant reductions in well costs across the Permian, you're saying about 20%. But do you have an update on the specific well costs for the Northern Delaware Basin, and the corresponding rates of return?","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","We're not giving any of the rates of return out. I will confirm the 20% number across the board is a pretty good number.","Blake W. Donovan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Great. That's all for me. Congrats on the quarter.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","All right. Thank you. All right. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Michael Hall with Heikkinen Energy Advisors. Please proceed.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","Thanks. Good morning. Looking at the new rig count, the 18 rigs versus I think it was 25 previously, with all the moving pieces around, service costs and efficiencies, given the current, the slightly lower budget, are you going to be able to drill as many wells in the second half as you originally anticipated with those rigs, with the fewer rigs, or should we anticipate that well count, wells turned to production come down somewhat relative to our prior expectation?","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think our \u2013 the number of wells we bring on in the second, third and fourth quarter will be pretty consistent. And if this \u2013 the whole year is slightly more front-end loaded probably than we anticipated just because of the effect of going from 40 rigs to the 18 rigs, but \u2013 so we brought on around 100 wells in the first quarter, and it looks like we'll average about 60 per quarter for the next three quarters.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","Okay. That's helpful. Thank you.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","And then as you think about kind of, I guess, getting back a little bit to one \u2013 I think it was Pearce that asked it earlier. Just around kind of the response time, how should we think about the time lag between you guys deciding to add a rig or, to your point, press the accelerator a little bit on the completion pace? How should we think about that lag from the decision until we get some additional production from that?","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","It's always been about the same. From the time you decide to increase spending or increase activity, it takes about six months before you see production actually show up on your financial statements. So I don't think that's changed. We can drill the wells slightly faster. We can complete slightly faster than we have in the past. But from the time you press the button, there's still a couple of quarter delay before you see production.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","Okay. Should we think in that acceleration case that you'd have some degradation in efficiencies just as you bring on new equipment, new crews and that sort of thing for some period of time?","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I don't think so because, I mean, we were running 40 rigs in the third quarter. And so when we talk about pressing on the accelerator, you don't need as many rigs today to accomplish the work we were doing with more rigs last year. So I don't think \u2013 I think our organization has plenty of capacity to expand what we're doing without and probably would enhance efficiency, not degrade it.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","Great. That's helpful. I appreciate the color.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","All right. Thank you.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","Thanks.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Scott Hanold with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks. Good morning, guys.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey, I'd like to kind of ask a question that I think you've answered in a couple different ways but maybe if I could be a little bit more specific. You did take a good cut to your rig count, due to efficiencies, cut it by a little over 25%. And the cut to CapEx wasn't as much, should we assume that you still have the same amount of wells planned to drill this year that you previously had or is it all just really this was a extremely front-end loaded, first quarter more than you expected. So on a go-forward basis the drilled well count goes down a little bit?","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","No. I think that the number of wells we're drilling \u2013 about the same as we originally planned. If you look at the first quarter, we've had \u2013 you can see in the completion data we completed a lot more wells than we drilled. And that was due to a couple of reasons, one is kind of the slowing down of the drilling program and the other was just the weather effect at the end of last year. And the drilling intensity is way up, the lateral length, the number of stages within each well and so \u2013 and the productivity of each well.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. And maybe that's a great segue to my follow-up then as you look at the wells that you're going to be drilling the second half for the year, how big of fracs are you testing. I know some other operators in that same area are talking about pushing the envelope with 3,000 pounds per foot. What are you using on average right now, and what kind of limits are you testing today?","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Each one of these areas and each one of these zones is different, so it's just fine-tuning within each one. And so it's \u2013 I don't think it would fall into the category of testing the limits, as you described, in other places.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Thanks.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of James Sullivan with Alembic Global Advisors. Please proceed.","James Sullivan - Alembic Global Advisors LLC","Hey. Good morning, folks.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","James Sullivan - Alembic Global Advisors LLC","I just wanted to kind of ask on the Northern Delaware. Understanding that you guys have a big inventory to pursue but you have talked in the past about the rate of return effect of drilling longer laterals, I mean, certainly in the Southern Delaware, but in the Northern, too, and your average lateral length has risen from 4.5 mile to 5 mile and so forth, or a little above 5 mile.","What is the appetite for you guys? And I know you do a lot of blocking and tackling work in terms of trying to block up units, but what is the appetite for doing a more comprehensive swap with one of the other big operators in Southeastern New Mexico there who would have a bunch of sections offsetting you to kind of block up a bunch of stuff right away and increase your location count that's susceptible to 1.5- mile or 2-mile lateral lengths?","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Right. Let me first say that we clearly believe that longer laterals are better than shorter laterals. And so, on paper, getting blocky acreage is very important, and trading acreage to get more blocky acreage makes all kind of sense. However, I would say the devil's always in the details on trades like that, and they're more difficult to accomplish than you would think they need to be.","James Sullivan - Alembic Global Advisors LLC","Okay. Good, makes sense. All right. Then just on the follow-up, you guys have talked about service cost deflation and nice numbers there, 20%. Can you quantify in any way, and I know that these two portions of the AIC (29:52) are not equivalent, so it's going to be hard for me to express this mathematically correctly here. But can you quantify kind of on a weighted percentage portion how much of the savings is coming on the drilling side and how much on the completion side?","And maybe you can just give a feel or a trend in there, I mean. And what really I'm gunning for is there more completion side deflation still ahead. Have you already think it's mostly in there already?","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","In general, I think that the drilling versus the completion percentage of the total cost is about one-third, two thirds. And we're seeing savings on both sides that are comparable. And so, I don't think that there's more to be squeezed out of one side versus the other. Generally, within our portfolio, I think there's more to be squeezed out of the newer areas that are lower on the experience curve. So I think by area there's more to be done within Concho. Some of the areas that we're further toward development drilling right now probably we're also further toward optimizing the cost and efficiencies.","James Sullivan - Alembic Global Advisors LLC","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","All right. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Jeb Bachmann with Howard Weil. Please proceed.","Jeb E. Bachmann - Howard Weil, Inc.","Morning, guys. Tim, maybe, a different way to ask the last question. Just curious on those 18 rigs, how much are spot rigs versus contracted?","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think generally, the way you're thinking about it, all of them would be spot rigs. We have a very short contractual and maybe as we start adding rigs, if we ever start accelerating back again, you might go a little bit out on the contracts, but right now, it's very short.","Jeb E. Bachmann - Howard Weil, Inc.","Okay. Great. That's it for me. Thanks.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Jon Wolff with Jefferies. Please proceed.","Jonathan D. Wolff - Jefferies LLC","Good morning. Just curious if there were any federal lease sales upcoming on the New Mexico side and how that process works and also how far in front you're staying on the permitting, given a lot of it's federal acreage?","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I think we've become experts at permitting those wells. That's really a key to success in areas with BLM and state land and I think we're really good at that. I think we've talked in the last quarter or two, we bought some land at a previous sale and that was about all that they were going to do for the next 12 months or something like that. So I don't \u2013 if there's another sale coming up, I personally am not aware of it. They've become fewer and further between, I think.","Jonathan D. Wolff - Jefferies LLC","Got it. And any private land holdings that are out there for sale, either on Texas or New Mexico side that are big packages at all?","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Every single day that \u2013 when we talked about the blocking and tackling in the past of adding to our lease position, I mean we're really working those areas that \u2013 where we already have core positions. Like a previous caller was asking about blocking up acreage and getting more blocky acreage and that's really a focus of what we're doing, either buying interest within areas that we're already drilling or blocking it up where we can drill longer laterals.","Jonathan D. Wolff - Jefferies LLC","Any thoughts on paying, doing a little bit more drilling in the Wolfcamp on the New Mexico side to try to prove that up, whether it's better, worse or indifferent than 2nd Bone Spring \u2013 it's kind of a faster way?","Timothy A.

Please proceed.","Richard Merlin Tullis - Capital One Securities, Inc.","Hey. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Tim, just looking to get an indication on the current outlook for your Midland Basin acreage. I see the CapEx expectations there took a cut, and you're only running two rigs. So how are you looking at that acreage overall currently?","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","We like that acreage a lot. We think it has a lot of potential. It will be an area of focus, both now and in the future. There's a couple of things that are affecting our pace today, and that's the water system we talked about building out earlier, and that area is mostly held by production, so there's not an urgency around drilling wells to hold anything.","And we've got kind of a mixture of ownerships over there, things like that. So all that goes together to make our capital allocation for 2015. We really think highly of that. In fact, some of the best wells we've drilled have been over in that area recently, so I'm very encouraged by it.","Richard Merlin Tullis - Capital One Securities, Inc.","And then just a follow-up, have you been testing the Lower Spraberry on your acreage?","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes, we have.","Richard Merlin Tullis - Capital One Securities, Inc.","Any results to share?","Timothy A.

Please proceed.","Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Good morning. The first question was with regard to the three recent Avalon wells, were they widely dispersed really or were they drilled in a fairly confined area?","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I would say that our acreage position if you look at that map, it's those wells were as dispersed as they could be on our acreage position. Our acreage position's fairly concentrated there.","Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Okay. And staying with the Avalon, your recent completions were over twice as productive as your 30-day averages despite being oilier wells which is really remarkable. And when it comes time in the future to drill gas here, the gassier portions of your Avalon position, is it reasonable to expect some more uplift in 30-day rates in that part of the play as well due to the better completions that you're making now?","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, we haven't done yet so it would all be speculation but, yeah, I think that the well improvements we're making today will apply. I mean, we talked in the past and others have talked in the past how there are tremendous gas opportunities within the Permian. They're really \u2013 they're going undeveloped today just because of the gas price. So when it comes time to develop those assets, yeah, I would expect the productivity gains that we've seen on the oil side to translate over to the gas side as well.","Jeffrey L.

And the company plans to file its Form 10-Q today after market close.","Participants on today's call will make forward-looking statements based upon current expectations. They are subject of risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements and other disclaimers are provided in the earnings release and presentation.","The company's comments today also may refer to non-GAAP financial measures. The appropriate reconciliations are included in the company's earning materials.","On today's call is Tim Leach, Concho's Chairman and CEO, along with President Jack Harper; Chief Operating Officer, Will Giraud, and members of Concho's senior management team. Following prepared remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up.","Now, let me turn the call over to Chairman and CEO, Tim Leach. Sir, please go ahead.","Timothy Leach","Thanks, Michelle, and good morning. Last quarter, we talked about the efficiency of our operations and the economic advantages of execution and scale. It seems like today the entire industry is focused on the Permian and how good execution and scale creates value. We are very familiar with this theme. For as long as you've known us, we're focused on building our execution machine and that's driven by core assets, the team that executes, prudent capital allocation, and a strong balance sheet.","Our focus paid off for us last quarter. We exceeded the high-end of our production guidance with strong oil volumes. Production for the quarter also benefited from strong early production out of our latest projects, including the Dominator, Eider and Mabee, as well as outside operated volumes.","With solid cost control and production ahead of expectations, we also delivered strong financial performance. As expected, our capital investments, which are front-end loaded this year, exceeded operating cash flow during the quarter. Importantly, we're on track to deliver on the $2.8 billion to $3 billion capital program we laid out last quarter, and we have increased our estimates for oil production in 2019.","The Permian continues to dominate global activity and represents the most economic source of supply growth in the world. The attention on the Permian, a renewed focus for some, reinforces the importance of being low cost with high quality scale, but also validates the strategic rationale for the moves we made in 2018, which included the RSP acquisition and numerous strategic trades. Our business development and asset teams are working on a new slate of trades as we continue to value owning large blocky tracks of operated acreage with high working interest.","This is one of the most exciting times in the history of Concho. The building blocks of our strategy has been validated by the entire industry. It's not surprising to me that so much attention is focused on the Permian and consolidation in the basin. We've understood from the beginning, we are stewards of our shareholders' capital, and we believe that we have built a company that will be a winner for our shareholders under any scenario.","With that, I'll turn it over to Jack and take you through the details.","Jack Harper","Thank you, Tim. First quarter was a strong start and we're in a good position to take advantage of the growth platform we've worked hard to build. I'll quickly review the financial results for the quarter, followed by an update on our growth outlook for 2019, and a review of our midstream efforts. Sequentially, total production was up 7% and oil production increased 6%, driven, as Tim mentioned, by program efficiencies, on operated assets, and an increase in non-op activity.","Controllable cash costs, which included production expense, G&A and interest, totaled less than $10 a barrel and were lower compared to the fourth quarter of '18. Our adjusted earnings for the quarter were $0.72 per share and adjusted EBITDAX totaled $755 million. Exploration and development capital totaled $926 million for the quarter and included an incremental $40 million for non-op activity.","Of course that capital came with increased production and investment opportunity that we're very happy with. And, as Tim just said, we plan to land our capital budget in the range we have provided. Recall that we ended 2018 building momentum and planning to spend $3.4 billion to $3.6 billion for 2019, but we modified that range and set up a very significant cash flow inflection points in 2020.","As we described last quarter, first quarter '19 capital would be the highest spend level for the year and you should expect a decreasing rig count has spend rate throughout the remainder of the year. That plan is still intact.","We've raised our annual production growth outlook to account for the outperformance in 1Q as well as continued strong performance across the portfolio. At the midpoint, we increased our full-year oil production guidance to 29%. Relative to the two-year outlook provided in February, we've clearly made a lot of progress and have a great deal of confidence in that plan.","Full-field development is an important contributor to our momentum. This approach is all about optimizing spacing, timing and drilling and completion techniques to maximize program economics and recoveries. Approximately, 80% of our capital is allocated to large-scale projects this year. And, during the first quarter, we commenced production on nine projects, many of which, including the 23-well Dominator project, were ahead of schedule.","Turning now to our midstream marketing efforts. Our midstream investments provide a competitive advantage and create an additional platform for building shareholder value. We partnered with experienced teams to build regional gathering transportation and storage systems. These systems support our growth and efficiently transport our production to key markets. We've recently announced the sale of the Oryx I in the Southern Delaware and, based on our ownership, we expect net proceeds of $300 million from the sale in the second quarter.","And we recently announced that we formed a joint venture with Frontier to construct the Beta Crude Connector in the Northern Midland Basin.","Last November, I provided a framework for capital allocation. The first set of priorities is reinvesting to grow our business and support our growing dividend. We value preserving operational flexibility in a cyclical business and excess cash affords opportunity, including further strengthening the balance sheet, additional returns to shareholders, and portfolio enhancement. Our goal is to have a fortress balance sheet and with the Oryx sale we're well on our way to achieving that goal.","Our first quarter results and the outlook for our company give us great confidence in the effectiveness of our development program and the strength of our business and team.","We are now ready to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Arun Jayaram","Yeah. Good morning, team. Tim, Big Oil looks to be embroiled in a bidding war for Anadarko. With APC's Permian assets, it looking to be coveted. From our eyes, it looks like the major are willing to pay NAV-based valuations in terms of M&A, Concho would be seem to be a pretty good fit just given your scale, acreage quality, valuation, et cetera. So I was wondering if maybe you could think about your thoughts generally on M&A and perhaps the gap that you perceive and the current value of the stock relative to your NAV?","Timothy Leach","Yeah, Arun, Thanks. As I said in the prepared remarks, the building blocks of Concho, or what make us so attractive, are our core assets, the team that can execute, et cetera. And so, it's not surprising that as you look at the Permian Basin, Concho pops out as something that would be very attractive to everybody. I think that's kind of a validation of what we've been working on for the last 10 years.","So what we tried to lay out here is, we are a public company, so we trade every single day, we're always available for someone to acquire some ownership and as if they would like. On the other hand, for our shareholders, we've laid out a long-term strategy for how we can build value in this company through our execution. So that's kind of the nature of my comment that I think we can win under any scenario.","I do think recently when you look at NAV calculations and things like that, it demonstrates that we have been building a lot of value and through our trades and through our focus on our balance sheet and things like that. So I think that also shows the value proposition in the machine we built.","Arun Jayaram","Great. And just my follow up is just on CapEx. Jack, you alluded to this, but the company spent 31%, 32% of its full-year budget in 1Q, it seems like the non-op CapEx and I know you partnered with some of the majors who outlined some pretty robust spending plans in the Permian. Can you give us a little bit more thoughts on the non-op CapEx and just your confidence around the overall CapEx budget this year, just given that non-op spend?","Jack Harper","Sure. Yeah, we're committed to the budget we've laid out, as I just said. Our partners in the industry have transitioned their business to the - a similar style of business that we have, so non-op capital and request come in and block your firms nowadays. Fortunately, for us, there's also a lot of ways to manage that capital through other partners as well as the extreme - non-consent. So we plan to manage that as we go forward and land the budget.","Arun Jayaram","Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate with Bank of America. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Doug Leggate","Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and congrats on your execution. I guess the cadence is really the question that we're all interested in as we go through the year. So I wonder if I could start with that. I understand the trajectory is going more in terms of spending, but can you give us some idea of cadence on our completion activity? I know you have those fuzzy bars that you gave us before, but any help that could clarify the trajectory will be appreciated?","William Giraud","Sure. Hey, Doug, this is Will Giraud. Yeah, I mean we talked a little bit about the cadence. We averaged 33 rigs in the first quarter, we're at 29 today. We expect to be in the low-20s by this summer. So just from a high level that's the cadence. As it relates to putting wells on the production, the fuzzy bars still hold, the back half of the year still has a majority of the wells put on the production.","Doug Leggate","I guess directionally I think we're there. So I appreciate the clarification. Well - maybe, well - for my second one to you as well, if I may. And there is a long lateral target is, obviously you're executing not pretty well, it seems across all parts of the portfolio, something we haven't, I guess, never really talked about and that is the inventory of that one lateral development backlog.","I'm just wondering if you could give us some kind of line of sight on that low-20s rig count activity level? What would you say is the line of sight in terms of specs on the map that give us visibility on your ability to sustain those - that level of activity on those long-lateral wells? And I'll leave it there. Thanks.","William Giraud","Sure. That's one of those things that as investors in the past, we probably would not been right. I think we have undershot - or I would have ended up being able to drill longer laterals than we expected. So I'll give you the answer as we sit here today and that is, I think, we will continue to push in the Delaware Basin closer to that 2-mile average and I think in the Midland Basin we'll be able to push beyond two miles on average. One of the big wild cards is our ability to continue to get these swaps and trades are done.","For a long time, we thought we would be more buyers to shorter laterals in the Delaware Basin just given our relatively more scattered position in the Northern Delaware, but because of the good work of the teams and beat here we've been able to do on the swap front, we've been able to push that average up and my expectation is we march into the future, we'll be - we can do more of those trades and continue to lengthen our laterals and get away from really drilling 1-mile well, so...","Doug Leggate","All right. Yeah. I understand. I'm sorry. I'm going to be really - just a real quick third one, if I can, because it's something that's been - it's been something as we've been kind of focusing on. There still seems to be a lot of comments and questions about NPVs, free cash flows seems to be the story, you guys have adopted that model for sure.","Can you give us some idea of what your sustaining capital is, if you were to hold exit reproduction front till the - until the end of this year, what do you think your sustaining capital look like? So we can get an idea of what the free cash capacity of the portfolio looks like and I will leave it there. Thanks. Thanks for indulging me.","Jack Harper","Sure, Doug. This is Jack. This year, we feel like we can sustain our production was roughly half of our cash flow and going forward that implies about a 15 rig cadence and we feel like we can maintain that going forward.","Doug Leggate","Appreciate the answers, guys. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Scott Hanold with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Scott Hanold","Yeah. Thank you. As you guys progress through these larger scale projects, can you discuss - is there anything that you're learning from them regarding spacing or configuration or just, in general, how you go about those that have changed as you get through this? So what learning this - have you gotten that you're going to apply going forward?","William Giraud","Sure. I mean there's a lot going on. As you think about the different phases of the sales cycle, discovery, the delineation and now development, I think there is maybe a misconception that you've reached development stage and so you know the answer, and that's definitely not the case.","We continue to learn from all these projects. And so using the Dominator one, just because it's a good example, that is our most extreme version of activity in a single square mile and also some of the more dense spacing we've tested. And so, yeah, the teams did a fantastic job on that, bringing that project and a couple of other large ones this quarter and putting well production actually ahead of schedule.","So we're continuing to figure out how to concentrate that much activity in one spot in the most efficient manner possible. We're continuing to play with spacing and also landing zones and we're still continue to tinker with combinations of different landing zones and to our whole completion design in them. So there is a lot to learn, but I think, at the same time, you've got a really competitive business that competes for investor capital. And so I think that's the exciting thing about what we've been able to do and are going to continue to do as - deliver really compelling returns while continuing to learn.","Scott Hanold","Okay. I appreciate it. And then just specifically on that. I mean, have you have problem with what you've seen on some of the initial results. I think, Dominator is in the closer space. I mean, what have you specifically seen in that compared to the wider space wells? Like, what is the most optimal?","Timothy Leach","It's going to range depending on where you are in the basin and also the zone you're drilling. On that one, we drilled at almost 50% more densely than kind of our - where we typically look at resource booking in that zone. So we will watch - we haven't hit for a, kind of, critical 60 days of production where we included that'll be next quarter's batch of wells to talk about, but certainly returns look pretty good for us.","Scott Hanold","Okay. And then just one clarification on CapEx. I mean, obviously, it's a big discussion point today, but it does sound like you've got some flexibility to do - obviously, manage the non-op piece. With your better efficiency on your operated activity to reach the budget, is there a chance that you guys would, say, dip a little bit from - into - cut into operated activity later the year? And if you had a comment on like what oilfield service inflation might do to that given what the industry is doing at these higher oil prices?","Timothy Leach","Sure, Scott. Well, we are already contemplating pairing back our operated activity to land that budget. The result being a little bit of a normal cadence of activity as we head into next year, but I think more importantly the plan we've laid out over the two-year period that spins roughly our cash flow or less this year and we see a big inflection to free cash flow next year remains intact and, in fact, we're more confident in that today.","Scott Hanold","That's great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Derrick Whitfield with Stifel. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Derrick Whitfield","Good morning, all.","Timothy Leach","Good morning.","Derrick Whitfield","Perhaps for Tim or Jack, over the last several weeks, gassing-rise has become a topical discussion among the Permian producers in light of recent oil prices. While gas is a relatively insignificant component of your revenue stream, could you comment on how you position Concho to mitigate risk and how you might respond to face with negative netbacks where period exceeding one or two months?","Jack Harper","Sure, Derrick. Just to start with, we have a slide in here that kind of shows our breakdown of our revenue and you see that natural gas, the dry gas portion is less than 5% of our revenue, but we do need to move it. And like last year when we were talking about crude and we talked about firm sales agreements with our large providers, the same holds true for gas and we are in constant communication with those large providers and feel comfortable that we will be able to move the gas. So we do not see that as a factor to slow down our plan this year.","Derrick Whitfield","Great, thanks. And then as my follow up, perhaps for Will, asking really a follow-up on Scott's earlier question regarding learnings and conclusions. As you guys look at optimal project size, pad size, how are you thinking about that now post-Dominator?","William Giraud","Yeah. I mean, I don't think that Dominator is determining point. Like I said, if you've watched us for a long time and so you've watched as we have transitioned into this project development, where we started small, started drilling two-well pads, three-well pads and then two two-well pads into a project and so on.","We've kind of highlighted that Dominator was an effort to kind of jump a couple of steps down the line and see if running seven rigs in a square mile, where do you see inefficiencies and how can you go attack those. And so, I do think that the average project size in the Delaware particularly will be something less than that. It will be for us today probably in that 8 to 10 to 12 range in the Midland Basin, maybe a little bit bigger just because of the initial rates out of those wells and try to size those facilities from an economic kind of return standpoint. But that would be kind of one of the big learnings, but there are a whole lot more.","Derrick Whitfield","It's very helpful. Thanks for your time.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Michael Hall of Heikkinen Energy. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Michael Hall","Thanks. Good morning. I guess, I was just curious if you'd be willing to provide a - maybe some additional guidance around expectations for capital in the second quarter, just given the heavier spend rate in the first quarter, I think, to the extent you'd be willing to give us something to hold onto for the second quarter could be helpful.","Jack Harper","Good morning, Michael. This is Jack. Yeah, what you should expect - Will mentioned that our rig count averaged 33 in the first quarter and we're at 29 on our way down. So it will be less, but it will certainly be the second highest quarter of capital for the year, but then tailing down throughout the rest of the year.","Michael Hall","Okay. That's helpful on the trajectory. And then I was also curious just you had very strong first quarter results, obviously, the 2Q guidance is more in line, I'd say, with what, kind of, Street expectations has been and that you took up the fourth quarter '19 exit rate. I'm just curious, I guess, number one, what gives you confidence on the 4Q '19 exit rate increase?","And then what if anything should we read into kind of the trajectory or momentum into 2020 in the context of that exit rate bump?","Jack Harper","Sure. Yeah. As we laid out, we had more wells completed in the first quarter and, therefore, we will have modestly less in the second quarter, but then ticking back up in the third and fourth quarter. So that should help as we end the year as is implied by our guidance in the new fourth quarter number.","Michael Hall","Okay. That is helpful. Appreciate it.","Jack Harper","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Brian Singer","\u2026the rates of return from your operated activity. And given the greater non-op activity during the first quarter, are you specifically planning in both CapEx and production guidance to non-consent, non-op activity in the remainder of the year to keep the full-year budget within guidance?","Timothy Leach","Hey, Brian. I think you were on mute for the first half of your question, but I think we got the second half around kind of some of the strategies around non-op capital in the back part of the year. And the answer, I think Jack alluded to it. I mean there's a variety of ways that we're going to manage our capital. One is just it's the easiest thing to swap. It's the lowest hanging fruit on those kinds of deals.","And so, I think we will - that has been a big point of emphasis, but we'll certainly redouble our efforts on swapping that. Also, I just - I think it's worth noting that there is a pretty sizable and growing market of private capital looking to purchase non-op well bores on kind of adjusted-time basis, that's something we will look into. And then, as you mentioned on, that's most extreme if we don't like the economics of the project is always non-consent. I hope that answered your question.","Brian Singer","Yeah. Thank you, and apologies. The first half was whether the non-op activity rates of return, how they compare to the operated rates of return?","Timothy Leach","They're all over the board. Some are very good and we like to participate in them. There are others that are not as good and those are what we're really looking hard on asset swaps and other things. But essentially non-op gives us an incredible intelligence advantage as well, because we have partners across the entire Permian.","And so, it lets us get an inside look at people's actual costs and actual results, which as we sit around and benchmark our own performance is very helpful. So we've always liked non-op and having some exposure to it, but, as Jack referenced, as those partners have moved to this, more projects still in development, the capital numbers inside of an individual quarter can get bigger.","Brian Singer","Thank you. That's helpful. And I my follow-up is, as you highlighted at the outset, Permian scale and consolidation has become very front and center here and as we now reached the first anniversary of the RSP acquisition announcement, can you reflect on how your latest - this latest experience in consolidation makes you more or less willing for consolidation to be a strategic objective for Concho? And, as well, how you see opportunities and pitfalls of Permian consolidation for others in the industry?","William Giraud","Yeah. Let me take that one. I've said before on this call that we got the one we wanted. So after a year and reflecting I'm glad we did the deal we did, it folded in really well, it met all our objectives and - but it also highlights to me how difficult it is to find anything like that in the Permian that doesn't have a bunch of hair on it. And so, as we look around at other opportunities in the Permian, I think our main focus is on this trading and that wells alluding to and because we have a huge inventory of the bar for anything is very high for us and so strategically, I think, we are where we need to be.","Brian Singer","Great. And do you see others having pitfalls as they look to consolidate their different assets, work for different companies if you look at the learnings that you've seen as a long time, long-term Permian consolidator?","William Giraud","The things that we highlighted has been the strategic building blocks of our success of what I think everyone is striving for the big blocky acreage and the team that can execute. That's really, really difficult to put together. And so, I think doing it is a lot harder than talking about it. And we've said that many times before. So I think strategically we are where we need to be and I'm happy that we've been focusing on this for so long.","Brian Singer","Thank you very much.","William Giraud","Yeah, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Neal Dingmann with SunTrust. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Neal Dingmann","Good morning, all, and thanks for the details. My question just firstly on the oil mix. I think previously you'd mentioned I think about, sort of, seeing a steady increase, it look like - I know that can kind of trend a bit different quarter-to-quarter, it looks like it was down 1% for the quarter and then if you could just sort of comment thoughts as you see the - all these laid out for the rest of the year, if you see the oil trend rebound a little bit for the remainder of the year?","Timothy Leach","Sure. The short answer is, yes, we do. And, again, it always - it depends on the mix of wells. We did see significant oil production in absolute terms, growth this quarter, but as a percentage, yeah, we expect it to be a little bit higher than it was this quarter going forward.","Neal Dingmann","Okay. And then just lastly, great sell obviously other than what you've realized on your return on the Oryx. My question is just on that, going forward the - sort of terms is it - just want to make sure, is it a longer term deal you signed up or you just talk about what was, sort of, involved and sort of how you see the contract going forward? I mean, it sounds like you didn't really lose a beat by selling that, but I'm just curious any color you can add to that?","Jack Harper","Sure. Very similar to the ACC sale a year or two ago, same holds for Oryx. The commercial terms were in place, they were put in place originally with our E&P hats on and those are long-term deals that have 8 to 10 years left in both cases.","Neal Dingmann","Very good. Thanks, Jack.","Jack Harper","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Then our next question comes from the line of John Freeman with Raymond James. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","John Freeman","Good morning, guys.","Timothy Leach","Hey, John.","John Freeman","You all spent a lot of time and effort testing both the horizontal spacing within individual zones like what you did with the Gettysburg and then testing the interaction between those different landings, like, for example, the Square Bill. And I know this a difficult question to sort of answer, but we all are sort of thinking about your long-term planning, when do you anticipate you sort of reached the point where you've got sort of the optimal development plans sort of figured out?","Timothy Leach","Well, I mean, I would say, I think we know it today, but I would say that as we keep going, we continue to learn. And so, we will continue - I mean, the Permian is not a gigantic uniform, sort of, geology. And so there are going to be changes as you move around the different parts of the basin, even within a sub-basin. And so, I expect there will be - we will continue to play with spacing differences within the bench, but also between the benches, but I think we feel very comfortable with kind of our base resource estimate, which is generally in that 6 to 8 across in each of the benches.","John Freeman","Great. And then just my follow up, just a quick kind of housekeeping item, does the previous oil differential guidance that you all have given, is it reflective of all the recent marketing agreements you all have done, like the 50,000 a day of production at the - toward the end of this year that will get waterborne pricing, things like that, is that all reflected in the prior steps guidance?","William Giraud","It is John and it's reflective of all of the dynamics that are out there currently in the market.","John Freeman","Great. I appreciate it. Well done, guys.","William Giraud","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mike Kelly with Seaport Global. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Mike Kelly","Hey, guys. Good morning.","Timothy Leach","Good morning, Mike.","Mike Kelly","Tim, you mentioned in your prepared remarks that you are in view of new slate to create opportunities. I was hoping you could just characterize these potential deals. I guess I'm interested if this is kind of standard blocking and tackling for you guys as kind of what you've done in the past or if there's maybe some larger trade opportunities out there on the horizon? Thanks.","Timothy Leach","Sure. We've built a pretty sizable team that's focused on this and it's interesting out, say, that different operators - most operators have awaken to the importance of this, some I think are a lot better than others and we're trying to pretty hard to get those done. We did 15 trades of significance last year. I think, we've already closed 5 in the first quarter of this year, so that the cadence is picking up.","But when I look at what's on the horizon, there's a lot more to do and a lot more to come, kind of getting maybe to the heart of your question there, there are one or two really significant trades last year and we're trying pretty, we've got kind of one or two more like that that we're working on, but the bulk of these are trading a section here for a section there and maybe a little bit bigger than that, which just requires a lot of attention to detail. But it's a big part of our business, but it's also a huge way to make our plans better.","Mike Kelly","Appreciate that. And follow up, I'm just curious about to get your thoughts on kind of the current returns you're seeing, if we compare Midland versus the Delaware. We track your 60 day rates every quarter and can't help but notice that Delaware now seems to really have accelerated now almost 2x what the Midlands doing, 30 or 60-day rates at the end oil metric to look at, but just really kind of curious if Midland rates return to really - continue to keep up the Delaware? Thanks.","Timothy Leach","Sure. I mean, it's a fair point in terms of the initial rates in the Delaware tending to be higher, but remember there's also a capital component that the Midland Basin wells tend to be less expensive and they also do not decline as fast. So we really like having both suites of assets and from a rate of return standpoint they are competitive with each other and you highlight a really, I think, important and interesting point, which is especially for operators like ourselves who have moved into this large-scale project development, 30-day rates or even 60-day rates are really not as good of an indicator of the quality of a well as they used to be, because we're being very mindful as we flow these wells back and, also, as we set the facilities to maximize the returns not just the initial 30-day rates that going to slide. So that is an issue out there.","Mike Kelly","Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of David Deckelbaum with Cowen. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","David Deckelbaum","Good morning, Tim, Jack, and everyone. Thanks for taking my questions.","Jack Harper","Good morning, David.","David Deckelbaum","I'm curious and we all know there's - the beat on production, some of that was attributed to the non-op activity, which you've discussed. Can you give a little bit more color on, sort of, the timing of beats that you've experienced relative to the initial assumptions and then considering you raised your guidance which seems to, sort of, just give credit for the 1Q beat and do you do not necessarily believe that those timelines are achievable through the rest of the year. And I guess how does that frame - how do you think that you can being improving your efficiency as you head into 2020?","Jack Harper","Sure. I'd say the beat in the first quarter, which was pretty significant, was a combination of a couple of things, the non-op that we've highlighted, also getting a couple of these very sizable project on ahead of schedule. And so, there was something a little unique to the quarter maybe in that. But, I mean, underlying all of that is, we continue to see really strong results across our portfolio. And so, I think, that's what gave us the confidence to raise the overall annual guidance.","David Deckelbaum","Fair enough. I guess just more specifically what contributed to bringing those projects on earlier? It doesn't sound like it was necessarily a function of drilling days, I guess as you all allocated more time just having crews on location before time?","Timothy Leach","No. I mean, it really was a series of smaller gains that add up to something that's pretty meaningful. I think it's - our teams are really good at executing and as we do more and more of these large-scale projects, they'd find ways to grind efficiencies that service both on costs and timing. We expect them to find more of that, we're not baking anything into that - into our plan, of course, but I think that's really what drove getting those projects on this quarter as opposed to early in the second quarter.","David Deckelbaum","I appreciate the color. And just my follow up would be, the second being my OpEx, when you look at the Midland rates on just a productivity per foot, outside of - is there anything that would explain the decline sequentially? Is it more of a function of midstream constraints, just zones that you are targeting and longer cleanup time? Is there any color you could add there?","Timothy Leach","Sure. We've talked about that just a moment ago on the previous question. I mean there is a couple of different things that - effectively one is just managing the flow back of a bunch of long-lateral wells coming into a single facility and having signed that facility to maximize your rate of return versus your initial 30 to 60-day rate, that's a piece of it. There's also just a sample size you're looking at relatively limited number of wells within a quarterly period.","So I wouldn't read too much into it. Also just last piece, I think you kind of referenced this, is that, we continue to push lateral lengths. And as you lengthen your laterals, there is a huge pickup in the rate of return, there is generally linear increase in the EUR, but you don't see a linear increase in the initial rate, especially when you're doing 10, 12, 15 at the same time.","David Deckelbaum","I appreciate it. Thanks for the responses.","Timothy Leach","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Bob Brackett with Bernstein Research. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Bob Brackett","A number of mine has been answered already, so if I could dig into the comment made about Permian targets having a bunch of hair on them. Could you give some color on that? What types of hair you might find on a target?","William Giraud","Yeah. That was a technical term of art, I guess. It's broken up - it all falls into buckets of the things that we look at it or components of our strategy. So the broken up assets that are contiguous, it would be not having a team that can execute, it would be not having the size and scale necessary to get the pricing that the larger companies get and then there is the integration and the mixture of cultures. The culture of execution is a rare commodity. And so, integrating cultures together is a very difficult thing. You don't see that on a spreadsheet.","Bob Brackett","Great. I appreciate that. Thanks.","William Giraud","Very well.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Leo Mariani with KeyBanc. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Leo Mariani","Hey, guys. I wanted to follow up a little bit with the comment that you made regarding, I guess, declining activity levels as the year progresses. So, clearly, I guess lower activity in the second half of the year, this year, versus the first half, just wanted to get a sense of how that can play out as we head into 2020? Do you guys expect it to kind of ramp back up a fair bit, kind of early in 2020, because I know - I think that you'd previously kind of said that 2020 CapEx will be very similar to 2019. Maybe if you can just kind of describe that dynamic a little bit in 2020?","Jack Harper","Sure. At a very high level, as we've described, we see the rig count trending down over the year, but when we look at the average rig count year-over-year, it's pretty similar. So - but the cadence will be a little down before it moves back up, but in terms of on-average, it's very similar, maybe up a little next year.","Leo Mariani","Okay. All right. I guess just with respect to second quarter, looking at your production guidance, I guess, it's down a few percent in Q2 with the expectation versus 1Q. I know that you folks said that you brought on kind of more wells than expected in 1Q, but as I kind of looked at your slide deck, I mean, it looks like a number of those kind of came on late in the quarter, which should, I guess, benefit second quarter production. I think you guys are still putting a fair number of wells on it in the second quarter. Can you just provide, maybe, a little bit more color around why you expect the production decline to a little bit in 2Q versus 1Q?","Timothy Leach","Sure. I think, Will described it earlier. We are bringing on fewer wells in the second quarter than in any other quarter of the year. And so, it's just not enough to offset declines from the previous wells that didn't put on production, so it's timing. But you see that come back with a modestly higher fourth quarter guidance. So I think that's what you should expect.","Leo Mariani","Okay. Helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Charles Meade with Johnson Rice. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Charles Meade","Yes. Good morning, Tim, to you and to your whole team there. I appreciate you guys taking up - taking all these questions. If I could go back to this question, I think a lot of people hit on it - of your - your operational pace, but ask more specifically, how things are playing out versus the guidance for rig count by quarter you guys gave for 4Q reporting?","So I would imagine that as you complete projects more quickly, like you did and bring things on earlier as you did 1Q that your rig count would actually drop more quickly than originally contemplated. But 1Q you guys averaged 33 versus 32, which you guided last quarter and right now you are at 29 versus the 26 average that you guys had laid out for 2Q. So what are the other pieces of the picture that filling those variances?","Timothy Leach","Well, Charles, I mean, on some level, I'd say, our pencil is not that sharp. But I mean I would say that the first quarter landed from a rig activity standpoint about exactly where we thought it would, to your point that we're at 29 today. I mean, it's just May. So we're still - we're in the middle of the quarter and we're moving to low-20s pace as we move into the summer here. So, as Jack emphasized, I think, at the beginning of the call, we are going to land our budget this year. And so, we're going to maneuver as best we can to accomplish that.","Charles Meade","Got it. That's helpful. And then just a quick follow-up on the Dominator to kind of help us contextualize what we're going to see with lower sales there. How many landing zones in the Wolfcamp A did you have? Did you try on for those 23 wells?","Jack Harper","It's interesting if you look at a gun barrel of those things. It's actually - you can see that the West half and East half are two very different spacing test, and so there's five landing zones kind of tested in total. If you look over in the East half, there is more of a traditional three landing zones stack over the West half.","Charles Meade","Got it. That's helpful. Thank you.","Timothy Leach","Thank you.","Jack Harper","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jeanine Wai with Barclays. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Jeanine Wai","Hi. Good morning, everyone.","Timothy Leach","Good morning.","Jeanine Wai","Just following up on Charles's question just now. I just wanted to clarify something. You mentioned that you are already thinking about pairing back operator activity this year to stay within budget. I just wanted to clarify that that comment was in reference to the plan your released last quarter, where you're getting down to the 24 rigs starting in the back half of this year or if it was kind of in response to how the operating environment and the efficiency that you're seeing here to-date?","Jack Harper","Yeah, I'll answer that. It's - I was comparing that to what we talked about last quarter, but the bottom line is we're going to land the budget and it's not a perfect science with different working interest and different activity from other operators, but if it requires going lower than that 24, we will be willing to do that.","Jeanine Wai","Okay. And then, I guess, just digging into that a little bit more, just from the operational perspective, in terms of how you - if you were to dip below that 24 rigs efficiencies or better, cost inflation runs ahead of schedule or whatever, does the current service environment allow you to reduce factory utilization like we heard from some other operators at the end of the year?","And kind of what - how do you envision your operational efficiency changing if you have to go below the 24 rigs? And I know there's ratio that people usually like to keep between rigs and crews, and so I guess, adding to that, does the evolution to, say, the 80% large development projects this year, does that push you more towards a bunch of the non-operational levers that you can pull?","So, for example, you mentioned a bunch of transactional things like you could do just in time, well, where sales or trades and\/or non-consent, just trying to see how the decision making changes this year versus prior years?","Timothy Leach","Sure. I mean you covered the waterfront of a lot of a different options we have as we work to stick the budget. But I don't expect there to be - I think in the earlier question is, do you expect there to be some loss of operational efficiency for making these changes and the answer is no.","Jeanine Wai","Okay. Thank you for taking my questions.","Timothy Leach","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And I'm showing no further questions at this time, and I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Tim Leach for any further remarks.","Timothy Leach","Thank you. Once again, this is a - as I said, is the most exciting time for Concho, as we're able to execute and deliver on all this work we've prepared over the years. So I appreciate your interest in the company. Look forward to talking to you again next quarter. Thank you.","Operator","And, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference.

My name is Fab and I will be your operator for today. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.","I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Mr. Price Moncrief, Vice President of Capital Markets and Strategy. Please proceed.","L. Price Moncrief","Thank you, Fab. Good morning everyone. We\u2019re glad you could join us today for Concho\u2019s second quarter 2012 conference call. Before we get started, I would like to direct your attention to the forward-looking statement Disclaimer contained in the press release.","In summary, it says that statements in last night\u2019s press release and on this conference call, that state the company\u2019s or management\u2019s expectations or predictions of the future are forward-looking statements intended to be covered by the Safe Harbor provisions under the Federal Securities Law. There are many factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations, including those we\u2019ve described in the press release, our 10-K and other filings with the SEC. In addition, we will reference certain non-GAAP measures, so be sure to see the reconciliations in our earnings release.","On today\u2019s call, I\u2019m joined by Tim Leach, our Chairman and CEO; Joe Wright, our Chief Operating Officer; and Steve Pruett, Senior Vice President of Corporate Development, who will discuss our second quarter results. We are also joined by other members of our management team, who\u2019ll be available to answer your questions later in the call.","With that, I would now like to turn the call over to Tim.","Timothy A. Leach","Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining our second quarter conference call. I\u2019m joined in Midland today by our officer team, who look forward to taking your questions later in the call.","Before I turn things over to Joe and Steve, I\u2019d like to spend a few minutes talking about our performance and accomplishments during the quarter, as well as our expectations going in the second half of the year. As you most likely read in our earnings release last night, during the second quarter production was curtailed by about 3,000 Boe\u2019s per day, due to gas plant turnarounds. And our oil realizations were negatively impacted by the widening of the Midland Tucushion basis differential. So, this created a tough quarter for Concho. The good news is that both of these challenges appear to be behind us and our fundamentals remain intact.","In addition, we are still on track to achieve the targets we set for 2012 production growth and capital spending. The Permian Basin remains the place to be in terms of profitability and oil growth. Although, price realizations were negatively impacted due to takeaway disruptions during the quarter, we still delivered a 74% cash margin, which remains one of the best in the industry.","Activity in the Permian reached unprecedented levels during the second quarter with rig count surpassing the 500 mark previously set in the early 80s. As the second largest oil producer in the Permian Basin, with over a million gross acres, we\u2019re exposed to some of the highest rate of return plays in the country. And against a backdrop of an increasingly unpredictable economy, it\u2019s encouraging to know that Concho has the ability to organically grow profitably in a broad range of commodity price environments.","One of our most significant accomplishments during the second quarter was the acquisition of the Permian assets from Three Rivers Operating Company. The Three Rivers acquisition represents our largest and most strategic acquisition since Marbob in 2010. And just like the Marbob, Henry and Chase acquisitions, this slightest deal was privately negotiated and provides an opportunity to deploy our big drilling and operating machine to accelerate and optimize the activity on these assets.","We expect that the acreage we acquired from Three Rivers in the Northern Delaware Basin and the Southern Midland Basin, will provide us an additional source of growth over the next five or six years. As you know, we elected to finance the acquisition with a combination of bank debt in a planned asset divestiture.","As we continue to evaluate the non-core divestiture candidates, we\u2019re confident that expected proceeds will not only enable us to reduce borrowings and bring our leverage more inline with our optimal target, but also will provide an opportunity to redeploy capital into higher growth areas in the form of additional acreage in our more strategic areas and accelerated drilling in our horizontal plays.","Over the last few quarters, I\u2019ve spoken to you about our ongoing horizontal development efforts across our portfolio. And I think this is a major new theme as we continue to experience both faster drilling times and better well results. The drilling and capital efficiencies realized through horizontal development are compelling, and I expect Concho\u2019s mix of horizontal rigs will continue to increase, as early as like the Delaware Basin and other emerging areas, evolve into full scale development.","During the second quarter, we completed our first horizontal Cline well in Terry County in the Northern Midland Basin and plan on spudding our second horizontal Cline latter this year. Over in Upton County, we just completed our first horizontal Wolfcamp Shale Well that well drive in the heart of our Wolfberry play. And our second horizontal Wolfcamp Well in Upton County will spud in the third quarter.","Moving East over into Glasscock County, we\u2019ve drilled one horizontal Cline well, which continues to produce in line with our expectations. And we just spudded our second horizontal Cline in the area last week. And before the end of the year, we will move into our newly acquired Erian county position and test horizontal concepts on that acreage targeting either decline or the Wolfcamp shale. While, all these wells are in the early innings, there is clearly a lot going on and that\u2019s just in the Midland Basin.","Over the Northern Delaware Basin, our signs and understanding of the stack pay nature of the play continues to improve, which is evident in our mid year drilling location count, which Joe will highlight later on the call. At the beginning of 2012, we had identified of approximately 1,400 horizontal locations on our Northern Delaware Basin acreage, 10% of these were identified as second zones and multi-zone locations.","At mid year, our total horizontal count in the Northern Delaware Basin was over 2,300. 30% were identified as second zones in multi zone locations. So clearly we\u2019re making progress on quantifying the stack pay opportunity within our Northern Delaware Basin portfolio, and I expect that there is going to be more to come. Our confidence in the stack pay potential is supported by our continued drilling success. Since the beginning of the year, we\u2019ve added 36 Northern Delaware Basin horizontal wells that now have 30 days of production data, bringing our total horizontal wells completed by Concho to 91 targeting 7 unique zones.","In total, the average 30 day IP rate of those 91 wells continues to increase and remains comfortably above 700 Boe\u2019s a day from single zone completions. And as I\u2019ve said in the past, we do plan to drill our first do a lateral well in the Delaware Basin before the end of the year.","The last area that I\u2019d like to highlight is our Southern Delaware Basin position. The vertical wells we drilled and the data we collected, suggest multiple horizontal targets within the Wolfcamp Shale and Bone Spring. Today, we drilled and completed three horizontal Wolfcamp shale wells, two of which have been producing for more than 30 days.","One of those wells in particular has received some public attention and while we do not comment on individual well performance, we\u2019re encouraged by early horizontal results in this area, as they\u2019ve been similar to our success in the northern part of the basin. While our horizontal success in the Southern Delaware basin is concentrated in Reeves County, we intend to test other portions of our 140,000 acres in this play before the end of the year.","So as you can tell there is a lot going on and despite a challenging quarter, we\u2019re right on plan to the first half of the year, and on track to meet both our capital and production guidance for the full year. But more importantly, the opportunities and sources of sustainable growth in the Permian Basin are abundant. I\u2019m confident that Concho\u2019s position to take full advantage.","So I look forward to taking your questions at the end of the call. And now I would like to turn things over to Joe.","E. Joseph Wright","Today I\u2019m going to address production and [price realizations] operating and capital cost trends, our mid year drilling location update and our expected drilling program for balance of 2012.","Let me start with the production for the second quarter, which was negatively impacted by both scheduled and unscheduled gas plant processing maintenance and expansion work at the Linam Ranch plant and the Halley Gas processing plant.","We estimate their production curtailments during the second quarter were 3,000 Boe\u2019s per day, causing us to report an average rate for the second quarter below consensus expectations. Both the Linam and the Halley plants have returned to normal operating levels. So we expect the recent turnaround challenges to be isolated events.","From a planning and annual guidance standpoint schedule turnarounds in the Permian occur annually. And so Concho specifically takes this into account. As a result, we are not changing our annual production guidance of 28.7 million to 29.8 million Boe\u2019s. Going forward, activity levels across the Permian will likely remain at elevated levels and NGL takeaway capacity will remain tight until additional capacity like the Lone Star pipelines and Sandhills pipeline are operational.","During the first quarter conference call, I talked about the expected impact of the widening Midland-to-Cushing basis differential on our oil realization. That differential averaged approximately $5 per barrel deduct during the second quarter. Historically, the five-year average differential was $0.22 per barrel with very little volatility. Fortunately, the events that led up to the unprecedented differentials in the second quarter are largely resolved, and the current differential sits at less than $1 per barrel.","Our unhedged realized price for the quarter was 92% of NYMEX oil, which is just below our annual guidance of 93% to 95%. But as I said on our first quarter call, we do not expect the widening differentials during the second quarter to have an impact on our annual guidance. Longer-term, we will need projects like the West Texas Gulf expansion, the Longhorn reversal and the BridgeTex Pipeline to provide additional oil takeaway capacity in order to avoid another widening in our basis differentials.","In the second quarter, we reported per unit LOE slightly above our annual guidance. The biggest contributor of our higher LOE expense has been related to work overs. In fact, our direct LOE per barrel has been declining since the fourth quarter of 2011. Our annual guidance is based on historical data, and the work over component is the most difficult to project.","Going forward, we will need to digest the impact of the Three Rivers integration and planned asset divestiture to have a better understanding of longer-term LOE trends, including work overs. In the meantime for 2012, I would guide you toward the upper end of our annual lease operating expense guidance, which is $7.50. But expect the third and fourth quarters to average $7.50 to $8 as we reflect the impact of the Three Rivers assets.","On the service cost side, we\u2019re seeing softening in pricing, especially large ticket items like pipe, pressure pumping and rigs. In addition, we are experiencing cost savings due to improved logistics and scheduling thanks to drilling efficiencies, getting wells online faster and an increasing supply of services.","Shifting gears now to our midyear inventory update, we have identified over 10,600 locations across our portfolio, which compares to approximately 8,900 locations at year-end 2011. The acquisition of the Three Rivers and PDC are reflected in our midyear numbers. It\u2019s worth noting that the midyear inventory account no longer includes the 364 vertical Wolfbone locations that were reflected in our drilling location inventory at the beginning of the year.","Our expectation is to replace these vertical locations with horizontal wells by year-end. In addition, our midyear inventory does not reflect horizontal opportunities in our other emerging areas in the southern Delaware Basin, the northern Midland Basin, eastern shelf in the Midland basin, our newly acquired acreage in the southern Midland Basin, or our legacy Wolfcamp acreage.","With that, let me give you some detail on what we identified across our portfolio, starting with the Delaware basin. Substantially all of the 2,375 locations identified in this area target horizontal objectives like the Avalon, Bone Spring and Wolfcamp in the northern Delaware Basin.","As Tim noted in his comments, our drilling success in this part of the basin has translated to greater confidence in our multi-zone potential, which is why 30% of our northern Delaware Basin locations are classified as multi-zone. That compares to 10% at the end of 2011.","In New Mexico shelf area, we have currently identified 2,470 locations, which includes 1,559 verticals Yeso locations. The most significant development with respect to inventory in the shelf area is identification of 369 horizontal Yeso locations.","Concho has drilled 15 horizontal wells this year and will drill at least 15 more before the end of the year. We are still testing horizontal Yeso concepts in the shelf and in the Southwest extension of the shelf, which may lead to additional horizontal locations. These wells cost $3 million to $4 million, and the early results have been encouraging, which is why we continue to add horizontal rigs in the shelf.","Over in Texas, we have identified 5,772 locations, 2,064 of which target the vertical target the vertical Wolfberry play through 40-acre spacing and 2629 of which target the Wolfberry owned 20-acre spacing.","We also have included 927 vertical shallow Wolfcamp locations in Irion and Schleicher Counties that were part of the Three Rivers acquisition. As we discussed on the acquisition conference call, we expect to develop these horizontally going forward. Instead, we will begin testing horizontal concepts targeting the Wolfcamp or client shale\u2019s later this year in those counties.","The last topic I\u2019d like to discuss is our drilling plan and capital budget for the remainder of the year. While our 2012 capital budget remains the same at $1.5 billion, we are planning to shift a greater portion of our remaining capital towards horizontal drilling.","As Tim suggested in his comments, relative to our vertical program, we are seeing greater efficiencies in our horizontal program in terms of capital dollars per flow and barrel. As we move forward. So as we move forward through the balance of 2012, our overall rig count is going to average around 30 to 35 rigs, about 40% of which will be horizontal. And as we continue to de-risk the emerging plays across our portfolio, I expect our horizontal mix will continue to increase.","And now I would like to turn it over to Steve.","Steven H. Pruett","Thank you, Joe. The Three Rivers acquisition closed on July 2 for $1 billion, and was funded with borrowings under our credit facility. Given the timing of this closing, this acquisition did not impact our second quarter results. We are pleased to report the integration of the Three Rivers assets is going smoothly.","Going forward, Concho remains committed to its core philosophy of financial discipline in maintaining a conservative capital structure. Proceeds from our non-core asset divestiture will be applied towards reducing borrowings under our credit facility and will reduce our pro forma debt to EBITDAX ratio within our targeted level. We expect our non-core asset divestitures to close before year-end.","During the second quarter, we successfully increased the commitments under our credit facilities $2.5 billion. Taking into account the proceeds used to fund the Three Rivers acquisition, we currently have approximately $1.4 billion drawn on our credit facility, leaving $1.1 billion in available liquidity.","Costs incurred for the first half of 2012 were $730 million for exploration and development capital. We also invested $227 million in property acquisitions, which excludes the Three Rivers acquisition that closed after the end of the quarter.","Concho continues to maintain an active oil hedging program. Approximately 80% of our expected oil production in the second half of 2012 is hedged at $96 per barrel. In conjunction with the Three Rivers acquisition, you\u2019ll recall that we added oil hedges on $2.4 million barrels of oil and a weighted average price of about $93 per barrel for the remainder of 2012 through 2017.","A key component of our growth strategy is the ability to reinvest high margin cash flow into high rate of return projects. In these exceedingly volatile times, it\u2019s encouraging to know that Concho was able to maintain strong cash margins as a primary source of reinvestment capital.","During the second quarter, our unhedged realized price was $63.43 per BOE with a 74% cash margin. Our cash flow and profits continue to be significantly tied to oil, which comprises 62% of our total volumes and 84% of our revenues for the quarter. When combining our oil and NGL revenue, liquids represent 96% of our revenue in the second quarter.","Oil price realizations, excluding the effects of derivative settlements, were $85.62 per barrel, a decline of 13% from $98.16 per barrel realized in Q1. NYMEX WTI Cushing prices declined 9%, while the previously noted increase in the Midland-Cushing differential made up the balance of the decline in oil price quarter-over-quarter.","Gas price realizations, excluding the effect of derivative settlements, were $4.58 per McF in Q2, which declined 21% from Q1 due to a 21% decline in Mont Belvieu NGL prices and a 20% decline in the El Paso Permian Basin pipeline index, which is used in form of those pricing some of the company\u2019s natural gas.","The realized natural gas price differential to NYMEX was 195% for the quarter. We expect this premium in Henry Hub to decline in the second half of the year with the decline in NGL prices and the recent improvement in NYMEX natural gas prices.","At this time, we would like to turn the call over to our moderator who will take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) And your first question will come from the line of John Freeman with Raymond James.","John Freeman \u2013 Raymond James & Associates","Good morning, guys.","Timothy A. Leach","Hey, John.","John Freeman \u2013 Raymond James & Associates","The first question, you were good enough to give the average 30-day rates on the Northern Delaware basin horizontals you\u2019ve drilled to-date. I was wondering if you can do the same thing for the 15 horizontal Yesos that you\u2019ve done that gave you the confidence to add those locations?","E. Joseph Wright","John, this is Joe. Those average rates on those horizontal Yeso, let me pull that together and get that to you so I get a better number, but we\u2019ve seen a variety up to as much as 400 barrels plus associated gas and then we\u2019ve seen some down about 180 to 200 barrels. So, there is a pretty good range in there. I\u2019d like to pull those numbers together there for you.","John Freeman \u2013 Raymond James & Associates","Okay, sure. And then, if I\u2019m sort of thinking about the way you went about testing the Yeso before kind of putting out the horizontal locations. If I\u2019m thinking about the Southern Delaware where right now, conservatively you\u2019re not providing horizontal locations. If you\u2019ve done three so far, you\u2019ve got seven more, puts you around 10 at the end of the year. I guess, kind of thinking about it should be when you report, I guess, fourth quarter results is when we would get the horizontal locations for the Southern Delaware, does that timeline sound about right?","E. Joseph Wright","Yeah, and John, that would give us a chance to run it by our third-party engineers as well and run all those results, because it\u2019s a new area. It\u2019s horizontal drilling. So we would really like to get the backup of a third-party before we talk about it too publicly.","John Freeman \u2013 Raymond James & Associates","Okay. And then, last question for me and I\u2019ll turn it over to somebody else. I just want to make sure I\u2019m looking at the rig number on an apples-to-apples basis, but after you did the Three Rivers deal, the thought was you would be running 43 rigs on average second half \u201812. Now its 33, but you\u2019re able to basically maintain a production guidance because just how much more prolific these horizontals are, is that right?","E. Joseph Wright","Yes. I think that\u2019s a good way to think about it. And the other point on that, I think is that, our rig count is more reflecting landing our budget on the number that we projected and not a reflection of economics in the projects. It\u2019s just we had more activity in the front half of the year. The horizontal wells, as we said on the call, are more efficient as far as dollars per flowing barrels. So you get more bang for the buck there.","John Freeman \u2013 Raymond James & Associates","Great. I appreciate guys. Thanks.","E. Joseph Wright","Thanks, John.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Brian Lively with Tudor, Pickering, Holt.","Brian Lively \u2013 Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Hi, good morning.","E. Joseph Wright","Good morning, Brian.","Brian Lively \u2013 Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Tim, on the reiteration of your annual volume guidance, just thinking about the second quarter and being down sequentially. Doesn\u2019t that imply that you\u2019ve actually increased guidance over the second half of the year, and is that related to just more confidence around the horizontal program going forward or was it just reflective of you guys having some kind of fat already in those numbers?","Timothy A. Leach","Well, I would say we do have more confidence on our horizontal drilling, I don\u2019t know, the way I think about it is not that we are increasing our guidance. So I tend to think about it in terms of, we knew these turnarounds. I mean they\u2019ve happened this time of the year for the last several years. And we kind of built that into our estimates. So, while these turnarounds lasted longer and some of the things were not planned that happened when they started [the plants] back up. We still think this is well within our comfort zone that we planned for, and in fact, we still feel pretty good about the top of the range on production numbers.","Brian Lively \u2013 Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","And this is more of a timing question, but it looks like in the second quarter you completed about 30% more wells than what you completed in the first quarter. And I was just wondering from a timing standpoint, were those completions more weighted to the end of the quarter, given you guys were already planning some maintenance downtime?","E. Joseph Wright","Yeah, this is Joe. I think as you kind of think in between quarters, sometimes just timing of getting those wells on production, finishing up stimulation jobs, frac jobs, and getting them on production kind of sometimes pushes them to where one quarter may have more than the other. Just from a timing standpoint of getting those on production, I would say they probably are a little more weighted towards the end than they are in the first part, so.","Brian Lively \u2013 Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Last question for me is just on the Midland Wolfcamp side. I know it\u2019s early, I know you guys have drilled one wells, but when you look at some of the industry well results, we also look at some of the JVs, at least one of the JVs that have been done already. Shouldn\u2019t it be reasonable for us to assume that your Wolfcamp wells and Upton and your greater Wolfberry play should be similar to what the industry has posted already?","E. Joseph Wright","We don\u2019t know, so I\u2019m going to tell you, I wouldn\u2019t assume anything yet. We really like our acreage the Wolfcamp on our acreage is really strong, but as you get up to the western boundary of that shelf edge in the Midland Basin, the Wolfcamp changes, it becomes a better reservoir actually. And I think we said publicly that we think at least half our acreage is really prospective for that horizontal Wolfcamp, but we\u2019re just drilling our first well. So I would most of the industry data that I think you are referring to is more in the center of basin and it\u2019s deeper and it\u2019s thinner there. And so, I expect ours to be somewhat different, it could be better, it could be worse.","Brian Lively \u2013 Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","And Tim just on timing, how long do you think it will take for you guys to get some confidence to at least put out some cursory inventory numbers?","Timothy A. Leach","That\u2019s probably latter part of next year sometime, I think with everything we\u2019ve got going on. I mean to get an update of where we start counting inventory horizontally. My hope and I\u2019ve said this publicly is, all of those 20 acre space locations that we\u2019re carrying that overtime that you convert those into more profitable horizontal locations.","Brian Lively \u2013 Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","That\u2019s great. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs.","Brian Singer \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you, good morning.","Timothy A. Leach","Good morning.","Brian Singer \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","","Can you give a little bit more color with regards to the Southern Delaware Basin what drove the removal of the vertical locations and what would it takes for you to actually assume the horizontals there in your inventory given that you\u2019ve been encouraged generally so far?","Timothy A. Leach","Sure. When we started acquiring acreage down there that play was, and still is for some operators a vertical play. Lot of the vertical wells, we drilled, we collected a lot of scientific data and we completed each zones separately as we came up the whole the test of productivity of each zone more as a science experiment. And I think what we discovered was that we really like the horizontal potential of that area.","And as I commented on the previous call, I think we\u2019ve got three wells there that were encouraged by. We\u2019ll have more by the end of the year plus we\u2019ll have a chance to review with our outside engineers and get another set of eyes looking at it. And then I think it will be properly appropriate for us to start talking about location counts, because it\u2019s a lot of acreage and its spread over a pretty big extent. And typical as these things work, we won\u2019t count probably all the locations on that acreage, initially. The locations we will start building around the areas where we\u2019ve drilled and had success and it will probably take a few years to get that thing fully dotted up.","Brian Singer \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it, thanks. Just to confirm on the verticals, is the removal because of your preference to move towards horizontals or because you don\u2019t see the economics of verticals, as strong as you previously did?","Timothy A. Leach","Well, it\u2019s our preference. We still think that there is positive economics on those verticals.","Brian Singer \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay, thanks. And then bigger picture if you look out there with relatively stuff fragmented in Permian Basin. Do you see and is it your priority to do continued acquisitions or is time better spends on integrating the Three Rivers assets, since you just acquired that or both?","","Timothy A. Leach","Well, I mean we have a priority of integrating assets and this divestiture is very important to us to complete the Three Rivers process, but I\u2019ll tell you the acquisitions are in our blood and there is a lot going on in the Permian right now. So, we\u2019re very picky and the things we do we want them to be immediately accretive and I think the answer to your questions both, but right now if I had to prioritize, I said priority is integrating Three Rivers and getting this divestiture completed.","Brian Singer \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","","Thanks. I could ask one more, any update on Terry county drilling?","Timothy A. Leach","No, just that we\u2019ve completed one well and we\u2019re planning the second.","Brian Singer \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of William Butler with Stephens.","William Butler \u2013 Stephens, Inc.","Good morning.","Timothy A. Leach","Good morning.","William Butler \u2013 Stephens, Inc.","Similar question over in the Southeast Midland Basin and the Erian county, you\u2019ve got in the current inventory the vertical Wolfcamp\u2019s I mean \u2013 so for conservatism should we just think about it on that basis for now too early yet to be thinking on Wolfcamp and Cline, and again, when would you expect that data?","Timothy A. Leach","","Yeah, I mean that was what they were doing when we bought those assets. That activity was making money, but our view is becoming increasingly horizontal. And we\u2019re going to jump down there and test some of that here between now and the end of the year. And I think if had asked us our view today, I think that\u2019s what we think will be the highest and best use of those assets.","William Butler \u2013 Stephens, Inc.","","On the horizontal?","Timothy A. Leach","Right.","William Butler \u2013 Stephens, Inc.","Okay. And then, can you all give us a little hint into 2013 rig count outlook. I guess another thing is, speaking more broadly, with all of the horizontal drilling that you all are doing, is it still the company\u2019s strategic goal to deliver that double-digit growth within cash flow? Any reason that should be further enhanced by horizontal drilling, or we should change our view on that?","Timothy A. Leach","Well, I think that philosophy of reinvesting our cash flow into these high rate of return projects, the horizontal stuff does compete very well with anything we\u2019ve ever done vertically. It\u2019s more capital efficient. We can get more capital invested with fewer rigs and that\u2019s influencing our thinking. When we started this capital budget process for 2013 as we have done in the past, the first thing we will do is try to make a reasonable estimate of our cash flow and build our drilling budget around that\t. And I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to take as many rigs to get that invested as it has taken in the past, because of the horizontal nature. It wouldn\u2019t surprise me if half our rigs weren\u2019t drilling horizontally in 2013.","William Butler \u2013 Stephens, Inc.","Okay. Great. That\u2019s all from me. Thank you.","Timothy A. Leach","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of David Tameron with Wells Fargo.","David Tameron \u2013 Wells Fargo Advisors LLC","Hi, morning. Most of the questions have been answered, but can you just talk about, you guys had previously indicated you may try to do a lateral in the second half of this year. Can you just talk about, is that still on the board? What do you think would be a cost advantage, and can you talk about some of the operational difficulties, of many, in doing that?","E. Joseph Wright","","This is Joe. So let me handle that question. Just from a timing standpoint, I believe we will spud that well this quarter, in the third quarter. That is our timeline. Anytime you run more than one lateral, you add some complexity, but this is something that\u2019s been done in other places. It\u2019s not something new to the industry. I think the reward outweighs risk easily. As you think about the cost of that, you have so much sunk into vertical section of a well, and we can add a second lateral for much less than the full cost of the first lateral. So when you think about efficiencies there of reserves, and the development cost of those reserves, it\u2019s significant. It\u2019s worth the risk.","David Tameron \u2013 Wells Fargo Advisors LLC","All right. So, Joe, can you talk about savings of a couple of million dollars a well type of thing if you were to be in development mode?","E. Joseph Wright","Well, I\u2019d like to get my first one done before I tell you what I think that real savings is going to have to be.","David Tameron \u2013 Wells Fargo Advisors LLC","","Right. Fair enough. Tim, can you talk about, if you\u2019re to think about what your crown jewel today, as far as your asset base, how would you characterize that or what asset would that be?","Timothy A. Leach","","That\u2019s really hard to answer, to differentiate. The Yeso has been such a wonderful asset for a such long period of time. And just when you think that you might have it becoming fully developed, this horizontal opportunity appears to be working. But I have to tell you that the Delaware basin and the multi-zone potential and the kind of rates and the kind of economics we are making on it and the geographic extent of all that is really exciting right now. So, while it\u2019s probably our smallest asset in terms of production today, I think potentially that\u2019s the thing that is really going to drive our growth in the future.","David Tameron \u2013 Wells Fargo Advisors LLC","Okay. And then, one follow-up there. So just because infrastructure is important in all of these plays, can you talk about Southern Delaware? What infrastructure is in place? How would you characterize it relative to the other parts of the basin? Assuming Wolfcamp holds up, are those results and you start to get more (inaudible) talk about that.","Timothy A. Leach","I\u2019m going to let Joe do that.","E. Joseph Wright","Yeah, this is Joe. Some areas you'll find absolutely no infrastructure in some parts of that play in the Delaware Basin and others that you have pretty good infrastructure. As we develop that northern part of the Delaware Basin down in South Eddy in South Lea County that didn\u2019t have a whole lot of infrastructure to start with either. And so you have to build roads, you have to build disposal systems, you have the electricity, and then of course your gathering facilities in terms of gas and oil. So really sometimes starting from scratch is easier than taking these old systems and trying to modify them in an area that you do have the infrastructure. So it\u2019s a big part of our planning going forward. Part of our budget, we always budget dollars that will go straight to infrastructure that we call non-revenue generating CapEx. So we\u2019ll continue to do that, last year I think that was close to $100 million, this year about the same kind of number and next year I\u2019m not going to do probably going to be in that same range.","David Tameron \u2013 Wells Fargo Advisors LLC","All right, that\u2019s all I got thanks for the color.","Timothy A. Leach","Thank you.","E. Joseph Wright","Thanks, David.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Neal Dingmann with SunTrust.","Neal Dingmann \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Good morning guys. Tim maybe a question just for you, Joe first, just one when you look at some of the mid-stream, as you look at the remainder of the year you see still a fair amount of maintenance and expansion work for some of the mid-stream or is that now after this last quarter pretty much behind us just for at least what you know about?","E. Joseph Wright","This is Joe again. I think we are going to stay tight in both our NGL takeaways and really accrued too and I\u2019d say I mean that is a full base in the full industry. So any County interruptions kind of have a hiccup through the system and I think we\u2019ll see some more of those as we go through the \u2013 from now to the end of the year. I feel like though that we have plane for those and I think we\u2019re again feel very good about our guidance range and really guides towards the upper end.","Neal Dingmann \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Great and then just one follow-up I could. You continue to do great job just on overall well cost, Joe, I guess now when you kind of look at the, the horizontal is kind of two questions I guess just maybe in just the Delaware Basin in general. Just overall what you are seeing and sort of on service cost. Are you seen it continued general trend of those coming down and then beside just those general cost, will you continue to see because of some efficiencies that you still have upcoming, where you continue to see cost, do you believe, decline because of that also?","E. Joseph Wright","I think both we have seen some softening, as I said before in the bigger ticket items. Some where larger than others I think generally as you think about it today that\u2019s probably 5% to 6% kind of number. Efficiency wise we are getting faster and that always helps from a cost standpoint. Everyone will have a long wells but for the most part we are getting much faster, some wells we are drilling in less than 15 days from surface to TD. That\u2019s setting three strings pipe, so that\u2019s a pretty good, a pretty short period of time. So we are starting to see those efficiencies take hold.","Neal Dingmann \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","That\u2019s great color. Thanks, Joe.","E. Joseph Wright","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Scott Hanold with RBC Capital Markets.","Scott Hanold \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Good morning.","Timothy A. Leach","Good morning.","Scott Hanold \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Obviously, it\u2019s pretty clear you are all looking at a lot more horizontal activity going forward because it seems like the economics are looking strong. Can you just in general give us a sense of, when you look back at the new traditional vertical plays versus some of the stuff that\u2019s going on horizontally? How do those economic stack up against each other and so obviously the horizontal basin look very strong but how do the economic stack up?","Timothy A. Leach","Yeah, well I think we are about to put out a slide. That we\u2019ll compare some of the economics, but I think it\u2019s important to point out that when we started the year we were drilling more Avalon shale wells in Eddy County on the western side. They tended to be gas here. And as we discovered that we moved more of the drilling to the Bone Spring sand wells, which were oilier. And just because of the difference in oil price and gas price those have much stronger economics. I'd say, and this is going to be a growth generalization, but typically those horizontal oily sand wells have probably a rate of return that\u2019s 10 points higher than our normal stuff, and the gas wells are about 10 points lower than our normal stuff. In the normal stuff, I\u2019m talking about Wolfberry and Yeso vertical wells.","Scott Hanold \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Okay. So you are seeing stronger economics as you go for horizontal oily parts of the basin?","Timothy A. Leach","Yeah, and I think that\u2019s based on well cost today. It really don\u2019t have the benefit of moving into that kind of manufacturing operation, I still think there is a lot of room for us to drive down the cost.","Scott Hanold \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Okay, okay. Good to hear. Thanks for that. And when you look at obviously, potentially, you said your acquisitions are in your blood. Are you still primarily looking at the Permian Basin or is there any thought like bigger picture over time that you strategically having another large core area makes sense?","Timothy A. Leach","I mean, I\u2019ll tell you today that all our focus is on the Permian, but from time to time, we see opportunities that include assets outside the Permian. So I think we have to at least be familiar enough to answer the questions in other areas, in other parts of the country that you believe compete with the Permian and where Concho would have an advantage. And right now, I think we have such a strong advantage here close to home, that\u2019s hard to make anything compete.","Scott Hanold \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Understood. Thank you, guys.","Timothy A. Leach","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Irene Haas with Wunderlich Securities.","Irene Haas \u2013 Wunderlich Securities Inc.","Hi, I have two questions. Firstly, in the Midland basin, you are active in Terry County. Just kind of want to know the competitive landscape, who else is around. And I assume your first well is Red Headed Stranger and has it hit 30 days yet. And the second well, you\u2019re going to drill, would you consider drilling more wells in Terry County? So that\u2019s my first question. The second one is Pecos County. My quick question for you is, do you like it as much as Reeves County. And then, how do you pick zones that you that you like sort of 1000 plus for the feet of section?","Timothy A. Leach","That was more than two questions, I think Irene.","Irene Haas \u2013 Wunderlich Securities Inc.","Okay.","Timothy A. Leach","All right, let\u2019s go, Terry County. We are being pretty guarded on what we say about that for competitive reasons and that is just early. So now our first well hasn\u2019t been on for 30 days. The competitive nature of it. There are operators from very small independents to major oil companies that have acreage in that play. And on your question about Pecos and Reeves, all our wells are in Reeves. We have considerable amount of acreage in Pecos, but we haven\u2019t the drilling hasn\u2019t moved in that direction across the County line yet. So I think that will happen more towards the end of the year. And Matt Hyde has done a great job of, while I was encouraging him to hurry as fast as he could, we drilled vertical test holes first, we took a lot of core, we tested lot of zones coming up the hole and those wells are kind of as I said on the call both Wolfcamp and Bone Spring sand looks like our potential target in that area.","Irene Haas \u2013 Wunderlich Securities Inc.","And how many zones have you picked? You know it\u2019s pretty thick section there. So I mean how many have you kind of arrived at for your shortlist?","Timothy A. Leach","Well, we only completed in one zone. I\u2019m looking at Matt, he is sitting down the table. And we probably tested \u2013 we tested a couple in the Wolfcamp and the three sands and the Bone Spring from a vertical standpoint.","Matthew G. Hyde","We are talking Southern Delaware basin at this point.","Timothy A. Leach","Right, right.","Matthew G. Hyde","At this point our horizontals are in the Wolfcamp, but we had verticals zone test in several other zones that you indicated.","Irene Haas \u2013 Wunderlich Securities Inc.","Great, thanks.","Timothy A.

Leach","Good morning","Pearce Hammond \u2013 Simmons & Company International","Can you provide an update on where current production is right now, post Three Rivers close, and then where you think the exit rate will be at the end of the year?","Timothy A. Leach","Yeah. Pearce, we typically don\u2019t provide exit rate data, we\u2019re comfortable as Joe mentioned that the disruptions we had from the gas plant turnarounds or behind us. So, things are back more to steady-state, but we don\u2019t do exit rate guidance or current rates.","Pearce Hammond \u2013 Simmons & Co. International","But to clarify, you are biasing your production to the high-end of the guidance for this year.","E. Joseph Wright","That is correct.

International","And then Tim, if you can do a little compare and contrast on your Texas Permian acreage between Cline and the Wolfcamp formations? And what you see in the product mix, IP rates is one zone and bit more attractive than the other et cetera.","Timothy A. Leach","","In which area are you referring to?","","Pearce Hammond \u2013 Simmons & Co. International","The Texas Permian and specifically, the Cline and the Wolfcamp.","Timothy A. Leach","","The Texas Permian, in the Midland Basin you are talking about?","Pearce Hammond \u2013 Simmons & Co. International","Yeah, the Midland Basin, exactly.","Timothy A. Leach","Okay. Well the, firstly here, we have drilled mostly Cline wells in the Midland Basin. I don\u2019t think we have any Wolfcamp production to contrast it with. And those Cline wells, we don\u2019t have many of them completed with very much data, but I would tell you that they tend to look like, what you\u2019re seeing other members of industry do in the southern part of the Midland Basin.","Pearce Hammond \u2013 Simmons & Co.

Joseph Wright","Hi Mike.","Michael Scialla \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","I got on the call late, so I apologize if you answered any of these questions already, but your inventory 10,617 gross locations. Do you have a corresponding net number for that?","E. Joseph Wright","No, I do not Mike right now with me.","Timothy A. Leach","And that has continued to go up on these locations. We tend to have a much higher interest than what we\u2019ve had in the past.","L. Price Moncrief","Hey Mike, it\u2019s Price. If you want to give me a call, we can go through that.","Michael Scialla \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay.

And then Tim you mentioned replacing a lot of the vertical Wolfberry wells, the 20-acre spacing with \u2013 your hope is anyway that those get replaced with horizontal Wolfcamp. Is it fair to say that over the next year or so the absolute inventory might go down in terms of number of locations, but the resource potential would increase.","Timothy A. Leach","Yeah, I think that\u2019s directionally correct. I mean it\u2019s a little bit tricky when you replace a number of vertical locations with a horizontal, because you\u2019re counting the one horizontal, but it maybe replacing, in some cases that does in vertical locations.","Michael Scialla \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. And in terms of the horizontal Yeso locations that you talked about, what spacing assumption are you using there?","Timothy A. Leach","Well our verticals were spaced on 10-acre spacing.","Michael Scialla \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","In terms of the horizontals though that you have talked about now?","E. Joseph Wright","Yes, it\u2019s Joe. We had drilled some one the \u2013 on 10 acres spacing and we drilled some that would be what I call 160s right now that we have in field down to that small spacing. We got a mixture.","Michael Scialla \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. So the horizontals themselves you\u2019d say you\u2019re spacing at 160, but you\u2019ve also drilled in within the area that where you have. Tim you are speaking vertically?","E. Joseph Wright","Where you would call a 10 acre top spacing, that\u2019s correct.

Following prepared remarks, we will host a question-and-answer session. Please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up.","With that let me turn the call over to Tim.","Tim Leach","Thanks, Megan, and good morning. Yesterday's results and updated 2019 outlook reflect our continued move to a lower capital budget than originally planned this year and our desire to enter 2020 in the best position to deliver competitive production growth and increasing free cash flow.","Production for the quarter averaged 329,000 boes per day, which exceeded the high end of our guidance range and oil volumes averaged 206,000 barrels per day. We delivered these volumes while maintaining our discipline on operating costs. Controllable cash cost stayed below $10 a barrel and we're working to drive this lower through field efficiencies, debt reduction and non-core asset sales. We're focused on actively managing our portfolio to bring value forward to shareholders and reinforce our flexibility in a lower price environment.","Last year, we completed the RSP acquisition enhancing free cash flow generation of our machine and this year we're looking to high-grade the portfolio through trades and sales. Lower Permian natural gas and NGL prices weighed on our financial performance in the second quarter with realized prices down by more than 50% from last quarter. However, today, we anticipate modestly improving gas realizations for the remainder of this year. Operationally, the team is making the transition to full-field development across our assets. Our objective with project development is to maximize returns and recoveries. In that effort we've tested the limits on sand loading, lateral lengths, fluid volumes and now weld density.","We have a track record of innovation in the Permian. We've always favored the empirical data from drilling and testing. The resource took us a decade to build and now we're trying to get the program up and optimized quickly for our next two or three decades of work. We've used and we will continue to use the information we gather from these tests to make future programs better. I'm very proud of the job the team did executing on some of the most logistically sophisticated projects the company has undertaken. In the Delaware Basin, the 23 well Dominator project was designed to test logistical capabilities and well spacing that was approximately 50% tighter than our current resource assessment. While initial rates were solid, current performance data indicates that we developed the Upper Wolfcamp too densely.","We're incorporating the data into our development model to adjust spacing on future projects including those projects set to spud in the second half of 2019. In the Midland Basin, we completed the Marion Benge project ahead of schedule. This project is our largest today with 18 two mile wells targeting the Spraberry and Wolfcamp zones. Initial performance for the Marion Benge is strong and the project highlights the benefits of a large contiguous acreage position with infrastructure that can drive efficiencies. We transported the initial flow back water from this project to a recycling facility where the water was treated and used to supply 100% of the water needs for operations at a two well location nearby.","Turning to our capital program; we averaged 26 rigs in the second quarter and capital totaled $785 million, which was down 15% compared to the first quarter. Year-to-date production volumes are ahead of schedule and today we're running 18 rigs, which is below our previous plan of 24. We made the decision to adjust our drilling and completion schedule in the second half of the year to slow down and not chase incremental production at the expense of capital discipline.","We're focused on two primary objectives delivering our $2.8 billion to $3 billion plan in 2019 and positioning the company for a free cash flow inflection in 2020. For 2019, capital, activity and volumes are all now frontend weighted and we expect to exit the year with a larger than usual inventory of drilled but uncompleted wells. This will provide a strong momentum as we enter 2020 and importantly our outlook for oil growth and free cash flow in 2020 gives us confidence in our ability to reduce debt and deliver increasing returns to shareholders. Our assets are in the best part of the Permian and support our commitment to delivering value to our shareholders now and in the future. That means prioritizing capital discipline, focusing investments to deliver the greatest return, finding ways to increase productivity and decrease cost and maintaining the national strength and flexibility.","Thanks. And now I'll turn it back to the moderator and our team looks forward to taking your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from John Freeman with Raymond James. Please proceed.","John Freeman","Good morning guys.","Tim Leach","Good morning, John.","John Freeman","When given the scaled back activity, we haven't gotten an update on sort of the initial two year plan looking out through 2020 that you all gave with the 4Q 2018 release. And maybe just how we should be thinking about how this potentially impacts the 2020 initial plan that you all provided.","Jack Harper","Sure, John. This is Jack. When we first described the cadence over the next two years, we described 2020 as production numbers that translated into double-digit production growth with oil production outpacing the overall growth where we saw free cash flow at $50 oil and where we saw free cash flow approaching $1 billion at $60 oil. And that's still what we see today under that same base budget scenario.","John Freeman","And maybe when we \u2013 the follow up question, maybe when you look out to 2020 and we sort of think about what some of the potential efficiency drivers would be versus 2019 in addition to the fact that you'll go to sort of wider spacing. Maybe any color on \u2013 maybe sort of pad sizes potentially getting smaller maybe in 2020 where cycle times get quicker as opposed to some of the larger pads like what we saw with the Dominator.","Jack Harper","Yes, John. I think the average project size will remain about the same. We will enter the year with a higher than usual number of uncompleted wells, which I think will help to bridge the gap on production and timing as we work our rig count back up modestly from where we look at ending at this year. So I think having that that uncompleted well inventory as we enter the year gives us more options.","John Freeman","Okay. Thanks, Jack.","Jack Harper","You bet.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Derrick Whitfield with Stifel Financial. Please proceed.","Derrick Whitfield","All right, good morning.","Tim Leach","Good morning.","Derrick Whitfield","Perhaps for Tim or Will, as I recall the Dominator tested five zones in total with three on the eastern half and five on the western half. Is there a noticeable difference in the performance of the wells between the eastern and western half of the project?","Will Giraud","And Derrick, this is Will. We really have not seen much of a differentiation between the two sides of the project so far, but that's something we'll be watching as it continues to produce.","Derrick Whitfield","And as my follow up on Page 6 of your PowerPoint, you noted that Concho tested the upper limits of oil spacing during the second half of 2018 and first half of 2019. How many wells in projects probably pertain to that statement?","Tim Leach","You know, I don't know the number off the top of my head. Typically, I would characterize 2019 as the year that we were advancing our understanding of optimal lateral lengths, completion design and well-spacing being one of the critical variables there. Typically, where we've done that, we have added kind of one more well into a project. Dominator is the most extreme example where we went 50% beyond kind of our traditional resource spacing. So I would say that in a number of the projects we have this year and including a couple more coming on in the back half of this year, you're going to see them developed at a moderately more dense than our resource spacing, but nothing anywhere close to Dominator.","Derrick Whitfield","Got it. That's very helpful. Thanks for your time.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Neal Dingmann with SunTrust. Please proceed.","Neal Dingmann","Good morning all. Guys, Tim or Jack, it seems certainly that the brunt of the plan or primary plan is still about the capital discipline. And I'm just wondering would the lower activity and maybe obviously not getting through and you certainly have a material inventory position. Could you talk about how you would view asset sales as far as further potential upstream sales \u2013 or midstream sales? I am just wondering anything you could comment on to the details on the size, timing and potential goals around that.","Tim Leach","Yeah, we talked in the past about kind of our leverage targets. And so, the asset sales programs we're working on right now, which would include anything that we're not allocating capital to orders that non-core asset would support getting us to that leverage area quicker. And we are very focused on that. I mentioned it is one of our top priorities. So we have a number of things out right now that are being tested and expect that to yield a good result for us.","Neal Dingmann","Okay, very good. And then just lastly on the GR, it seems like the percentage there is holding up pretty well. Could you just discuss as you sort of target different areas, I mean, your thoughts for the remainder of the year into 2020. Do you still feel good about roughly around that 63% holding?","Jack Harper","Yes, Neal, this is Jack. I think it's important to remember in the first half of the year, our oil production is ahead of our expectation, so as the gas production. And we want to overcome that percentage in the back half of the year because we're slowing down. As we look forward moving back towards that mid 60s range, it\u2019s how we see things playing out over the next couple of years.","Neal Dingmann","That's helpful. Thanks guys.","Tim Leach","Thank you. You bet.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Paul Sankey with Mizuho. Please proceed.","Paul Sankey","Hi, good morning guys. Tim, you mentioned the posted of free cash flow inflection next year. At the same time, we're seeing this year some issues with some of the science project type stuff and we\u2019re seeing what seems to be gas volumes relatively higher, NGL volumes relatively higher and some disappointment around overall volumes. Can you talk a bit about how this year flushes through allowing for the disposals as well? And what you think things will look like in terms of your level of CapEx and volume growth in 2020? Thanks.","Tim Leach","Yes. Thanks, Paul. This year was a transition year for us and we entered the year hotter on capital and also hotter on production. And so, we \u2013 when oil prices came down from where they were late last year, we reduced our capital budget and our capital budget range. We think it's very important to do what we said we\u2019re going do and land the capital budget inside that range and we're continuing to drive that number down. So \u2013 and demonstrate our ability to show capital discipline and live within cash flow. So that is a driver for us for 2019. And we \u2013 on almost every project we do \u2013 we have some level of experimentation. And so, we have to fit that experimentation within the projects and the capital that we are deploying. So \u2013 and as we'll describe, 2019 was heavily weighted toward density testing.","And as we described in the past, you can't test all the variables at one time. You can't test sand loading, completion design and density all at the same time and know what you got. So that's one of the answers. We feel very confident that the landing 2019 where we said we're going to land it and instead it's up for the 2020 and beyond as the way we described it in the past as a more modest capital deployment on our properties, double-digit growth and increasing amounts of free cash flow.","Paul Sankey","Right. Is there a particular reason, I mean, I know you have the capability to grow very fast, but you're talking about double-digit growth as a general aspiration. Could you reset things to be more at a lower oil price, reinvestment rate type approach? So that we could get more conviction that we're definitely going to have a really good inflection in free cash flow next year and I'll leave it there. Thanks.","Jack Harper","Sure, we have the flexibility to move the capital up and down pretty much at our discretion. I think if this relatively similar amount of capital year-over-year demonstrating double-digit growth outpaced by oil and yielding free cash flow at $50, it seems like an appropriate level today. But next year will be like this year, there are a lot of variables in play and we'll have to see when we get to the beginning of next year of what the landscape looks like.","Tim Leach","And I think our conviction of trying to budget around a $50 oil price and then a lower gas price, I think positioning ourselves in a conservative stance is going to pay dividends and then \u2013 pay dividends and capital return. And so I think our view of the future hasn't really changed.","Paul Sankey","Great, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.","Brian Singer","Thank you. Good morning.","Tim Leach","Good morning.","Jack Harper","Good morning.","Brian Singer","I start on CapEx, given that the $2.8 billion to $3.0 billion range at the same budget that you were forecasting with fourth quarter 2018 results in February. Can you talk to what you thought you would be able to do within that budget that you aren't now, i.e., where the degradation in capital efficiency may be occurring? Or should we expect your capital spending this year will be at the low end of that $2.8 billion to $3.0 billion range?","Jack Harper","Yeah, Brian, again, I'd start with the production in the first half of the year has been ahead of our plan. In the back half of the year, it's going to be below our original plan primarily due to putting less wells on production and to some effects of the spacing tests that that Tim the Will have described. But more importantly than that is to preserve the balance sheet, keep our capital this year as close to our cash flow from operations as we can and set up for the inflection that we've described in 2020.","Brian Singer","Thanks. I completely understand the reasons for the discipline. I think I would ask on the getting fewer wells online in the second half and what it is specifically relative to the original plan that is changing the ability to get those wells on i.e., same budget, fewer wells.","Jack Harper","Yes. Well, as I described, there was a lot of noise in the beginning of the year with a production in capital and non-op capital coming in ahead of our expectations. That coupled with a declining liquids and gas price market have us inclined to bear back our capital to make sure we land well within that capital budget. We're not necessarily trying to hit the top end.","Brian Singer","Great, thanks. And then my follow-up is do you expect with regards to the debt reduction goal over two years of $500 million to $750 million. Do you expect that that can be accomplished with double-digit growth next year in the absence of further asset sales? Or do you think that the asset sales will be needed to hit that that debt reduction plan from here?","Tim Leach","We're kind of targeting debt reduction through asset sales and then the double-digit growth out of cash flow and reinvestment in our assets.","Brian Singer","Thank you.","Tim Leach","Yes, thanks.","Operator","And our next question comes from Biju Perincheril with Susquehanna. Please proceed.","Biju Perincheril","Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Tim, you mentioned that you\u2019re adjusting spacing on the wells that you're spudding now based on the results from some of the reason pilots. So just wondering how should I think about the spacing and productivity on the wells that you're telling between now and the well \u2013 when the wells that are spudding now comes online?","Tim Leach","Sure. I mean, like I could mention 2019 was a year of testing a number of different things. One of the primary variables is being well spacing. So there are still projects to come on in the back half of this year that have, as I stated, bought us to lead down spaced tests incorporated in them. I think going forward, you all expect us to revert back to that resource spacing, which I think you can generally characterize as eight across in a section. And then also would expect us as a move forward into 2020 to also test what densities \u2013 less dense than our \u2013 that resource spacing look like as well.","Biju Perincheril","Okay, that's helpful. And then the related question is certainly appreciate \u2013 can appreciate the necessity for projects such as Dominator to sort of compress your learning cycle time. So are there you know additional projects like in other zones that we should expect sometime next year or are you \u2013 do you think you have most of the data that you need at hand now?","Tim Leach","Yes, I mean, there's really nothing quite like that in the portfolio for 2019 or beyond. As we mentioned that was a test both of the intensity of activity with seven rigs and then five frac crews operating simultaneously in a square mile, but then it was also testing a density at that 150% of our resource that's greater than we've ever done. And so we've certainly learned some things about the impact of the inner well communication and spacing. We've \u2013 I think as we have said from an operational standpoint, the team did a fantastic job executing the project with it all brought on safely as planned and ahead of schedule. But clearly, the \u2013 it\u2019s the 30 and 60 day production rates were consistent with our other projects in that area, but the performance has declined and that\u2019s been cleared. It\u2019s just too tight.","Biju Perincheril","That\u2019s great. All right and if I could ask one more follow up on that is, you know, other than productivity, you're also looking at sort of the cycle time and cost savings, which you can get from the bigger projects. Can you talk about that aspect of the Dominator and what does that mean for your capital efficiency going forward?","Tim Leach","Yes, I mean, one thing that is consistent is our belief that large scale project development \u2013 there are very clear benefits both in terms of the capital efficiency you get from concentrating that much activity at one spot at one time and there's also benefits around resource recovery from developing all that resource at the same time versus coming back a year or two later to do it in different chunks. So our conviction around that certainly is the same. I just think you'll see us revert closer to the resource spacing going forward.","Biju Perincheril","Great, thank you guys. Very helpful.","Tim Leach","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Doug Leggate with Bank of America. Please proceed.","Doug Leggate","Thanks. Good morning everybody. Guys if I could just go back to the Dominator, I\u2019m really \u2013 it seems to me the market is conflating. What may have been an overly aggressive spacing test or at least the attempt to try and figure out the optimal density. But I guess what I'm really trying to understand is how does this \u2013 when you talk about remediation, how does this change the go forward development plan as you think about rightsizing large scale developments. But if I could just elaborate what I'm really trying to get out is you obviously committed a lot of capital here, which is kind of set the future for the second half of the year. So some it doesn't matter really what you do, I guess, second half is now in place with that that momentum. But does that lead you to rethink that maybe the right size of these large developments needs to be somewhat smaller? I'm just thinking philosophically how you're going to develop the portfolio going forward?","Jack Harper","Yes, I mean, in terms of the project spacing, I don't know that it has taught us anything in terms of the optimal project size, the teams executed extremely well from a logistical standpoint, getting that much work done on time actually ahead of schedule. So I do think, as we've talked about in previous calls, the optimal project size for us is probably in the 8 to 10 to 12 depending upon where you are in the Permian. But I'm not sure that Dominator gave us confidence that we can continue to push that up over time and find incremental efficiencies and how we do it.","Tim Leach","But I'd also say\u2026","Doug Leggate","Well, I guess\u2026","Tim Leach","Projects\u2026","Doug Leggate","Well, go ahead, I am sorry.","Tim Leach","This is Tim. The projects that we're looking at developing will continue to test densities and zones to continue to make our projects better. And I think you'll see us the project, not the project size will be smaller, but the densities will be smaller, both vertically and horizontally. And we will be testing that against our \u2013 the implications against our broader spacing assumptions. So I think testing is something that we and the rest of the industry will continue to do to find by zone, by area what the right answer is. And we have a very large inventory and the implications of developing that optimally both for recovery and rate of return is kind of what we're driving at. And 2019 was a very important year in gathering the kind of data that would design the programs of the future. But I think the answer to your question is they will be less dense.","Doug Leggate","Understood, thanks Tim. My follow-up is really just, hopefully relatively quick one regarding the medium turnout, like I mean your pivoted free cash flow that we have this kind of year-over-year that this kind of cash flow value of zero, zero. In other words all these guys spending all their cash flow really don\u2019t have any equity value at high levels. So I just want to underline, you guys are not backing away from that strategy. And if that is true then can you give us some ideas that what you see as the right pace or balance for your portfolio between cash returns and optimal growth, this is going to be competitive with other industrial sectors? And I\u2019ll leave it there, Thanks.","Tim Leach","Yes, I\u2019d just say that as we stated last quarter generating free cash flow in a $50 world is kind of first marker and then if we find ourselves in the $60 world where we can generate close to $1 billion of free cash flow and that\u2019s next year. And then the outline you always get better than that, and that's kind of what the plan is. That it starts with that market of a lower commodity price environment still being able to generate free cash flow at lower commodity prices.","Doug Leggate","Understood. Thanks guys. Appreciate taking the questions.","Tim Leach","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Michael Hall with Heikkinen Energy. Please proceed.","Michael Hall","Thanks, good morning. I was just curious if you could talk a little bit about kind of how you balance the shifting of activity and slowing down pretty meaningfully in the back half with the potential efficiency degradations that come with that. So kind of the balance between sticking the budget versus impacting efficiencies and how long until we might be in a place where the activity profile is in a kind of steady state type range where we won't see these swings up and down that\u2019s been probably or potentially, relatively inefficient?","Jack Harper","Sure, Michael its Jack. We lowered our capital budget to $50 and that\u2019s the way we're looking at it into the future. It had implications from bringing a budget in the 3.6 to 3.7 range down certainly in the first year. But I think importantly as we look out into the future and use that framework of \u2013 as Tim just mentioned $50 oil yielding free cash flow and growing our production double-digits that\u2019s how we're \u2013 we\u2019re getting to that point as fast as we can.","And while we are building more uncompleted wells than normal into next year, we will be able to work through that more than likely in the first half of next year and get to a more steady state range from there. But by budgeting at that consistent commodity price it should take out some of the noise that's been called this year.","Tim Leach","And with a less levered balance sheet.","Jack Harper","That's correct.","Michael Hall","Okay. And then if I could just, I guess follow-up a little bit on Brian Singer\u2019s question. How much exactly where \u2013 has like outside activity exceeded expectations in the first half of 2019 in terms of capital and volume?","Tim Leach","Yes, it\u2019s certainly been a factor. We've been very successful with the wellbore sales program we talked about in the last conference call. But the reality is activity level in the Permian are very high and there's a series of these projects that are not operated, that we want to participate in our self because the returns are very compelling. And so it's a factor as we think about the full-year 2019 budget. It continues to be a pressure point.","Michael Hall","Okay. Can you quantify, I guess in terms of dollars how much that's impacted things?","Tim Leach","Probably \u2013 it\u2019s probably in the $100 million plus above what we expected.","Michael Hall","Okay, Tim and thank you.","Tim Leach","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Drew Venker with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.","Drew Venker","Hi everyone. I was hoping you can just give us an update on the level of maintenance spend or maintenance activity for 2020 to hold exit production flat in 2020?","Tim Leach","Yes, Drew. Last quarter we talked about a level of $1.5 billion to hold the production flat and that has not changed.","Drew Venker","Okay. And just a follow-up on your free cash flow comments, Jack. For 2020 have you assumed that NGL and gas prices rebound kind of to where they were last year for 2020? Can you just talk to some of the assumptions behind that free cash flow number?","Jack Harper","Yes, our current assumption is the futures market and so we haven't assumed anything better than that.","Drew Venker","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from David Deckelbaum with Cowen. Please proceed.","David Deckelbaum","Good morning, Tim and Jack. Thanks for taking my questions.","Tim Leach","Good morning.","Jack Harper","Thank you, David.","David Deckelbaum","Just wanted to ask, I thought you had mentioned before that \u2013 there you all might consider some less dense development in 2020, relative I guess to the resource estimate. You at the point now where, I know that you've learned some things about process, but I guess, still is the MPV perception question still up for debate, and do you see like the most logical path here is kind of up spacing in order to enhance returns next year?","Tim Leach","Well, we will continue to test on both sides of spacing, but clearly in the back half of this year our bias is at the resource level or less than to continue testing in all the zones in both basins. So in general I would say 2020 versus 2019 would have less densely spaced wells.","David Deckelbaum","Okay. And then just Jack, if I might, as you talked about the broad parameters around the 20 plan, at what point now does that include rig additions? And if you contrast that to the 27 average that you guys had thought about previously, where does thinking kind of stand today as what you would need to maximize that free cash generation that you're looking for and still hit that double-digit growth?","Jack Harper","Sure. The pace we're on this year will average somewhere in the low-25 rig range. That same range is what we expect to average today for next year, which implies a bit of an increase at the beginning of next year, but as I mentioned before with this inventory of uncompleted wells that we entered the year with next year that allows us to bridge that gap as we \u2013 in activity as we add those incremental rigs.","David Deckelbaum","Sure. I appreciate that. Thank you guys.","Tim Leach","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Scott Hanold with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.","Scott Hanold","Thanks. Not to blabber the point, but you know again I'm going to go back to Brian's question on the CapEx this year relative to activity levels? And certainly, OBO is a piece of it, but can you give us some context of some of these larger projects like Dominator and such. Was there also some cost increases on those relative to your plan? I do understand they could be more efficient still, but relative to your plan that resulted in sort of the mismatch of where we are today versus your initial budget?","Tim Leach","There\u2019s really not.","Scott Hanold","Okay. All right. And then you also talked about some uncompleted wells, inventories heading into 2020. Can you just give us the relative size of that versus what, I don't know if the right word is normal levels or maybe where you were sitting in as you entered 2019?","Tim Leach","Sure. Over time we've described our level of Doug's versus rig count in kind of that 1.5 to 2 times range and that that bounces around with these large scale projects. But on average that's been a way we've looked at the world. We \u2013 as we see it today we will end the year at plus or minus 100 uncompleted wells, which is more in the 4 to 5 times range of our rig count. So higher than normal, but again I think gives us flexibility as we entered 2020.","Scott Hanold","Understood. I appreciate it. Thanks.","Tim Leach","Thank you.","Jack Harper","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Arun Jayaram with JP Morgan. Please proceed.","Arun Jayaram","Good morning. Jack I just wonder if maybe you could clarify some of your commentary on 2020 thoughts on production and free cash flow that you made on the last call. If we put in your updated oil guide for 2019, we get the volumes around 2.08 on the oil side. So \u2013 and I believe your previous guidance called for a 23% kind of two-year CAGR in oil. I think the straight number is around 250 [ph]. So I was just wondering if you could maybe give us some thoughts on 2020 and how you think the exit rate for the fourth quarter will play out on the oil side?","Jack Harper","Yes, the gap this year, it does lead to lower back half oil production. But for the year it's within 3% to 4% of the previous, say I\u2019m talking about 2019 right now. And having a modestly larger uncompleted well inventory as we enter next year helps us bridge that gap. And so as I described then and I describe now, we see 2020 is a year to grow our production in that double-digits with oil outpacing the overall Boe growth and yielding the free cash flow at 50 and approaching those same kind of larger free cash numbers of 1 billion if oil is closer to 60.","Arun Jayaram","Okay. So does that put you lower in 2020 versus your previous expectations or at a similar place?","Jack Harper","We haven't really changed our base plan and so I expect our production in 2020 to look pretty similar as we have in previous points in time. But we are ways to finalizing the 2020 budget right now.","Arun Jayaram","Okay, fair enough. And just today we have question for Will. You talked about some of the benefits of the larger projects, but it seems to have cause quite a bit more volatility in your results. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the costs of benefit potential of moving to maybe some of the smaller package sizes that may give you a little bit more \u2013 more of a level loaded program, which may provide more consistent growth versus more volatility, which you could argue maybe hurting you multiple.","Will Giraud","Yes. I mean, there's no question that moving to these larger project development even in a company our size will cause what you'd call volatility and non-linear growth profile in the company. But if you're \u2013 if you think about the multiple decades of inventory we have, we're focused on the best, most economic development of it over that long-term time period. And as I mentioned we still believe that doing it this way is the way to recover the resource in the most capital efficient manner over the long-term versus just kind of cherry picking with some very small projects now that you're going to regret when you come back later in a year or two.","Arun Jayaram","Okay, fair enough. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Mike Kelly with Seaport Global. Please proceed.","Mike Kelly","Hey guys. Good morning. I was hoping to bolt-on to the Brian Singer question as well. You guys entered the year forecasting 310 to 330 wells drilled and completed and I think 330 to 350 pops. And I was hoping maybe you could refresh us on what that range for both those categories can look like now? Thanks.","Tim Leach","Yes, sure Mike. I think on \u2013 on both of those were \u2013 we\u2019re going to be at or below the low end of that range, the way we see it today.","Mike Kelly","Okay, fair enough. Thanks, guys.","Tim Leach","You bet.","Operator","And our next question comes from Matthew Portillo with Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Please proceed.","Matthew Portillo","Good morning guys.","Tim Leach","Good morning.","Jack Harper","Good morning.","Matthew Portillo","Just a follow-up to that question. Is there any incremental color you could provide on the 2020 pop guidance? So you're clearly pulling quite a few wells out of 2019. You've talked about going into 2020 with a larger duct count, but you're also coming in with lower rig count than initially envisioned in the original guidance. So just trying to get a better sense of how we should think about your gross operating completion account heading into next year?","And then back to one of the previous questions. As we think about the 2020 oil growth expectations, should we be basing that off of the revised 2019 numbers? So looking out into 2020, kind of growing that double-digit growth rate off of the lower 2019 oil guidance?","Tim Leach","Yes, I think entering the year with more uncompleted wells will give us flexibility on how we stage those in and whether its front end loaded or more evenly distributed. But when you look at the two years next to each other, it's the capital will be relatively similar. And the wealth put on production will depend a bit, but probably similar as this year.","Matthew Portillo","Just to clarify that those to the new well counted is the 300 or so wells. We should think about that as a similar well count for next year or basically you're going to catch up on the wells that you pushed from this year into 2020?","Tim Leach","Yes, I think it should look relatively similar to this year, when the dust settles and the cadence may be different next year, but it should be relatively similar to 2019.","Matthew Portillo","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Richard Tullis with Capital One Securities. Please proceed.","Richard Tullis","Hey, thanks. Good morning, Tim and Jack. Taking a step back at high level, what has changed in your view of whether it's cost of well productivity or commodities since late April when, when production guidance was actually raised at that point?","Tim Leach","Well, our focus is heightened on landing our budget within our cash flow. The gas and liquids market has deteriorated, therefore so has our cash flow modestly. And so our bias to touching the top-end of our budget range or going above is non-existent. And so we prioritize capital discipline for this year to set up the company in the best position to head into 2020 and do the things we've described.","Richard Tullis","Okay. Thank you. And for the follow-up, what were the main drivers of the impairment at the New Mexico Shelf asset?","Tim Leach","Sure. As Shelf has been flagged on the watch list for impairment, I think in the last two quarters in the queue due to sensitivity to pricing and also the inability to book undeveloped reserves there because we don't plan to allocate new capital there in the next five years.","Richard Tullis","Okay. Thank you. Appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Gail Nicholson with Stephens. Please proceed.","Gail Nicholson","Good morning. A very different question, cap expenses excluding GP&T below $10, with the strategic debut with Solaris that was announced last night. Can you talk about the potential impact on are we going forward with increased water recycling usage? And then thoughts on any potential infrastructure \u2013 water infrastructure, CapEx savings and in the future as well?","Tim Leach","Sure. Just addressing your first question specifically on kind of the overall cost structure. We don't expect it to be any significant change up or down in the near term from that Solaris deal. But just kind of more broadly on the Solaris transaction, I mean it's something that looked very similar to how we\u2019ve styled our previous deals in the crude gathering space with ACC and Oryx.","We've got a very strong long-term commercial contract that underlies the deal to handle our produced water in Eddy County. Also similar to those crude deals we're partnering with a very sophisticated operating team that has a dominant regional footprint and for all that we get the benefits of really high level of service handling all of our produced water volumes. They also bring with them the needed infrastructure to allow large scale water recycling like you\u2019ve referenced, which I think will be a driver of savings in the future. And then we'll have a 20% equity investment that gives our shareholders exposure to a growing competitive business and we see as a table on terms of how it goes from here.","Gail Nicholson","Great, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Jeffrey Campbell was Tuohy Brothers. Please proceed.","Jeffrey Campbell","Good morning. I just wanted to ask one question because I've been listening to a lot of the discussion around Dominator and spacing and so forth. I just wanted to ask you, is it fair to say that while Dominator did not add as much inventory as you might've hoped. Your corporate inventory assumptions are based on far more conservative spacing and remain unaffected?","Tim Leach","That\u2019s correct.","Jack Harper","That\u2019s correct.","Will Giraud","That\u2019s correct.","Tim Leach","All three of us say that's correct at the same time.","Jeffrey Campbell","I'll let you go. I got three lemons and that's great. Thanks, appreciate it.","Operator","And our next question comes from Leo Mariani with KeyBanc. Please proceed.","Leo Mariani","Hey guys, I was hoping to touch on the asset sales, you surely mentioned that number of things are in queue. Just wanted to get a relative sense of magnitude and we talked 100 or so million of asset sales are kind of more like upwards of a billion. Is there any just kind of high level numbers you can kind of throw out, just to give us a sense of how impactful this could be?","Tim Leach","Well, let me take that one and just say that, it's a combination of properties and also system \u2013 systems that like this Solaris deal that generates cash, but it's on the upper end of what you described.","Leo Mariani","Okay. No, that's helpful. And I guess just with respect to obviously some of the issues you had here on Dominator, I think you guys had said that, there may be a \u2013 some lingering effects into the second half and maybe a couple of other pads that also tested spacing that was too dense. I just wanted to get your, kind of high level thought, I mean, do you think that by saying the fourth quarter, you guys are no longer bringing on pads that are likely to show some under performance. Just want to get a sense of when some of the deleterious impacts are kind of removed from the numbers here?","Tim Leach","Sure. I mean the cycle times on these projects \u2013 you planned them in years, but you really implement them in a couple of quarters and so the ability to dramatically change our 2019 plan is pretty limited at this point. Although, I do think by the fourth quarter you'll start to see adjustment to that capital plan.","Leo Mariani","Okay. So just to be clear. So, would you basically anticipate that the impact of some of the pads that were spaced too tight will sort of be gone by the end of the year and allow you to see pads that are tied in next year that are just spaced correctly. Just trying to get a sense of when we start to see maybe a little better kind of run rate production performance?","Tim Leach","Sure. I'd say that we've \u2013 yes, I think it's the short answer to your question.","Leo Mariani","Okay. Thank you.","Tim Leach","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Nitin Kumar with Wells Fargo. Please proceed.","Nitin Kumar","Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my question. I\u2019ve very quick one here. In April, do you still expect 2019 oil production to go faster than your total production rate? As you were talking about the updated guidance that's more, what has changed and what's your confidence level that in 2020 oil will still grow faster than total production?","Tim Leach","Yes. The main thing that changed in 2019 is less wells being put on production in the back half of the year, does not get that percentage back-up. Next year with the well mix and the cadence of the completions, I feel confident that we will reverse that and you will see that oil percentage picking back up.","Nitin Kumar","Great, thank you.","Tim Leach","Thank you.","Jack Harper","Thanks.","Operator","And our next question comes from Charles Meade with Johnson Rice. Please proceed.","Charles Meade","Good morning, Tim, Jack and Will and the rest of the team there and I appreciate you guys gave \u2013 the longest questions to you if I could remember. But one question for me on the Dominator pad. Doing some rough math, it looks to me the Dominator pad with respect to the ship lower in oil for the back half of the year. It look \u2013 it looks to me like \u2013 like maybe about half of that ship lower in the low is, you can attribute to the Dominator pad. But I'm curious is that the right ballpark and what's it look like from your end?","Will Giraud","It\u2019s certainly a factor and I think that factor with putting less wells on are really the primary driver to that back half oil production.","Charles Meade","Got it. Thank you, Jack. And then I think Arun touch on this point earlier, but I wonder if I could just revisit it with. Looking at your annual guide now for oil growth, what are the \u2013 it leads a pretty wide window for what 4Q could be. So I wonder if you could talk about what are the events and decisions that would line up on your end that would lead you to the high-end of that range. And what are the events and decisions that would lead you more towards the low-end of the range?","Tim Leach","You\u2019re talking about within 2019 and just the fourth quarter specifically?","Charles Meade","Exactly. What would have to happen in the back-end of the year if we \u2013 if we kind of pick \u2013 take your guidance for 3Q and then the annual guide leaves a pretty wide range for where 4Q might be, just wondering what the pay attention to you there?","Tim Leach","Sure, it\u2019s timing and it's well performance. And as Will just mentioned, you will see some of the benefits of projects spaced lift densely then the Dominator coming through towards the middle and the end of the fourth quarter and heading into the first quarter, but \u2013 so those are going to be the primary drivers.","Charles Meade","Got it. That\u2019s the color I was looking for. Thank you.","Tim Leach","Thank you.","Will Giraud","Thank you.","Operator","And this concludes our Q&A session for today. I'd like to turn the call back over to Tim Leach for closing remarks.","Tim Leach","Thank you for dialing-in and I look forward to talking to you next quarter.

Ma'am, you may begin.","Megan Hays","Great. Thank you, Daniel. Good morning and welcome to Concho's fourth quarter 2018 earnings call. Our earnings release and corporate presentation are available on our website, and we plan to file our annual report on Form 10-K today after market close.

During today's call, we will discuss fourth quarter and full year 2018 operational and financial results and will update you on our 2019 outlook. Following our prepared remarks, we will host a question-and-answer session please limit yourself to one question and one follow up.","Now, let me turn the call over to Tim. ","Timothy Leach","Thanks, Megan. Good morning. This was a transformational year for Concho. We started the year communicating the importance of our strategy, execution strength and capital discipline. During 2018, we delivered on each of these and achieved strong results while running one of the largest development programs in the Permian. Our biggest milestone in 2018 was the acquisition of RSP. Based on our track record in the Permian, RSP checked all the boxes. The transaction enhanced our long-term strategy and the scale of our growth platform.","As we fold this premium inventory into our development machine we\u2019re extremely pleased with the assets and the team that joined us. The portfolio that we've created is a competitive advantage and we're focused on high grading it and blocking up acreage for drilling long laterals and project development.","To that end, in 2018, we executed 15 asset trades covering 60,000 net acres in aggregate. We also sold non-core assets for proceeds of about $360 million and received $160 million distribution from our investment in the Oryx regional gathering system. Through portfolio high grading development, and delineation during 2018, we increased our horizontal resource to 12 billion barrels of oil equivalent. ","Roughly two thirds of this resource is considered premium and achieves a rate of return greater than 35% at $60 oil. The average rate of return of this premium resource is 68% and we have 40 years of runway at our current pace. Our capital program in 2019 is directed to these locations.","We also delivered solid operational performance. We increased production 36% year-over-year driven by a 41% increase in oil volume. Our teams are leading the transition to large scale manufacturing stall development and well performance for the projects completed in 2018 is strong. Free cash flow has been a practice not a concept. And we again executed a disciplined program that highlighted the quality of our assets. We invested a total of $2.5 billion in our drilling and completion program and generated around $2.6 billion of cash flow, marking the third consecutive year for cash flow to exceed our capital investments excluding acquisitions. ","And our track record for free cash flow and outlook for the business enables us to initiate a dividend this quarter. We ended the year with investment grade credit ratings from the three top rating agencies and the strong balance sheet. We're working to deliver a value proposition in our industry that competes for capital across the broader market and in 2018 we made significant progress in achieving this goal.","While our supportive market conditions and higher oil prices are welcome. Our returns focus game plan means we find opportunity especially in times of volatility. There has been a lot of conversation about service cost, historically if the slowdown materializes there is typically a three or four month delay before activity levels and service cost respond to market realities. We expect this to be the case in 2019.","Against this backdrop, we're continuing to focus on free cash flow growth and maintaining balance sheet strength. Because of this, we're calibrating the 2019 program around lower commodity prices and even at lower prices, the efficiency of our machine and the compelling benefits of the RSP transaction are apparent. We talked last quarter about the evolution of the E&P business model. ","Our model will build excess cash flow and maximize returns on and off capital. At a time of broad industry change, our strategy combined with the best team, assets and balance sheet will deliver in a way and in a timeframe very few in our industry can.","We have carefully and thoughtfully pursued our plan. Developing the platform, more capable and better position than any other time in our history. And 2019, sets up an incredible trajectory for our company, one that reinforces the investment case for Concho.","With that, I'll turn it over to Jack. ","Jack Harper","Thank you, Tim. Our performance and actions in 2018 contributed to one of the most strategically important years in our history. We invested in high value growth projects, controlled cash cost, executed a disciplined capital program and strengthened our portfolio. In short, it was another year of good offense and delivering on what we say we're going to do.","I'll start with a recap of fourth quarter and full year 2018 results, before reviewing our updated outlook for 2019. Fourth quarter production averaged 307,000 BOEs per day, in line with our guidance range. ","Oil volumes averaged 199,000 barrels per day and now make up 65% of production volume compared to 62% during the fourth quarter of last year. Controllable cash cost look good, but we continue to focus on improvement. Adjusted earnings per share was $0.94 and adjusted EBITDAX totaled $751 million, a 46% increase as compared to the fourth quarter of 2017.","For 2018, production volumes were $263,000 BOEs per day. This includes a partial year contribution from RSP, which we acquired in mid-July. Controllable cash cost per unit improved, down 4% compared to 2017. Full year adjusted earnings per share was $4.60 and adjusted EBITDAX totaled $2.8 billion.","As Tim mentioned, we invested $2.5 billion in our capital program, while generating $2.6 billion in operating cash flow and received proceeds of approximately $520 million from divestitures and our strategic investment in Oryx. Our disciplined capital program and prudent portfolio management continued to be used to strengthen the balance sheet. Long-term debt ended the year at $4.2 billion and our annualized leverage ratios stood at 1.4 times.","Clearly, the backdrop for oil prices was different last quarter. Companies were poised to increase activity and inflation wins were not in our favor. The steep drop in crude prices at the end of the year illustrates how fast this business can change. A strong financial position is a core value and competitive advantage and our balance sheet and cash flows are well protected. Based on our guidance range approximately 70% of our oil is hedged and roughly 60% is covered with basis swaps.","Operationally, things are proceeding as planned. During the fourth quarter, we ran 34 rigs, one of the largest programs in the basin. We continue to advance our style of return centric development, which focuses on large scale and multi-well projects across our asset base. Our project results continue to demonstrate the prudence of this approach, which mitigates parent-child impacts, drives operational efficiencies and maximizes the long-term value of our investments.","As the competition to supply the most efficient barrel intensifies technology is increasingly important. Our moved to manufacturing style development combined with the team's use of technology is accelerating innovation, improving productivity and optimizing program economics. In 2018, more capital was directed to large-scale projects than ever before. And our well performance on an absolute and lateral adjusted basis increased 21% to an average peak 30 day rate of more than 1,400 BOE per day, while the average lateral length was relatively consistent year-over-year. ","In addition to creating value through how we build, develop and operator assets, we're also looking to capture the most value with how we market the oil and gas we produce. Since the beginning of 2019, the Midland Cushing discount has narrowed significantly as Plains Sunrise System ramps up and anticipated line conversions come to fruition.","The scenario around takeaway capacity and regional pricing has played out largely as we expected and communicated. I'm glad we were patient and didn't sacrifice long-term value for short-term transportation arrangements. We're not aware of a single Permian barrel that didn't clear the Midland market. Importantly, we're now in a strong position to begin diversifying our pricing and market exposure and we're making progress on this strategy.","During the first quarter of 2019 we entered into a firm sales agreement with a third-party purchaser that will provide an integrated transportation and marketing solution, including ample dock capacity. This agreement ramps to 50,000 barrels of oil per day when Plains Cactus II pipeline comes online. The barrel sold under this arrangement will receive waterborne pricing.","The energy sector space had a myriad of headwinds including big swings in oil prices, and investor frustration. With this backdrop, we're redoubling our focus on cost control, capital discipline and growing free cash flow and returns. While others in the sector are talking about a new strategy our actions and track record uniquely position us to deliver differentiated performance.","Our updated 2019 capital program is based on our view that volatility will continue to challenge the sector. The program includes a capital spend of $2.8 billion to $3 billion, which represents a 17% reduction compared with our previous guidance. This level of capital supports volumes with less investment and sets up a strong and sustainable free cash flow growth trajectory. With an oil production growth rate of 15% in the fourth quarter of 2019 versus the fourth quarter of 2018, we continue to highlight the 2019 exit rate because 4Q 2018 includes a full quarter of RSP activity.","Looking ahead to 2020, our base plan calls for similar investment level as 2019, resulting in a substantial free cash flow growth. We will respond to the price environment guided by the capital allocation framework laid out last quarter. This framework places an increased emphasis on returns of capital when we have excess free cash and still gives us the flexibility to opportunistically deploy additional capital. Our focus will remain on growing free cash flow over the long-term, more so than in any individual quarter.","We started the year with 34 rigs and 10 completion crews, which is our peak level for the year. As a result we expect 1Q capital of $825 million to $875 million, which will moderate as we move through the balance of 2019. Production for the quarter is expected to be in the range of 300,000 to 306,000 BOE per day, which reflects the timing of our move to more project style development across the asset base and the ramp of wells placed on production in the second and third quarters.","We have the team and assets to deliver differentiated value. Our scale advantage, execution strength and strong financial position allow us to deliver one of the most competitive barrels in the world.","We\u2019ll now open up the call to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Arun Jayaram with JP Morgan. Your line is now open.","Arun Jayaram","Good morning, Tim and Jack. First question, pretty sizable change in the 2019, 2020 guide versus what you articulated last quarter, you mentioned volatility, but I was wondering if you could maybe give us some thoughts on how your thinking has evolved since that time in terms of the guide and what do you see as the benefits of the new operating plan, which does seem to indicate more capital efficiency versus your own plan?","Timothy Leach","Yes, Arun, I guess, when we put this plant together the thinking is really very similar to what we were thinking in November is that we were trying to be conservative and generate free cash flow. And so with the oil prices declining in the fourth quarter, we thought we\u2019re being conservative back in November with how we were deploying capital at that time.","There\u2019s reduction just is at a pace that will give us additional free cash flow, also gives us substantial growth of production. So I think it will allow us to demonstrate that we can generate growing amounts of free cash flow and grow the company.","Arun Jayaram","Fair enough. And Tim, just a follow up on the free cash flow characteristics of the new plan. Anyway you could give us a sense of your thoughts on call it between a $50 to $60 per barrel number in 2019 and 2020 what\u2019s the free cash flow would like and your thoughts on prioritizing that free cash flow in terms of cash return, the balance sheet or reinvesting in your portfolio?","Timothy Leach","Yes, I'm going to give you directionally how I think about it and then I'm going to let Jack and a cleanup the mess and give you more specifics. I think between $50 and $60 there\u2019s a big change in amount of free cash flow that we can generate, but I think as you look into the future that range of pricing is very good for us and I think that we can demonstrate that we can grow the company at exceptional growth rates and start to generate a free cash yield that competes kind of across all industries and that\u2019s really what I'm focused on doing is growing our free cash flow yield to a level that generally inventors can get excited about.","Jack Harper","Yes and Arun just to add a little color to that, I think this level -- this capital level reflects a pace and an amount that allows us to cover our dividend and our capital budget in the low 50s this year, but we see an inflection point on free cash flow next year at an even lower price than that. And when you think about a price like $60 that amount of free cash approaches $1 billion in 2020.","Arun Jayaram","And then\u2026","Jack Harper","Go ahead I'm sorry.","Arun Jayaram","There was $1 billion in 2020?","Jack Harper","That\u2019s correct. And I also wanted to make sure we talked about -- you asked about priority most certainly balance sheet strength is a huge priority for us. We have a strong balance sheet, I think we believe it can be stronger and like to see it gravitate more towards the lower end of the range we've stated of 1 to 1.5 times. So making sure we achieve that, and then having the optionality for additional returns to shareholders or to run our business depending on the set of circumstances that are at that moment in time.","Arun Jayaram","Great, thanks a lot. ","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Brian Singer","Thank you. Good morning. ","Timothy Leach","Good morning. ","Brian Singer","Following up a little bit on the free cash flow point. You talked about having a big free cash flow number potentially if oil prices stay strong in 2020. But I wondered, if you could talk a little bit about M&A. You mentioned earlier and you highlight in your slide presentation you have 40 years of premium inventory that seems like a lot of premium inventory. ","Can you talk to the interest or disinterest in further consolidation on a net basis? And whether that is a potential use of free cash flow or whether the free cash flow would be more sought out for debt pay down and return to shareholders as you mentioned?","Timothy Leach","This is Tim. I think that consolidation in leadership in Permian Basin is something that we'll always be a player in. And I mentioned how many trades we've done to try to continue to block up our assets. So continuing to high grade this portfolio of assets, I think you're going to see the entire industry working on that, and we want to be at the forefront of that.","The free cash flow that we generate from our business though, doesn't need to go into consolidation. The free cash flow is kind of what runs our business, runs our capital program and provides cash flow to shareholders. So I wouldn't -- I think about those two things separately.","Brian Singer","Great, thanks. And then my follow up is with regards to oil mix, oil production as a percent of the total. Your guidance would appear to imply as an increase in oil as a percent of the total both in 2029 and 2020 versus recent quarters. Can you just talk to the dynamics and drivers of this and whether on the natural gas side you see any constraints i.e. flaring or reinjection that are being assumed or expected?","Jack Harper","Brian, this is Jack. The increase in oil percentage which is accurate is a reflection of capital mix and the projects that we have planned for in the budget, which do have an increasingly oily mix. And it's the timing and the cadence of bringing on those projects.","As to the gas constraints, we do not anticipate any meaningful constraints in our business. The increased in oil is really more driven by capital allocation.","Brian Singer","Great, thank you. ","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Phillip Jungwirth with BMO. Your line is now open.","Phillip Jungwirth","Thanks. Good morning. ","Timothy Leach","Good morning.","Phillip Jungwirth","Based on the 2019, 2020 guidance or outlook is currently laid out. How would you say you're tracking versus your original $2 billion RSP synergies and which synergy areas would you say you're outperforming either the development efficiencies, asset optimization, shared infrastructure or corporate level savings?","Timothy Leach","Yes, as I've said before, I think the synergy part of it we've achieved in terms of interest cost savings and G&A reduction, those things are done. The real value creation opportunity on the RSP assets was manufacturing style development, which now 70% of the development going on in 2019 on the RSP assets are long laterals and manufacturing styles. So that is a value creation on the RSP assets that will continue on now as we develop those over many years. So I'm very pleased with the value that I think is being created out of RSP.","Phillip Jungwirth","Great. And then on the upcoming dominator development between three wells there, how are you looking to measure success of the project in terms of operational efficiencies, leveraging facilities, productivity for well. And then, how would you expect to communicate results from this project?","William Giraud","Sure, Phillip, its Will. We\u2019re obviously bringing that project on right now, I think that\u2019s something we will be speaking to in more detail next quarter. But I would say we would measure it the same way we would measure any other drilling project in terms of the returns we received versus the investment. ","And also that\u2019s a bit of the unique project just given its size and as we\u2019ve said before we\u2019re trying to see how far we can push the efficiencies as we make these projects larger and larger and also there\u2019s elements of spacing, testing and other things going on in that project. So there\u2019s a lot in that, but I'm not sure there\u2019s anything unique about it versus any of the other big projects we\u2019re doing.","Phillip Jungwirth","Great, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Neal Dingmann with SunTrust. Your line is now open.","Neal Dingmann","Morning guys. My first question just on your sort of 2019 and 2020 plan it looks like you talked about Jack, and very nice capital cut for 2019 as you and Tim just pointed out, but then it looks like what I think if I am reading that right year-over-year CapEx for 2019 and 2020 assumes relatively flat. Does that mean latter part of 2019 or sometime in 2020 you would pick some rigs up and just try to sort of balance those two years?","Timothy Leach","Yes, we average this year 27 rigs and to get there we obviously are declining over the year, but it\u2019s a similar level of rigs next year in that plan. So, yes, I would anticipate a bit of a ramp sometime during 2020, but not much.","Neal Dingmann","Okay. And then lastly just looking to slide 11 where you show some of your key projects, looks like you continue to be pretty diversified as far as kind of about 78 wells in that Delaware Basin with those key projects and about 67 Midland, is that cadence wise? And I guess you still feel equally as good about the two areas as judged by kind of the diversified plan?","Timothy Leach","Absolutely, we like the diversity of the Delaware and Midland Basin and when you look at our capital allocation this year it\u2019s about a 60:40 mix with the 60 going to the Delaware.","Neal Dingmann","Very good. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Leo Mariani with KeyBanc. Your line is now open.","Leo Mariani","Hey, guys. I was hoping you could expand a little bit on the 2019 activity and CapEx plan just kind of looking at the full year guidance obviously you\u2019ve got first quarter CapEx certainly is kind of above the full year run rate. Can you give us a little bit color around how you guys kind of plan to reduce activity if it\u2019s kind of do a lot of rigs sort of roll off as we work away into the second quarter as first quarter you kind of your high CapEx quarter for the year. What can you kind of tell us about the activity in spending pace throughout 2019?","William Giraud","Yes, definitely, Leo, there\u2019s a really helpful slide back on the very last slide in our deck around the guidance where we actually show you the 2019 rig cadence. And so we\u2019re averaging 32 rigs in the first quarter going to 26 in the second and then back half of the year averaging 24. So there\u2019s definitely a frontend loaded aspect as we come off the high of 35 rigs we ended the year with.","Leo Mariani","Okay, that\u2019s helpful for sure. And I guess just in terms of asset sales which you guys obviously focused on a little bit and sign off some of the non-core pieces in 2018, what can you kind of tell us about the plans for 2019? Are you guys kind of continue to prune and should we expect decent proceeds in assets sales here in 2019?","William Giraud"," That\u2019s a little hard to predict, we will definitely be very active on the portfolio management side, as Tim mentioned we\u2019re most focused on the trades that\u2019s kind of the preferred use of our non-core acreage to use in this currency and the trade, but you saw us peel off a non-core asset package or two in 2018 and that\u2019s certainly something we look at for 2019.","When you look at the map the goal is to end up with very large blocks of acreage in the best parts of the Permian. And so when you look at our map the Northern Delaware kind of jumps off the page, actually there is an area that we still have the relatively scattered position, we like it but it\u2019s certainly a focal point for trades and an opportunity for non-core assets.","Leo Mariani","All right, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Bob Brackett with Bernstein Research. Your line is now open.","Bob Brackett","Yes, I had a question about some of the development efficiencies, I saw that big jump in lateral length from a 8,000 to 9,700 you\u2019re able to achieve that with a mix of Delaware and Midland acreage?","William Giraud","That\u2019s right. And that really goes back to that conversation around this trades and swaps that\u2019s been the big enabler for pushing lateral length especially in the Delaware Basin. ","Bob Brackett","And then, expanding on that can you talk about the fine tuning of completions, you dropped stage count last year, but improve the wells. Can you talk about where stage count goes in 2019 and also maybe pound per foot, if there's any relevant change there?","William Giraud","Certainly, I think we should, if you look at the program year-to-year one evolution as you notice was stage spacing, but then also the intensity of the completions has backed off a bit. We continue to work on evolving completion strategy for all of the different bones and also kind of applications of -- it's not just the pounds per foot, there's a lot around lateral targeting and other aspects of completion. So I would expect to continue to see that change over the future, but I think that's a driver in increased well performance over time as well.","Bob Brackett","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Drew Venker with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Drew Venker","Good morning, everyone. Just wanted to follow up on the last question on well performance improvements, can you speak to how much you think the well performance improvements have come from optimizing spacing and well design aside from -- and things targeting on the reservoir, as opposed to just completion design modifications?","Timothy Leach","That's a little hard to describe in a brief way. But certainly what -- I think what we're pleased by is that as we moved into this large-scale project development. We're seeing the results we expect and it's enabling us to do some pretty interesting thing from testing and continuing to understand the best way to do it.","Drew Venker","Understood. Maybe if you all could give a little bit more color on how you think spending maybe would flex in a higher price environments like $60 or $70 price environment that\u2019d be helpful, I guess both for 2019 and 2020?","Timothy Leach","Yes, I would say that we run a flexible business. But I really think that higher oil prices will just generate bigger cash yields for us free cash flow. So -- and I think that's how we can differentiate ourselves so we can show growth and really strong free cash flow.","Drew Venker","Thanks, Tim.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Michael Hall with Heikkinen Energy. Your line is now open.","Michael Hall","Thanks. Good morning. Appreciate the time. I guess, I wanted to just kind of come back to the evolution of your thinking on -- as you call it the E&P business model, I'm just kind of curious on kind of what would you say your guiding principles behind the line and the evolution of this E&P business model? ","Just kind of taking the other side on some level conscious that probably one of the deepest inventories in the business, low cost structure, differentials are narrowing, costs are falling cyclically. So, one could ask why flow now, why not just kind of push through? I'm just curious to what extent that was discussed or debated and kind of what are the guiding principles behind I guess the why in this evolution?","Timothy Leach","Well, I mean, we've been talking for some quarters now about a compelling business model for our industry. And the one thing to remember about Concho is that while I think we're one of the leaders in the shale revolution, where this company was only started 12 years ago. And so, as I talk to my shareholders that were investors on the IPO of this company, they best of -- our shareholders have stayed with us through the discovery of the biggest oil field in the world. They've stayed with us while we were delineating it and trying to figure out how to best drill it. And now it's kind of time for a payday.","And so when you think about what does the payday look like for those long-term investors, I think it's a model that competes with any other kind of industrial model in the world where you can grow and generate enough free cash flow to redistribute the shareholders that it's a new kind of oil and gas model.","Michael Hall","Okay, that's helpful, I appreciate the color. And I guess it kind of segues into my next question, which was the payday I guess, the dividend. How are you guys thinking about target yields on that if you have one? And what sort of timeframe should we think about for the pace of growing the dividend?","Timothy Leach","I mean, this quarter, we just initiated our first dividend ever so it's kind of earlier gain. But I","I would say that I think what we're thinking about more is being able to demonstrate increasing cash yields. And then talk about -- after your balance sheet is right where you want it in what form is the best way to get capital back to shareholders. ","Michael Hall","Okay. Appreciate the color. Thanks very much. ","Timothy Leach","Thank you. ","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Bob Morris with Citi. Your line is now open.","Bob Morris","Thank you and good morning gentlemen. Tim, you mentioned earlier that when there is a slowdown there is typically a three or four month lag on seeing oilfield service cost inflation, deflation. But at this point, we're a little bit into that with the slowdown by you and a lot of your peers in the Permian Basin, what are you expecting or seeing today as far as oilfield service cost deflation on the year?","Timothy Leach","Well, let me say in general that if everybody was within their cash flow we don't need 500 rigs running in the Permian Basin. So we are thinking that the back half of the year up to be less expensive than it is today. Jack, you want to talk about how?","Jack Harper","I would just add to that that we have -- our plan is based on cost as we see them today. And so to the extent they do come down, that would be incrementally beneficial.","Bob Morris","Okay. And then, Tim, just curious with the slowdown in activity now, how does this impact the economics on the price you paid for RSP or is the bulk of the slowdown really on the legacy Concho assets are how do you think about that with regard to RSP?","Timothy Leach","We've combined this -- we've successfully put two businesses together, RSP a thriving business that was generating its own cash flow. If you look at how the capital is being distributed in 2019, there is just about as much capital going back to the RSP assets as they represented in the whole combination. So I think about it as taking two businesses and combining them into one better business. But -- so the capital efficiency is gained from the way that we are drilling the RSP assets.","Bob Morris","Okay, thank you. ","Timothy Leach","Yes, thanks. ","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Paul Sankey with Mizuho. Your line is now open.","Paul Sankey","Hi guys. Appreciate your comments about taking what shareholders want. Things have changed obviously in the time that you've been IPOed and then run the company. Are you now really going to more cash -- I guess the point is if you're going to a more cash return oriented strategy. And the big idea I think two or three years ago maybe longer was that you would sell the company. Is the idea now to run it hard for cash return? Thanks.","Timothy Leach","That wasn't my big idea, Paul. Either may have been your big idea. ","Paul Sankey","I thought you told me that. ","Timothy Leach","You were talking to other, Tim, I think. But my big idea is to create a business model that hasn't ever existed before one that attracts capital across all industries because of the growth and capital return to create something that's really compelling for investors. And that's why it gets our blood pumping is to see if we can through the right set of assets and capital allocation create something that's compelling investment?","Paul Sankey","And so the idea is rapid cash return growth, I guess right now or -- I mean you have such big growth opportunity in volumes terms?","Timothy Leach","Yes, I mean, I still think we're growing pretty substantially even in a reduced capital scenario.","Paul Sankey ","Okay. ","Timothy Leach","From a pretty big base I would say. ","Paul Sankey","Yes, well that's kind of the idea, because I guess you're getting too big to sell yourselves, right? So. ","Timothy Leach","I don\u2019t know, yes. Go on to your next topic.","Paul Sankey","Thank you. ","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Jeffery Campbell with Tuohy Brothers. Your line is now open.","Jeffery Campbell","Good morning. Earlier in the call you said 2020 outlook is using a lower than 2019\u2019s low-50s benchmarks. What are variables to alleviate the year-over-year free cash in 2020 bearing in mind a flattish year-over-year spend and a lower commodity assumption.","Jack Harper","Yes, just to clarify what we said earlier is that our 2019 dividend and capital program can be funded in the low-50. And that as we look into 2020 at a lower price like 50 we can cover all of those things and have additional cash flow. And if we see a price somewhere at the level of a strip is currently or even approaching 60 we see free cash approaching $1 billion.","Jeffery Campbell","Okay. And -- but I guess what I'm asking is what is it about 2020 that\u2019s going to make that performance even if the commodity assumption is lower is it just discontinued push towards bigger and bigger projects and longer laterals or just what are some of the variables there?","Jack Harper","Sure, I mean, our focus will be on the most efficient deployment of our capital under any circumstance and that is further highlighted the lower the commodity prices and I think it\u2019s actually an opportunity for us to differentiate ourselves. But you\u2019re right it\u2019s making our investment better through large project development lateral placement within the zones, well spacing all of the small nubs that can now be turned to increased efficiency.","Jeffery Campbell","Okay, thank you. That was helpful. And I was also just wondering just I'm looking at the map of what you\u2019ve been doing recently, I'm just wondering how\u2019s your Reeves County acreage competing for capital with the Mexico Delaware Basin and the core Midland Basin acreage? And was wondering, if any of the large scale projects that you\u2019ve detailed on slide 11 are located in the Reeves area?","William Giraud","Sure, this is Will. There are large scale projects in the Reeves area I mean if you look on slide nine I think that did a good job of showing where all of our wells are located. So I think you can see that\u2019s just the fourth quarter, but you can see a pretty broad dispersion of development across all of our assets now.","And if you looked that on an annual basis I think you would see it across almost the entire portfolio.","Jeffery Campbell","Okay. So none of the projects that were named on slide 11 are in Reeves, but Reeves is doing its own projects?","William Giraud","Yes, I think the Jack project is in Reeves and then there\u2019s one other significant project and there\u2019s a also the Tempest well there, it is.","Jeffery Campbell","Okay, great. Thanks for that.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Ryan Todd with Simmons Energy. Your line is now open.","Ryan Todd","Great, thanks. Maybe just a question on the large scale project, you\u2019ve seen strong results to-date on the various projects that you\u2019ve developed. Can you provide any additional color on takeaways that you\u2019re seeing from these projects whether regarding proper development of multiple horizons, efficiency gains, potential impact to parent-child dynamics and well productivity things like this?","Timothy Leach","Sure, I mean, while it\u2019s still early it\u2019s been a slow evolution for us into these larger and larger projects sizes. I\u2019ll just say we\u2019re obviously very pleased with what we\u2019re seeing and in terms of what we\u2019re expecting to see I think we\u2019re also double down on the necessity of doing it this way and that this is the better way to do it. And I'm modestly optimistic that over measured in periods of years we will continue to find more efficiencies how to doing it that way in addition to just the base reasons to do it around mitigating parent child impact and things like that.","William Giraud","I would also add that when you look at the Permian Basin map having big blocky acreage once again it becomes apparent to us that that\u2019s the way you can mitigate parent-child relationship and also frac heads from neighbors and things like that. So we\u2019re very pleased with the way our acreage is configured and the trades and the way we\u2019ve continued to block up a big chunky blocks of the best parts of the Permian.","Ryan Todd","Thanks. And are you -- I mean are you trending towards a time where you increasingly develop full sections in terms of all the developable horizons at the same time or do you think that you focus on one or two or two or three of the primary target horizons first and then go back at a later time and do secondary horizons?","Timothy Leach","No, we think it\u2019s a three dimensional problem so you need to do all horizons simultaneously. And so, one of the big questions so you can kind of see it if you look at our list of projects on slide 11 one of the big questions is what the optimal project size and the answer is a little bit different depending upon where you are in the Permian and your lateral length, but we think it\u2019s important to do. ","We\u2019re typically doing half mile fairways it\u2019s kind of a way we think about it is developing the entire all of the horizontal targets in a half mile fairway open time.","Ryan Todd","Thanks, that's helpful, and maybe just a quick one on the fourth quarter. 4Q CapEx was probably a little bit higher than expectations was that just tightness towards the end of the quarter, was there any particular driver of that?","Timothy Leach","I mean, we were clearly ramping activity into an anticipated activity level in 2019. So there is a little bit of that, there is a whole bunch of those things. But I\u2019d just point you to the fact that 2018 capital came at the high end of our guidance range. So I don't think it was really upside of our expectation.","Ryan Todd","Great. Thanks, I appreciate the help.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from John Freeman with Raymond James. Your line is open.","John Freeman","Good morning. ","Timothy Leach","Hey, John. ","John Freeman","Hi. The slide 11, which shows the breakdown of activity this year is really helpful. Would it be possible to get the 1Q wells that are anticipated to pop in 1Q. I'm just trying to get the -- what the percentage of those kind of really large pads in the Delaware that come out at the very end of 1Q is sort of the total in 1Q.","Timothy Leach","We're guiding you pretty clearly there on the far right side of that page. There is a lot of wells coming on in the back half of the first quarter, probably in the neighborhood of 70 in 1Q.","John Freeman","Perfect. And then, when I look at you've got the rig cadence as it goes through 2019, in 4Q you have the 34 rigs and the 7 frac crews. Does that sort of ratio of rigs that frac crews does that sort of hold through the year or just maybe how we should think about that?","Timothy Leach","It's probably in the range of 7 completion crews throughout the year in 2019. And it will bounce around a little bit as we -- one of the big we've been working on these projects is trying to compress the time from spud for sales on the project and the way we do that if we will hit it with the multiple rigs at the same time and also multiple completion crews. So the completion number may bounce around from month-to-month, but I think the average in that 7 to 8 number.","John Freeman","Great, I appreciate it. Thanks a lot. ","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Charles Meade with Johnson Rice. Your line is now open.","Charles Meade","Good morning, Jim and Jack and to the rest of your team there. I wanted to go back to some of the earlier questions around the 2019 and 2020 guide. It looks like you guys are pointing to pretty steady quarter-over-quarter growth through 2019 and on into 2020. ","But if you just looked at the rig count going from 34 down to 24 and capital spending trending down to the back half of the year that wouldn't -- you wouldn't guess that there would be steady growth. So what are some of the other -- what's missing from that picture that helps you guys continue that steady growth despite the reduced spending in rig rates.","Jack Harper","Sure, I think if you look at the bottom left of slide 11 and while the drilling and completions match up for the year, we do have more wells being placed on production during the year. And it's the cadence of those wells being put on production. And being able to start completing all of the large projects that we invested in last year, and were not producing last year.","Charles Meade","So it's just kind of the delay through the completions and the size of pads to bring on those wells to production?","Jack Harper"," That's correct. ","Charles Meade","Okay. Thank you, Jack. And then, Will perhaps this is a question for you, I\u2019m trying to -- somebody asked this in a different way earlier, but you've mentioned about those -- the way you're developing different zones across the pad. And I wondered if you could talk a little bit about those the two -- to the pads that you guys talked about the Gettysburg pad and the Square Bill pad, both kind of been in the same Knuckle Woods there and Southeast, New Mexico. But I was going to say that one of them was just 3rd Bone Spring and the other one was 3rd Bone Spring in Wolfcamp A. ","And I wondered if you could talk about if what's the reason where actually you targeted as one zone or one and two on the other and what's more indicative of the way you guys are going to operate going forward?","William Giraud","Yes, I mean, I should have probably clarified, so the idea is to be doing half mile fairway as we are attacking all the zones. You think back to when these products were started this is on that evolutionary continuum. And so, as we've been doing -- we've been testing horizontal spacing within an individual zone, which that Gettysburg as an example of that. And we've also been testing the interaction between different landings, which is the square builds as an example of that. So it's just part of that evolution to this large-scale model where you're currently developing all the zones simultaneously.","Charles Meade","Thank you for that.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Jeanine Wai with Barclays. Your line is now open.","Jeanine Wai","Hi. Good morning, everyone.","Timothy Leach"," Good morning.","Jack Harper","Good morning.","Jeanine Wai","I just wanted to follow-up on some of the prior free cash flow questions. The release indicates that moderating activity really enhances Concho\u2019s free cash flow outlook and capital efficiency. And I think you mentioned earlier on the call that the updated outlook generates $1 billion of free cash flow in 2020 at $60 WTI. So I'm just wondering how much higher is that number versus the prior outlook at the same oil price?","Jack Harper","That's -- it's hard to compare with the different capital stem levels. But I think relative to where we are today, really, I think the most important focus is kind of lowering the bar in terms of the base level of commodity to set the capital budget. And the efficiency gains we are able to see by high grading the budget. And so, I just focused more on where we are today. And I think, if in terms of dollars invested and yield gained, it's at least as good if not better than before.","Jeanine Wai","Okay, great. And then, I guess, my second question is just a more general one. You mentioned building a company that hasn't existed before. Can you discuss how you benchmark yourself versus peers in both the near-term and the medium term? And I know you've mentioned a bunch of things on the call already, but any specific numbers that you can provide on the metrics would be great? Thank you.","Jack Harper","Sure. We track certain metrics that we think correlate the most closely with share price appreciation, but ultimately our share price itself is the report card that is most important.","Jeanine Wai","Okay, great. Thank you for taking my questions.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from David Deckelbaum with Cowen. Your line is now open.","David Deckelbaum","Good morning, Tim and Jack and everyone. Thanks for taking my questions.","Timothy Leach","Sure, David. Good morning.","David Deckelbaum","You talked a lot about the focus on free cash, I'm curious as you look at your program in 2019 and '20 and perhaps beyond you also alluded to Jack and his team working a lot of things to cut costs. When you look at the large projects, how do you balance the desire to create sort of an annual free cash yield versus sort of the cash recycle periods associated with large pads? And I guess, if you thought about where you are in optimizing that process, do you still feel like it's early innings and that there's a lot of efficiency gains to be had in 2020 and 2021?","Jack Harper","Well, I'll start with the efficiency gains. And yes, I do think they are there to be had they\u2019re -- as we mentioned before they're not going to be as obvious as they have been up to now, which is lateral length, stage spacing and stand loading it's spacing within the zone -- spacing -- placement within the zone and spacing of wells in the large projects. And so I think there are incremental gains to be had.","Speaking of the large project development though, in the first part of your question, as we've ramped up last year was the biggest ramp and we're going further in terms of percentage of capital spent on those kind of projects now. And so, now we're starting to get into a mode where we will roughly equal out the number of wells that come in and go out and completed. And so, that I think you're able to see that efficiency of that type of development starting this year and enhancing next year.","David Deckelbaum","Okay. So that kind of smooths out that cadence then over the next couple of years?","Jack Harper","Yes, I think the fourth quarter to first quarter should be the shallowest or flattest production cadence this year, and I wouldn't say that that will never happen again in the future, because it very well may. But as we look out over the next year, it should -- the trajectory should be up.","Timothy Leach"," I would add also that one of the things about continuing our business in this way and at the pace that we're doing it, it flattens that PDP decline curve. And the flattening of the PDP decline curve really helps us run our business and generate more free cash flow.","David Deckelbaum","That makes sense. So I suppose even as you get to 2021 if there\u2019s a need to add rigs, like Jack was talking about at the end of 2020 based on whatever your targets are you still lowered your PDP decline to a point where you\u2019re still lowering that free cash breakeven overtime.","Jack Harper","That\u2019s right. ","David Deckelbaum","Okay. If I could just ask one quick follow up, you talked about the firm sales agreement getting down to the Gulf, as you\u2019ve waited you alluded to earlier appreciate that you didn\u2019t act to it rationally before. As you\u2019ve waited for the market to clear a bit did you see sort of a natural opportunity to be able to mark more of your barrels to Brent with favorable terms? And is there sort of a philosophical balance or mix that you\u2019d like to have exposed to Brent versus Midland?","Jack Harper","Sure, David. We like the idea and have described the desire to have a mix of pricing between Midland and some Gulf and beyond related price. However, we like Midland as a place to price barrels. And so, I think even though we\u2019ll build out this diversity Midland will more than likely always make up the majority of where our barrels are priced.","David Deckelbaum","Thank you, guys.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Nitin Kumar with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Nitin Kumar","Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Just maybe referring back to something you said at the beginning of the call, you\u2019ve got activity here by 17% within the quarter you mentioned it takes about three to four months to get that you also talked about prioritizing some of your extra free cash flow to growth. What are your markers over the next two years for additional activity? I know you just got activity, but I'm just kind of curious what are your markers to adding activities at this point?","Jack Harper","Sure, we valuate running a steady shift as we\u2019ve described in the past. And so, I think that\u2019s what you see us talking about when we lay out 2019 and a base plan for 2020. And so, as our cash flow grows and the production base grows you should expect to see our activity levels grow as well and it will be -- we\u2019ll have to see what the circumstances look like at that point in time. But I think you should expect the same thing, it should be growth balance with increasing cash yield.","Nitin Kumar","Got you.","Timothy Leach","I\u2019d also say second half of this year and into next year if we see lower service cost, we can get more done with the same dollars. So that might lead to more activity and more efficiency at lower service cost.","Nitin Kumar","Great, thank you for that. And the other one is just your gas and NGL pricing for that year you model a 10% discount versus and kind of you have traditionally it\u2019s been around at 15% to 20% premium. When do you expect that to come back to kind of more normalized level or is that to go forward normal for the basin?","Jack Harper","Well, it will be highly driven by the NGL pricing. And so when we think ethane and propane recover to higher levels like we saw in the third quarter that would be the main driver of that gas realization for us.","Nitin Kumar","Great. Thank you, Jack.","Jack Harper","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Richard Tullis with Capital One Securities. Your line is now open.","Richard Tullis","Good morning. So Tim, Concho has a fairly long history drilling the Northwest shelf, how does that area compare on returns today given the generally lower well cost. And I guess we\u2019ve been seeing some solid well results from industry drilling Abo and Yeso recently. So how are you looking at that area these days?","Timothy Leach","Sure, I mean, we still like the Northwest shelf the returns as you referenced are still very attractive the challenge has always been for us as we\u2019ve gotten bigger is just it doesn\u2019t drive the growth of the company. And so, it has become a smaller and smaller piece of our capital budget overtime not because we disfavored it\u2019s been a great fly wheel asset over the years and really funded the growth of the Delaware Basin for a long time.","Richard Tullis","Okay. And then just lastly, I guess more of a macro question for Tim or anyone on the team what is the next leg in the Permian consolidation process? And does the consolidation slow, at least from an M&A viewpoint with oil, say $55, $60 oil?","Timothy Leach","Well, oil volatility has always been the enemy of consolidation it seems like. And everybody has been saying for several years that consolidation is going to start next quarter, and it never has. So I mean, yet last year was a pretty active year though in deals in the Permian. So I think you're going to see a steady stream of the map resolving itself to who the final players are going to be, that can really execute with the scale and I also mentioned blocky assets are very critical. So I think, it will take years of work, I think for the picture to resolve itself.","Richard Tullis","All right. Well that's all for me. Thank you.","Timothy Leach","Thank you.","Jack Harper","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our last question comes from Derrick Whitfield with Stifel. Your line is now open.","Derrick Whitfield","Thanks. Good morning all and certainly want to applaud you guys on your capital discipline outlook.","Timothy Leach","The question start.","Derrick Whitfield","Perhaps for Tim or Jack, the capital efficiency implied in your 2019 and 2020 outlook is relative to consensus is quite impressive. Building on an earlier question in your earlier PDP decline, comment, Tim, as you slow growth to what degree does your base decline decrease at year-end 2019 and year-end 2020?","Timothy Leach","It's such a big base right now it only moves a couple of points in the near-term, but a couple of points is a big number of barrels. So -- but over the long-term that's an important factor to keep an eye on.","Derrick Whitfield","Completely agree. And then referencing page eight of the PowerPoint, you guys post a material growth in your premium resource category. Are there specific areas or intervals that accounted for that significant amount of growth?","Jack Harper","Hey, Derek. It's really representative of the areas that you've seen us focusing on and talking about over the last 12 to 18 months. So it's driven by Northern Midland Basin, Delaware Basin. And so, it really is representative of the portfolio and we\u2019ll continue to hydrate that and attempt to move more resource into that category.","Derrick Whitfield","Great and thanks for the update and taking my questions.","Timothy Leach","All right. Thank you.","Jack Harper","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today's call. I would now like to turn the call back it over to Tim Leach for any further remarks.","Timothy Leach ","Thank you for your attention. I know there's a lot of earnings coming in today and lots of calls. But I appreciate your interest in Concho and look forward to talking to you the next quarter. Thank you very much.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude today's program. And you may all disconnect.

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Ms. Megan Hays, Director of Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin.","Megan P. Hays - Director, Investor Relations","Thank you very much. Good morning. Thank you for joining Concho's Second Quarter Conference Call. Joining me today in Midland is the Concho senior management team. In addition to yesterday's earnings release we have posted additional information in our earnings slide presentation that is available on our website.","Before I turn the call over to Tim, please be reminded that we will make forward-looking statements this morning. Please refer to the forward-looking statement and other disclaimers contained in our earnings release and on slide 2 of today's presentation.","Also we will reference certain non-GAAP measures. How we calculate these measures and reconciliations to the comparable GAAP measures are provided in the earnings release and the presentation.","With that, I'll turn it over to Tim.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you. Good morning. Today our industry is facing headwinds as commodity prices move lower. The outlook appears uncertain. And it seems there are more variables than ever influencing corporate decisions and market volatility.","At Concho, we're navigating the commodity downturn by staying committed to our business strategy, developing our high quality Permian assets, delivering profitable growth and maintaining a strong financial position. As you saw in yesterday's release, we're achieving differentiated performance and demonstrating that our strategy works through the cycles.","Let's start on slide three with a review of the key highlights for the quarter. For the second quarter we reported record production volumes, lower cost and operational efficiencies throughout all of our assets. Total production for the second quarter averaged 147,000 BOEs per day. Production was more than 5,000 BOEs per day above the high end of our guidance range and represented an 11% increase over the first quarter. Our crude oil production increased by 45% year-over-year.","During the quarter our drilling program added nearly 10,000 barrels of daily oil production compared to the first quarter. These outstanding results reflect the strength of our assets and the team's relentless focus on enhancing value by drilling and completing wells faster, improving completion techniques and increasing well productivity.","The quarter's operational performance translated to a strong financial result. EBITDAX for the second quarter was $458 million. Unit cost including lease operating expense, DD&A and G&A were lower year-over-year. Both unit LOE and G&A decreased compared to the first quarter of 2015.","For full-year 2015 we again raised our guidance for production growth as a result of our strong well performance and the efficiency gains we have achieved this year. We expect to deliver about 25% annual growth, up from the 20% target provided last quarter while maintaining our $2 billion capital program.","Commodity price volatility is not new to the industry and Concho's got a track record of adapting and improving capital returns during challenging times, much like we've done in previous cycles. We've built a dominant position in one of the most prolific oil and natural gas basins in the United States. We've identified a deep inventory of drilling locations and maintained a strong balance sheet along the way. In the recent down cycle we demonstrated our operational flexibility by trimming the original capital budget by a third, from $3 billion to $2 billion.","And due to the productivity of our wells, we've nearly achieved our original growth target. Through the first half of the year we've invested about two-thirds of our 2015 capital budget. That's resulted in dramatic performance and efficiency gains. While this optimization is a priority, so is capital discipline. Our spend rate will now slow dramatically in the second half and we expect to land our base budget within the $2 billion range. As a result of the reduced spending in the second half, you'll see flatter production for the remainder of the year and growth resuming in 2016 as we execute a drilling program that's targeted within cash flow.","At Concho we manage for the long term. The cycles remind us that the industry is prone to volatility and that we can't control the price of our commodity. So we've built a scalable business with robust economics, even at these price levels. This enables us to maintain our efficient drilling machine, a benefit of our straightforward hedging strategy and our operational flexibility, so we can take a measured approach to further slowing down and focusing on maximizing efficiencies.","Turning to slide 4, I'm proud of the results our team delivered this quarter. We continue to see strong momentum from our horizontal program in the Delaware basin. For the second quarter, horizontal production averaged about 82,000 BOEs per day, representing a 66% increase year-over-year and an 18% increase over the first quarter of 2015. Cash operating expenses are shown on slide 5. Per unit costs continue to trend lower, reflecting lower production costs, field-level improvements and higher volumes.","Now let's review our core areas, turning to slide 6. We'll start with the Northern Delaware basin. We're running 10 rigs here today. Overall efficiency has improved with drilling days down 15% year-over-year to approximately 23 days per well. In addition to drilling faster, we're optimizing completion methods and increasing recoveries and returns. Three quarters ago we highlighted the productivity gains from enhanced completions in the second Bone Spring formation.","Our team has achieved similar improvements in the oil-rich Avalon shale in Lea County, outlined on slide 7. The Avalon shale is roughly 1,000 feet thick, providing opportunity to target an upper and lower section. Our current inventory for the Avalon assumes only four to six wells per section, and we believe there's upside to further build the inventory as we test multi-zone and down spacing potential.","We have at least 180 days of performance data from multiple Avalon wells where we've used the bigger completions. Our chart on slide 8 illustrates the production uplift from greater completion intensity. On average, cumulative production per well increased more than 60% over the first 180 days of production compared to the wells we've completed with the base design. Our total well cost for enhanced completions averages about $6 million, or an incremental $0.5 million compared to the base average. This is a highly profitable program for us, generating 70% rates of return at $60 oil. We plan to drill 25 wells to 30 wells in this area during calendar 2015.","In the Southern Delaware basin on slide 9, we're running two rigs today. A benefit of our scale in the Permian is our ability to transfer success from one asset to another. We've shortened the learning curve in the Southern Delaware with drilling days down compared to a year ago. In addition to drilling faster we're realizing completion improvements and optimizing well spacing.","On to slide 10, we're also running two rigs in the Midland basin, focusing on long lateral development and delineating the multi-zone Wolfcamp and Spraberry across our position. Our Midland basin assets are primarily held by production, which provides operational flexibility as we refine our drilling completion methods to effectively recover more oil.","Moving on to the New Mexico Shelf on slide 11, where we're currently running two horizontal rigs. We're drilling faster on the Shelf with feet drilled per day increasing 11% year-over-year. And let's not forget this asset has been one of the bedrock assets for Concho since the IPO and still continues to be a workhorse that delivers solid results quarter after quarter.","On slide 12, capital expenditures excluding acquisitions were $565 million in the second quarter, down 23% from the first quarter. In total we're running 16 horizontal rigs compared to a peak of nearly 40 rigs in 2014. In the first half of 2015 we completed the work from the ramp in activity that started in 2014. With the remaining work we have planned and the current service costs, we expect drilling capital and cash flow to be in balance as we continue through the second half of 2015.","We've recently added to our hedge position. For crude oil in the second half of 2015 we're approximately 75% hedged at $75 per barrel. For 2016 we now have hedges covering 18 million barrels of oil at $76 per barrel.","And looking ahead, I want to provide some insight into how we're thinking about next year. We're committed to executing a disciplined drilling program, ensuring that the capital we're investing delivers value to our shareholders as we maintain a strong financial position and advance operational efficiencies.","The current outlook for price of crude suggests another challenging year for our industry, further impacting activity levels. At today's forward curve for oil we expect to generate another year of production growth in 2016 while targeting the capital program that's within cash flow. This implies less capital in 2015 and highlights the improving capital efficiency of our drilling program.","I'll conclude on slide 13. The Concho strategy cycle-tested. We've been successful at assembling some of the highest quality assets in the Permian and growing our low-risk drilling inventory. Our balance sheet's solid, our drilling program's delivering top-tier performance, and our people are constantly improving the business. Drilling days are down, well performance is improving, the cost structure is aligning with the current reality of the commodity price environment. So we're well positioned to come out of this cycle stronger than ever.","And more than ever before, choosing the right team is probably the most important part of the investment decision that you will make. So thank you for your confidence in Concho, and I'll now turn the call back over to the moderator, and look forward to the Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from the line of David Tameron of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning, Tim.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, David.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Can you just, I'll go with the M&A question. Can you just talk about \u2013 obviously you were I guess public in saying that you were out looking for assets. But so is everybody else. Can you just talk about what you're seeing in that environment and opportunities?","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Tell me your preamble again. What was the first thing you said?","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","About M&A, sorry.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","But you said I...","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Just about the assets. There was, let me rephrase then. I, there was a lot of chatter on our side that Concho was going to be out looking for assets. Part of the reason you raised equity was to go buy something. So you can address that, whether or not you choose to address that, that's fine. But, bigger picture can you just talk about the M&A, and what you're seeing in that arena?","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, sure. We've had the philosophy for a long time that you use your cash flow to drill and you use your balance sheet to take advantage of opportunities. And that's why we think it's important to maintain a strong balance sheet. And in this environment I think we're seeing more opportunities to do the things we like to do to grow. And historically in these kinds of down cycles it's been the time that we've been able to add good assets to our company. And so that's no different than it's been in the past and we're as active as we've ever been at trying to find good things for our shareholders. I would say that everything's still \u2013 the big deals still look expensive to us. And really the focus of where we're finding most of our opportunity is within our core areas in the smaller sized, blocking and tackling things that enhance the stuff that we're already doing. So it's...","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And is it fair to say you've done \u2013 it looks like you've done a little more recently sales. Is that the type of blocking and tackling, so smaller pieces like that?","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Yeah.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","All right. I just had a couple so I'll let somebody else jump on. Thanks.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Kelly of Global Hunter. Your line is now open.","Michael Kelly - Global Hunter Securities","Hey. Good morning.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Michael Kelly - Global Hunter Securities","I'm trying to figure out how to ask this to actually get an answer from you, Tim. On 2016's outlook here, if you look at 2015 you had a 35% cut in the CapEx budget and achieved 25% growth or will achieve. I'm really just curious to see on 2016 it looks like just ballpark figures that you could have a pretty similar CapEx cut in 2016 versus 2015 if you want to stay within cash flow.","And I want to get a sense on the efficiency front comping maybe efficiencies you expect to see in 2016 versus 2015 and what that could ultimately translate to in terms of potential growth, or how we should think about next year's program on a lower CapEx and what that could do...","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure.","Michael Kelly - Global Hunter Securities","...ultimately for volumes. Thanks.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I mean one thing I want to make sure that you hear me say is that we think that in this environment we can stay within cash flow in our drilling program and grow our production profile. I think that's an important bullet point. When you're comparing 2015 and 2016 I think that the other thing you have to remember is 2015 we were coming off a very large ramp that began in 2014.","So a lot of the work that we began in 2014 spilled over and we had lots of production coming online the fourth quarter of last year, the first quarter of this year. So timing's really important when you look at the 2015 versus 2016 versus 2014 for that matter.","So I agree with you that in a lower commodity price environment, it looks like our capital budget will be smaller again in 2016 than it was in 2015 but we are making very good wells. The enhanced completions are being applied across all our assets and in almost every well that we're drilling. So I think those kind of efficiencies give us the confidence that we think we'll be able to grow in 2016 staying within cash flow.","Michael Kelly - Global Hunter Securities","Okay. Great. And, follow-up on that, just curious what we should expect to see going forward on the enhanced completion front. You've really highlighted pretty drastic improvements in Second Bone and now the Avalon. If you could highlight of whether you're targeting other formations here or you're just kind of keep hammering on these two formations for the time being? Thanks.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","No, I mean, we are having success in all of our assets in all the different zones. And highlighted two, I mean we were talking before the call that it's getting harder and harder to have a base set of data to compare, enhanced completions against because everything now is kind of an enhanced completion of one type or another. I think you'll see us do more and more work in the Wolfcamp. We've had success in the Wolfcamp, in all our core areas so that's another zone that I think's going to be impactful to us.","Michael Kelly - Global Hunter Securities","Okay. Great. Really appreciate it. Great quarter.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from David Deckelbaum of KeyBanc. Your line is now open.","David A. Deckelbaum - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Good morning, Tim. Thanks for taking my questions.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure.","David A. Deckelbaum - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","I was hoping to get some color on the Avalon shale. It looks like you guys have added maybe 10 additional completions or 15 additional completions this year. One, is that coming at the expense of another program? And, two, just could you update us on some of the things that you witnessed in the second quarter because I think to-date we have the data from the first quarter's completions?","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Jack, you want to...","Jack F. Harper - Executive Vice President","Yeah. David, this is Jack. I mean we've, you know, continued to allocate the capital to areas that are making higher rates of return. And as compared to our original budget, the Avalon is getting more dollars and we're drilling more wells. So, but I think that's the beauty of these completions and applying them where we can really get program economics working for us.","David A. Deckelbaum - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. And, maybe just on the guidance, you're still \u2013 your guidance for oil mix still kind of implies a declining oil mix throughout the year. Is that still kind of risking the oil cut of the Avalon area?","Jack F. Harper - Executive Vice President","Yeah. I mean I think that we're very comfortable with that range and certainly the middle to upper part of that range and that's it. You know, the well mix makes a big difference and so yes, to answer your question.","David A. Deckelbaum - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","I guess another way of asking, I think like in the first quarter we saw some of those oily Avalon completions in the high 70s% in terms of crude cut. Is that \u2013 but I know like in the inventory obviously it's quite lower in the areas that you're drilling now do you expect like a mid-60s% or low-70s% oil cut for Avalon shale wells?","Jack F. Harper - Executive Vice President","Oh, again, it varies a bit well-to-well but the initial rates are consistent in the 70s%, like you said in this particular area. But we're balancing that with the wells we're drilling in all of the different areas when we come up with that guidance.","David A. Deckelbaum - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. Thanks for the color there, guys.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Pearce Hammond of Simmons and Company. Your line is now open.","Pearce Wheless Hammond - Simmons & Company International","Thank you for taking my questions this morning.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Pearce Wheless Hammond - Simmons & Company International","Tim, you \u2013 appreciate the color on 2016, that's helpful. And if the capital budget is lower in 2016 and you're still delivering production growth, do you think your activity levels would also be reduced \u2013 you'd do it with less rigs?","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well we're down to 16 rigs right now, so we've continued through the first and second quarter to cut rigs. I think we're going to try to hit an activity level in the third and fourth quarter that will carry us through 2016. But there's a lot of variables, the oil price \u2013 it depends a lot on the oil price. It depends on service cost. We still have some time to watch and plan for that. But I think, yes, the number of rigs and all that that we're using in 2016 is going to be lower certainly than it was in 2015.","Pearce Wheless Hammond - Simmons & Company International","Great. Thank you. And then my follow-up is, what are your thoughts on the fall bank redetermination season and any impact to Concho?","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I don't think there will be any impact to Concho. We \u2013 what's that?","Darin G. Holderness - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Spring. We're only once a year.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes, we're once a year...","Darin G. Holderness - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","It's spring.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","...and we've got a large borrowing base, it could be larger. And, we've got quite a bit of crude develop producing reserves and I think that's what the banks are after. So we're very thankful of the position we're in financially.","Pearce Wheless Hammond - Simmons & Company International","Well, great. Thank you very much, and congrats on an excellent quarter.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from John Freeman of Raymond James. Your line is now open.","John A. Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Good morning, guys, another great quarter. First thing, I was trying to get a little bit more color on last quarter you all mentioned after bringing online, I want to say roughly just over 100 net wells in the first quarter that that pace would slow to around 60 wells a quarter, kind of pretty consistent 2Q through 4Q. And it looks like you were a good bit above that pace in 2Q. So I'm just trying to get kind of an update on the well, completed well cadence the rest of the year.","Jack F. Harper - Executive Vice President","Yes, John. For the rest of the year we're looking at more of a balance between wells drilled and completed in that plus or minus 80 wells per quarter.","John A. Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","And that's a net number, right?","Jack F. Harper - Executive Vice President","Those are gross numbers.","John A. Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Those are gross. Okay. And then my one follow-up question, on the Avalon, when we talk about the current spacing in your inventory right now is based on the four wells to six wells per section, then you're going to try these downspacing tests in the, later this year. Those downspacing tests, how many wells per section are you planning to test?","Jack F. Harper - Executive Vice President","Yeah. They're at the upper end of that range of four wells to six wells per section.","John A. Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Great. Thanks, Jack. Appreciate it.","Jack F. Harper - Executive Vice President","You bet.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Todd Hanold (sic) [Scott Hanold] of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Yeah. Thanks. It's Scott Hanold here. Thanks for taking my questions.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Good morning. I've heard worse, right? On the oily Avalon, just to keep on that theme, obviously a pretty exciting opportunity. When we look at your box on page seven, you know, a couple things standout. One, it's a big area and there's still some, I guess, space outside of Concho. In general, big picture, do you see much acquisition opportunity in there? And if you could define what your net acreage in that box is that'd be great.","Jack F. Harper - Executive Vice President","Yeah. I mean we're not \u2013 we don't really comment on acquisitions but like our \u2013 all core areas we're always in search of ways to add on. The way we've talked about our inventory there, Scott, is roughly a third of our Avalon inventory of 1,500 wells, so 500 wells plus or minus is accounted for in that focus area.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Appreciate that color. And then, again, on the Avalon I guess I'll keep with that for my follow-up questions. Tim, I think you mentioned there, it's really thick there. Could you define that a little bit for us? And you discussed there being potentially an upper and a lower section, where have your wells to date been placed and what is the near-term plan of testing the other part of that formation?","Jack F. Harper - Executive Vice President","Yeah. In that area it's about 1,000 feet thick and we have tests in both the upper and the lower section.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. So your wells have been in both. So when you do that downspacing would they be staggered or is that four to six in just of those upper or lower?","Jack F. Harper - Executive Vice President","Yeah. Those are in one of the zones.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","In one of the zones? Okay. So there's a possibility of stacking the wells on top of each other than in theory?","Jack F. Harper - Executive Vice President","There is that potential.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Awesome. Appreciate it. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Singer of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Brian A. Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. Good morning.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Brian.","Brian A. Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","When we look at what's implied in production in CapEx guidance, third quarter looks down from second quarter and fourth quarter looks down from third quarter with fourth quarter looking a lot closer to where you were in the first quarter. So when we look ahead to 2016, the prospects of what looks like it would be a $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion capital program to stay within cash flow at strip prices, that's not that different a run rate than what you're projecting for the second half of 2015 during this period of sequentially declining production. Is there backlog coming on or can you reconcile this more specifically for how production would sequentially grow in 2016 when that's not being guided to in the second half of this year?","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. I'm mean you got to think about 2016 will be a year where you would get the full benefit of cost concessions for one, and continued efficiencies and capital allocation. So those are really the main things to be thinking about.","Brian A. Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","I guess when we looked at the capital program and where you are right now, are you not fully benefit, or would you not fully benefit from that in the second half of 2015, so there would be even further benefits? And is that a function of rig contracts that are coming off that would go back to lower market rates or is it more of a productivity point from where you're drilling?","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes, it's probably a little bit of both. But you're right, we are getting, the costs are what they are today, but so it's well allocation and where you're going to spend those dollars.","Brian A. Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. And then in the Midland basin, can you just give us an update there of where you're choosing, and the zones that you're choosing to drill? And then strategy importance and whether that's an area you would focus on for acquisitions.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes, like we've said in previous quarters, we like the Midland basin. Most of our activity has been focused in the Wolfcamp but we also have tested the Spraberry. And yes is the answer to the question, would we look at acquisitions there. Yes, we would.","Brian A. Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Are there any new zones there or any more recent results worth flagging from a, that would shift to more of your focus to one zone from another?","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Not really to speak of.","Brian A. Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Drew Venker of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Drew E. Venker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good morning, everyone.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Drew E. Venker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","I was hoping you could talk a little bit more about the Wolfcamp results in the Southern Delaware basin, whether you're seeing some flatter declines. And, really just asking that because it looks like your 30-day (27:25) rates were pretty comparable to your 24 hour rates. It looks flatter than before, but maybe if you could comment there.","Jack F. Harper - Executive Vice President","Oh, it's really pretty close to where it's been in the past, and that just is a factor of that subset of wells. So I wouldn't read too much into that.","Drew E. Venker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay.","Jack F. Harper - Executive Vice President","It's an area we like and it's got great economics. So we're going to continue to allocate money there.","Drew E. Venker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks, Jack. And then on the, going back to the prior questions about inventory and stacking wells. How much testing have you done within the Second Bone Spring to stack wells on top of each other? Do you have a good sense of whether they could produce independently?","Jack F. Harper - Executive Vice President","Yes, we haven't really done a lot of testing in that zone. And it's not as thick as the Avalon and it's a different type of reservoir, so.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","But on the Second Bone Spring that's in an area that we've drilled five independent zones...","Jack F. Harper - Executive Vice President","Correct.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","...in addition to the Bone Springs. So it's a multi-zone, lots of potential area.","Drew E. Venker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. But essentially stacking wells in Second Bone Spring would not be baked into your inventory?","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","No, no. Not necessarily. Just the spacing assumptions that we've given is really what goes into that inventory count.","Drew E. Venker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay, okay. Is it fair to say that if oil prices are lower than they are today, you'd still target spending within cash flow?","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","That's right.","Drew E. Venker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","No real change in thinking there. Okay.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yep, yep.","Drew E. Venker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks. That's all I had.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","All right. Thank you.","Jack F. Harper - Executive Vice President","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Smith of Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Jason Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, good morning, everyone.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Jack F. Harper - Executive Vice President","Good morning.","Jason Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Tim, just coming back to the drilled uncompleted wells. I think so far this year you guys have completed 90 more wells than you've drilled. So can you just give an update on where that backlog stands today and what you guys are targeting there?","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, we've got about an inventory of 25 uncompleted wells today, which is, in our view, about right for the number of rigs that we're running. We're running about 16 rigs today. So that backlog that we had at the first of the year naturally worked itself down, most of that happened in the second quarter. A big part of it happened in the second quarter. And, so we think we're at a run rate now that's comfortable for us.","Jason Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. Okay. And my follow-up is on the balance sheet. Obviously the balance sheet's in very good shape, but historically you've been pretty strict about keeping net debt to EBITDA I think around two times. So under your plan of spending within cash flow, how do you see that playing out next year?","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, well we think that's an important parameter and we were in better shape when oil was $65 than when oil is $47, but we're still in pretty good shape. And we plan to keep a very close watch on that and keep our activity at a level that we don't run outside our debt fairway.","Jason Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Great. I appreciate the answers. Thanks, guys.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeffrey Campbell of Tuohy Brothers. Your line is now open.","Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Good morning, and congratulations on the strong quarter. On slide 7, you highlighted the upper and lower Avalon and you showed four wells to six wells per section. Does that include both zones or is that a per zone estimate?","Jack F. Harper - Executive Vice President","Yeah, we're really just considering the Avalon in total when we say that. So four wells to six wells per section.","Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Okay, good. And I was wondering if you could add some color on the significant drilling efficiencies that you're seeing throughout your operations and what I'm really wondering is the degree to which performance is influenced by services components such as enhanced bits, fluids, geosteering as opposed to better logistics and retaining your very best personnel as the rig count has declined.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","The answer is always it's a little bit of all that. But I'll tell you that when the industry is in a slowdown type of mode, the rigs, the equipment, the people that have been retained are the very best and that makes a big difference. The efficiencies, the speed of drilling, the quality of the fracs, the logistics, all that improve and that's helped us quite a bit.","Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Okay. Great. I appreciate that. And we're looking forward to seeing Matt in a couple of weeks.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ipsit Mohanty of GMP Securities. Your line is now open.","Ipsit Mohanty - GMP Securities LLC","Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Just a quick housekeeping, when you talked about 2016 and drilling within cash flows, what sort of deck (32:27) are we looking at for oil and gas?","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, right now we were just talking about the strip, but whatever it is when we get toward the end of the year, we'll adjust off of that and target within cash flow spending.","Ipsit Mohanty - GMP Securities LLC","Okay. And sorry if I missed that, but what well costs are we looking at right now in the Southern\/Northern Delaware and the Midland basin?","Jack F. Harper - Executive Vice President","Oh, it depends on each area. And, I'd just encourage you to call our team and get that by area.","Ipsit Mohanty - GMP Securities LLC","Will do. Thank you. And just in terms of the non-D&C spending that when you think about 2016 versus 2015, you spent a bunch in midstream. But is that in the rearview now? Are you still looking, will you look for a much lower non-D&C spending in 2016?","Jack F. Harper - Executive Vice President","Yeah, historically the non-D&C spending has been in the kind of middle to high-single digits as a percentage of the budget and I think that's the type of range we'd be thinking about right now.","Ipsit Mohanty - GMP Securities LLC","Okay. And one last, this is more of a strategy question, is when you think about allocating capital in this sort of an environment or even a falling environment if you will in 2016, and as you remain prudent on balance sheet and you think across your asset base, will the allocation of rigs be similar to what we have right now in the Midland basin and Shelf versus what you're seeing in Avalon?","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","It will be similar but there will always be movement from one area to the \u2013 that's the beauty of having four areas that have competitive economics.","Ipsit Mohanty - GMP Securities LLC","Got you. Thank you. Thanks for taking my questions.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Neal Dingmann of SunTrust. Your line is now open.","Neal D. Dingmann - Suntrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Hey, good morning Tim, Jack. Say, just two quick ones. Tim, on that slide 15, I'm just wondering, I know you haven't baked it in your sort of the guidance or expectations yet, but just your thoughts on the two things there \u2013 the wells per section, and then secondly your thoughts about doing some multi-stacked pads. Is there upside potential on both, maybe even late this year or next year, on both those sides?","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","There is, but I would tell you that as the industry slows down, as our capital budget gets smaller, we drill fewer wells, there's not as much experimentation. The data collection and experimentation will take longer, so, and the wells per section that you're referring to, I think the inventory is \u2013 people aren't as on fire about how much inventory you have as much as how capital efficient are you with the capital you're putting to work in this part of the cycle.","Neal D. Dingmann - Suntrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Yeah, very good points, Tim. And then just lastly on that slide 6 that shows the Northern Delaware, just I think somebody had kind of referred or alluded to around this, Tim, your thoughts. I know there hasn't been as much activity in that very Northwest part of Eddy County. Just your thoughts when you get further north up there.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, we've drilled some really good wells up there. The zones are a little bit different than they are in the South, but that's, we've got lots of acreage up there, we've had lots of success.","Neal D. Dingmann - Suntrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Got it. Got it. Okay. Thanks, guys. Great quarter.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Jack F. Harper - Executive Vice President","Thank you, Neal.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from James Sullivan of Alembic Global Advisors. Your line is now open.","James Sullivan - Alembic Global Advisors LLC","So obviously you guys are looking at a pretty significant deceleration in the second half of this year. Can you just comment are there any factors out in the field that would prevent you from decelerating as fast as you might like. And I'm thinking here about a problem that I've heard described and actually was touched on a little bit earlier about the higher quality rig crews that you guys are retaining now, that you're drilling wells faster than, extremely fast, and you find yourself having to complete them and then spending money more quickly than you planned to. So it's a high-class problem to have, but it still is a problem when you're trying to control capital. So any comments you have on that would be great.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. No, I mean one \u2013 the first part of your question about physical constraints, I mean the way we built that into our comments is talking about our operational flexibility, meaning we don't have long-term contracts. So we don't \u2013 that doesn't prohibit us from slowing down. There've been some things we've done in the field that allowed us to keep these crews working like on the frac spreads, we had a high number of 24-hour-a-day teams working out there. Almost all that's been cut back to just working in the daylight; so that leaves teams working but fewer wells completed, slows down the rate. So things like that are ways that you kind of preserve your service companies and at the same time slow down your rate of spend.","But I think as we decelerate in the second half of 2015, I mean we're going to be hitting a pace with the crews, both the drilling and the frac spreads that I think we can carry into 2016.","James Sullivan - Alembic Global Advisors LLC","Okay. That's great. That's helpful. So just one other one, we haven't really talked that much about the Southern Delaware, could you just update us a little bit on what you're doing down there? Obviously I saw that the lateral lengths are getting longer and you guys continue to drill good wells, but I was thinking a little bit about the newer acreage in Central Reeves; what's the permit situation out there? Are you getting ready to start testing stuff out there? Or, what's the state of play?","Jack F. Harper - Executive Vice President","We continue to be active, two rigs running down there. And we've drilled essentially in the same areas in the previous quarters that we have been in this most recent quarter, so I'd say it's steady state.","James Sullivan - Alembic Global Advisors LLC","Okay. And then any plans for the newer stuff up in Reeves?","Jack F. Harper - Executive Vice President","Oh, probably not other than what you've described.","James Sullivan - Alembic Global Advisors LLC","Okay. Sounds great. All right. Thanks, guys. Great quarter.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from David Heikkinen of Heikkinen Energy Advisors. Your line is now open.","David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","Good morning guys and thanks for taking my question. As I think about optimized completions and kind of balancing returns with productivity, EUR and cost, in this commodity environment, do you start reducing costs like frac stages or size that would lead to lower productivities and EURs ever?","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, ever is a big word, but no, that hasn't really entered into our thinking at this point in time. It's...","David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","Okay.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","We're trying to make these wells the best, highest recovery, highest initial rates and optimize, we're trying to find the appropriate cluster spacing and sand loading, things like that. So no, it's not can we drill cheaper wells to keep the returns up. We haven't had to do that.","David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","Okay. Not yet. And then thinking a little longer term beyond 2016 around how you think about the impact of your hedges and the value of those hedges that are benefiting this year and next year, and you're living within 10% of cash flow targets and you're less than two times debt to EBITDA. How do hedges factor into your CapEx versus cash flow thoughts and your balance sheet thoughts.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Oh, in the past we haven't considered the hedges as a part of our cash flow as far as our capital budget. When we say living within cash flow, it means the, what the script looks like. And if the hedges give us a cushion so we can be more thoughtful about speeding up or slowing down and not jerking around the big operational machine. But the value of those cash flows and the cash settlements we get on them obviously go into our drilling machine and we invest that money. We've typically built about a 18 month to 24 month book of rolling hedges and we're continuing to do that. We still \u2013 I mentioned on the call, the average price for the remaining hedges in 2015 and 2016 will continue to add to that. In the past, that length of book has kind of been able to bridge us across these down cycles. And our hope is that that will be the case this time as well.","David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","So kind of calling on the insurance policy maybe a little bit through this down cycle versus kind of the normal way you've thought about the value of hedges over time is how we should think about it. Okay.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, and I just want to make sure that you understand that we do get the benefit of the cash flow of those settlements...","David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","Yeah.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","...of hedges and we invest that money as part of our budget.","David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","Yes. That's helpful, thanks.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. All right.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Robertson of Barclays. Your line is now open.","Jeffrey Woolf Robertson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you, Tim. Two question. One on LOEs. Can you talk a little bit about the trend of LOEs as you see it into 2016 and whether there are things that you can do to chip away at those? And then secondly, can you talk a little bit about the midstream arrangements in the Delaware basin and in the context of now that you've got a more normal wells-in-process inventory, are you also shortening the cycle time of spud-to-sales in tying that infrastructure? And is that part of trying to get more efficient with your capital as you look out into 2016?","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I'll ask Jack to address the second question. The first question on LOEs, I'll take. And, it \u2013 we do a lot of things to try to keep our LOEs low and our costs under control, and investing in saltwater disposal systems is one of them. We've \u2013 in previous quarters we got into a conversation about for all that infrastructure, we're a kind of a pay-as-you-go company, so we always have some activities of building out saltwater disposal systems and things like that that help mitigate the cost of producing these wells. At the same time, a lot of the improvement you've seen in our LOE per unit is the fact that our units are so strong. So the production is so strong. So I do believe that we will be able to maintain a low cost structure on our oil that we produce, but growing production and concentrated and focused operations is the way we achieve all that.","Jack F. Harper - Executive Vice President","Yeah. And, Jeff, on the midstream question related to the Northern Delaware Basin, we \u2013 as you remember, we're building a large gathering system up there that will result in almost all of the Northern Delaware Basin oil barrels being on pipe by the first part of next year. So that'll be a big advantage for us, moving those barrels from trucks to pipe.","Jeffrey Woolf Robertson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Jack, that will show up in the crude price, right, instead of an LOE number?","Jack F. Harper - Executive Vice President","Correct. In the realization, you're right.","Jeffrey Woolf Robertson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. All right. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Grigel of Macquarie. Your line is now open.","Paul Grigel - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Hi. Good morning to the team there. Was wondering if you guys could provide a little bit more color on the rig plan as you guys head into the end of the year and then into the start of 2016, as much as you can provide on rig count? If you plan on holding at 16 or any further reductions in the current price environment?","Jack F. Harper - Executive Vice President","Yeah. I mean as Tim said, we're at 16 today. That number could bounce around a little bit, just depending on where we're drilling wells between now and the end of the year. And beyond that it'd be too early to comment.","Paul Grigel - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay. And then just generally speaking on the service cost side, it was touched on a little bit earlier but could you talk a little bit more on, is there more service cost savings to be found on the drilling side and the completion side? Or are we pretty late in the game there at this stage of the cycle?","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I mean I think at the current commodity price environment I think there's probably more savings to be had, but it still feels like it's late in the game. I don't think that the future service cost savings are going to be as \u2013 of magnitude of the same size as what we've seen in the first half of the year. At the same time I think there's other efficiencies, and we talked about them a little bit already on this call, the slowdown helps in almost every aspect of the logistics and the equipment and the people that are working out there. And that's also helpful and will also be impactful, I think.","Paul Grigel - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay. And then one last one, have you seen the number of non-consents pick up over the last few months here as the oil's kind of returned back down to the lows at this point in time? And is that an opportunity to pick up acreage going forward in the blocking-and-tackling mechanism?","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Yes, we have. And I mean the way I think about that is a very cheap acquisition. But in most of these arrangements in the oil and gas industry, a non-consented interest doesn't bring a whole lot of acreage with it. It's mostly the well bore that you're drilling at that time. But it's still \u2013 I guess our view is it's an inexpensive acquisition, and the non-consents have become more meaningful than they have been in the past.","Paul Grigel - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Thanks. That's it for me.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Scialla of Stifel. Your line is now open.","Michael S. Scialla - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yeah. Hi. Good morning, guys. I wanted to follow-up on Brian Singer's question on how do you contemplate growing production in 2016, move within cash flow when it looks like in the second half of 2015 your forecast and sequential production declines. Jack, you mentioned in 2016 you'll get the full benefit of a full year of cost savings. I'm wondering too, is part of the answer there in that your base decline rate is going to shallow as you move into 2016, I would think, with the decelerating rig count? How do you think about that?","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Let me take that on. Yes, I think that's part of the answer. I think the other part of the answer's timing though. And, I think for us, if you run a steady state model of what can we do within cash flow with our base of assets and our base of production, we can grow it within cash flow. That, the world we find ourselves in today. Now the second half of this year we're coming off a very big ramp, and the production in the first and second quarter is a result of completing a whole lot of wells all at one time. So the production performance in the third quarter and fourth quarter is greatly affected by timing. And I think the thing that we get a lot of encouragement out of is if you look past the timing of that acceleration that began in 2014. We can still grow this company from that level within cash flow, so, and I think that's going to differentiate us.","Michael S. Scialla - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Got it. That's helpful. And then I kind of wanted to follow-on David Heikkinen's question too. I guess maybe in reverse, he was talking about maybe looking at ways to save on well costs. Would you cut back on your well costs there or cut back on what you're putting into your wells? I'm wondering, have you found the limits yet on where you think you've optimized the sand concentrations in particular with these wells?","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, and lots of \u2013 it's not continuing, it doesn't always continue to get bigger. So in many circumstances we think where we've found the optimal, where you have diminishing returns. And it's both spacing and amount of sand and type of fluid and all those components.","Michael S. Scialla - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","So you think you're there in say like the Second Bone Spring and Avalon, or are you still experimenting in some of the other formations or do you think you're pretty much there on all of them at this point?","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, even in the Second Bone Spring and Avalon, we will always be experimenting and fine-tuning and you learn something just about with every well you drill, I think. And, but it's not always bigger is better.","Michael S. Scialla - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Got it. And then the last one from me, Tim, you said less experimentation given the lower spending but any thoughts on I think the service companies, talking pretty heavily about the potential of re-fracs, have you looked at those at all? And would that make any sense at all in an environment where you're going to spend less?","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I don't think re-fracs in the short term are going to be any real part of our capital program.","Michael S. Scialla - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Got it. Thanks a lot. Appreciate it.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Tim Leach for any closing remarks.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Thank you. Once again, I thank you for the good questions and the large participation on this call. And the team here looks forward to visiting with you over the next several weeks. And thank you again for your interest in the company.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation on today's conference. This concludes the program. You may now disconnect.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. And later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Miss Megan Hays. Ma'am, you may begin.","Megan P. Hays - Concho Resources, Inc.","Thank you, Amanda. Good morning, and welcome to Concho's third quarter 2017 earnings call. On the call with me today in Midland is Tim Leach, Chairman and CEO; Jack Harper, President and CFO; and members of the Concho senior management team. Our third quarter earnings release and corporate presentation are available on our website. Additionally, we plan to file our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q today after market close.","Please note that we will make forward-looking statements based on current expectations this morning. Also, some of our comments may reference non-GAAP financial measures. Forward-looking statement and other disclaimers as well as reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial figures are provided in the earnings release and corporate presentation.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Tim.","Timothy A. Leach - Concho Resources, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning. Thank you for joining. I'm sure it was a late night for many of you on the call. 2017 is an important year where execution strength and scale differentiate industry leaders. Over the past decade, we've built an execution machine that delivers reliable growth and this quarter was no exception.","Our operational teams delivered an outstanding quarter as total production of 193,000 Boes per day exceeded the high end of our guidance range and represented 5% growth over the previous quarter. Crude oil production of 120,000 barrels per day increased 6% relative to the second quarter.","Before we move on, I want to acknowledge our team. Hurricane Harvey was a devastating storm that impacted communities along the Gulf Coast. The storm shut down refineries, backed up several pipes out of the Permian, and interrupted the supply chain. It was a storm that could have easily impacted our operations, but it didn't because of the hard work and dedication of a lot of people across our organization.","On the last conference call, I spoke about reaching a new inflection point in capital efficiency. And the inflection is driven by the shift to large-scale project development. We turned two such projects in the Northern Delaware Basin on late in the third quarter. The Windward project includes eight 2-mile laterals in the Avalon and the Vast project includes seven wells in the Wolfcamp Sands and Wolfcamp Shale. These wells produced at a combined peak 30-day rate of more than 30,000 Boes per day, of which 74% was oil.","We continue to deliver strong individual well results. But as large-scale projects become a bigger part of our program, 30-day rates on individual wells become less relevant. The focus is moving to longer data production from our projects. In the slide presentation this quarter, we updated the production history for several projects and key wells in Red Hills and the Deep Area in New Mexico.","This data illustrates the high impact role the Northern Delaware Basin plays in generating sustainable return-driven growth. Building on our success in the Southern Delaware Basin, we continue to unlock the multi-zone resource potential underlying our position. During the quarter, we completed a Wolfcamp B delineation well. Continued success in the Wolfcamp B has the potential to add a third zone to our development program.","Also, in the Southern Delaware Basin, the Brass Monkey project includes eight wells, all 2-mile laterals, within a half section. These wells are landed in the 3rd Bone Spring and Wolfcamp zones. We currently have three completion crews on this project and expect production in early 2018.","We have a premier position in the Midland Basin. And during the quarter, we advanced our development of the Lower Spraberry and Wolfcamp B zones. In addition, the Mabee Ranch development project remains on track for first production in early 2018. This is our largest multi-well project as it includes 13, 2-mile wells targeting five landings across the Spraberry and Wolfcamp zones.","We completed the three fiber optic wells first and quickly deployed real-time findings into our completion plans for the remaining wells. Our legacy New Mexico Shelf properties provided steady production and strong cash flow and we're running one rig here today with a focus on the Paddock and Blinebry zones.","The outlook for full-year 2017 continues to get better. This is a direct result of our team pressing our scale advantage and working both sides of the efficiency equation, producing more barrels per dollar invested. As a result, we're increasing our 2017 growth outlook. We expect total production to come in above the high end of our guidance range of 26%, and oil production to exceed 27%.","Importantly, we expect to land our capital program, excluding acquisitions, within our guidance range of $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion, all of which will be funded within cash flow.","Although we aren't providing our 2018 budget, let me frame our initial thinking. Large scale projects will capture more of next year's activity. And consistent with the three-year outlook, we expect to invest within anticipated cash flow. We plan to provide more visibility to our 2018 plans when we report our year-end results.","We have a better asset base than at any time in our history. Our platform for delivering differentiated growth within cash flow and long-term value for our shareholders is diverse, including leading positions in the Northern Delaware Basin, Southern Delaware Basin, Midland Basin, and the New Mexico Shelf.","Throughout the last quarter, there's been a lot of conversation about what the optimal E&P business model should look like over the next decade. I'm excited that we're in a position to lead that discussion.","For the past two years, we've generated free cash flow, delivered pure leading production growth per debt-adjusted share, and strengthened our financial position. This is a reflection of our returns-based capital allocation process, our active portfolio management, and a dedicated focus on improving margins through cost control.","The E&P business model is evolving. And I believe our advantages, our people, asset quality, scale and a strong balance sheet, put us in the best possible position for defining that model.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Jack to discuss the quarter in more detail.","Jack F. Harper - Concho Resources, Inc.","Thank you. As Tim mentioned, we're proud to announce another strong quarter of operational and financial performance. I can't emphasize enough the importance of our team, our balance sheet and our scale. These are and will continue to be unique advantages that give us confidence in the success and repeatability of the Concho strategy.","Despite a challenging macro backdrop since 2016, we've reduced long-term debt, lowered our cost of capital and improved our cash margin, all of which reinforces our ability to navigate condition in a way few companies can. As a result, the third quarter strong operational performance was accompanied by solid financial results.","Per unit cash cost, production expense, G&A and interest were in line with the previous quarter. And, notably, per unit interest expense is down 42% versus a year ago and is set to improve further following our successful debt refinancing in September. And per unit DD&A expense, which totaled $16, continues to move lower, in part due to improved capital efficiency. All of this translates to adjusted net income per share of $0.45 and EBITDAX of $458 million for the third quarter.","For the fourth quarter of 2017, we expect to complete a record number of growth stages and bring our inventory of wells waiting on completion down from 50 to the mid-30s. And as Tim mentioned, for the full year, we expect to spend within cash flow and deliver production above the high end of the guidance range. The strength of our balance sheet enables us to deliver near-term results, invest for the long-term and better manage risk.","During the third quarter, the team executed several transactions that further reinforced our balance sheet. First, we achieved investment-grade credit ratings from two rating agencies, highlighting our high-quality asset base, disciplined capital allocation, and differentiated execution. Second, we moved our credit facility to unsecured. And third, we issued $1.8 billion of senior notes consisting of both 10-year and 30-year tranches. The proceeds from the notes offering were used to repurchase a total of $2.15 billion of 5.5% senior notes.","Since the second quarter of last year, we have refinanced our entire long-term debt complex. As a result, for our senior notes outstanding, we have extended the average maturity from six years to 16 years, reduced the average interest rate from 5.9% to 4.3%, and lowered annual interest expense by approximately $90 million.","We're focused on delivering on our near-term goals. Our strong portfolio gives us excellent opportunities for delivering per share growth over the long-term. We've seen strong momentum in our business year-to-date, driven in part by our shift to large-scale project development. And we expect that momentum to continue into the fourth quarter and beyond.","And, with that, we'll now open up the call for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And our first question is from the line of John Freeman of Raymond James. Your line is open.","John A. Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Good morning, guys.","Timothy A. Leach - Concho Resources, Inc.","Good morning, John.","Jack F. Harper - Concho Resources, Inc.","Hi, John.","John A. Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Regarding the first three wells that you all did the fiber optic monitoring on and said you sort of took the takeaways from those and looked at how you completed the additional wells and lateral placement. Are there any significant takeaways that you can provide and any thoughts on expanding that to other areas of your portfolio?","Timothy A. Leach - Concho Resources, Inc.","Yeah. I think there are. And those results were results of very early time information. So it had to do more with completion design, plugs, perf performance, those types of things. But I think we're collecting an immense amount of data. And over a longer period of time, it'll give us other information about drainage and how the wells are draining. So, I think it will be extremely beneficial and we can apply it to other areas of the company as well.","John A. Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","And then just my one follow-up on the Oryx system, at least just based on the last filings we have we can see how much has been invested in that system up to this point. Is there any additional investment that you all have to make in Oryx beyond this year?","Jack F. Harper - Concho Resources, Inc.","No, John. We don't anticipate additional equity investment at this point.","John A. Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Great. Well done. Nice quarter.","Timothy A. Leach - Concho Resources, Inc.","Thanks, John.","Jack F. Harper - Concho Resources, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Michael Hall of Heikkinen Energy. Your line is open.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Thanks. Appreciate it. I guess I wanted to maybe go to the discussion around the E&P business model that you did kind of allude to in the opening remarks. And I'm just curious, as a growth company, how you think about this discussion around dividends and other potential cash returns to shareholders as opposed to just plowing back all of the capital into what appear to be very high rate of return projects. How do you think about that balance at this phase of your life?","Timothy A. Leach - Concho Resources, Inc.","Yeah. I think the phase of the life is a good way to think about it because I think that the business is entering a third phase. We were in the resource capture. And then we've been through the phase of identifying all the zones. And now, I think, it's in the development phase. And the development phase will go on for several decades. But when you try to look out into the future, I mean this business will generate tremendous amount of cash flow and a tremendous amount of value creation. That's why we're so excited about our position.","And then the conversation we're having with our shareholders is how do you maximize the value for our shareholders. And we've been able to demonstrate that we can generate free cash flow and grow. And we can do that for a very long period of time. So, I think that's \u2013 the business model that the industry is trying to define over the next several years is what is the best answer for the shareholders. And I think it includes some sort of return of capital. It includes some kind of growth. And, of course, it's going to include generating lots of free cash flow.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","And then, in what sort of timeframe do you think a return of capital could be, I guess, in the cards for Concho?","Timothy A. Leach - Concho Resources, Inc.","Well, we value maximum flexibility. So, I wouldn't tell you anything that I felt pin me down to any particular timeframe. But we've talked about three-year outlooks. We've talked about what the things are going to do over the next decade. So, those are the kind of timeframes that I would be thinking around.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Okay. Understood. And then, I guess, as my follow-up in the context of that three-year outlook. We know you've done a very good job in 2017 of exceeding your growth targets. Does that front-load the CAGR or does that potentially provide upside to the three-year CAGR? How should we think about that?","Jack F. Harper - Concho Resources, Inc.","Oh, it's definitely a good start. You're over 26% on the 20% CAGR no doubt. But as Tim said, I think, it just proves the point that we have an asset base that can do that and gives us a lot of optionality and makes us feel comfortable with that outlook.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","All right. We'll look forward to the 2018 outlook with year-end. Appreciate it. Thank you, guys.","Timothy A. Leach - Concho Resources, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Doug Leggate of Bank of America. Your line is open.","John H. Abbott - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","Good morning. This is John Abbott on for Doug Leggate. We appreciate you taking our questions. Starting, as you move into large-scale development mode with less disclosure on incremental wells, is there a significant change expected per well result as full development comprise a greater mix of parent-child wells?","Timothy A. Leach - Concho Resources, Inc.","I think full development does not create a greater mix of parent-child wells. Full development minimizes the parent-child relationship. So that's one of the strengths. I would really highlight the notion that full development optimizes both the ultimate recovery and the rate of return. And that's one of the things that's driving all this efficiency.","John H. Abbott - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","Okay. And, secondly, you are virtually stuck within spending within cash flow. Oil is looking better. Can you give some sense of the upside range of oil prices where that would apply?","Timothy A. Leach - Concho Resources, Inc.","Well, I'm not sure I completely understand what you're asking, but I would say that we have talked about oil prices being volatile. And we've seen that and I think we expect that going forward. So we're not going to plan our spend rate at the very latest oil price, I wouldn't think.","John H. Abbott - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","I think what he was trying to get at is if oil, let's say, move to the $60 range, is there a point where you'd have some willingness to outspend cash flow? Granted you'd have more cash flow at that time.","Timothy A. Leach - Concho Resources, Inc.","No. I think if it goes to $60, we'll pile up cash.","John H. Abbott - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","All righty. Thank you.","Timothy A. Leach - Concho Resources, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Drew Venker of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Drew E. Venker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good morning, everyone. I just wanted to ask on the rig count ticking down. I think it was within your original plan for the year. But at 15 rigs, is that an indication of you going a bit slower than you have in prior quarters, or more of an indication of drilling higher working interest wells?","Jack F. Harper - Concho Resources, Inc.","Yeah. Drew, the move-down keeps us consistent with our average rig count, we've talked about, for the year. And it also is consistent with spending our cash flow. But as we enter the end of the year, we will build some momentum into 2018 such that we will start the year roughly at the level we plan to operate at for the entire year.","Drew E. Venker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","And, Jack, does that \u2013 overall in program next year you just talked about shifting towards more large scale projects. Is that overall higher working interest than what you had in 2016 and 2017?","Jack F. Harper - Concho Resources, Inc.","Oh, it's going to be pretty similar, really, Drew, same type of levels.","Drew E. Venker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Neal Dingmann of SunTrust. Your line is open.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Good morning, guys. Tim or Jack, could you just talk about the efficiencies. Are you continuing to see the ramp specifically? I guess my question around that is the efficiencies when you look at on the rig side and on the completion side, with the 15 rigs running, how many frac spreads do you think you typically can run? And I'm just kind of wondering how that ratio is changing based on the efficiencies on each side you're seeing?","Jack F. Harper - Concho Resources, Inc.","Sure. Well, these larger projects will lend to different phases and uncompleted wells. But as I've mentioned in the remarks, we're at a high right now that will come down in the last quarter. So it will depend. But we've bounced between roughly five and eight crews this past year. We'll be at eight when we end the year, and that'll be a good way to start the year. And I don't anticipate needing to go higher than that.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. And then just one last follow-up, just on the sort of staying around that boat, Jack, mostly on the completion side. Could you just talk on cost, I guess? I'm particularly wondering in the sort of that deeper Northern Delaware area, if you've seen, I don't know, a material change in cost. And if you could just maybe talk about the initially cost there, as well as maybe your other areas if you've seen I guess a stabilization, the word, you're seeing now or what, if you could just address that.","Jack F. Harper - Concho Resources, Inc.","Sure. We've most certainly seen some cost inflation from the beginning of the year, but I would characterize where we are today as more of a stabilized environment. You've seen that with the rig count. And so, costs are relatively consistent right now. But having so many different types of assets within our portfolio, really, it's hard to talk about just one. And it also depends on the mix of sand and many other factors. But, overall, we're pretty consistent right now.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","And, Jack, you all haven't done this in the past, but there's no reason to start sourcing sand or any of those things to yourself as you haven't done that in the past?","Jack F. Harper - Concho Resources, Inc.","Well, we're going to have a lot of options here with the local sand, and we'll kind of determine the best way to handle that. But the important thing to think about is that is a positive factor on the cost side for us and for the industry.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Understood. Thanks so much, guys. Nice work.","Jack F. Harper - Concho Resources, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from the line of David Deckelbaum of KeyBanc. Your line is open.","David A. Deckelbaum - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Jack, I just wanted to expand on the last point you made. The in-basin sands, have you guys contracted yet? You said that it's an option right now. Have you contracted for volumes like some of the other peers that have announced this week or are you just using that as leverage right now or with negotiating some of your other basin supply?","Jack F. Harper - Concho Resources, Inc.","Yeah. We have not contracted to this point.","David A. Deckelbaum - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thank you. And, Tim, I just wanted to ask I guess \u2013 you talked about the lifecycle of the company entering this third phase of development now. I guess we talked a lot about it, I think, in past calls this year on trading into higher working interest projects, longer lateral projects. I guess, we should think of that as ongoing because it maximizes your NPV. But in terms of I guess being in the third phase now, does that sort of lower the bias of Concho to pursue acquisitions at this point? Is it more prohibitive to delivering the shareholder returns that you want to?","Timothy A. Leach - Concho Resources, Inc.","So, like we said in the past, the bar is very high. And \u2013 but I think that the capital intensity of this phase that we're in would describe the benefit of being larger and stronger. So Concho is in a great position with a great asset base. We have great capabilities. So, I think, as we've said in the past, there will be consolidation.","You described the trading of property to try to block up, get bigger interest. And you're right. We'll be doing that every single quarter. I think consolidation is a little bit different than that. And I think as the industry consolidates, Concho ought to be in a position to have the best optionality on building a bigger and better company. But we've got a pretty good one right now.","David A. Deckelbaum - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","I appreciate that. And this is the last one I have. I guess next year as you focus more on the large scale projects \u2013 Concho has done a good job of staying ahead of some of the bottlenecks in the industry, particularly in the midstream side. Do you envision investing more in some more vertical integration at this point?","Timothy A. Leach - Concho Resources, Inc.","Yeah. To me, vertical integration is kind of a bad word almost. And we have invested in infrastructure that we thought was really integral and critical to an activity or an area that we were developing. So, I think, we'll continue to do that but I'm not looking to get into other lines of businesses.","David A. Deckelbaum - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thanks, Tim and Jack.","Timothy A. Leach - Concho Resources, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Derrick Whitfield of Stifel. Your line is open.","Derrick Whitfield - Stifel Financial Corp.","Good morning, all.","Timothy A. Leach - Concho Resources, Inc.","Good morning.","Derrick Whitfield - Stifel Financial Corp.","Tim or Jack, in thinking about 2018 further, could you directionally comment on what percent of your activity will be focused on large-scale development projects? Or said differently, if you look at page 6, where you've outlined five projects, how might that slide look in 2018?","Jack F. Harper - Concho Resources, Inc.","Yeah. Just thinking about next year, it's probably going to be two-thirds plus or minus allocated to those type of large scale projects, Derrick.","Derrick Whitfield - Stifel Financial Corp.","Got it. And then, staying on large-scale projects, with regard to the Windward and Vast pilots, could you give us a sense of the cycle times for these pilots and the degree of cost savings you attain from multi-level development versus one-off development?","Jack F. Harper - Concho Resources, Inc.","Well, the savings are mostly along the lines of less drilling days, more efficient completions. And we really haven't quantified that on those two projects at this point. But we do feel confident as we think ahead to that style of development that there are real savings in there that will show through.","Derrick Whitfield - Stifel Financial Corp.","Got it. Make sense. And then last one for me. With regard to the Wolfcamp B well and the Southern Delaware, does that result give you pause on your order of development?","Jack F. Harper - Concho Resources, Inc.","Oh, I think, right now, it gives us confidence in the way we're thinking about that area. And so it just expands our horizons a bit, I would say. So no, it's a positive outcome.","Derrick Whitfield - Stifel Financial Corp.","Got it. Thanks for taking my questions.","Jack F. Harper - Concho Resources, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of James Sullivan of Alembic Global Advisors. Your line is open.","James Sullivan - Alembic Global Advisors LLC","Hey. Good morning, all. So on the new notes, the 2027 and the 2047, in the indenture obviously there's no covenant or anymore restricting dividend payments on those. I just wanted to confirm the 2025 is still outstanding. Do you still have that restriction or that didn't get changed in all the actions back in September?","Jack F. Harper - Concho Resources, Inc.","I'm sorry what were you \u2013 what was that very last part on the 2025?","James Sullivan - Alembic Global Advisors LLC","Oh, the 2025s \u2013 do they still contain that restriction on dividend payments in the indenture?","Jack F. Harper - Concho Resources, Inc.","Yeah. Those will be callable in a couple of years, and they will be consistent with our current notes.","James Sullivan - Alembic Global Advisors LLC","Right. Okay. Yeah. No, I just wanted to see what \u2013 across the liability covenant crossing to our company what are the remaining restrictions on you contemplating a dividend. I think that's just the driver behind that. So that one getting called in will be that. And then, on the facility, I haven't had a chance to go back and look in, but you guys are not restricted there anymore. Is that right?","Jack F. Harper - Concho Resources, Inc.","That's correct.","James Sullivan - Alembic Global Advisors LLC","Got it. Great. Thanks. And then, you guys did talk about obviously inflection point in capital efficiency from the larger number of wells on pad. If you were to think about isolating the effect of going from, whatever it is, the two or three well pad up to a 10 or 12 well pad, can you think about the range or potential effect on unit F&D from doing that obviously normalizing cycle and productivity and all that?","Jack F. Harper - Concho Resources, Inc.","Yeah. Again, it's hard to quantify, but we would certainly expect some savings and I would hope over time approaching double-digits for that kind of the larger scale projects.","James Sullivan - Alembic Global Advisors LLC","Great. Thanks. And then, just one last one real quick. As you go to the bigger well pad, do you guys have a plan for risk mitigation? Obviously, one always tries to avoid train wreck wells, but they do happen on the drilling and completion side. If well 6 of a 12 well pad is having problems, what do you do? Do you jump over to the next one and just do all the remaining 11? How does that work or what's your plan for that?","Timothy A. Leach - Concho Resources, Inc.","That's one of the reasons size and scale is so important that we've got many of these projects going on at the same time. I think you have to be an appropriately sized company to do such types of things. Also, I'd say that on these big projects, the wells are very repeatable. So you wouldn't expect to have a design surprise as you're drilling the hole. I know it's a little bit controversial of whether it's factory-like operation, but that's why these things, they're some of our best projects in the best areas and you take what you learn and then repeat it. So that's kind of the idea.","James Sullivan - Alembic Global Advisors LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you. That's it for me.","Timothy A. Leach - Concho Resources, Inc.","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Richard Tullis of Capital One Securities. Your line is open.","Richard Merlin Tullis - Capital One Securities, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning. Nice quarter. Tim, going back to the industry consolidation topic, when can we begin to see some acceleration in larger scale consolidation among the operators in the Permian? And what could be the likely drivers of that consolidation? Does it slow potentially in a mid-$50 oil environment?","Timothy A. Leach - Concho Resources, Inc.","Certainly, commodity price volatility has an effect on the consolidation of the A and B market. But I think it's more driven by this whole conversation around business plan. I think everybody from the very largest company to the very smallest company is reevaluating their business plan and how do they take all the new things that have happened and create value.","And I think the answer to those questions is what's going to drive consolidation. And I think you're seeing a little bit of it now, but I expect it \u2013 especially with the increasing diligence around capital efficiency, I think, you'll see that increase. But the market's been saying that for a long time and it's been very slow. So I think we're talking in very long cycles here.","Richard Merlin Tullis - Capital One Securities, Inc.","Thank you. That's helpful. And just last question, looking at the Oryx Midstream, what are the near-term, longer-term plans there? Do you see a monetization likely?","Jack F. Harper - Concho Resources, Inc.","Well, we don't have the same amount of ownership in that system that we did in the ACC system, but it has all the same characteristics. It's a acreage dedication. The deal was in place. And, most importantly, it was an asset that was strategic to our business. So we're happy with it as is or if this monetize someday that's fine too. It's a good system and provides all the optionality and efficiency we're looking for.","Richard Merlin Tullis - Capital One Securities, Inc.","Thanks, Jack. That's all from me. Appreciate it.","Jack F. Harper - Concho Resources, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Rob Morris of Citi. Your line is open.","Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thank you. Nice quarter, Tim. Looking at the Midland Basin, you had some nice well results there and I know they were a little bit better than last quarter because you had eight or nine delineation wells in the mix last quarter that were maybe not as good as you'd hoped for. Where are you in the delineation program? Is there more delineation to occur here in the fourth quarter or as you go into 2018 or are you sort of wrapped up on the delineation work that you were doing in the second quarter?","Timothy A. Leach - Concho Resources, Inc.","I don't think we're ever wrapped up with delineation work. We try really hard not to have a bunch of bad wells show up in one quarter. So, I'm not anticipating any negative results. But we will continue to spend a significant part of our cash flow on understanding different zones within these programs, even while we're doing these large pad developments. But the more wells we drill the better we get and the better the wells get. So, I think, that's the bottom line answer.","Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","And then second question is referring back to the rig count at 15 and I know that came down for the higher working interest you've got in a lot of your activity currently. And if you go into year-end, you said you're going to have a similar working interest in your programs next year as this year. You're going to have it around 19 rigs this year. So, should we expect that rig count to move back up here into year-end to where then it'll hold flat in 2018 with a max of eight completion crews next year?","Timothy A. Leach - Concho Resources, Inc.","As Jack said previously and while we haven't announced our specific plans for next year, I think, directionally that's all correct.","Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. That's good. Thank you.","Timothy A. Leach - Concho Resources, Inc.","All right. Thanks.","Jack F. Harper - Concho Resources, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Scott Hanold of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks. A couple questions. Maybe I'll first hit the rig. It sounds like you might opportunistically add some into the end of the year. Can you generally say in specifically to getting more crews in on the rig and frac side, have you seen any degradation in the labor force and how easy it is to secure something for, let's say, a year?","Timothy A. Leach - Concho Resources, Inc.","We typically don't secure things for a year. We have shorter-term contracts to give us more flexibility. I think as a result of size and scale, we think we have access to the best crews. And we haven't had any problem adding either drilling rigs or frac spreads when we need to add them and we have multiple suppliers. So, I think we're in a good position.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. It sounds great. And a follow-up question to \u2013 how do you look at hedging 2018, 2019, even maybe a bit forward as you look at the optimal way to run an E&P company? What is your view on hedging and how do you see kind of the forward market as it is right now?","Timothy A. Leach - Concho Resources, Inc.","Yeah. Well, as the business model evolves, I'm very slow to change our hedging strategy because it's worked so well for us over the last decade or so. And, so I think we've published all the hedges we have out there, but our strategy has not really changed. We're kind of forward selling our PDP curve for a couple of years and we just keep that rolling every quarter. I don't anticipate any changes in that strategy.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. So even though crude's kind of ticked up here a little bit, you're going to still remain fairly systematic. Is that the message?","Timothy A. Leach - Concho Resources, Inc.","Yes.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay.","Timothy A. Leach - Concho Resources, Inc.","In this regard, I'd like to be fairly systematic.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","All right. That sounds great. Thanks.","Timothy A. Leach - Concho Resources, Inc.","All right. Thank you.","Jack F. Harper - Concho Resources, Inc.","Thanks, Scott.","Timothy A. Leach - Concho Resources, Inc.","All right. We'll -","Operator","Thank you. And at this time...","Timothy A. Leach - Concho Resources, Inc.","No. I just wanted to say thank you for being on this call.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we'll conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this conference may be recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Ms. Megan Hays. Ma'am, you may begin.","Megan P. Hays - Director-Investor Relations","Thank you. Good morning and welcome to our First Quarter 2016 Earnings Call. On the call with me today is, in Midland, is Tim Leach, Chairman, President and CEO; and members of the Concho senior management team.","Our first quarter earnings release and corporate presentation are both available on our website.","Please note that we will make forward-looking statements this morning. Also, some of our comments may reference non-GAAP financial measures. I kindly refer you to the forward-looking statement and other disclaimers, as well as reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures contained in both the earnings release and corporate presentation.","Thanks again. Now, I'll turn the call over to Tim.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning. Thanks for joining us on this busy morning. Before we get into first quarter results, I want to talk about the current business environment for our industry. We're operating in one of the toughest commodity price cycles we've experienced in the past 30 years. We've responded with deep cuts to capital budgets.","The U.S. rig count is in an all-time low since we began keeping records. Meanwhile, the industry's leverage is at historic highs. Lower 48 oil production is set to decline by nearly 1 million barrels per day in 2016 according to EIA's current estimate.","Think about what's happened in our industry over the past two years. Underinvestment and overstretched balance sheets mixed with a growing global population, a decline in U.S. oil production and a service sector that's been cut to the bone. The long-term implications to the balance of supply and demand mean more volatility, not less. Amid the volatility, we're focused on aggressively managing the things we can control.","Concho delivered another strong quarter, and the contrast between the current environment and our results for the first quarter demonstrate our flexibility to respond to low oil prices, protect our balance sheet and sustain operating momentum. Results this quarter also reflect our high-quality drilling inventory in the Permian Basin, which sits at the low end of the cost curve and continues to be one of the best basins for driving capital-efficient growth and creating value for our shareholders.","Our robust hedge position provides stability around our cash flows and combined with our strong portfolio, we're well-positioned to keep moving forward, investing in our assets and driving gains in productivity and efficiency. And while commodity prices have moved higher recently, we remain committed to a disciplined returns-based capital program while spending within cash flow.","Now, let me summarize some of the key achievements in the first quarter. Quarterly production increased 6% year-over-year and exceeded our guidance range. Our operating performance this quarter highlights the strength of our portfolio. Each core area is performing well. For full year 2016, we now expect production will be flat compared to 2015 and our capital plan's unchanged.","We continue to make progress on our cost structure. Combined, unit costs, LOE and G&A, were down 9% year-over-year. And importantly, we reduced our full year outlook for LOE. Cost control is a priority and is headed in the right direction. In addition, the Alpha Crude Connector system in New Mexico is improving our oil price realizations in the northern Delaware Basin. As a result, the guidance range for the pre-hedged oil differentials has improved.","For the third consecutive quarter, we underspent operating cash flow, which excludes A&D. Spending within our means fortifies the balance sheet, and it's with this discipline that we find ourselves on a path to emerge stronger than when the cycle started.","Also, during the first quarter, we closed two transactions. The previously announced transactions include an acquisition of 12,000 net acres adjacent to our core North Harpoon prospect in the southern Delaware for a combination of equity, cash and drilling carry, and the sale of 14,000 net acres in Loving County for cash proceeds. The net impact of these transactions added cash to the balance sheet, high graded our inventory, and improved our returns-based capital allocation program by freeing up capital to develop higher-return properties.","Our strong balance sheet's a key advantage during periods of volatility. At quarter-end, we had $0.5 billion of cash on our balance sheet and a net debt-to-EBITDAX ratio of 1.7 times. We have substantial liquidity of $3 billion and our credit facility is undrawn. The total commitment level is $2.5 billion, which was recently reaffirmed by our lender group.","Turning now to our capital plan for 2016, our plan to spend within cash flow remains unchanged and the capital guidance is still a range of $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion. And I don't have to say that our production is going to be down anymore because now we expect 2016 production to be just as robust as 2015.","Our average expected rig count for the year is approximately 14. As we've mentioned before, during 2016, we plan to direct more capital to the Midland Basin where consistently strong well results and good returns across several zones support our development plans. Drilling more wells enhances our operational scale, expands our opportunity to test new ideas, and accelerates development efficiencies.","Our commitment to capital discipline is evident. The first quarter of 2016 represents the third consecutive quarter where cash flow exceeded our drilling expenditures. Since our rig count peaked in late 2014, development capital has been reduced 70%. Meanwhile, production's grown 12% over that same time period and cash operating expenses are lower.","Lower commodity prices create opportunities for Concho. We're actively managing our portfolio by consolidating core acreage and selling lower rate-of-return assets. The acquisition of 12,000 net acres in the southern Delaware Basin brings us new drilling locations that move to the front of the inventory line. We closed this transaction in late March and shifted two rigs onto these properties in April.","Acquisitions for assets like these are very competitive. The seller picked Concho as a partner based on our execution strength. And we like these assets because they increase our exposure to the best part of the southern Delaware Basin and add long lateral drilling locations.","We continue to see good consolidation opportunities around our core areas. While we possess the financial and operational firepower to move quickly, we will remain disciplined with our acquisition strategy. The acquisitions we evaluate must compete with the best projects in our portfolio and strengthen our financial position. And we're willing to sell assets to high grade our portfolio and to fund transactions.","And importantly, our leverage ratio remains unchanged since late 2014 with $0.5 billion of cash on the balance sheet. This is a direct result of our fundamental strategy to focus on our asset quality, program returns, balance sheet and our team.","The most impactful way that we can affect the value of Concho is by becoming even more efficient, and we're focused on improving the productivity of each capital dollar invested.","2016 is an inflection point for capital efficiency. During the year, our average lateral length will increase by approximately 35% year-over-year and more than 50% of our operated drill wells will be on multi-well pad sites. We continue to optimize well results and returns by fine-tuning completion design through each core area and zone we're drilling.","This inflection in capital efficiency also creates an inflection in production, which is demonstrated by our ability to hold production flat from an all-time high in 2015 and it allows us to confidently project double-digit production growth in 2017 within cash flow. This outlook remains unchanged.","The strength of our machine is demonstrated by our longer-term view that at current strip pricing, we're capable of delivering differentiated annual production growth while continuing to spend within our cash flow, run a steady rig program and maintain a leverage ratio at or below 2 times.","We're working hard to deliver on our near-term objectives and position the company for the future. Our technical expertise and team facilitate the spread of innovation across our assets. We're uniquely positioned with four core areas to compete for capital within the Permian, which is the most robust and cost-efficient basin in North America. We're focused on making smart capital allocation decisions and keeping a strong financial position.","The outlook for oil prices remains uncertain, but we've never been in a better position to deliver strong profitable growth. This is our opportunity to extend our lead.","Thanks for listening, and let me turn it back now to the moderator and take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from Brian Singer of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. Good morning.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Brian.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Wanted to ask on capital allocation between the Delaware and the Midland Basin. Based on some of the wells that you reported, that the well performance in the northern Delaware Basin looked very, very strong, particularly over the last couple of quarters and particularly this quarter in terms of oil rates adjusted for lateral lengths.","And I wanted to see if you could comment a bit more on the decision to add rigs in the Midland Basin versus the northern Delaware Basin. You're drilling much longer laterals in the Midland Basin, but wanted to just get a sense as to their differentiation in costs or expectations for future well performance that can justify adding activity there relative to ramping in the northern Delaware.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Right. Well, Brian, the amount of capital as a percentage basis that we're dedicating to the northern Delaware hasn't changed, still 45% of our total capital budget. The returns there are very strong and as we've indicated in the past, the Midland Basin we see is improving. There've been several efficiency breakthroughs from longer laterals and completion techniques and things like that.","We think the Midland Basin properties are getting stronger because of those efficiencies and will compete with the northern Delaware Basin, and we will \u2013 we haven't really changed our capital allocation. We're just on a trajectory to ramp up capital on the Midland Basin.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Got it. Thanks. Okay. And then just thinking about overall capital levels in addition to the activity levels, obviously adding rigs here now, but how should we expect your plans to shift it all depending on the oil environment and then that the start of more quarterly increases in activity if current \u2013 or current oil prices \u2013 level on higher oil prices play out?","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Like we have done in the past, I think the best way to think about us is steady as she goes. And I don't that we're going to change our capital budget or our rig count based on kind of quarterly swings in oil price. So, we will \u2013 we're very hedged. That gives us some certainty around the amount of cash flow we're going to have from oil prices. So, we'll continue the plan that we started at the first of the year.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thank you.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Brian.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Scialla of Stifel. Your line is open.","Michael Scialla - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yeah. Good morning, Tim. Tim, you had mentioned \u2013 I think you said 50% of your drilling this year was on pads. Just as you look into next year, trying to get a sense of where you think that will be, do you go more towards more development or is there more delineation still to be done?","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think as we continue to roll forward in a normal environment, it's going to become more and more development-like. So, I would expect that number to do nothing but go up.","Michael Scialla - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. And looking at the new well data that you put out, looks like the oil cut increased in all four of those areas. Is that just kind of coincidental or was there any change in any of the drilling that would count for that?","Jack F. Harper - Executive Vice President","Yeah. Hey, Mike. It's Jack. There really was no change that would have caused that. It's just kind of well location.","Michael Scialla - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. And then just last one from me. It looks like you had some pretty positive results on the stack laterals in the Wolfcamp A and B in the Midland. Any implications for your drilling inventory there or was that already kind of baked in?","Jack F. Harper - Executive Vice President","Yeah. It's consistent with our inventory, Mike, and we're just furthering our knowledge there.","Michael Scialla - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from David Tameron of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning, Tim. Can you talk about \u2013 just going back to the pad drilling, what this do for you in terms of cost? And then are you thinking two- to three-well pads or is it more than when you say multi-well? And then, finally on the pads, like what should we expect as far as \u2013 any interference as far as impact on EURs going forward? Can you just address all those?","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. That's a lot of questions.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","I know.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Generally, there are dramatic cost savings from pad drilling, both just reduction in absolute cost but also efficiency gains. Typically, our pads today are more like three or four-well in size and the spacing that we've talked about from our wells is \u2013 the maximum spacing we have on any of our inventory is eight across. Although we're continuing to test down-spacing ideas in all of our areas and the down-spacing testing is a pretty high percentage of the total of what we're doing. But, no, we wouldn't expect any, from pad drilling, any change of interference or drainage or EURs or anything like that from what we've talked about in the past.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And then as we think about \u2013 now that you've had some of these wells that have a pretty good production history, we start thinking about the GORs over time. Kind of what \u2013 can you talk about what you're seeing as far as changing the composition of the well come year three, four in these plays?","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I mean we're a bit unique in that we have those multiple core areas in multiple basins. So, we probably have more zones to talk about than other companies do. So, it's a little bit \u2013 each zone's a little bit different. But in general, all these zones have increasing GORs over time and that's kind of baked in to the \u2013 our estimates of ultimate recoveries and things like that, but you would expect the GORs to go up over time.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks for the color.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","All right. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Hanold of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks a lot. Hey, Tim, if I could just ask a question off one of your responses. And you obviously made the indication that activity is not going to be dictated obviously by quarterly moves in oil prices. But when you step back and look at it, you did increase activity a little bit this year, but kept the budget unchanged. So, how did you evaluate that? Was it more so that you're able to stay within your budget and so you made the decision to put in some additional rigs? Or was it obviously the improvement in oil prices that also factored into that as well?","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","No, the \u2013 what looks like a change of activity level has a couple of factors. One is the acquisition and divestiture program we have that I hope will continue throughout the year. So that adding rigs and subtracting rigs based on buying or selling properties is one factor. And then the other one is just from quarter to quarter kind of the net change in ownership that we have within the properties that kind of what dictate more or less rigs based on how much capital we're spending.","So, I wouldn't read too much into that in terms of ramping up activity because of a higher oil price. That's not what really is going on; it's more just the blocking and tackling of our base business.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay, understand. Thanks for that clarification. And you all reiterated your view that 2017 double-digit growth within cash flow at the strip, which is highly consistent with your comments last quarter. Now, the strip increased, and can you maybe discuss that a little bit, how that can be achieved?","And one of the things that's pretty evident, if you look at consensus estimates out there right now, certainly it doesn't reflect that. Where do you think the disconnect is, where the Street's modeling you all versus what you think you can accomplish?","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I think there are some things that are harder to model. I mentioned in the call the increased lateral length from one year to the next also, and we talked about the shallowing of our base decline rate as an important one as well. Pad drilling is an efficiency that's hard to model outside the company.","And the tweaking of completion designs and the optimization of these wells continue to provide growing efficiencies that when we stew all these things together, when we talk about 2017, it's kind of based on the efficiency and the costs we know of today, and we can get to that double-digit growth based on what we know today. But also, I'm pretty optimistic that with these increasing efficiencies that Concho is going to be able to really differentiate itself within cash flow.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","All right. Appreciate the color. Thanks a lot, guys.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from John Freeman of Raymond James. Your line is open.","John A. Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Thanks. When I look at the new rig count outlook for \u2013 the average of 14 versus 11 previously and the fact that you can still keep the CapEx budget unchanged, I guess I'm just curious. When you look at \u2013 when you last sort of updated all of us two-and-a-half months ago, like what's changed the most that's allowed you to add three more rigs and yet the budget the same as what you would've thought two-and-a-half months ago?","Jack F. Harper - Executive Vice President","Hey, John. It's Jack. Just to reiterate what Tim said earlier, you have a lot of things going on. You have new assets coming in, old assets going out. You have changes in interest assumptions in different asset areas, but to that effect is the same capital and roughly the same net wells.","John A. Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. So, the net wells didn't really change.","Jack F. Harper - Executive Vice President","Yes.","John A. Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","And then my follow-up question, you all have given awhile back \u2013 it shown how through the enhanced completions have been driving like the Avalon wells were sort of 60% better over the first 180 days. I'm just curious if we've not had a good bit of time since that update if \u2013 is that sort of held in there? Has it gotten \u2013 has that gap improved more now that the wells have been online longer?","Jack F. Harper - Executive Vice President","Yeah. We're comfortable with what we've come out with before on that, John. So, the short answer is yes. We were still very optimistic about the Avalon in that area.","John A. Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Thanks, guys. Nice quarter.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, John.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeffrey Campbell of Tuohy Brothers. Your line is open.","Jeffrey Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Good morning.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Jeffrey Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","First question I want to ask, you just \u2013 in answering John's question, you said that the net \u2013 when everything shakes out, the net number of wells for 2016 essentially remains the same. I think Tim touched on this earlier, but last quarter, you said that production would be flat to down 5%, and now the guidance appears to be flat. So, essentially, we have the same number of net wells. Are we getting this improved production outlook because we're getting better performance from the wells?","Jack F. Harper - Executive Vice President","That's correct. It's well productivity is the main driver.","Jeffrey Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thank you. My other question, slide nine indicated the first quarter 2016 minimum (23:20) wells were drilled in Upton County. I was just wondering is this going to be the focus area for some of these additional rigs that are coming on or will they drill elsewhere. And if they are going to drill elsewhere, could you give some color as to where the new rigs will go to work?","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","It's about half and half in Upton and Midland County. So...","Jeffrey Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Richard Tullis of Capital One Securities. Your line is open.","Richard Merlin Tullis - Capital One Securities, Inc.","Good morning, everyone. Tim, the 1Q acreage acquisitions and swaps were clearly positive and innovative. Do you see the potential to do more in similar-sized deals given the current commodity environment?","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I really \u2013 I mean, the impact of that property trade for our company was a pretty large impact and that's the kind of thing, the kind of asset high-grading that I think we ought to continue to do. Landing them both at the same time and closing two deals on the same day \u2013 or announcing two deals on the same day is a little bit of a trick. But in general, as we progressed through the year, continuing to consolidate tier 1 core acreage and sell off stuff that is further out in the drilling queue is kind of an activity that I'm hopeful we continue to see.","Richard Merlin Tullis - Capital One Securities, Inc.","Okay. And just lastly regarding the two rigs added in the southern Delaware Basin and the North Harpoon area, is the plan to keep those rigs drilling in that area the entire year and will those all be long laterals and would it approach or go beyond 7,000 feet?","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes. To the first two and the lateral length, I think those were all 2-mile laterals down there.","Richard Merlin Tullis - Capital One Securities, Inc.","Okay.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","1.5 miles to 2 miles.","Richard Merlin Tullis - Capital One Securities, Inc.","Okay. That's all from me. Thank you.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","All right. Thank you.","Jack F. Harper - Executive Vice President","Thanks, Richard.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Neal Dingmann of SunTrust Robinson. Your line is open.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Yes. Say, Tim's notable \u2013 again, when I look at it sort of in the press release, the 30-day results when you break down for the north and the south, obviously north remains strong, but now even the southern continued. Could you maybe give your thoughts on do you see both of those sort of continuing to trend in line? Or I guess as we go forward, I'm just \u2013 I get pleasantly surprised how much now that the south is now right in line now with the north when you see kind of those 30-day peak averages.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I mean, right now, the north is a lot bigger than the south. We've had good results from second Bone Spring, Avalon and Wolfcamp in the north and primarily what we're drilling in the south is Wolfcamp. So, I think that will be expanding, but we're very pleased with the performance of the North Harpoon area and the southern Delaware Basin. It competes with anything we're doing in the northern Delaware and as we've stated, we think that the efficiencies will continue to drive cost lower and production higher. So we like both of those areas.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Tim, and just one last one, what kind of upside are you seeing or how does it compare, I guess, to other formations? You commented on the press release about the test in the multi-zone, potential on the Avalon there in the north. I'm just wondering how you get out of \u2013 I'm trying to get a sense kind of how that fits in versus the others.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Oh, the Avalon oil is just as \u2013 I mean the rates return, the productivity, the prospectivity is just as good as anything we have. We're really high on it.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Wow. Okay. Thanks so much.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Arun Jayaram of JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah. Good morning, gents. I just wanted to see if you could maybe elaborate. It sounds like the driver of the big production and guidance increase were some of the well productivity gains and maybe just detailed areas where you're just seeing wells outperform.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I mean, one of the big drivers was that trade where we're doing more drilling now, more of our capital in the southern Delaware Basin around North Harpoon. That's a big driver.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Driver. I think, Tim, you added about 350 locations in that trade. Have you already \u2013 it sounds like you've already started to attack some of those locations year-to-date. Is that fair?","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. In our prepared remarks, we said we added two rigs immediately on those acquired acres.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Great. And just in terms of reallocating at least some rig activity to the Midland Basin, and obviously you're shifting to longer laterals here, what are your thoughts? I mean, obviously, you've been more of a Delaware Basin player throughout the company's history. What are your initial views on the longer laterals and potentially get even more active in the Midland Basin if oil prices surprise to the upside?","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","You know what? I'd like to dispel that notion that we've been primarily a Delaware Basin player. I mean, we bought Henry Petroleum back in 2008 and they were one of the first movers in recognizing the oil potential in the Wolfcamp on the western side of the Midland Basin. So, we inherited a lot of that knowledge expertise. I think we were an early mover over there.","It's just been \u2013 with all our Delaware activity and everything we're doing in New Mexico, all that really good Midland Basin stuff just kind of got lost in the bigger picture. But I think we've got some of the best Midland Basin acreage that there is. Our well results compare with anything that anybody else is turning out in the Midland Basin and we now have completed the infrastructure kind of investment that we needed in place so that you could run a multi-rig pad drilling development kind of program. So, we're ready to devote more capital there.","When we come out of this cycle and things start growing rapidly again, I think it'd be good for Concho to have multiple growth drivers. The last time we came through this growth cycle, the growth of the company was really driven by the northern Delaware Basin. I think next time, we'll have multiple growth drivers. I think that'll be a better, more diversified company.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Several legs to the stool. And just quickly in the Midland Basin, how much acreage, Tim, do you think you have in the core?","Jack F. Harper - Executive Vice President","Oh, Arun, we've got 110,000 net acres and we like the great majority of it.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks a lot, Jack.","Jack F. Harper - Executive Vice President","You bet.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Hall of Heineken [sic] (Heikkinen) Energy. Your line is open.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Good morning. Heikkinen Energy. I was just curious, kind of going back to the capital efficiency trends, your rig count \u2013 I'm just curious if I'm interpreting this right or not, but your rig count in the first quarter and second quarter aren't quite up at that 14 average level for the year. Similarly, lateral lengths aren't quite at 7,000 feet on average across the program in the first quarter. Should we think about the back half as having higher levels relative to the averages for rig counts and lateral lengths? And if so, does that then just continue forward into 2017?","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes is the answer to all those questions. And the lateral length, the longer lateral length is primarily coming from the Midland Basin and the southern Delaware Basin, and that's where we just really put the rigs on.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Okay. That's helpful. And then just thinking about productivity across all the areas, it looked quite strong relative to lateral length. Is there any reason to think that those levels aren't sustainable or repeatable over the long term, the next several years given your current inventory?","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","No, I hope they get better. One thing you're kind of dealing with with longer laterals, though, is just the mechanical ability to move that much fluid out of a 2-mile lateral. So, I think as the industry goes to longer and longer wells, the initial 24-hour 30-day rates aren't going to move as much as the 60- and 90-day rates because these wells \u2013 in the first initial days, you just can't make that much more fluid out of that sized hole, but I think they'll hold up better and you'll get better economics.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Great. Appreciate the color. It's helpful.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Smith of Bank of America. Your line is open.","Jason Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey. Good morning, everyone. So, you guys completed more wells than you drilled this quarter so just curious, where is the DUC backlog today? And I guess you guys have typically highlighted a 2 times rig count as a target. Does that still hold as you shift more towards pad drilling?","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Our DUC inventory is down to about \u2013 what is it?","Jack F. Harper - Executive Vice President","30.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","30. And in general, because of the \u2013 conditions have changed a little bit, there's not as much tightness in the supply for frac spreads. So, I don't \u2013 the balance of inventory of wells waiting on being completed and wells drilling, I don't think you need quite as many wells waiting on completion as you had in the past. There's more flexibility in the system because of excess capacity of frac spreads.","Jason Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks, Tim. And one quick follow-up on the Midland and capital allocation, it looks like CapEx is not increasing as a percent of the total for the year within the Midland despite adding a raise (33:58). Can you just maybe help us reconcile why that is?","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","It's just a basis of partners joining or not joining in the wells and our net interest in those wells at this point in time.","Jason Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, that's all from me. Thanks.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Grigel of Macquarie. Your line is open.","Paul Grigel - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Hi. Good morning. Following up on 2017, is there any additional color you could provide on the rate of change in your corporate decline rate in the double-digit growth assumptions?","Jack F. Harper - Executive Vice President","Yeah. So, as we've said in the past, we've come down significantly from 2015 to 2016. And going from 2016 to 2017, there may be some modest shallowing in that decline curve, but not anything comparable to the change between 2015 and 2016.","Paul Grigel - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay. So, it's that base production that you're building up that allows for the kind of launching point, for a lack of better term, in 2017.","Jack F. Harper - Executive Vice President","That's right. A more steady base is the way to think about it.","Paul Grigel - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay. And then on the longer-term comments about growth combining with the likelihood for continued volatility in crude, how do you balance those goals? And is there any additional specific detail you can provide on what's your view of differentiated production growth could imply?","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I'm sorry. Could you try that again?","Paul Grigel - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Just trying to balance out comments that crude will continue to see volatility going forward, yet you continue to focus on differentiated growth. Looking at what could differentiated growth imply as well as how do you respond to increased volatility in crude when you are trying to grow.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Well, I think that our long-term strategy that we've had works well in cycles like this, that the way we think about our balance sheet and our leverage and our activity. And I think what's going to differentiate Concho going forward is our ability to grow within cash flow. And so, when you compare us to other companies, I think our growth will be differentiated or better and we'll be drilling within cash flow while others will probably be outspending the cash flow.","Paul Grigel - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Thank you.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from James Sullivan of Alembic Global. Your line is open.","James Sullivan - Alembic Global Advisors LLC","Hey. Good morning, guys.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","James Sullivan - Alembic Global Advisors LLC","Just two quick questions. Just to go back to a prior comment you guys have made regarding the longer laterals and the rates, the 30-day, 60-day and 90-day rates. Have you guys yet experimented with choking back the longer laterals? You probably haven't needed to do this yet, but just think about that in managing infrastructure needs for the kind of the very high initial rates.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. In general, we're experimenting with everything. But specifically to your question, one thing we've done to reduce expenses, early in the process of drilling these wells several years ago, we would put electric sub pumps on the wells so we could move the fluid faster. That was very expensive. And so, as we've tried to optimize things especially at lower oil prices, we'll put mechanical pumping units on them earlier and move less fluid that it kind of flattens the declining curve. So it's not really choking them back, but it's controlling cost and not using as many sub pumps.","James Sullivan - Alembic Global Advisors LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks for the color on that. Just last quick kind of modeling integrated question. I did notice you guys made another contribution to the JV this quarter. Can you just remind me \u2013 I know it's been a little business to talk about this, but what the pace of ACC contributions are likely to be going forward? I think you guys have said that you guys will be funding incremental additions, but I just want to see what those were likely to be as we \u2013 going forward for modeling purposes.","Jack F. Harper - Executive Vice President","Sure. The pace will slow down markedly and we're going to stay consistent with the budget that we laid out in the beginning of the year.","James Sullivan - Alembic Global Advisors LLC","Okay. Great. So is there a total number that you guys are budgeting just for that particular budget line this year or is that \u2013 I just don't remember if I had that in my notes here.","Jack F. Harper - Executive Vice President","Yeah. It's again consistent with the 10%. It's embedded in that 10% of non-drilling and completion capital in the budget and I don't believe we broke it out beyond that.","James Sullivan - Alembic Global Advisors LLC","Great. All right. Thanks, guys. Appreciate it.","Jack F. Harper - Executive Vice President","You bet.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Pearce Hammond of Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.","Pearce Hammond - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Pearce Hammond - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)","Tim, I was just curious when you look at the Permian as \u2013 as oil price is normalizing, we're now hearing activity comes back into the basin. And how quickly do you think the service companies can respond? It doesn't get a lot of equipment, but what about people, given how many people have left the industry? Or is the Permian in good shape because there's been a lot of people and equipment that have moved to that area?","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I think the Permian's in better shape than the other basins because the Permian seems to be the place right now that all the equipment wants to come to. And we spoke about the rig count. The rig count's at a historical low right now at about 130 rigs. So there's a long way to go to add back equipment and people, even to get back halfway of where we were two years ago.","So I do think that, in general, it will take the industry some time to respond to increased activity, but we need some increased activity just to get back to normal. So I think we have a lot of spare capacity right now and we're likely to have spare capacity for some time to come.","Pearce Hammond - Piper Jaffray & Co.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we'll conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this call may be recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Ms. Megan Hays. Ma'am, you may begin.","Megan P. Hays - Concho Resources, Inc.","Thank you. Good morning and welcome to Concho's second quarter 2018 earnings call. I'm joined today in Midland by Tim Leach, Chairman and CEO; Jack Harper, President and CFO; and Will Giraud, Executive Vice President; as well as members of the Concho senior management team.","Our earnings release and corporate presentation are both available on our website and we plan to file our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q today after market close.","Please note that we will make forward-looking statements based on current expectations this morning. Also, some of our comments may reference non-GAAP financial metrics. Forward-looking statement and other disclaimers as well as reconciliations to the nearest corresponding GAAP metrics are in our earnings release and our corporate presentation.","We have a lot of great news to discuss with you today. Tim will start the call and then you will hear from Jack. Following their prepared remarks, we will take your questions.","Now, let me turn the call over to Tim.","Timothy A. Leach - Concho Resources, Inc.","Thanks, Megan. Good morning. With nearly half the drilling rigs and completion crews in the country running in the Permian Basin, the region is as busy as we've ever seen. We estimate that more than $50 billion in capital will be invested to drill and complete wells in the Permian in 2018. Industry's capital investment is headed even higher when you add up midstream, refining and other services. It's an environment like this where our scale, experience and being right in the middle of the action helps us deliver.","Second quarter was another strong quarter. We achieved record production of 229,000 Boes per day with oil production up 26% compared to a year ago. Our performance this quarter wasn't driven by any one asset, rather it was the outcome of strong results from large-scale development across the entire portfolio. And even with the busy environment, the team's done good work fighting inflationary trends by getting more efficient increasing our use of Permian sand.","We talked about reaching inflection points in the past. The shift to horizontal development in 2011 is one example. Establishing a position in the Northern Delaware is another. And it was about a year ago that we described another inflection point, our progression to large scale development.","Horizontal drilling and the Northern Delaware turned out to be huge value drivers for the company. And we believe manufacturing mode will do the same thing. This transition has been one of our most important operational and strategic priorities. And we're early in realizing the positive impacts to capital efficiency, returns, and recoveries that we believe large scale development will deliver.","The RSP acquisition solidifies our scale advantage and reinforces our growth platform for bigger wells and increasing returns. With the transaction now complete, our most important phase of work begins, realizing the benefits of this powerful combination by successfully integrating our teams and operations. You've heard me say before that our people are our greatest asset, and with RSP, our team grows even stronger. I welcome the 171 RSP employees to the Concho team.","The RSP assets enhanced some of the best parts of our portfolio with exceptional development potential. We started on unlocking that potential on day one by directing capital to several projects on the RSP assets. Following the closing, we're running 32 horizontal rigs, which is the largest program in the Permian and eight of those rigs are running on former RSP assets. Jack will cover the development plans for the second half of the year in more detail. The key takeaway is we're taking premium resource and making it more valuable with our operational machine.","So far 2018 has been unprecedented in terms of the transformative actions we've taken and the solid results we've delivered. In the first half of the year, we organically added 18,000 Boes per day of production, generated about $150 million in free cash flow, executed several trades to block up core acreage, sold non-core leasehold and announced the RSP acquisition. The acquisition combines two great companies focused on the highest quality resource in the Permian Basin, with the scale and expertise necessary to compete globally.","As we move forward, I'm even more optimistic and energized about the outlook for the company. We have distinct competitive advantages; execution strength, the depth of our quality resource, capital efficiency, financial strength and RSP reinforces each of these and enhances our ability to drive sustainable growth and returns for our shareholders.","Jack will now discuss the quarter in more detail and provide an update on our outlook for the year.","Jack F. Harper - Concho Resources, Inc.","Thank you, Tim and good morning. Our strategy and execution translated to strong operational and financial performance. Production for the quarter totaled 229,000 Boes per day, which was in line with the high end of our guidance. Oil production averaged 143,000 barrels per day, a 26% increase compared to the prior year and flat versus the first quarter of 2018. At this point, we're right where we expected to be.","Over the past 12 months U.S. oil production has grown considerably and the engine behind this growth was the Permian Basin. The EIA estimates that the Permian has added an average 75,000 barrels per day each month so far in 2018, with August production expected to be a record 3.4 million barrels per day. This growth is showing up faster than forecasted. And while new long haul pipe projects are being built, these new projects are slated to come online with little margin for delay.","As we described last quarter, our midstream strategy has evolved significantly over the past decade. We've made strategic investments in infrastructure that are intended to protect our upstream business by ensuring operational continuity. Approximately 90% of our oil is gathered and transported by pipe, most of which is covered by firm sales agreements, with the remaining 10% directed to regional refineries.","Our marketing strategy has always prioritized the highest wellhead price, while maximizing flexibility. As crude takeaway gets tight, we are leveraging our size and scale to secure flow assurance today. Importantly, our firm sales agreements provide near-term flow assurance without limiting long-term pricing flexibility. And just as we mitigate flow assurance risk through firm sales agreements, we also mitigate the financial risk of the Midland-Cushing differential with basis hedges.","On the other side of the margin equation, our controllable cash costs look good. Cash G&A was stable when compared to the first quarter of the year, while both LOE and interest expense decreased. In the second quarter, adjusted net income per share was $1.24 and we generated $592 million of EBITDAX.","When oil prices moved lower in late 2014, we moved quickly to align capital spending with cash flow from operations, and we've done that for 11 out of the past 12 quarters. In fact, over that time period, we've generated more than $600 million in free cash flow.","In the earnings material, we only show operating cash flow and D&C capital for the past two years, which is also impressive. We've increased production 50% and generated approximately $250 million in free cash over that period. I believe that stacks up well against our peers and I can't think of a better illustration of the commitment we have to capital discipline and of the quality of our assets.","Turning now to the balance sheet, maintaining a strong financial position enables us to deliver near-term results, invest for the long term and better manage risks. Following the RSP transaction, we maintain a strong balance sheet, which was acknowledged by the upgrades to BBB-minus by Moody's and BBB-flat by Fitch. We now have investment grade ratings from all three agencies.","We recently completed a $1.6 billion senior notes offering, consisting of both 10-year and 30-year tranches at a blended rate of 4.5%. The proceeds were used to redeem RSP senior notes for $1.2 billion and repay a portion of the outstanding balance under their credit facility. These transactions achieve a key cost savings target by reducing pro forma annual interest expense by more than $15 million.","After giving effect to the liability management actions and associated transaction costs, we would have had long term debt of $4.2 billion at June 30. Importantly, our leverage ratio remains below 1.5 times. We're proud of the RSP acquisition and the entire position we've carefully and strategically built in the Permian over the last decade.","As a result of closing the transaction, we've updated our guidance for production and capital to include RSP beginning on the closing date of July 19. Although RSP reported production volumes on a three-stream basis, we will continue to report on a two-stream basis and have converted RSP's volumes to two-stream, which results in an approximate 10% reduction in their equivalent volumes, but has no impact to cash flow.","For the third quarter, we expect production to average 280,000 Boes to 285,000 Boes per day, with RSP contributing to production beginning on July 19. The fourth quarter will be our first full quarter with RSP and we expect production will average 305,000 Boes to 310,000 Boes per day. For both third and fourth quarters, we're guiding to an oil mix of 65%. For full year 2018, we expect reported production to average about 260,000 Boes per day consisting of 64% oil.","To help calibrate models, on slide 12 in the earnings presentation, we've provided pro forma production on a two-stream basis for full year 2017 through the second quarter of 2018. On a pro forma basis, the new full year 2018 guidance equates to approximately 21% to 23% production growth year-over-year.","Moving RSP's premium assets to development mode is the most efficient way to build value in the combined company. Post transaction operations and integration activities are going well. And in the second half of the year, we plan to jumpstart large-scale projects on RSP's assets.","In the Northern Delaware, we have one planned project, the Taylor. In the Midland Basin, RSP recently achieved solid results in Glasscock County. We plan to continue this success with a six-well project there. We also plan to develop a five-well project on the Spanish Trail lease in Midland County and a 13-well project in Martin County.","We're also completing several infrastructure projects that facilitate large scale development in the Northern Delaware on RSP's assets. All of this activity is reflected in our updated capital outlook of $2.5 billion to $2.6 billion.","There are two points I want to emphasize. First, there is no change to our investment philosophy. We expect operating cash flow to fully fund the capital program which will be allocated based on rate of return. Our production growth is the output of this investment framework.","And second, the RSP transaction enhances the capital efficiency of Concho as we help define the new E&P business model. We continue to believe that leadership in our industry is defined by execution strength and capital discipline. I hope you've come to expect Concho to deliver on these principles.","We are well positioned to leverage the power of our portfolio and the strength our team to extend our track record of profitable growth and returns.","And with that, we'll turn it over to the operator.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from John Freeman with Raymond James. Your line is now open.","John A. Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Good morning, guys.","Timothy A. Leach - Concho Resources, Inc.","Good morning, John.","Jack F. Harper - Concho Resources, Inc.","Morning.","John A. Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","When I look at slide 13, clearly, you guys are hitting the ground running immediately on the RSP acreage with these large-scale projects. I know that stand-alone Concho had about two-thirds of its activity that was focused on these large-scale projects, and it looks like, kind of ballpark, it looks like on second half 2018 over half of the activity in the RSP acreage is devoted to these larger scale projects and I'm just trying to get a sense and just from a high level kind of rough estimate, of the projects that are detailed on slide 13, just kind of a ballpark rough idea of what percentage of those wells or projects don't come on line until either, call it, second half 4Q or into 2019?","C. William Giraud - Concho Resources, Inc.","Yeah. Hey, John. This is Will. All of those will come on kind of later in 2019.","John A. Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Perfect. And then, when I'm looking at the various kind of sizes of the projects, anywhere from kind of 5-well pads to 20-well pads. And you all do mention in the slides that, for example, on the Dominator pad like you all had to basically coordinate over a year in advance with the midstream partners with that project. I'm just kind of curious how much kind of the midstream component has an impact on the size of these kind of pads? And then, kind of longer term, if we should sort of think that these projects are likely going to kind of gravitate toward the larger end of that range over time?","C. William Giraud - Concho Resources, Inc.","Sure. I mean, midstream is certainly one of the elements that goes into sizing it. But I would say the bigger driver is \u2013 well, let me step back for a minute. I think we've been one of the leaders in moving to these larger-scale development projects. And that's been a steady evolution over the last couple of years as we've tested different spacing between \u2013 within a zone and between zones. And so, these bigger and bigger projects I think are just the further evolution of that trend. Where you see some of the smaller projects, that's us continuing to test tighter spacing or different spacing within a zone or between zones again. And so, I think you're right, longer term, you'll see an evolution to the bigger and bigger projects. However, we're still learning as we go and so I think you'll see a blend of different sizes.","John A. Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Thanks. I appreciate it. Nice quarter.","Timothy A. Leach - Concho Resources, Inc.","Thanks, John.","Jack F. Harper - Concho Resources, Inc.","Thanks, John.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bob Morris with Citi. Your line is now open.","Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Good morning. Congratulations, Tim and Jack, in getting the RSP deal completed, in the fold here. Looking at the rig count that you've ramped up to combined for the two companies at 32, you've added about 5 since the deal was announced. And 4 of those 5 are on the Concho properties, which at 24 rigs is a little bit higher pace than what you'd originally planned for the year. Could you just talk a little bit about the acceleration now on legacy Concho assets and why you're seeing more acceleration there at this stage as opposed to RSP deal? So just overall the acceleration activity, if that's driven by oil prices or just the better positioning of the combined companies?","C. William Giraud - Concho Resources, Inc.","Sure. This is Will again, I'd say that what we're doing on the Concho properties is consistent with what our plan had been for the year. We did add those rigs here over the last month or two, but we've also added a rig to the RSP properties. And like I said, at this point, it really just reflects what the two companies were doing on a stand-alone basis and I think you'll see \u2013 you're starting to see it now that we've closed and over the course of this year, you'll continue to see us I think put our stamp on those properties. But I wouldn't really characterize that as anything different than what you should have expected earlier in the year.","Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. All right. And then my second question is, on the Northern Delaware Basin, the Columbus four-well pad, the 30-day IPs were sharply above what we've seen in the Delaware Basin historically. Can you just talk a little bit about where you are in the completion optimization process as far as that contributing to the much better results there, Columbus versus what is just location or acreage there being better than what we've seen in other areas in your portfolio?","C. William Giraud - Concho Resources, Inc.","Yeah. I mean, we're drilling really good Wolfcamp wells. And I think that Columbus project is an example of that. I think we're getting better and better at targeting and also continuing to refine our completions. So, I think it just reflects a good area and also good work by the team drilling really good wells.","Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Great. Thank you. Congratulations again.","Jack F. Harper - Concho Resources, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you. Good morning.","Timothy A. Leach - Concho Resources, Inc.","Good morning, Brian.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Shifting to firm sales agreements and the realized pricing side of the equation, can you add a bit more specifics on those firm sales agreements, particularly how they provide a long-term pricing optionality as you describe, and then whether the agreements provide the flow assurance for the 90% of the crude that your gathering systems are moving, the full 100% when the including PCL sale regionally or some other percentage?","Timothy A. Leach - Concho Resources, Inc.","Yeah. Brian, let me first say that when I think about the issue of crude oil leaving the Permian Basin, it seems like there's two issues. One is can you move your crude oil and secondly what price you get paid for it. And I think as we've described, we have firm sales agreements that cover our crude oil in such a way that we have a high confidence level that our crude will move.","And then on the pricing side that we've used hedges the way we've historically used hedges for the differentials as a shock absorber that covers most of our exposure for this year and next year. So, I feel good about our position. I don't think that transportation is going to affect any of our plans. In fact, you can kind of see by the way we're ramping up that we have confidence that we're going to be able to expand going into next year. But I'll turn it to Jack to talk about any specifics he wants to talk...","Jack F. Harper - Concho Resources, Inc.","Yeah. Brian, I would add to that that the flexibility we're talking about in 2020 is just a reflection of how we attempt to style these agreements, which give that opportunity at a later date. And if history repeats itself, when you get through this period of tightness and Midland pricing becomes at parity again you have a lot more options at that point than you do today.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks. And I guess to tie that in to the production trajectory, and I think this was covered a little bit earlier. But by virtue of increasing the scale with the longer lead time projects on slide 13, you would seem to have a lot more visibility on the cadence of wells being brought to sale not just in the next two quarters but potentially for the first three plus quarters of 2019. Is it fair to say that the second quarter and the third quarter of 2019 are when a lot of these new projects are going to come online? And to your point just now, for many that's when Permian oversupply may very well be at its worst?","Jack F. Harper - Concho Resources, Inc.","That's a fair assessment, Brian. And that does line up with the timing of a lot of these larger scale projects. So, that is correct and it's also just in line with how we were planning to go about our business anyway. So, it's nice that it lines up that way.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thanks. And are you still taking efforts to expose the company to pricing points beyond Midland and via your hedges, Cushing? And is that something that could have an impact on 2019 or is that longer term?","Jack F. Harper - Concho Resources, Inc.","Oh, it's longer term and I think you could see that optionality and price begin in late 2019, early 2020. And I feel very confident that we will have opportunities to look at it more as a portfolio approach if we choose to do that. However, we do think Midland will be a good place to price a barrel longer term due to the options that we have here.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Jack F. Harper - Concho Resources, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Doug Leggate with Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks, everybody. Good morning. Tim, I kind of feel as if I ask you this question every quarter, but for the combined company you're \u2013 well, on a standalone basis in Q2, you generated free cash flow. And the combined company in this commodity deck, it looks like that might continue even at a higher activity level.","How should we think about your prior comments about spending cash flow? And I think a couple of quarters ago, you talked about when you do something, it will be significant as it relates to surplus cash, whether it be dividend or buyback or something. But can you just frame your thoughts if post the Permian bottlenecks, oil prices, let's assume, hold up at this new trading range we've seen recently?","Timothy A. Leach - Concho Resources, Inc.","Yeah. Well, I think one of the most important things to start with is that these capital programs we put together are the highest rate of return capital efficient programs we've ever had in the company's history. So, a lot of our cash flow goes back into those programs because they create so much value. I would say over the longer term, though \u2013 and going into the next year or two, oil prices have been very volatile and we've been pretty conservative on how we build our capital program and what commodity price we look at for that program to breakeven.","I like the notion of generating free cash flow and growing dramatically. And so I think in the short-term, you're going to see us generating free cash flow and growing dramatically. And then, beyond 2020, I think as we've discussed in the past, we have all the options in front of us on what's the best way to create value for our shareholders, what's the optimal rate to run our machine. And I think we're just going to be really well-positioned.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I know it's not an easy one to answer, but I guess we'll have to wait a couple of years. My follow-up, if I may, and this really goes to my discussion with Megan last night, I realize that \u2013 do not put words in your mouth, but you really couldn't do a whole heck of a lot with RSP prior to the close. So, now that you've got a hold of this thing, you haven't given us updated outlooks for 2019 and 2020, the way you did for Concho. And I'm just wondering if I could press you a little bit to give us some idea as to maybe how you see the pro forma company growth profile over the next couple years, referencing the guidance you used to give us for Concho. I realize it's a little early, but any help would be appreciated. And I'll leave it there. Thanks.","Timothy A. Leach - Concho Resources, Inc.","Yeah. Well, I think as Jack said, our philosophies haven't changed on how we run the business. And RSP, that acquisition brings in very high-quality property. So, one of the ways we create value is by aggressively managing our portfolio of assets. You'll see that continue. And then, as we look at our capital budget and allocate capital, you're going to see capital going to the highest rate of return projects, which as Jack's described in his presentation, are bigger and bigger percentages of multi-well pads and those kind of projects. So lots of those will be on RSP.","And as far as when we give guidance for 2019, historically \u2013 we've transitioned to giving guidance after the year has been completed. I think it \u2013 we just got our hands on the steering wheel on the RSP assets, but we've already started to reallocate capital, and the earliest, I think, you could see us give you any guidance would be probably at the end of the next quarter.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Sorry, Tim, just to be clear, are you pointing towards an acceleration in asset sales (00:25:46)","Timothy A. Leach - Concho Resources, Inc.","I wouldn't call it \u2013 I think an acceleration would be a mischaracterization. I just think it's an ongoing aggressive portfolio management to high grade our portfolio. We've got great assets across both basins, but we will continue to very aggressively manage those, to block up, high grade and you ought to see our map getting more concentrated over time.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I'll take aggressive. Thanks a lot, fellows. Appreciate it.","Timothy A. Leach - Concho Resources, Inc.","All right. Thanks, Doug","Jack F. Harper - Concho Resources, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mike Kelly with Seaport Global. Your line is now open.","Michael Dugan Kelly - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Hey, guys. Good morning.","Timothy A. Leach - Concho Resources, Inc.","Morning, Mike.","Michael Dugan Kelly - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Really just wanted to get your take, kind of at a high level, of how you see the dynamics playing out in the Permian over the next six or 12 months. Jack mentioned in his prepared remarks that production has really exceeded expectations. And as we kind of near pipeline capacity, just really curious on how you see the potential for differentials to vary? What dynamics you could see ultimately happen with producers, certain behavior, et cetera? Just really your kind of high level thoughts. Thanks.","Timothy A. Leach - Concho Resources, Inc.","Okay. Well, let me start with the high-level thoughts. And we have not had any problem moving or selling our crude oil. And historically, we've seen situations like this before where it was just two years ago that everyone was asking about access to service and supply and it came along big time for us. So, the Permian is a great place to be. Transportation resources out of the Permian I think will supply all the needs the industry has. And I think that my expectation is, from a very high level, that when there is a need and there is economics involved, that our industry is great at responding to that need.","So, I think that we've seen these blowouts in differentials before, that's why we have the type of hedging program we have. I think it's probably \u2013 this problem will be solved more quickly than anybody's estimating. And then we'll be on to the next problem.","Michael Dugan Kelly - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Fair enough. In the \u2013 I know you guys do have great basis swaps, you're protected there. How about activity levels for you guys? If differentials really do get to excessive, egregious levels, do you think about slowing activity? Or how do you respond to that?","Jack F. Harper - Concho Resources, Inc.","Mike, I mean, cash flow is the ultimate governor of our business, and we're also prudent in the way we go about our business. So, if you did have some period of dislocation that brought down the cash flow, we would match up our activity over time with that.","Michael Dugan Kelly - Seaport Global Securities LLC","I got it. Appreciate it. Thanks, guys.","Timothy A. Leach - Concho Resources, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Hall with Heikkinen Energy. Your line is now open.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Thanks, good morning.","Timothy A. Leach - Concho Resources, Inc.","Good morning.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Just wanted to talk a little bit I guess about the 2018, the back half guide on a pro forma basis. I guess as we kind of combine the two, we had a bit higher fourth quarter number in particular relative to what you all had. You talked in the deck about kind of project timing on the legacy assets and shifting to manufacturing on the RSP assets. Was wondering how much that impacted, I guess, the fourth quarter number relative to what it maybe would have been on a just kind of go forward RSP in terms of the way they had been managing that business and how quickly do we make that up? Should we expect to see a big uptick in the first quarter 2019 or how does that transition to manufacturing? How long does that have to take to play out I guess? A few questions there. Appreciate it.","Jack F. Harper - Concho Resources, Inc.","Yeah. Let me start by saying that both companies are doing well relative to our plans. And relative to our internal forecast, both look favorable to those. And most certainly, jump-starting the activity on large projects in RSP modestly defers the timing of some production. But really nothing materially different than what they had planned on those assets or what we had planned on ours, so. But it should provide us some nice momentum as we look to build a budget for next year.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Okay. And is it fair to think then we'd see a pretty healthy uptick early in 2019 just as that curves or is it likely that there's a big lump I guess early in 2019?","Jack F. Harper - Concho Resources, Inc.","Yeah, as Tim mentioned we're just now getting our arms around these. You see some actions we're taking here in the near term, which is building out infrastructure, starting on some of these larger projects on the newly acquired assets. And the earliest we would really guide, as Tim mentioned, would be next quarter. But we're excited most importantly about the added efficiency. This allows us to build a program with this new set of assets.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Okay, makes sense. And I guess last, do you have an estimated base decline for the combined company at this point like what a 12-month out decline rate might look like?","Jack F. Harper - Concho Resources, Inc.","Combined, they're similar to what ours was prior.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Is that like a low 30s type percent? Is that a reasonable level?","Jack F. Harper - Concho Resources, Inc.","Yeah, it's a little bit lower than that.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Okay.","Jack F. Harper - Concho Resources, Inc.","It depends on the timing and cadence of these projects. But yeah, somewhere in that plus or minus 30% is a good way to think about it.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Great. Appreciate that. Congrats, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from Neal Dingmann with SunTrust. Your line is now open.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Good morning, all. Tim, for you or Jack, I just wanted to \u2013 obviously your Oryx investment continues to pay dividends here with that 24% membership interest. Was I think, last quarter you received what, almost $160 million distribution there. I'm just wondering, how should we think about that, either remainder of this year or go-forward, what else that can generate or what else we should think about around that position?","Jack F. Harper - Concho Resources, Inc.","That Oryx asset is a great asset. We were very happy that we were able to participate in that. As we described in the prepared remarks, it's helping us move that Delaware Basin oil via pipeline. And so \u2013 and it's a real business, generating real cash flow. So, we're happy with it as is or if there's a monetization opportunity in the future, that'd be fine too. But most importantly, it's serving the purpose that we hoped it would which is helping us move our barrels to better markets and better prices.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Jack, are there more opportunities like this to invest in that you think you'll see?","Jack F. Harper - Concho Resources, Inc.","There are more midstream opportunities. We try to stay true to our E&P business roots. And really, you would most likely see us only investing in those kind of projects that our equity volumes could support some large portion of the investment.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. And then just one last quick one. Maybe, Tim, for you. You mentioned \u2013 nice to see the ramp in rigs, just wondered, with the efficiencies you continue to see both on the drilling and completion side, how do you think about sort of what's needed on the frac side if you're running 32 rigs? I mean, it seems like it's nice tug of war to see, you see a little more efficiencies in drilling then you see more efficiencies in the fracs. How should we think about that on a go forward?","Timothy A. Leach - Concho Resources, Inc.","We're running 10 spreads today and that seems to be adequate with the number of rigs we're running. So, that's \u2013 we're pretty happy with the balance in the business right now.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Very good. Thank you, all.","Jack F. Harper - Concho Resources, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Charles Meade with Johnson Rice. Your line is now open.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Good morning, Tim, Jack and to the rest of the team there.","Timothy A. Leach - Concho Resources, Inc.","Good morning.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","I want to go back to the question you've had from a few, I guess, questioners ago on the 4Q guidance. And I appreciate the disclosure you guys put on slide 12 on your presentation, but to put some numbers to it, it looks like the kind of consensus on the Street for 4Q was maybe 3% or so higher than the \u2013 than what you guys are guiding to for 4Q. And of course, one possible explanation for that is that people in seats like mine maybe had some difficulty going from three-stream to two-stream. But the other possibility that is out there to me is that perhaps you guys are pulling in your horns a little bit in 4Q in response to the differential situation and your desire to kind of continue spending within cash flow. So, is there any aspect of that in 4Q that you guys are dialing back a bit in anticipation of lower cash flow or is this really are you on the same course that you said earlier?","Jack F. Harper - Concho Resources, Inc.","We really have not had any significant change to our plans. The modest change to RSP's plan is more investment in the back half of the year on starting these large-scale projects, both in infrastructure and in the size of the projects. But really as I mentioned before, both companies are tracking well with the previous plan and the guidance that was laid out there last quarter.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Got it. Thank you for that, Jack. And then, in a totally different direction, there's some news reports \u2013 or there are news reports yesterday and again more this morning about a pipeline fire to the southeast town where you guys are. And I'm just curious if you guys could offer any insight into whether you're affected by any of the flows on those lines. And if there's any, kind of bigger industry effect that you guys are aware of right now or might anticipate?","Jack F. Harper - Concho Resources, Inc.","Yeah. We are aware of that situation and don't anticipate any impact to our plans.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Timothy A. Leach - Concho Resources, Inc.","Thanks.","Jack F. Harper - Concho Resources, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael McAllister with MUFG Securities. Your line is now open.","Michael McAllister - MUFG Securities America, Inc.","Good morning, everyone. I was hoping that you could give me at least the metric that could work with \u2013 grow dramatically within cash flow? Is it production, resource, reserves?","Timothy A. Leach - Concho Resources, Inc.","Well, I'm not sure I really understand your question. But when I talk about growing dramatically within cash flow, I'm talking about growing production within our cash flow and generating free cash flow while we're doing that.","Michael McAllister - MUFG Securities America, Inc.","That's the answer. Okay, so it's production, the metric.","Timothy A. Leach - Concho Resources, Inc.","And we've talked about a three-year CAGR that is supported within cash flow at much lower oil prices. We kind of gave a point in time reference to that last quarter. So that's only been enhanced by this transaction.","Michael McAllister - MUFG Securities America, Inc.","Okay. That's what I was looking for. That's the answer. While I have you, can you give me an update on Eddy County? What's been going on there? Will it have a development program at some point, things kind of shift a little with RSP? Any color on that would be helpful.","C. William Giraud - Concho Resources, Inc.","Sure. You're asking about what we're going to plan to do at Eddy County? I mean it's clearly part of our Northern Delaware asset. We and other participants have been doing a lot of good work out there in the different Bone Spring intervals. We talked about a couple of wells there last quarter. But also our people are drilling a bunch of the different Wolfcamp zones and it has been part of the plan and will continue to be.","Michael McAllister - MUFG Securities America, Inc.","Okay. That's helpful. Thanks.","Timothy A. Leach - Concho Resources, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah. Good morning. I was wondering if you could just give us more details on the conversion from three-stream to two-stream and just the impact to RSP volumes in the second half of the year.","Jack F. Harper - Concho Resources, Inc.","Sure, Arun. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, it's about a 10% impact to their equivalent volumes and that is starting on July 19. That is how we have forecasted those volumes combined with ours.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thanks for that. And just secondly, Jack, you've gone to 32 rigs and now 10 frac crews, just your thoughts on maintaining that level of activity as we move into 2019. And just wondering if \u2013 also, if you could comment broadly, in 2018, the growth rate is 22% on a pro forma basis, how the RSP assets would look like relative to that growth rate when you put that together with 2019 to 2020?","Jack F. Harper - Concho Resources, Inc.","Okay. If I understand that correctly, let me take a shot at that. We had put out guidance of 18% to 20% stand-alone. So, incrementally moving above that is what you're seeing the benefit of their assets. And previous to this deal, we had talked about our plan, which is reinvested cash flow and grew about 20%. They had talked about reinvesting their cash flow over a longer period of time and growing about 30%. So, that's a good indication of the two asset bases. But now that we have the opportunity to put them together and base the programs on the best rate of return from either set of assets, I think that's very powerful and they bring a lot of cash flow to the table as well.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thanks a lot.","Timothy A. Leach - Concho Resources, Inc.","Thank you.","Jack F. Harper - Concho Resources, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Derrick Whitfield with Stifel Financial.

Harper - Concho Resources, Inc.","Good morning.","Derrick Whitfield - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Tim or Jack, so referencing slide 13, what percentage of your aggregate completions are large-scale development projects? And then, how should we think generally about the cadence of completions over the next year assuming relatively static rig activity levels?","Jack F. Harper - Concho Resources, Inc.","So, more than half of the completions that will happen will be on these large-scale projects, and that's only going to continue to increase over time. And I'm sorry, what was the second part of your question?","Derrick Whitfield - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Sure. The second part of the question is how should we generally think about the cadence of completions quarter-over-quarter if we assume static rig activity levels from here?","Jack F. Harper - Concho Resources, Inc.","Sure. Yeah. Ramping into the fourth quarter, you will see progressively increasing completions throughout the back half of this year.","Derrick Whitfield - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. And as my follow-up question, regarding the Dominator pilot in Northern Delaware, how should we think about the sequencing of drilling completion and flow back operations for larger pilots like it? And specifically, when would we see first production and then when would it \u2013 how much later would it then peak?","C. William Giraud - Concho Resources, Inc.","Sure. This is Will. The goal there is to bring \u2013 to complete those wells simultaneously with multiple frac spreads and then flow them back together. And that's probably a mid to late next year timing.","Derrick Whitfield - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Got it. Thanks for taking my questions.","C.

So, now that the RSP acquisition is closed, I know it's still early days, but could you talk a little bit about your current outlook for achieving the $2 billion plus in synergies from the deal? Do you expect to see significant synergies once you do publish your 2019 budget?","Jack F. Harper - Concho Resources, Inc.","Sure. There's a lot of value creation opportunities with that deal that we've described. I'd point you towards the corporate and interest savings, which we've already achieved. That gets you approximately a quarter of that larger number. And then, you can see by evidence of our activity in the back half of the year, we've jumpstarted these large-scale projects which we think is the biggest driver. We're also spending money on the infrastructure to support those. And then outside of that, we've identified a large number of trades that we are actively working and we continue to actively manage our portfolio via asset sales and purchases of acreage in and around some of our best areas. So, I would say we're ahead of schedule there and optimistic.","Richard Merlin Tullis - Capital One Securities, Inc.","Okay, Jack. And if you had to roughly estimate the impact on the updated 2018 budget from the synergies, what would you put that number at?","Jack F. Harper - Concho Resources, Inc.","Well, I guess it depends on how and who's calculating that. But as I said the corporate and interest savings have been achieved now. And by virtue of starting these large projects in the back half of the year, we will begin to see the fruits of those investments into next year.","Richard Merlin Tullis - Capital One Securities, Inc.","Okay.

Please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up.","With that, let me turn it over to Tim.","Tim Leach","Thanks Megan. Good morning. We\u2019re really pleased with the company\u2019s performance last year. Commodity prices strengthened during the fourth quarter but the move higher was choppy. This only helps to highlight what we\u2019ve tried to do at Concho, and that\u2019s build a machine that not only survives volatility but thrives. We do that by consistently executing our strategy, the same, simple yet powerful strategy since we founded the company. It\u2019s driven by our people, assets, returns, and balance sheet. Fourth quarter and full year 2017 results illustrate our ability to execute on this strategy and deliver near term performance while positioning ourselves for sustainable long-term growth and returns. ","This industry is exciting. Commodity prices change, new plays emerge, technologies advance. Our strategy allows us to adapt quickly and our history in the Permian, which is the best value-creating engine in our industry, enables us to be a leader in the development here. Developing large scale projects, manufacturing mode, whatever you call, it\u2019s one way that we\u2019re doing it. ","While our strategy is the same, the development of our inventory is more sophisticated and creates an opportunity to extend our competitive edge. Overall, 2017 was a great year for Concho.","At the start of the year, we outlined a $1.5 billion capital program with a resulting growth range of 20 to 24%. The operating environment was dynamic - we had to keep both our hands firmly on the steering wheel, but our focus paid off and the team delivered exceptional performance. Capital invested totaled $1.7 billion and for the second year in a row after fully funding our capital program, we generated excess cash flow.","While acquisitions and trades were a key part of our strategy, it\u2019s our development program that ultimately drove value. For \u201917, production growth totaled 28%, which exceeded the high end of our guidance. A key ingredient to our success last year was better well performance. That was driven by extending our lateral links, refining our lateral placement, and optimizing completion designs. ","We also announced proved reserves in yesterday\u2019s release. Our proved reserves increased 17% to 840 million BOEs. Proved developed reserves increased 26% versus a year ago and now account for 70% of our total, and we replaced 275% of our production at a proved developed finding cost of $8.68. ","Our accomplishments last year paved the way for continued operational and financial performance for the next decade. Our development activities validated well spacing, lateral placement and completion design, and our strategic acquisitions and asset exchanges added complementary leasehold for long lateral development. The result is more high quality reinvestment opportunities to fuel our growth. ","Total resource increased by more than 25% year-over-year driven by a 37% increase in premium resource. For Concho, what we call premium resource will achieve greater than a 35% rate of return at 55 and 3. Based on this economic threshold, approximately 60% of our undeveloped horizontal resource is premium. Importantly, our premium resource inventory achieves an average rate of return of 67%, and we have roughly 30 years of premium runway at our current pace.","Looking back, shale has passed through three stages: discovery, delineation, and now development. For Concho, development entails harvesting reserves with large scale multi-zone projects. As competition to supply the most efficient barrels intensifies, we believe this type of development is important to maximize recoveries, drive economies of scale, and deliver attractive long-term economic returns predictably and consistently. ","As our competitors report results and provide their guidance, it\u2019s clear that the Permian, which is already the most active play, is set to see even more activity. We\u2019ll leverage our unique position to continue to execute the Concho strategy and advance our lead in the best oil play.","One advantage we have that allows us to deliver growth today and build for the future is active asset portfolio management. For Concho, active management is a three-part equation. We buy things that bolt onto our core areas, we sell things that are not strategic to our development, and increasingly we focus on swapping things with our neighbors so that we all block up for longer lateral development. We\u2019re focusing on all parts of this equation. Most recently, we sold non-core leasehold in Ward and Reeves County for approximately $280 million. These were non-contiguous, low working interest, and largely non-operated properties with minimal production and proved reserves. The sale brings our total divestiture proceeds to $1.4 billion since 2016.","We also executed a significant asset trade with one of our larger neighbors. For us, the trade fills in a very strategic part of our Mabee Ranch position and also adds working interest to our operated positions in Upton County and on the New Mexico Shelf. In exchange, we traded out of our checkerboard acreage in Culberson County. The trade is a win-win and allows both companies to operate more effectively and maximize the value of their respective assets.","Our people and strategy have built a great company with decades of high quality drilling opportunities. We have a visible path to strong growth per debt-adjusted share and free cash flow generation. I\u2019ve said this before - leadership in our industry is defined by execution strength and capital discipline. We\u2019ve built a company that can thrive in almost any environment, and if you\u2019ve followed Concho, you know our execution over the last 10 years has demonstrated this. I believe that we\u2019re in the best position in our history to execute on our long-term value creation strategy.","Again, 2017 was a great year for Concho. I want to thank our team. They made it happen. I\u2019m as excited about our future today as I was on Day 1.","Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Jack to discuss the quarter in more detail.","Jack Harper","Thank you, Tim. We delivered outstanding performance in the fourth quarter. Production of 2,011 BOEs per day exceeded the high end of our guidance range and represented 9% growth over the previous quarter. We also continued to focus on expense control in the fourth quarter. LOE per BOE edged down while cash G&A and interest expense were both substantially lower over the previous quarter. High margin oil growth translated into strong financial performance. Our adjusted net income per share was $0.66 and EBITDEx totaled $513 million. ","For 2017, we grew oil volumes 29% and total production 28%. Our cost savings efforts paid off too. Controllable cash cost per unit, which includes LOE, G&A, and interest expense, were down 16% as compared to 2016. During last year, we refinanced a substantial portion of our long-term debt and lowered our annual interest expense.","Regarding our balance sheet, we\u2019ve never been in a better position. In 2017, we achieved investment grade credit ratings and enhanced our credit position by lowering absolute leverage and improving our cost of capital. We\u2019re right in the middle of our comfort zone for leverage. A strong balance sheet increases our flexibility and puts us in a position to deliver differentiated performance within cash flow over the long term. ","Over the last few years, our transition to large scale multi-well projects has been an important development that will continue to drive growth, innovation and efficiencies. Here is an update on some of our recent projects.","In the northern Delaware, the Vast and Windward projects are demonstrating great early success. The Vast is made up of seven one-mile wells in the Wolfcamp sands and shale, and the Windward includes eight two-mile wells in the Avalon shale. These projects have produced an aggregate 3 million barrels made up of 71% oil in the first four months of production.","Our latest projects in the southern Delaware and Midland basins look to build upon that success. In the southern Delaware, our original eight-well project design expanded to 10 wells in order to optimize the development pattern and recoveries of the third Bone Spring, Wolfcamp A and Wolfcamp B zones. It\u2019s a great example of being able to feed real-time science into the development machine and adapt accordingly. The average lateral link for the project is 9,700 feet. We now have sufficient production history to provide you with an average 30-day peak rate for the project of 26,000 BOEs per day. ","In the Midland basin, the 13-well, two mile Mabee Ranch project is online as well. This project tests multi-zone development and key spacing assumptions for our core position within our portfolio. We\u2019re excited by the early production results with a 24-hour current peak rate of approximately 15,000 BOEs which is made up of 85% oil, with oil rates continuing to climb. While we\u2019ve operated in the Midland basin for a long time, we\u2019re also at the forefront of applying new technology to further advance completion techniques and ultimate recovery. The Mabee Ranch project includes three wells with fiber optic monitoring. The application of this technology generates both real time and long-term feedback that enables our team to make modifications with big implications for maximizing value, and this knowledge is transferrable to other parts of our portfolio.","As we look to 2018, our total capital investment is expected to be $2 billion with 93% allocated for drilling and completion activity. This level of investment is expected to grow oil approximately 20%. Importantly, approximately two-thirds of our development capital will be directed to large scale, multi-zone projects. To capitalize on our scale of manage and reduce operational risk across the supply chain, we are sourcing sand from several regional mines in the Permian and have secured last mile transportation logistics. ","Around this time last year, we provided a three-year plan to reinvest our cash flow and grow production at a compounded rate of 20%. We delivered in a big way in 2017 and are rolling forward that plan to 2020. By continuing to reinvest our cash flow, we expect to grow production at a compounded rate of 20% between now and 2020. This outlook is cash flow breakeven in each year at oil prices in the low to mid 50s. ","Our 2018 capital program and the three-year outlook are consistent with the way we\u2019ve run our business for the last 10 years. The growth we set out to achieve is the output of reinvesting in our high margin, high quality assets. ","We ended the year on a strong note and start 2018 with a great deal of momentum. We have so much opportunity before us, and our assets provide a solid platform for scalable growth. By delivering strong and consistent execution and managing our business with discipline, we are in the best position to build long-term value for our shareholders.","With that, we\u2019ll now open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions]","Our first question comes from the line of Doug Leggate of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Mr. Leggate, your line is open.","Megan Hays","Operator, we can go to the next question.","Operator","Okay, our next question comes from the line of Arun Jayaram of JP Morgan. Your line is open.","Arun Jayaram","Yes, good morning - Arun Jayaram from JPM. Tim, first question is regarding portfolio management. You outlined, I think, $1.4 billion in proceeds over the last couple years. I was wondering if you could comment on how recurring a program this could be and other opportunities you could have to perhaps bring inventory that is at the end of your queue and realize that in terms of cash, and what does the near term outlook look like for more asset trades like the one you did with the integrated oil company?","Tim Leach","Yes. I think as I outlined, I think it\u2019s a major part of our strategy. As the company grows, and I talked about our drilling program getting more sophisticated, the asset quality just continues to get better, so I think trading into longer development, longer lateral development, bigger blocks, higher ownership, those types of trades are ongoing. I can\u2019t remember the number we did in the last quarter, but it was a shockingly high number of trades. It\u2019s just kind of the blocking and tackling of our business. ","You know, selling out of areas, the number that you referred to, I still think that that will continue. Some of that was the ACC pipeline and how we monetized that. Creating value for our shareholders through our asset position in the Permian Basin is, I think, something we\u2019re going to continue to do.","Arun Jayaram","Great, and just my follow-up, Tim, you mentioned the ACC pipeline monetization. You did sit here with about a 24% or so interest in Oryx. I would suspect there\u2019s probably a lot of industry interest in that asset, so what are your plans on a go-forward basis with that investment in the Oryx system?","Tim Leach","Yes, we\u2019re really happy with that investment. We think it gets more valuable every year. As you know, we don\u2019t manage that asset - that was an investment in a company that built the pipeline, similar to ACC. It\u2019s an investment that we\u2019d be happy to hold long term and we\u2019d also be happy to sell it, so it\u2019s one of those opportunities to create more value.","Arun Jayaram","I guess stay tuned on that front. Thanks a lot, Tim.","Tim Leach","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of John Freeman of Raymond James. Your line is open.","John Freeman","Good morning, guys. As you guys look to further capitalize on your scale with roughly 65% of activity targeted at these large scale multi-well projects, I\u2019m just trying to get a sense of how you think about optimizing the size of these projects. It looks like they\u2019re getting a little bit bigger than they were last year, if that trend just sort of continues, how you think about optimizing the number of wells that you would have on one of these types of projects. ","Jack Harper","Sure, John. It\u2019s a work in progress. As you\u2019ve seen over the last few years, they have increased in size and scale, and that\u2019s all part of the process to determine in which areas what the optimal size project is to attempt to maximize rate of return and the drainage in those areas. So work in progress, but the size and scale is moving up.","John Freeman","Then just my follow-up question, you cited that you all got about 50% of your 2018 sand volume sourced in basin. Is that a mix that you\u2019re happy with long term, or do you anticipate that increasing over time?","Tim Leach","Yes John, I think that\u2019s going to go up over time. The whole capability of those mines is just starting to come on now and in the second quarter, and so I think it will be a growing part of our portfolio.","John Freeman","Great, thanks guys. Nice quarter.","Tim Leach","Thanks John.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Scott Hanold of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Scott Hanold","Good morning. My first question is obviously you guys have demonstrated your ability to produce free cash flow at low prices, and obviously at current strip prices that generation continues to increase. What are your current thoughts, and I think I asked this one last quarter but I\u2019d like to see where you guys are thinking about this now, what are your thoughts with regards to what to do with that excess free cash flow as that cash balance builds if commodity prices stay high?","Tim Leach","Yes, I\u2019m going to give you a very high level answer and then maybe go down a little bit more in the weeds. You know, in my comments I talked about the increasing commodity prices had been choppy in the fourth quarter and how we have positioned ourselves to take advantage of that. So I think being able to demonstrate free cash flow generation over a long period of time, that\u2019s something we\u2019ve done, something we\u2019re striving to do more of, but we also did a lot of other things with that cash. We improved our balance sheet. I think for the long term, having a strong balance sheet is going to be a real strategic advantage for us. I would like to see our balance sheet further strengthened.","But clearly, when you look out, we talk about decades of growth and work and things like that, and as we become more and more efficient, we create a really efficient cash generation machine. When we started this company a decade ago, we talked about would it be possible to deliver private equity types of returns for public shareholders like we did for the decade where we were private, and if you look back on the--and when we were private, we delivered high 20s compounded rates of return. When you look at the last decade now with Concho as a public company, we\u2019ve kind of done that, and the value proposition has been through our development machine and also through our focus on the Permian Basin and consolidation. So I think when somebody buys Concho, they\u2019re buying into that value proposition.","Now at some point in time when you look down the road, you can see how much cash flow we\u2019re going to generate, and I think when we get in the mode of starting to return capital to our shareholders, it will be in the form of a new value proposition. It won\u2019t be just a nominal type of return of capital, but it will be something that you say, okay, I get it, this is how these guys are going to create value going forward, so that\u2019s kind of how I\u2019m thinking about it right now.","Scott Hanold","Okay, appreciate that, and we look forward to more on that in the future. As my follow-up question, I like the aspect of talking about your inventory as premium and the returns that you can generate. Just broadly speaking, can you give us some color when you look at your resource base today versus where it was a year or two ago? How have those returns changed, i.e. how have the improvements in drilling techniques and capital costs improved that premium inventory you guys have right now? ","Tim Leach","Well, the inventory has grown but the quality of the inventory has improved. Having that much inventory that you can actually generate the kind of capital efficiency that grows the value of your company dramatically, that\u2019s been achieved through this asset portfolio management, and our portfolio of inventory, even though it roughly has the same number of drilling opportunities it had a couple years ago, the quality of that inventory is much, much higher.","Scott Hanold","Great. Specifically, would you say that the premium piece of it has, say, doubled from where it was a couple years ago, or what kind of scale do we have? Do you have a sense of that?","Jack Harper","Yes Scott, it\u2019s up significantly, and it\u2019s all the things that Tim mentioned - it\u2019s the long laterals, it\u2019s the completion optimization, and that\u2019s what you want to see and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve seen.","Scott Hanold","Thank you, appreciate that.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Michael Hall of Heikkinen Energy Advisors. Your line is open.","Michael Hall","Thanks. Congrats on a solid quarter. I was curious on the updated new outlook through 2020. You guys have provided a similar outlook in the past. You comment that it will deliver free cash flow in the low to mid 50s. I\u2019m just curious if there\u2019s any way to quantify that free cash flow at a given price so we can get a little better calibration around what the capital side of the equation looks like.","Jack Harper","No, I don\u2019t think--I think we\u2019ll let you put that through your model. I think it\u2019s just a demonstration of the power of the asset base to do that, and then we\u2019d like for you to calibrate that.","Tim Leach","I\u2019d like to re-emphasize that we don\u2019t have targeted growth here. We\u2019re managing our capital program for efficiency, and we\u2019re putting that three-year outlook out there so you can just see what the result of the current capital efficiency we see today.","Michael Hall","Okay, understood. I guess as a follow-up to that, is there any way or any kind of color or commentary you could wrap around how big of an increase in activity profile, be it rigs or completed well counts, that is anticipated within that program?","Tim Leach","I would say the rig count doesn\u2019t go up--it grows, but it doesn\u2019t go up that much. The number of stages and the footage drilled goes up dramatically. I don\u2019t know if you want to put any more--? Jack\u2019s shaking his head no, so that\u2019s all you get on that.","Michael Hall","All right. I guess as an unrelated follow-up, you\u2019ve had some commentary around portfolio management and the trades and asset level commentary, but you do have a pretty attractively valued stock. What are your views on corporate deals at this point? There is quite a bit of spread, if you will, between the valuation of some of the public entities in the Permian. How do you view that, and any interest in that market at this point?","Tim Leach","We\u2019ve said before that we think consolidation makes a lot of sense in the Permian from an operational efficiency standpoint. We also said before that corporate deals are complicated and more difficult to execute, and therefore there\u2019s fewer of them. We\u2019re really focused on the blocking and tackling of our business. We\u2019ve got numerous smaller type of transactions that in the aggregate make a huge difference to our business, so I think we\u2019re focused on the Permian, we\u2019ll be a participant in the consolidation, but we have a very high standard and a high bar for how do you improve on this business plan, so I think that ought to be one of your takeaways.","Michael Hall","All right, understood. Appreciate the comments.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Bob Brackett of Bernstein Research. Your line is open.","Bob Brackett","You\u2019ve talked about two-thirds of your activity being large scale pads, 80% being multi-well pads. Can you talk for a minute about those single well pads and those smaller scale pads - what is that activity doing for you, and what\u2019s that level going to look like, say, two years from now?","Tim Leach","Jack, you want to--?","Jack Harper","Sure. In general, it\u2019s testing new concepts, holding acreage, but as we move forward, we think the percent of large project development will only increase, but it will never be 100% of our capital allocation. There will always be some amount of capital or maintaining leases, testing new concepts, etc.","Bob Brackett","Okay, thank you for that. The quick follow-up, the 170,000 net acres you\u2019re carrying in the Midland, that\u2019s that same number you were carrying previously but now you\u2019ve added Mabee Ranch at 60,000. How do I reconcile the number now?","Jack Harper","The way to think about that is we\u2019re focused on the core, and so that\u2019s where the acreage will core up. To the extent things are not in the core, we\u2019re less concerned about them.","Bob Brackett","So you\u2019ve let them expire or you\u2019ve sold them, or what?","Jack Harper","Some of each over time.","Bob Brackett","Okay, got you. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Doug Leggate of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Doug Leggate","Thanks, good morning everyone. Some stupid Scottish guy doesn\u2019t know how to work the mute button, so apologies for that. Maybe one for Jack and one for Tim. Jack, most of your development to date, the tremendous growth over the last several years has, I guess, been single well pads as you\u2019ve locked up your acreage and moved to an efficient mode of operation. How should we think about moving to field development as it relates to child wells versus parent, and how have you factored that into your thoughts in terms of guidance and so on?","Jack Harper","Sure, and that is one of the reasons to move to the large scale development as we have, and I think we\u2019ve successfully made that transition and so you will see more of that in the future to attempt to avoid creating child wells. Where there are child wells, which is a smaller percentage of our opportunities, we will continue to test that and make sure that we try not to leave any behind.","Doug Leggate","So in terms of--I guess you don\u2019t give a tight curve as such, but as we look at the productivity per lateral foot, I guess is the best way to think about your business, you don\u2019t see any degradation there at all?","Jack Harper","Well, we\u2019ve modeled the outcome as we see it based on the spacing that is either already happened or will happen in the future.","Doug Leggate","Okay, thank you for that. Tim, maybe just going back to your comments about the longer term value proposition, the growth proposition is obviously pretty clear and you\u2019ve laid out a three-year growth timeline. What would you think--I\u2019m presuming you\u2019re talking about some kind of dividend policy, but presumably if that\u2019s the case, what do you think is the appropriate transition timeline when you think something like that might be the right call for the investment case going forward? I\u2019ll leave it there, thanks.","Tim Leach","Yes, I think there\u2019s a couple of factors. I think I\u2019d like to see--you know, we talked about moving the goalpost on our balance sheet and the appropriate leverage for a company that\u2019s in this kind of industry. We\u2019re in the middle of the fairway now, but I would like to see continued improvement on that. Also, I think there is a huge amount of continued core consolidation that we can do like we\u2019ve demonstrated in the last year or two. I think we have just started to get into the manufacturing or harvest mode of the shale revolution in the Permian. I think a few more years of that, evolution of that before you really think of yourself as starting to generate a cash cow type of thing, so I think we\u2019re a few years out.","Also, I don\u2019t think it\u2019d be something that you start tiny and insignificant. I think it\u2019d be something that would be a value proposition that we would communicate with our shareholders and talk about how we\u2019re going to transition to that.","Doug Leggate","That\u2019s very clear, Tim. Thanks for your time, and apologies again for the screw-up. ","Tim Leach","All right, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Neal Dingmann of SunTrust. Your line is open.","Neal Dingmann","Morning gentlemen. I had a question just on services. Jack, either for you or Tim, you mentioned kind of on the sand and different things. Could you talk about if you\u2019re locking in just with those rigs that you have? Do you sort of stagger or think about locking in now these days on longer contracts, and same thing on the frac spreads, are you able to--people say you really can\u2019t lock those in, but can you at least ensure that you have those same spreads over a period of time?","Jack Harper","We really value flexibility, as we\u2019ve said in the past, and with some of those costs, some things are going up this year, some things may go down. But right now, we see minimal increase to cost, but it\u2019s also a year where you\u2019ve already seen about a 10% increase in rig count, so that\u2019s something we\u2019ll work throughout the year. But maintaining flexibility is a key aspect of what we\u2019re trying to do.","Tim Leach","I would also say that part of our strategy has been running a steady operation, and we think the size and scale of that gives us preferred pricing and doesn\u2019t really involve locking things in. It involves being somebody that runs a steady program.","Neal Dingmann","Then just last one - you guys generally stay ahead, you mentioned a lot of the infrastructure. Could you just talk, you generally have seemed to stay ahead, even more than others, as far as water. Could you just talk about where you sit there and plans around the water with your growth?","Tim Leach","I think that water is one of the most important things, both the acquisition of water for the drilling program and also the proper handling of water after it comes out of the ground, so that\u2019s going to be a key part of our business. We\u2019ve become really good at that, I think, and we\u2019re also getting in our property base more concentrated and focused, which allows us more efficiency in all the water handling, so I think that\u2019s going to be a huge business in the future and I think there will be a huge expertise and business embedded in Concho going forward.","Neal Dingmann","Tim, is that something you would hold onto, or is that once you got to a certain size something that you would consider monetizing?","Tim Leach","It\u2019s hard to say at this point. It\u2019s something you\u2019d like to develop first, and then as Jack mentioned, we like flexibility so I\u2019d like to have all the options out in front of me. But I think that\u2019s why our shareholders will invest with us, because we will find opportunities like that to create more value along the way.","Neal Dingmann","Makes sense. Thanks guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Charles Meade of Johnson Rice. Your line is open.","Charles Meade","Good morning, Tim, to you and your team there. I wanted to go back to the comment you made a little bit earlier, Tim, about the shockingly high number of trades that you guys have been doing. For those of us sitting in the stands and watching you guys, we\u2019ve seen Concho and a lot of its peers, the pace pick up there, but it seems like the large integrateds are starting to play ball, and that might be a new thing. So I wonder if you could give us your take on whether this might be the beginning of regime change on their part or whether this is more of a one-off thing that you were able to pull off.","Tim Leach","No, no. We\u2019ve seen companies of all sizes, from the very largest to the very smallest, interested in trading assets to become more efficient. We have executed trades probably in the last quarter with companies of every different size on the spectrum, and I see that intensifying going forward.","Charles Meade","Got it, that\u2019s helpful, thank you. Then if I could go ask a question about the--you pointed out in your slides that you source a lot of Permian sand and you\u2019ve secured the last mile logistics. Can you talk about whether you see that becoming an increasing pain point or bottleneck for the industry, and where across your spreads in the whole Permian, where you see possible bottlenecks emerging either geographically or perhaps in the supply chain?","Tim Leach","I don\u2019t think that sand will be a bottleneck. When you look at the Permian, that\u2019s one of the benefits of the Permian - its location, its infrastructure, and there are lots of investment opportunities for other parts of the energy industry to invest in pipe, to invest in infrastructure. I think the biggest challenge for the industry as everybody is to manufacturing load, is just the infrastructure as it relates to human capital - it\u2019s housing, schools, hospitals, roads, things like that. So that\u2019s something that can be accomplished, but I think as far as the blocking and tackling of our business, it\u2019s always something. Everybody is always worried about either takeaway capacity or water or sand or gore. I can\u2019t even remember all the things that we\u2019ve been asked that never really--I mean, this industry has a great ability to respond and to provide what\u2019s needed to get the development done.","Charles Meade","That\u2019s helpful insight. Thank you, Tim.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Brian Singer of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Brian Singer","Thank you, good morning. As you continue to focus on your premium inventory in this harvest and manufacturing phase, can you talk about your outlook for productivity gains and efficiency gains from here and how you rank the drivers among extending lateral length thanks to your swaps versus further increases and completion intensity versus cost reductions via supply improvement or something else?","Tim Leach","That\u2019s a complicated question. In general when we give guidance, we try to forecast the things that we\u2019re aware of at the time we give the guidance, and we don\u2019t really forecast increasing efficiencies. Even in that three-year forecast, there\u2019s not an increasing efficiency assumption built into that, but if you look at the past year or two, increasing efficiencies have been a real driver in cash flow margins and driving costs down and productivity of the wells. So I think that\u2019s part of the upside and I think that will continue to go on. That\u2019s been driven primarily by longer lateral lengths, blockier acreage, and identifying more zones and bringing them all on at the same time. I think that that will continue.","We talked last quarter about the fiber optics in some of the wells we have up on the Mabee Ranch and what we discovered there and how that was improving the efficiency of our wells. Those kinds of things, they stay internal to Concho generally, but those kinds of things throughout the industry are going to be pretty dramatic, I think, to make our wells more efficient.","Brian Singer","Thanks. My follow-up is with regards to the labor and labor pressures. Much has been made about that in the Permian. Can you talk about what you\u2019re seeing and how we should expect the Concho experience to be the same or different versus the rest of industry? ","Tim Leach","Well, the thing that\u2019s different about Concho is I think the rate we\u2019re running now, the crews and things like that are basically what we need to deliver our plan, so we\u2019re not out looking--we\u2019re not desperately trying to add new labor, so I don\u2019t think that finding new labor sources, new crews and such is critical to us delivering on our plan. That may be different than the industry in general.","Brian Singer","Great, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dave Kistler of Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.","Dave Kistler","Morning guys. Wanted to touch a little bit more on the cost side of things. As I look at the LOE guidance relative to where Q4 came in, it\u2019s a little bit higher; but as you articulated in the call, efficiencies continue to improve but aren\u2019t baked into the guide, and service costs you kind of said looked to be flattish - some up, some down. Can you talk a little bit about what\u2019s factored into a guide that\u2019s a little higher than 4Q?","Jack Harper","Sure Dave. Over the last two quarters of last year, we were right around that $6 level. That\u2019s the low end of the guidance range, so we hope to be able to achieve that, but we\u2019re just trying to build a range that\u2019s realistic based on where we are in the cycle right now.","Dave Kistler","Okay, appreciate that. Then maybe diving in a little bit more to the comments you just made again on the fiber optics and what you\u2019re learning there, as we kind of look at the improvements and improvement in capital efficiency that\u2019s been driven by longer laterals, slightly better placements, improved efficiencies there, and we start looking at the tweaks that can come from the use of fiber optics, do you expect the same step shift changes in using that kind of data, or are we looking a little bit more surgically in bits and pieces, as opposed to larger step shift changes that we\u2019ve witnessed over the last couple years?","Tim Leach","I think our experience has been that what you perceive as a step change is really the combination of a bunch of incremental changes, and so I think the kind of data that we\u2019re getting out of the fiber optics tells us a lot of incremental things about a lot of subjects. But when you add them all together, it will look like a step change probably, but that would be my expectation. I think efficiency gains are still going to be substantial, but it will be a combination of a bunch of factors.","Dave Kistler","Okay, appreciate that color. Great work, guys.","Tim Leach","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Jeffrey Campbell of Tuohy Brothers. Your line is open.","Jeffrey Campbell","Good morning and congratulations on the quarter. My first question is does your expansion of Brass Monkey from eight to 10 wells imply that you can increase your total well completions per section in the area, or was there another takeaway from this increase?","Jack Harper","The takeaway really should be as we continue our plan and our thinking, we\u2019re trying to optimize the returns and the drainage of these wells, and in that case it just made sense to add those two wells to that project rather than waiting some time before we completed those two wells. ","Jeffrey Campbell","Okay, great. Thank you. My follow-up is it seems like based on the plans that we\u2019ve seen in front of us, it seems like the multi-zone development has not yet moved into Eddy County, and I was just wondering is this something that you see occurring during your three-year plan? ","Jack Harper","Absolutely. I mean, it\u2019s an area that we continue to test and multiple zones are producing well in that county, so I would presume there will be some of that.","Jeffrey Campbell","Okay, great. Well, we\u2019ll look forward to that. Thank you.","Jack Harper","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Derrick Whitfield of Stifel Financial. Your line is open.","Derrick Whitfield","Thanks, good morning, and great update, guys. Tim or Jack, could you comment on how, if at all, the heightened focus on compensation metrics has changed your approach to management and the metrics you use to steward the business?","Tim Leach","I\u2019ll take that one. I think we\u2019re ahead of the curve on that, and I think we\u2019ve designed compensation metrics that have been aligned with achieving our corporate goals. We\u2019ve been that way for several years, and I think the rest of the industry is maybe modeling their compensation changes to be more aligned with what we\u2019ve been doing for a while. So we have specific metrics that are driven off of growth for debt-adjusted share and being able to land your capital budget efficiently where you said you were going to land it. Things like that are basically what we get paid on, so I think--I\u2019m really proud of the compensation design that we have, and I think we were a little bit of ahead of our time.","Derrick Whitfield","Very good. My follow-up is regarding the captured resource comments on Page 7. Could you outline what range of recovery factors these estimates would imply?","Jack Harper","That\u2019s all across the board, Derrick, and in fact I don\u2019t know that we have a consensus of opinion even amongst ourselves on that. But suffice it to say it\u2019s low overall recoveries and increasing that percentage over time is something that will be a big effort. ","Derrick Whitfield","Thanks for taking my questions.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Richard Tullis with Capital One Securities. Your line is open.","Richard Tullis","Thanks, good morning everyone. Looking at the expected rig count, Tim, currently at 19 rigs, planning to average about 22 for the year, what do you expect the average rig count to look like, say, per quarter for the year, and where would those three rigs likely be added, what areas?","Jack Harper","Richard, it\u2019ll be probably pretty proportionate to where they are today, but it\u2019s just timing. No big significant moves in one of the areas over the other.","Richard Tullis","Okay, thank you, Jack. I guess a bigger picture question, you touched on it a little bit earlier too on the need for industry consolidation in the Permian. I know you\u2019ve talked about it in the past, Tim. Given where we are now, what conditions could spur more movement towards larger scale consolidation in the basin?","Tim Leach","I think stable commodity prices probably help. I also think that to the extent that investors differentiate between execution and non-execution, that probably helps, and the nature of the business is changing. The capital intensity, the balance sheet required, access to capital - all those things just kind of point to bigger and stronger companies, I think, and I think that will lead to additional consolidation.","Richard Tullis","Thank you, Tim, that\u2019s helpful. That\u2019s all for me.","Tim Leach","All right, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Grigel of Macquarie. Your line is open.","Paul Grigel","Hi, good morning. Tim, you made a few comments about further strengthening the balance sheet. Is there a metric or specific target that you\u2019re looking at relative to where you currently stand, given the increase in capital intensity of the business?","Tim Leach","We talked about a fairway of 1 to 1.5 times, and we\u2019re kind of in the middle of that. I\u2019d kind of like to be at the stronger end of that.","Paul Grigel","Okay, and then regarding the premium inventory, would it be possible to get a breakdown or some more color on the spread between Delaware and Midland and where you see the potential for increasing that resource between those two basins?","Jack Harper","The northern Delaware with all the zones that are accounted for there is the lion\u2019s share, and both of them have potential to increase, so those are our two big driver areas. The combination of the two of them accounts for most of that inventory.","Tim Leach","One of the big drivers of that high quality inventory is lateral length, so to the extent we can create more two-mile plus inventory, that enhances the quality.","Paul Grigel","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you, and that does conclude today\u2019s Q&A session. I\u2019d like to turn the conference back over to Tim Leach for closing remarks.","Tim Leach","Thank you. Those were great questions, and again I was really proud of both the year and the quarter\u2019s performance of the company, so it\u2019s fun for us to talk about things like that. I appreciate your interest in our company and look forward to talking to you again next quarter. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today\u2019s conference. This does conclude the program and you may now disconnect. Everyone have a great day."],"5954":["Concho Resources (NYSE:CXO) Q3 2013 Earnings Call November  7, 2013 10:00 AM ET","Executives","L.

Please proceed, sir.","L. Price Moncrief","Good morning. Thank you for joining Concho's third quarter conference call. I'd like to take a minute to direct your attention to the forward-looking statements disclaimer contained in the press release.","In summary, it says that statements in last night's press release and on this conference call, regarding the company's or management's expectations or predictions of the future are forward-looking statements intended to be covered by the Safe Harbor provisions under federal securities laws. There are many factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations, including those we described in the press release, our 10-K and other filings with the SEC.","In addition, we will reference certain non-GAAP measures, so please see the reconciliations in our earnings release.","On today's call, I'm joined by Tim Leach, our Chairman, President and CEO.","Before we get started, I'd like to point out that in addition to our earnings release, we have posted a slide deck to accompany this conference call, which can be found on our website at concho.com.","On the agenda today, Tim will cover our third quarter results and highlights, provide an operations update, and discuss our 2014 capital budget and accelerated growth plan. Members of our management team will be available at the end of the call for Q&A.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Tim.","Timothy A. Leach","Good morning. Both the management team and I are higher very excited to finally have an opportunity to provide some details around our plans to accelerate our growth and maximize our value for our stockholders. Before I do that, I'd ask you to follow along on the earnings call presentation starting on Slide 3.","The third quarter was an excellent quarter for Concho across the board. Our quarterly EBITDAX was the highest in the company's history at nearly $460 million, growing 7% over the previous quarter. Our growth in cash flow is due in large part to the ongoing growth of our oil-weighted production volumes. We averaged just under 95,000 Boes per day, representing 5% growth over the previous quarter and 19% over the third quarter of last year. As we look to the end of the year, we are tightening our full year '13 production guidance to 33.5 million to 34 million Boes, and expect our crude oil mix to settle just above 62%.","Our growth in crude oil over the last 4 quarters has driven our expansion in our cash margin and a reduction to our leverage ratio. That trend is reflective of our continued execution success across the Permian. We continue to deliver excellent results in the northern Delaware Basin, and we're making good progress with our horizontal programs, in both the southern Delaware and Midland Basins. It's hard to ignore all the momentum. Our success on our properties, combined with our financial strengths suggest that we have the capability and the capacity to increase our growth rate. So later on this call, I'll outline our plans to double our production by 2016, beginning with an accelerated 2014 capital budget of $2.3 billion.","Let's turn now to Slide 4. One of the most significant highlights from the quarter is our cash margin. On a non-hedge basis, we earned approximately $58 per equivalent barrel. High cash margins drive our plan. As we accelerate, our ability to maximize and reinvest profits will be critical. No one in the Permian is capable of recycling cash as efficiently and as quickly as Concho. We have the highest cash margin and one of the lowest cost structures among all of our Permian peers. What sets us apart is our crude oil-weighted production mix and our focus on keeping costs as low as possible for a growth company.","Let's move over to Slide 5 and begin our operational update with the Delaware Basin. You probably recall the second quarter, when we reported the Delaware grew 37% over the first quarter. That was an impressive accomplishment, but a really tough act to follow, especially, when you consider this asset now accounts for roughly 1\/3 of our total production base. However, during the third quarter, the Delaware Basin did grow 6% over the previous quarter, and 111% over the third quarter of 2012. Much of the recent growth is in response to a strategic shift in our drilling program, which we initiated in 2012 to accelerate development in the Delaware Basin. Over the last 5 quarters, we've nearly doubled our rig count across the Delaware. The production response exceeded our expectations. Total volumes have more than doubled, and importantly, our oil volumes have nearly tripled. Thanks to the oily nature of the multi-zone opportunities throughout the Delaware. As a growth engine for Concho, this asset feature prominently in our future capital programs. And given the depth of opportunities that we know exist today and the potential to identify new opportunities in the future, we're jump-starting the next acceleration phase right now.","During the fourth quarter, we're increasing our capital budget by $185 million to drill 23 additional Delaware Basin operated wells, approximately 15% more than we originally planned for the entire year, and exit '13 with 16 horizontal rigs in the Delaware. Obviously, it's too late in the year to see the production benefit in '13. However, we've added capital -- the added capital dollars will go a long way in testing several concepts. We scheduled multiple extended laterals in both the Northern and Southern Delaware, and we'll spud another dual lateral in our Alaska area. We will test more of our Pecos County acreage in the Southern Delaware, and continue our early delineation work of the third Bone Spring in the State Line area. The combination of these concepts and others are part of an effort to expand our resource delineation.","Let's move on to Slide 6 and drill down on some of the recent developments in the Northern Delaware Basin, which is our most active area. This is a new slide and it illustrates just how busy we've been for nearly 3 years. Since 2011, Concho has drilled and completed 211 wells targeting 6 zones. The map provides an excellent visual of where each well is located and is also color-coded by zone. There's lots of talk about multi-zone potential across the Permian, but nowhere is it more real than right here in the Northern Delaware. As you can see from the table, we're having great success in every zone that we've tested, including all 3 Bone Spring horizons. The metrics and averages on the table don't represent a select few wells in each zone, they represent every well in each stone. Beyond our drilling success to date, the good news is that we are still very early in the effort to fully identify the multi-zone opportunity across our properties.","An example of our current multi-zone work is with the Brushy Canyon, which is not featured in our current inventory count. We'll continue to dedicate a rig to the Brushy Canyon to the end of the year, and should have a total of 8 wells spudded or completed. In addition to the 2 Brushy Canyon wells highlighted on the table, we recently brought on 2 new Brushy Canyon wells in the fourth quarter with an average 30-day rate of 696 Boes per day, 84% oil and an average peak 24-hour rate of 935 Boes per day.","Another recent development here is the addition of the Delaware Ranch acreage. 30,000 net acres in Northern Culberson County in our State Line area. We recently leased this acreage and are currently completing our first well there. Much of our recent success has occurred in this State Line area, primarily in New Mexico and partially in Texas. But there's been very little development around our Delaware Ranch property. However -- and I know I'm breaking form here, we just brought online the best well we have ever drilled and it might be -- even be the best in the Permian Basin in modern history. It's in our State Line area, just east of the Delaware ranch. This particular well is in the second Bone Spring and had a peak 24-hour rate of over 4,500 Boes per day. After 20 days, it's still making over 3,700 Boes per day. This well has a 4600-foot lateral and cost $6.8 million. It's likely to make 1 million Boes and should pay-out in less than 6 months.","I'm telling you this because the flow of information is such that you probably are going to hear about it anyway and soon. I would caution you not to draw sweeping analogues across the entire Delaware Basin. Instead, it serves as an example of just how far we've come in understanding the productive extent and opportunity of the Northern Delaware. Success like this requires a massive technical effort and I have no doubt that Concho has the most talented technical team in the Permian.","Clearly, our activity level in the Northern Delaware Basin is very high and as you can see on Slide 7, our results a very consistent. The average 30-day rate on all 211 wells is 744 Boes per day, 68% of well. And the average 24-hour peak rate is 1,240 Boes per day. The 27 new wells that we added during the third quarter performed above average and in line with some of our best quarters to date. You'll notice on this slide that our average lateral length has not changed, roughly, 4,000 to 4,500 feet. So when we think about potential value and growth leverage going forward, you'll likely see us drill more extended laterals in the near future.","Another area of great focus for us is the Southern Delaware Basin. On Slide 8, you can see that we have been very active with over 25 horizontal spuds, and we now have 15 wells with 30-day rates. Last quarter, we provided an update on average rates, which looked very good. I'm not going to add any new information for you today for competitive reasons. But I want you to know that our returns are as good as other key assets in our portfolio and justify greater activity and capital allocation. We have a distinct competitive advantage in the Southern Delaware, and as this play evolves, we need to strike the right balance between public disclosure and strategic objectives. And at the appropriate time, we'll provide a more robust update on well results, development strategy and delineation efforts.","Just a quick update on the Midland Basin on Slide 9. We're advancing our understanding of the horizontal opportunity across our acreage in the western portion of the basin. While we will continue our legacy vertical Wolfberry program, the horizontal upside provides a distinct opportunity to maximize capital efficiency and returns. With only 7 wells recording at least 30 days of production data, we still have a ways to go. However, we do have another 10 wells coming on soon, including our first Andrews County well that's currently completing. In the near term, we will test other Wolfcamp zones, as well as the Spraberry, and are beginning to move toward extended laterals.","It's obvious that we have much to be excited about, so now I'd like to turn to Slide 10, and describe the factors that are driving our decision to launch a 3-year acceleration plan. Strategically, we have a significant flexibility in how we choose to execute our business. That flexibility is a direct result of the success across our assets in both the Delaware and Midland Basins. The performance of our assets and the depth of our inventory suggests that we can increase our growth rate. Combined with a strong balance sheet, robust cash margin and compelling economics, we couldn't be in a better position than we are today to accelerate growth.","I've said this before and I can't stress enough that horizontal drilling has changed the game in the Permian. Those with big drilling programs and talented technical teams are going to succeed over the long term. We have built a company capable of running a big scalable development machine, and we have proven quarter after quarter that we can execute horizontally across the Permian Basin.","So as we move forward with our accelerated growth plan, let me outline our major execution goals. First, we expect to double our production by 2016. Historically, we have averaged annual organic growth of about 20%. So over the next 3 years, we expect to average around 25% annualized growth of a much larger production base. Secondly, we will continue to pursue measurable operational efficiencies. As we move closer to development mode in many of our growth areas, we will continue to optimize capital efficiencies and cycle times. Next, we expect to reduce our leverage ratio, which we define as debt to trailing EBITDAX. Our robust oil-driven cash flow is expected to grow at the same rapid rate as our production. And given our strong cash margin, that rate of growth should exceed the growth in capital spending, enabling us to meaningfully de-lever and taking our debt adjusted growth metric, well above 20%.","Finally, by accelerating our development, we will also accelerate our understanding of the multi-zone potential of our existing assets, such that I expect to exit 2016 with more inventory on our existing acreage than we have today. Even with all of our success to date, I'm convinced that we're still in the very early innings of resource discovery and optimization on our assets across the Permian.","The first phase of our 3-year acceleration strategy is presented on Slide 11 and details how we plan to allocate our 2014 total capital budget of $2.3 billion. Drilling capital is expected to be $2 billion, with 90% of those dollars directed to horizontal drilling, up from roughly 66% of our '13 budget. This capital program is noticeably different from prior years in several ways. First, we typically have front-end loaded our budget early in the year, just like we've done in '13. This enables us to realize more of the production impact in the same capital cycle. As you can see in the quarterly rig count graph at the bottom left of the slide, in '14, we will steadily increase our rig count each quarter and spend progressively more capital each quarter. This will effectively push out more of our volume growth into the -- to later in the year and even until '15. Another difference in this capital program over previous years is that we have typically targeted a budget that largely resembles our annual cash flow.","Assuming commodity prices of $90 oil and $4 natural gas, we will moderately outspend our cash flow and will fund that outspend with our balance sheet and still have ample liquidity. Importantly, our debt-to-EBITDAX ratio each quarter in '14 is expected to stay at or below the current level, given the strength of our margins and rapid growth of our cash flow.","The last significant distinction of this capital budget relative to others is the allocation. The Delaware Basin is our highest growth asset and we plan to spend 70% of our drilling capital on projects in both the Northern and Southern Delaware. Almost all of which will be horizontal. In terms of total dollars, that's about twice the amount we're spending in the Delaware in '13. From a rig count standpoint, we averaged 13 horizontal rigs in the Delaware Basin last quarter and will roughly double that count by the fourth quarter of '14. The Midland Basin will be our second most active area, with roughly 1\/4 of our drilling capital. The majority of those dollars will go towards our horizontal Wolfberry program.","Finally, we're allocating less than 10% of our budget to the shelf. While the midstream infrastructure situation is improving, we're still looking for material relief and we'll continue to evaluate opportunities to allocate more dollars to the shelf in the future.","Finally, a potential variable in our '14 capital program is the speed in which we're able to ramp-up and drill all 600-plus of our planned gross locations. Our '14 program is ambitious, but it's achievable. We're becoming more efficient and moving more quickly with each well we drill. In the context of a 3-year acceleration program, we may choose to do more over the course of '14, if we find ourselves realizing greater efficiencies, assuming well performance, service cost and commodity prices stay on track.","Now that you have a sense for how we plan to deploy our capital, let's go to Slide 12 and review our growth expectations for '14 and beyond. Depending on '13 full year volumes, we expect to grow 18% to 22% in '14. As I mentioned before, much of our volume growth will pick up toward the end of the year and carry us into '15 '16. But over the course of the 3-year program, we're looking for annual production growth to average 25%, which will double 2016's production over '13 on a Boe basis.","Given the oily nature of our inventory, we do expect our oil volumes to grow at even a higher rate over the same 3-year period, pushing our oil mix from 62% today, up to 66% in '16. As our cash flow growth really starts to ramp-up in '15 and '16, we see our debt-to-EBITDAX leverage multiple dropping below 1.5x in the $90 oil and $4 gas environment.","We're also going to try something a little different next year with respect to guidance. Beginning on our next earnings conference call in February, we're going to provide quarterly volume guidance for the next quarter. Against the backdrop of a long-term plan, we believe it's in everyone's best interest to provide near-term visibility. This is a really exciting time for Concho. We have the perfect combination of an opportunity rich asset base, unmatched profitability, a strong balance sheet and one of the industry's most dynamic and scalable drilling platforms. We are well positioned to do more and increase our rate of growth, but while doubling production is an outstanding result, I'm even more excited about the strategic implications of a distinguishing Concho, as a leading Permian Basin operator and the opportunities that we will have beyond 2016.","So with that, I appreciate your continued interest in Concho. I look forward to taking your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of John Freeman, Raymond James.","John Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","The first question I had in regards to the robust 3-year growth plan, and I appreciate, Tim, that you have alluded to the fact that the production ramp will be quite a bit back end-weighted in '14, but maybe if you could just take it one step further to help us kind of connect the dots between the '14 to where you're going to end in '16. When I think about 2015, in terms of the rig count, I know in the past you've talked about maybe the ability to double the Delaware Basin rig count, so should I assume in '15, you kind of keep stepping up that rig count by a rig or 2 each quarter, maybe kind of the shape of what '15 kind of looks like?","Timothy A. Leach","Yes, John, good morning. Yes. The rig count looks like -- in '14 we're going to average in the mid 30s for rigs, that's in '14 and '15, we'll average in the mid 40s, and in '16, we'll be averaging in the mid 50s. And so from a ramp-up in production, it's pretty ratable after '15. So we're going to grow the rates I've talked about in '14, or that 18% to 22%, and then you start hitting kind of a 30% growth rate in '15 and beyond.","John Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","That's perfect. And then, looking at this record Permian well that you all drilled in the second Bone Spring, I mean, it appears based on at least what you said in terms of the lateral length and what you did, it wasn't terribly different from what you've been doing in the second Bone Spring yet. The well was 3.5x larger than your average. So I just -- I mean, anything else you see? Is it just purely the rock or was there anything else that you think you might have done?","Timothy A. Leach","Yes. We're continuing to improve our completions. So I think the rate that well is exhibiting is a function of a really good completion technique.","John Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","And then, just the last question from me, I'll turn it over to somebody else. I know last quarter, Joe, you had mentioned that about 20% of what you're doing in the North were these extended length laterals. And, I guess, I'm just -- I was a little bit surprised that it's still not showing up in terms of the average lateral length getting bigger, I mean, it really, basically hadn't changed over the last year, I'm just kind of trying to get a sense of, maybe, when we start to see more and more of those extended length laterals start to show up?","E. Joseph Wright","I think that -- yes, John, this is Joe. From a land standpoint, it takes us a little bit. But they're coming and we're getting longer laterals all the time. And I think our budget for next year, almost over 1\/3 is going to be long laterals.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Scott Hanold, RBC Capital Markets.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And so, just a little bit more on that record growth, I could needle in a little bit more, a couple things: One, for us data junkies like myself, do you have a well name on that, so we can kind of plot it on the map, just visually? And the second thing is, you mentioned that it was just a good completion, specifically, was there anything different that you did with that in terms of like how you completed it, like was it a bigger frac job in the different types of proppant or is it just experience?","Timothy A. Leach","Yes. We're not going to identify the exact location of that well. It is on the Texas side of the state line. And that well had more sand in it than our average -- the completion had more sand in it.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay, fair enough. And then, when you look at your accelerate plan, obviously, with all the growth that's happened in the Permian Basin, big pipe infrastructure, we see it's build up, but what about the -- more towards a field level? Is there going to be some infrastructure constraint that you're already planning into '14 as you provide this kind of ramped activity level?","Timothy A. Leach","Well, not really. I'd say the only infrastructure constraint that we're struggling with is on the Shelf in the New Mexico from a gas takeaway standpoint. That's not really a takeaway constraint, as it is kind of, a processing problem right now. We think that's going to be alleviated in the near term, and -- but, other -- I think that the infrastructure and the growth of the infrastructure is going to keep up with our drilling. So we don't have any planned outages or anything.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay, fair enough. And then, one last one, if I might, on that acreage acquisition. It seems it's pretty hard to buy good acreage for at a reasonable price in the Permian today. Can you give us a sense of, kind of, the range of price you paid and how that deal got done? I mean, it seems pretty competitive out there, and how was it negotiated? Can you give a little more color on that?","Timothy A. Leach","I'll give you a little color. It was negotiated, and I think, we had an advantage because we are a preferred operator.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Anything on cost that you'd willing to give?","Timothy A. Leach","No. That's -- no, I will keep that to myself.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of David Tameron, Wells Fargo.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","If I look at the Southern Delaware, I know, you said for competitive reasons, you're keeping it tight, but the bullet point you put in here about the new wells are performing. It looks like better than the prior 11. Can you talk about how the first 11 are holding up, as far as the type curve or are you taking to that curve or are they beating the curve, where we are in that process? And then, one other question I had, you said you're going to average 6 rigs here, is a limiting factor just the infrastructure out here? Why you don't go higher on that allocation? Can you just talk about those 2 things?","Timothy A. Leach","Yes. The wells are performing in line or above our expectations. So we feel really good about it and you can tell that by the fact that we're allocating a lot more capital there next year. The rate of growth that we see down there is affected by a couple of things. It is a new area for us, so we are -- we've got a lot of delineation work that we're doing. So that kind of dictates the pace and you're right that the infrastructure, you're kind of in a frontier area, there the infrastructure kind of sets the pace as well.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then, just going back to the Northern Delaware, it's obviously, there's a lot of talks out there about efficiencies and optimization, et cetera. Can you talk about where you're on that process? I know a year ago, you were drilling -- drilling wells, still figuring out the right place land laterals, et cetera, can you just talk about where you're at, as far as efficiencies, and how much more downside do you think you can squeeze out of the cost out there?","Timothy A. Leach","Yes. Well. We're expecting more efficiencies in this acceleration plan we have over the next 3 years. So we think there will be material, just from what we're seeing today. And I'd say on top of that, I think, what you're going to see from us and others as we get into more of a development mode over the next 3 years, you're going to see more and more pad drilling and other types of techniques that are going to drive the cost down. But, I will tell you, and you know this that, this is a very, very capital intensive operation. So it's -- while there are a lot of efficiencies and we expect the cost efficiency to continue to improve, this is a game, where scale is really important. And, so I think, that's one of the things I'm most excited about, when I think about a future is this execution machine that we are building and have built here.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Do you care to take a shot at -- is that a 10% efficiency you'd expect to see next year? Or care to give us a range?","Timothy A. Leach","Oh, that's probably an okay range for next year. But, I think in years beyond that, you can improve on that.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then, just one follow-up question about the 3-year plan, I mean, I'm not very good at math, but obviously, if you're doing 20% next year and then you're pegging at 25% CAGR for the 3-year.","Timothy A. Leach","Right.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Should we think about a linear ramp? '15, if you continue to see the same step-up in rigs like you show on '14? And then, are you leveling now, is it at a 50-ish, 55 rig type number in 2016? Or how should we...","Timothy A. Leach","Well. That's what you get in 2016. And by 2016, the cash flow of all this operation really catches up with what you've done. So you're generating a tremendous amount of cash flow as you exit 2016. And then, as I said on the call, we're talking about kind of the midpoint is 20% growth through '14. But then you go kind of in the 30% range for '15 and '16.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay, so -- in 2015, are you showing free cash flow excess -- free cash flow above capital in your model?","Timothy A. Leach","Yes. And as you know, that's not going to happen. We're going to find something to invest it in, so that's just kind of demonstrates the strength of what we're drilling.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Ryan Oatman, SunTrust.","Ryan Oatman - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","I wanted to talk a little bit about the well cost in the Northern Delaware Basin. You mentioned a $6.8 million cost for this second Bone Spring well. How does that compare with your typical cost out there?","E. Joseph Wright","Yes. Typically our cost on that second Bone Spring in that area is about $6.3 million to $6.4 million. And we did a few things a little different, as Tim mentioned, on our stimulation. So there's a little extra cost there.","Ryan Oatman - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","With regards to the New Mexico Shelf, can you discuss what's currently curtailed? And when you expect that production back?","Timothy A. Leach","Well, on the shelf, we're still -- we think for the full year that we probably have the curtailment effect of about 600,000 Boes, and we expect to kind of be fully back online by the end of the year, maybe the first quarter of next year.","Ryan Oatman - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then, one final one for me, the Northern Delaware Basin, the lateral length is already mentioned, if kind of stayed in that 4,000 to 4500-foot range to date. You mentioned those moving longer into 2014 and 2015, can you quantify kind of how you anticipate that program evolving towards the longer laterals? And then, what sort of cost you're anticipating for these long laterals wells? And I'll leave it at that.","E. Joseph Wright","You're specifically talking about the North Delaware Basin?","Ryan Oatman - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Yes, sir.","E. Joseph Wright","Yes, I think the -- as you think about those costs, as you increase the lateral length, I think, they're going to run somewhere in that -- for that state line area, I think somewhere around $7 million, $7.5 million. I think I misquoted you a while ago. On a normal link, lateral is down the state line. At those rates, these are really about $5.2 million, $5.3 million. I think I said $6 million, so I apologize. If you'd look at the longer laterals, you're adding a couple of million dollars to that.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Pearce Hammond, Simmons & Company.","Pearce W. Hammond - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Tim, in the history of Concho, you've had tremendous success with bolt-on acquisitions like Marbob, Three Rivers, et cetera. Now with the acceleration plan being the primary focus of the company to double production, do you think that signifies a turn away from the bolt-on acquisitions in the past? And do you have enough inventory at this point to really push the drill bit and get the drilling machine going? Or do you see consolidation as part of that strategy?","Timothy A. Leach","Well, I think our base business has never been in better shape. So when I think about how we've done things in the past, I think this organic growth through the drill bit, higher rates of return and higher value creation is better than it's ever been. So that raises the bar on the acquisition -- the bolt-on acquisitions side of our business. We do have a tremendous amount of inventory. So having said all that, I will tell you, both parts of our business, we're still very active in. Everything that's moving in the Permian Basin, we're taking a look at. We're very picky. We're very selective about our core areas and things like that. Clearly, the plan I laid out for you on our accelerated growth, we're doing it with our own balance sheet, and we think our balance sheet will continue to be very strong. And we're not issuing any equity around that. On the other hand, these bolt-on acquisitions and the consolidation opportunities, if the right one comes along, we wouldn't hesitate from pulling the trigger on it because I think we have a big advantage on our ability to execute. And if we pull the trigger on it and if it was of any material size at all, it have to include some portion of equity to keep our balance sheet strong.","Pearce W. Hammond - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","My follow-up is what are your thoughts on the Midland-to-Cushing differentials as you looked at putting out your '14 guidance that widened a little bit here recently?","Timothy A. Leach","Yes, they kind of returned to historic levels for a while and then widened back out a little bit. The market has developed now that we can hedge all that, and we have hedges in place for all the barrels that we have hedged in '14. So -- and I think we've put out information on what the Midland-to-Cushing hedge number is. I think it's around $1 somewhere. So we'll continue to do that. We'll continue to hedge that differential. I do think, as we've talked in past quarters, as these pipelines have come on to move the Permian crudes straight to the Gulf Coast, I think our pricing will improve. It has improved. The differentials we're receiving on the crude oil we sell seem to have gotten better. But I still think that it's going to be a bumpy road in terms of -- if a refinery goes down or a fractionation goes down or something like that, you're going to see blips, I think, in all those differentials. But we're going to be pretty aggressive on hedging those things.","Pearce W. Hammond - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Great. And then just one last one for me, over in the Midland Basin, are your lateral links constrained because of legacy high density vertical drilling which has occurred there?","Timothy A. Leach","No. I mean, it may be constrained because of lease constraints, but it's not constrained because of the vertical drilling. And I think you'll see just as much extended link lateral in the Midland Basin as you do over in the Delaware.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Ryan Todd, Deutsche Bank.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","A quick question. You've alluded to the fact that you'll provide more clarity in this area in the future, but any way you can find in kind of a ballpark range about how you think about CapEx in 2015, '16? I mean, we can back into it from some of your comments, but I guess maybe any help there in terms of how much more efficient you think you can get would be helpful.","Timothy A. Leach","I didn't understand the first part. You're talking about one specific area or our total capital budget.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Oh no, the total capital budget for '15 and '16.","Timothy A. Leach","Yes, yes. So we're talking about $2.3 billion in '14. And I think, nominally, if you look out in '15 and '16, we're like at $2.5 billion and $2.6 billion -- I'm sorry, $2.6 billion or $2.7 billion for '15 and '16.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And the -- I guess if we look at the Delaware ranch acquisition that you did, it looks -- from a targeting point of view, is that primarily focused on the second Bone Springs, Wolfcamp, same targets as generally what you see in the other side of the line?","Timothy A. Leach","That's true, and I mentioned delineation work in the third Bone Spring as well. And Avalon is also a target out there.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then it looks -- I mean, maybe it just looks this way in the picture. It looks like a checkerboard. Is there an opportunity to fill in that checkerboard at some point? And is it going to be lateral?","Timothy A. Leach","As you'd probably know that in that country, most of your checkerboarded partner is our friends at Chevron.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Right. And I would assume you're in conversations with them?","Timothy A. Leach","We've -- they've been great partners of ours in other areas of the Permian Basin.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then in the South, I know you've mentioned at times in the past, you'd like to be quite a bit bigger acreage-wise in the South. I mean, is that still the plan? Any idea on how much acreage you'll eventually like to have down there? And are you seeing much in the way of opportunities?","Timothy A. Leach","I don't have any specific plans to talk about right now. And because it's mostly in the hands of independents down there, there's all kind of opportunities.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. That's good. And then I guess, one final one, the Brushy Canyon, how much will that figure into your 2014 development plans?","Timothy A. Leach","I don't think we have the number around here somewhere.","E. Joseph Wright","Drilling 11 wells, is that right?","Timothy A. Leach","Yes, right now we've scheduled 11 wells for '14, but that could go up.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Matt Portillo.","Matthew Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Just a few quick questions for me. In regards to the Midland program, the 9 rigs you're planning on running, will any of those rigs be on your Glasscock or your Irion acreage?","Timothy A. Leach","We're not drilling horizontally in those areas.","Matthew Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Okay, perfect. And as you guys look at that part of your acreage position versus the rest of your Upton and Midland acreage, is that potentially something that could be divested over time?","Timothy A. Leach","We don't have any plans to sell it today. In fact, I think it probably will be valuable acreage in the future.","Matthew Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Great. And then just around the completions, I know you guys have talked about extending the lateral link. I also was wondering if you've started to test some of the tighter spacing between the stages and kind of where you guys are today in the stage spacing and where you may move to over time.","Timothy A. Leach","I'm going to give you several different answers to that question. I'm -- generally, we're in the early innings of delineation. So I've heard someone around here say, \"We're not down-spacing yet, we're still spacing.\" And now I think we're in the process of developing plans to test different spacing options in areas where we've got the most data and the highest confidence of repeatability that we've got the delineation completed. So you'll see us start to roll stuff out like that. And today, when we think about spacing these horizontals and when we talk to you about location counts, generally, we're still in the 4 laterals per section. So it implies 1,200 feet or so between laterals. And I think that's probably real conservative across the Permian Basin, but that's just where we are right now in the early innings.","Matthew Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then my last question, just in regards to, I guess, your stage count, how many stages you're doing per well on you shorter lateral wells. Where do you guys stand today in terms of the number of stages? And do you see some opportunity to potentially increase your stage count over time?","Timothy A. Leach","Yes, that's changing rapidly right now. And I think we're going to kind of keep that information to ourselves.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Brian Singer, Goldman Sachs.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","On the acceleration, you've always been a major Midland or the major Midland operator. But at times, we've certainly seen cost inflation. And at times, we've seen a tougher environment to find people. I'm wondering if you could just comment on whether you think as you begin the acceleration process here to a greater-than-20% type growth number, whether you feel like you have the people, infrastructure, all at hand or whether there are still items that are on the critical path and what that may be.","Timothy A. Leach","Yes. Well, one of the good things about our company right now is we got the high of 45 rigs or so back in '12. And so we have the infrastructure and the people in Concho that can do that kind of work. The other thing is as you transition from vertical drilling to horizontal drilling, it seems like the cycle times and the capital efficiency is greater. So you can get more done with fewer people in general throughout the industry. So I think there's going to be some efficiencies that help our industry. Now having said all that, I do think this acceleration program, part of what's driving this for me is, strategically, I want to be the first company that really is running 50 rigs and doing a really good job of doing that. And to get to that point over the next 3 years, we will be adding horizontal drilling personnel and geoscience personnel and things like that to help support a bigger machine.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","That's helpful. And then secondly, on the Brushy Canyon zone specifically, I was wondering if you can add a little bit more color on your thoughts there? On Slide 6 of your presentation, you talk about 2 recent wells that have 30-day rates of almost 700 Boe a day. And it seems like that might be incremental up to the 2 wells to the right of that. But I'm just wondering if you could just maybe add some more color on how widespread you think that zone could be given that it's looking pretty oily?","Timothy A. Leach","Yes. Well, the economics on that are really pretty good. The rates are high. The costs are low because the zone's shallow. And I think the whole question is how extensive is that -- I mean, the zone is extensive. It's going to be a question of how the rock changes over the entire area of the Delaware Basin. And that's why we're going to drill some more wells there. It's -- by the work we're doing deeper, all that stuff will be held by the deeper work we're doing. We get to look at it as we drill through it in all these different areas. So I think it is a substantial upside to what we're doing right now.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Do you have a sense to how many wells you plan to drill there over the next year? Or what the level of commitment is?","Timothy A. Leach","Let's see. Hold on a second.","E. Joseph Wright","11.","Timothy A. Leach","Yes, it was 11, 11 Brushy Canyon wells next year.","E. Joseph Wright","On top of the 8 that we're drilling this year.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Jeb Bachmann for Howard Weil.","Joseph Bachmann - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division","I just want a follow-up on the last question. Looking at the ramp and the rig count over the next 3 years, particularly in '15 and '16, just wondering if you've had preliminary conversations with the rig companies on that ramp or to your comments, Tim, getting a head start of maybe the industry. Do you not think that there's going to be any kind of difficulty getting those rigs when you need them?","Timothy A. Leach","Yes. I don't anticipate we'll have any difficulty getting the rigs when we need them, but you sure don't want to be the company in this industry that's picking up the last rig. And so I think our position, we have a currently running -- a large drilling fleet is going to be a big advantage as we add rigs. That's also why you -- I think a program to add a few rigs every quarter is better than trying to add them all at one time. And so I think the equipment is going to be out there. The other thing that, I think, is hard to anticipate over a 3-year time span is how much more efficient we're going to get. I talked about the rig ramp and how many rigs we're going to need for the next 2 or 3 years. But my real expectation is, as we go through that period of time, we're going to be able to do more with less rigs. These rigs will be moving faster. And so while I'm telling you my estimate today, if I was biased, I'd be biased on the side of I bet we can get more done with fewer rigs.","Joseph Bachmann - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division","Okay, great. And last one for me. Any idea of when you guys might give an update on the total location count across your acreage in both Delaware and the Midland?","Timothy A. Leach","Yes. I think that'll be after the end of the year when we do our fourth quarter, probably, conference call. We'll have brand-new engineering that's been reviewed with all the third parties and all that stuff, and I think we'll come out with a more robust kind of inventory count.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Arun Jayaram, Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Arun Jayaram - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Tim, I was just wondering if you could comment on any feedback you've received from your non-op partners regarding the new program. Obviously, Chevron is one of your biggest partner, but I just wanted to see what kind of feedback you've gotten from your partners.","Timothy A. Leach","Well, the great thing about our acreage position is we don't have that many non-op partners. The ones we do have are all full steam ahead. And Chevron and Apache are probably our biggest non-op partners.","Arun Jayaram - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And just my follow-up, Tim, as you think about -- I know your team has put a lot of effort and analytical and spreadsheet time on this new forecast and activity levels. I just wanted to see where you think the biggest risk in terms of you guys getting to this lofty growth target is?","Timothy A. Leach","Yes. Well, I think that -- I'm really focused on my debt metric. I think we're going to be able to delever at the same time we accelerate, which I think is an incredible thing. But a lot of it's driven by commodity prices. And so I do not want my debt metric to go up. And so I think that's the -- these projects are real robust. Our cash margins are high. We can stand some price volatility. But as always, in this business, commodity prices are probably the biggest swing factor and how fast you work.","Arun Jayaram - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Got you. And just a one follow up just regarding the CapEx, $2.3 billion next year, maybe going to $2.7 billion, $2.8 billion the following couple of years. What drives the fact that CapEx doesn't go up as much, but you get a lot more production growth? Just wanted to get some thoughts on maybe your assumptions around those efficiency gains.","Timothy A. Leach","Yes. I think one thing that's -- the performance of horizontal wells, timing-wise, is different than vertical wells. It takes longer to drill. And so the ramp looks different over time. And for the first time, we've built this plan around the concept not of financial constraints. We've built this concept around what is the appropriate ramp on our properties with our people and with our rigs. And that's what's driving the activity in '14, '15 and '16.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Irene Haas, Wunderlich Securities.","Mostafa Dahhane - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","Yes, this is actually Mo Dahhane for Irene. Just a quick question, it looks like you guys brought online 4 horizontal Wolfcamp in Culberson County. Is that right?","Timothy A. Leach","We have over a period of time, not necessarily recently this past quarter. If you're referring to the map on Page 6, that represents all of the wells that we've drilled over -- almost nearly 3 years here.","Mostafa Dahhane - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","Okay. Can you talk a little bit about these 4 wells in Culberson County in terms of how similar they are to Reeves County Wolfcamp wells?","Matthew G. Hyde","Sure. I think we've commented on those. This is Matt Hyde, by the way. We commented on those previously, and we actually have our rate information there on the bottom of Slide 6, where you see the collective effort, if you will, around 11 wells and the associated rights.","Mostafa Dahhane - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","Okay. And so a second question, over at Midland Basin, do you guys have a breakdown of how many tests you're going to drill into the Spraberry Formation in Wolfcamp D in 2014?","Timothy A. Leach","I don't think we have -- well, in the Wolfcamp D, I don't think we have any more tests planned over there. We will could that climbing, I think. And then on the Spraberry, it's just -- we just have 1 test planned for the Spraberry zone. All the rest of them will be in the upper benches of the Wolfcamp.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of John Nelson, Citigroup.","John C. Nelson - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I wanted to circle back on the earlier comments or questions about midstream capacity. I'm just curious, have you already held discussions with your midstream partners about sort of this accelerated growth plan such that you feel comfortable with the ramp? And I know, historically, Concho has tried to avoid entering into long-term agreements given the industry has pushed to accelerate growth. Is that something we should potentially look to change going forward?","Timothy A. Leach","We have had conversations. We do have confidence around the midstream assets that will be necessary for this ramp. And so like I said, I think the only area that we're going to wait and see before we invest any more capital is up on the shelf with the gas takeaway capacity. I think everything else -- there's projects going on. There's work to be done, but I think all of that will happen at kind of the same pace that we're doing our accelerated development.","John C. Nelson - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And then if I could just follow up to your comments on sort of productivity, and we use the term sort of pad drilling or development drilling. But can you help us think about the number of horizontal rigs that are maybe in '14, being a more development mode? And how that will shift as we get into '15 and '16 such that we can think about the efficiency gains?","Timothy A. Leach","That's a tough one. In terms of -- well, lots of things we're still doing, I wouldn't say are in the real development mode yet. And I think we are just beginning to have areas where you go lay down multiple rigs or multiple wells side-by-side and then frac them together. We still -- up until this very point, we still are doing a lot of our drilling, delineating the entire extent, both vertically and horizontally of all the pays and zones that we have. So I think the -- what you're getting at, the pad drilling and really driving that efficiency is going to start in '14. But I think it's more of a '15 and '16 kind of operation, and I think you'll see continued gains and efficiency over that period of time.","John C. Nelson - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I guess, I would -- for a little color, I mean, would 25% of rigs at year end '14 sound reasonable? Or is that already too high to think about?","Timothy A. Leach","That'd be probably on the high end of the range is what I'm thinking.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Ipsit Mohanty, Canaccord.","Ipsit Mohanty - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","Let's me stick to the Midland Basin and just shoot in a few. Going -- looking at your ramp from 2 rigs in '13 to about an average of 9 in '14, will it just primarily be the Upton County? Are you going to spread out to Midland and Andrews?","Timothy A. Leach","Yes, it's a spreading-out exercise. It'll be Upton, Midland and Andrews. You're right.","Ipsit Mohanty - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","And then just a broader question, you've been kind of the champion in the Delaware, and you've shown this big ramp-up, big plan. How comfortable are you that the Midland Basin part will also kind of go hand-in-hand with the Delaware Basin?","Timothy A. Leach","I'm very comfortable with that notion. And the great thing about our plan is we're going to be ramping up quarter-over-quarter. So you're going to kind of learn as you go here. But I think right now, the plan we've laid out for 3 years is very achievable. We feel very comfortable with it.","Ipsit Mohanty - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","And then my one last, among the average of 7 wells in the Midland basin -- I'm sorry, I'm sticking to that. But in that average of 7 wells, how did your Andrews County well fare in that? Did it -- or was it within the range of what's kind of lower or higher on the range if you care to comment?","Timothy A. Leach","No, we're just still working on that well.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Joe Magner, Macquarie.","Joseph Patrick Magner - Macquarie Research","I just wanted to kind of step back to Q2. Coming out of that release, there's a lot of discussion around 15% to 20% sort of your being base level of production growth within cash flow. The new accelerated plan now requires pretty significant step up in capital spending and somewhat of a lag until we see that inflection point on the ramp-up in growth. Can you just kind of walk through it? I just want to make sure I get a better understanding of what might be holding back the start of that ramp.","Timothy A. Leach","Yes. And I'm glad you asked that question because first, let me say that the 15% to 20% growth within cash flow is still a business plan we could execute. That's very doable. And then when you think about those shifting to more and more rigs and where you invest more and more capital, we described a shift from a front-end loaded capital budget in '13 where you spend most of your capital on the first half of the year to now we're starting to ramp these horizontal rigs in a way that we think is very doable for Concho. But the end effect is most of your capital is going to be invested in the second half of '14. So you're matching up 2 years that have -- '13 was front-end loaded. '14 is going to be back-end loaded. And so the second half of '13 and the first half of '14, of course, you expect to look a little bit different than once you get in steady-state growth after kind of mid-'14. So if you look at exit rates, I think the exit rate for '14 is going to kind of be 25% growth compared to the starting rate of '14, if that helps.","Joseph Patrick Magner - Macquarie Research","Okay, that's helpful. And then I guess to follow on the previous question. Then when you shift into more pad development that has had an impact on cycle times for other folks, how do you think about managing that as you're also trying to hit on these '15 and '16 targets?","Timothy A. Leach","Sure. We don't have the pad drilling shift modeled into this acceleration program. So now I think as you -- and I think the way I would think about it as we transition into that over a long period of time, I think the changes will be incremental. So I think we will be talking about that over time. It takes longer to get those wells drilled, longer to put the production on but you get higher rates and more efficiency and lower cost. I don't think that, that will happen overnight throughout industry, throughout the Permian Basin or at Concho. But I think you'll see that incrementally until one day, when you turn around and most of what we'll be doing is that kind of activity probably. But it's not contemplated in this plan or the efficiencies aren't built into this plan yet.","Joseph Patrick Magner - Macquarie Research","Okay, that's helpful. And then just one on oil prices, the discussion a couple of months back. There was a lot of concern about sensitivity or the volatility in oil prices, and that was somewhat holding you back from being willing to step out and talk about this type of plan. Maybe not this specific acceleration plan, but a type of plan that would require you to outspend. What's changed? It doesn't look like you've layered on much in the way of new hedges. Should we expect that to change or expect any changes in your hedging policy going forward?","Timothy A. Leach","I guess, for me, personally, a year ago, I was more expecting a dramatic decline in oil price, and I didn't want to be accelerating into a dramatically falling oil price. And I don't think I was alone in the industry thinking that. But today, I think there's more confidence around a stable oil price between $80 and $100, and this plan works beautifully between $80 and $100. And we have hedged as much of our PDP as we can. We've pushed it out through 2015. And so that provides us downside protection on some of this drilling program.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Mike Kelly, Global Hunter Securities.","Michael Kelly - Global Hunter Securities, LLC, Research Division","Tim, I was hoping you could really just talk at a very high level about the geological differences between the Northern Delaware Basin and the Midland Basin. And it's really my sense that us finance guys have kind of bought into the narrative that in the Midland Basin because it's more unconventional shaley, that it could take a company's net acreage position divide it by 80 acres spacing and instantaneously have 100 years of drilling inventory. And that same credit is not being given in the Northern Delaware Basin. And I'm just hoping you could speak on that because I think you'd have some opinions there.","E. Joseph Wright","Yes. I hope I'm going to touch on the subjects you want me to touch on. But the Northern Delaware Basin, as far as an opportunity rich environment, is the best I've ever seen. We've drilled 211 wells there now horizontally in 6 different zones. All of them at high rates. All of them have a lot of success. Now when you think of those 6 different zones, they all have a little bit different characteristics. Some of them are shaley. Some of them have more carbonate and sand. Some of them are mudstones from a geologic standpoint. And then from an operational standpoint, there's just been a whole lot more activity in the Northern Delaware. There's more wells. There's more data. There's more success. Also, I'd say, in the Northern Delaware, some of those zones are really oily. Some of them have quite a bit of gas. And the Wolfcamp has more gas up in the North than it does down in the South. It probably has more gas in the North than it does over in the Midland Basin. But the Bone Springs are more conventional reservoirs. They have a high oil content, and they seem to be widespread, which will be equivalent to kind of the Spraberry zones over in the Midland Basin. So I -- the basins are different somewhat. But they have very similar characteristics in the number of zones they have, the oil in place. I just think that the Delaware Basin got started first and probably has had more widespread activity, and we got more information on it, on how it performs horizontally. And it's really driving the company growth, and it's that whole area's production is growing pretty dramatically. And I think the Midland Basin is really just in the very early stages of showing production growth. I hope that answers your question.","Michael Kelly - Global Hunter Securities, LLC, Research Division","Yes. So is it fair to characterize it as its more complex geology in the Northern Delaware Basin, and you're going to have to do a little bit more work on the engineering side and location kind of side versus maybe what you have in the Midland?","Timothy A. Leach","No, I don't think that at all. I think both of them are complex. I think you need good geologic information on both sides. It's just -- it seems like there's been a lot more acreage mass left around in the Midland Basin, and the companies in the Delaware Basin haven't really done that yet. They either haven't talked about it at all, or they haven't talked about it in terms of acreage mass.","Operator","With no further questions, we'll turn the call over to Mr. Tim Leach for closing remarks.","Timothy A. Leach","Yes. Once again, I thank you for participating in this call. I know it's a busy time for you. I hope you can tell by our plan that we're very excited about the -- of what we think we can do with this company, and I look forward to talking to you more about that in the future.

My name is Carolyn and I will be your operator for today. As a reminder, the call is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the call over to Megan Hays, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Ma'am.","Megan P. Hays - Director, Investor Relations, Concho Resources, Inc.","Thank you. Good morning and thank you for joining Concho's fourth quarter conference call. Joining me today in Midland is the Concho senior management team. A few administrative items before we get started this morning. In addition to yesterday's earnings release, we have posted a slide presentation, which can be found on our website at concho.com.","We will make forward-looking statements this morning. Please refer to the forward-looking statement disclaimer contained in our earnings release and on slide two of today's presentation. Also, we will reference certain non-GAAP measures. How we calculate these measures and reconciliations to the comparable GAAP measures are provided in the earnings release and presentation.","Following our prepared remarks, we'll turn the call over for Q&A. Please limit your questions to one plus a follow-up, and then jump back in the queue if you have more questions. With that, I'll turn it over to Tim.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning. Despite the choppy macro environment, 2014 marked another excellent year for our company. Throughout the year, we operated one of the largest horizontal drilling programs in the Permian. We also delivered production, reserves, and cash flow growth for the seventh consecutive year since our IPO. Our success in 2014 reflects the technical capabilities of our team, the quality of our assets and our improving well recoveries. By optimizing our operations, we're not only increasing productivity, but we're enhancing drilling returns and capital efficiency.","Let's start with a review of our fourth quarter on slide four. Fourth quarter production was a record 125,000 Boes per day made up of 66% crude oil. Fourth quarter oil production grew 31% year-over-year and 13% or nearly 10,000 barrels per day quarter-over-quarter. Our horizontal drilling, our horizontal program in the Delaware Basin continues to be our growth engine. In the fourth quarter, horizontal production from the Delaware Basin averaged about 65,000 barrels per day, up 80% year-over-year and up 17% quarter-over-quarter.","Turning now to a review of full-year results on slide five. Operationally, the Concho team delivered on all fronts. We grew total production 22%, hitting our target for the year. Oil volumes increased 25% year-over-year, exceeding our expectations. EBITDAX for 2014 was a record $2 billion, up 21% year-over-year. Capital expenditures for drilling and completion were in line with our annual budget of $2.6 billion, and acquisition capital totaled approximately $390 million.","During 2014, we expanded our core acreage position by about 68,000 net acres with bolt-on opportunities and lease acquisitions. Lastly, we ended the year in a strong financial position with a leverage ratio of 1.7 times debt-to-EBITDAX and a sharp focus on maintaining our financial strength in 2015.","Moving to slide six. Concho's proved reserves increased 27% and proved developed reserves increased 24%, underscoring our ability to consistently convert undeveloped reserves to cash flow. During 2014, we replaced 428% of our production at a finding cost that reflects the capital efficiency of Concho's horizontal development program. The combination of our large drilling program and success from optimized drilling and completion methods drove a 107% increase in our horizontal proved reserves.","At year-end 2014, horizontal proved reserves accounted for nearly 60% of our total proved reserves, reflecting our transition to large scale horizontal development across our assets. With high quality assets in the Delaware Basin, Midland Basin and New Mexico Shelf, we've captured a significant amount of resource with upside to discover new production in reserves and improve well performance by applying new technology.","In 2014, we continued to lead the charge with advanced drilling and completion techniques in the Permian Basin. By refining these techniques and optimizing field operations, we substantially expanded our resource to 3.7 billion barrels. The best example of this is in the Northern Delaware Basin on slide seven.","Our position in the Northern Delaware Basin covers approximately 365,000 gross acres, and we're running 15 horizontal rigs there today. In the fourth quarter, we continued to deliver strong well results from multiple pay zones. The focus for our program for 2015 is advancing completion optimization, further delineating the Wolfcamp and downspacing test in the Avalon shale and the 2nd Bone Spring.","We acquired a substantial portion of our Northern Delaware Basin assets in 2010. Since then, we've completed almost 400 horizontal wells as shown on slide eight. As we execute our horizontal program, we're constantly improving our geologic understanding and refining our lateral placement and completion methods to maximize recoverable reserves.","Based on our well results, we've identified close to 10,000 drilling locations, targeting six pay zones. And we believe there's upside potential from reducing the spacing between wells and optimizing our completion design for each of these zones. This is a starting point; capturing, defining, and de-risking the resource. Our engineers and geologists then leverage the data we gather from hundreds of wells we've drilled to improve recoveries and reduce cost.","Turning to slide nine, since launching our Northern Delaware Basin horizontal program in earnest in 2011, our well results have improved each year. During 2014, average 30-day productivity increased 18% compared with 13%, and we're controlling cost while we're doing more. Year-over-year well cost per treated lateral foot was flat while our completion intensity increased.","On slide 10, we illustrate the key advancements on our completion techniques targeting the 2nd Bone Spring in the Northern Delaware Basin. Here, we're enhancing our completions by using more proppant. The updated production plot includes recent well results and continues to show a significant increase in productivity. Before factoring in lower service cost, these wells generate a 50% to 60% rate of return at $60 oil. We're starting to see service cost adjust to the commodity price which further supports project returns.","With a 20% reduction in cost at $60 oil, the rate of return for enhanced completions in the 2nd Bone Spring are comparable to the returns we generate at $85 oil. These efficiencies will help Concho continue to build long term value for our shareholders, even at lower commodity prices.","Turning now to slide 11, in the Southern Delaware Basin, we're running six horizontal rigs. Today, we continue to lead development in the region with a focus on drilling longer laterals. For the 11 wells added in the fourth quarter, our average lateral length set a new record for the company at 6,700 feet. The average peak 30-day rate for these wells was 1,271 barrels per day. The average 24-hour rate was 1,590 barrels per day.","It's early in our program but we're encouraged by our results in the play so far. This is a target-rich setting with considerable oil in place where we can transfer our success from other core areas to improve well performance. As a result, we continued to add to our core acreage position in 2014 and believe we'll see more opportunities to further scale our acreage position in the Southern Delaware Basin.","Turning to the Midland Basin, on slide 12, our core covers approximately 200,000 acres, and we're currently running three horizontal rigs. We're in the early stages of applying enhanced completion methods in the Midland Basin, but we've made good progress. During the quarter, we added 15 horizontal wells with an average peak 30-day rate of 846 barrels per day and an average 24-hour rate of 1,077 barrels per day. We're also optimizing our lateral length in the Midland Basin. And as a result, the average lateral length for our horizontal Wolfcamp and Spraberry inventory increased 20% year-over-year. Advancing our horizontal program to development mode and delineating additional zones are the primary objectives for 2015.","Our assets on the New Mexico Shelf are still delivering impressive results. We're running two horizontal rigs here. In the fourth quarter, we added 13 new horizontal wells with an average peak 30-day rate of 408 barrels per day and an average 24-hour rate of 585 barrels per day with average well cost ranging from $3 million to $4 million. With over 1,500 horizontal locations, this asset is the gift that keeps on giving. The focus for the year ahead is development drilling while continuing to optimize our completions.","Let's turn now to our plans for the year ahead on the next slide. We're starting 2015 with a great deal of momentum but since we last spoke in November, we've reduced our capital program from $3 billion to $2 billion due to the sharp decline in commodity prices. With this program, we'll grow production 16% to 20% year-over-year while maintaining our commitment to a strong balance sheet.","Concho has a track record of performing well when commodity prices dip and we're in a strong position to navigate the current price cycle. Through our operational strategy, we've avoided long-term contracts and vertical integration and opted to protect our cash flow with a straightforward hedging program. This strategy combined with low-cost operations and the quality of our inventory provides us with additional flexibility to scale the program up or down depending on market conditions.","So I'm encouraged about the year ahead and I believe that we have a unique opportunity to deliver differentiated growth by continuing our focus on proving well productivity across our assets, building value in the current commodity price environment, and strengthening our position in the Permian Basin.","We appreciate your support in 2014 and thank you for participating on this call. Let's go now to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And stand by for your first question which comes from the line of Scott Hanold from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Yes. Looking at the acquisition you all made somewhat recently, can you give us a sense of what the market looks like in the Permian in terms of like bolting on at this point in time? And is it getting easier or harder with oil prices coming down?","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, Scott. The acquisitions we made that we referenced were a bunch of bolt on things that were core assets, or in our core areas. They were also at very attractive prices. So we're seeing more of that. I think that the change in commodity prices and the change in the application of technology and just all the changes we've talked about in our industry are making it a consolidation game. I still think there's a fairly wide bid-ask spread on the things that are out there but from time to time we have an opportunity to pick up things that really enhance our position and we're excited about that.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay, thanks for that. And in terms of drilling within the 2nd Bone Spring, some other operators in the area have discussed an upper member of the 2nd Bone Spring that looks prospective where in theory you could get both a upper and a lower 2nd Bone Spring. Is that something you all have evaluated or will look at this year?","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I hope that we're on the lead of evaluating all the zones in not only the Bone Spring but all the other aspects of the Northern Delaware Basin. We got more data than anybody else, so if you're hearing things out there about new breakthroughs, you can rest assured that we're at the front of that.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Yeah. So, when you'd look at something like that, and obviously you guys haven't explicitly talked about it, but in your 3.7 billion Boe of potential, would that be included in that or could that be additional upside to that optionality?","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. We've got a lot of additional upside into things were described in 3.7 billion.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Appreciate that. Thanks.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes. Yes.","Operator","Thank you for that question. The next question comes from the line of John Freeman from Raymond James.","John A. Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Good morning.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, John.","John A. Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hi. In the Southern Delaware following the additional acreage you picked up, are you all able to provide an update to the previous 800 location count you all had?","Jack F. Harper - Executive Vice President","Hey, John. This is Jack. The location count year-over-year is plus or minus the same. We've added some and taken some off down there.","John A. Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. And then while we're on that same topic of location count, on the Northern Delaware, it looks like the Wolfcamp went up a good bit, Brushy came down a little bit, the rest stayed the same. Can you kind of just \u2013 just any general commentary on the changes on Wolfcamp and Brushy Canyon?","Jack F. Harper - Executive Vice President","I would just say that's a comment on the evolving program and what we know at any given point in time. And I would expect to see that same type of subtle movement year-over-year.","John A. Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. And then just the last one for me. Obviously, you all continue to see big improvements in the production rates across all the basins. Obviously, you all have done a good job demonstrating what's going on with the 2nd Bone Spring, and then Southern Delaware, you had like a 28% increase in your 30-day rate just from what you showed us in the third quarter. And I'm kind of trying to get an idea of when you all anticipate being able to provide updated EUR guidance for the different basins.","Jack F. Harper - Executive Vice President","Yeah. We have historically not given EUR guidance. We've however, like we did in the 2nd Bone Spring, when we have enough information to feel comfortable about giving production guidance out beyond 30 days, we've done that, and that's the same pattern I would expect.","John A. Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. Thanks. Good quarter, guys.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, John.","Operator","Thank you. The next question we have comes from the line of David Tameron from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Yeah. Good morning. Yeah. Congrats, Tim, on a great year.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","If I think about, and I'm going to try to tag on that last question a little bit. If I think about the resource uptick, the implication is the type curves are coming in, and the wells indicate this too, but the type curves are coming in better. I mean can you talk about like year-over-year in your reserve bookings, was there a material uptick? And I know you were not going to give me EUR level. I'm just trying to figure out from that standpoint is that, when we look at the resource base uptick, how much of that's type curve related?","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I'd say that there's two components. It's type-curve related. It's also the breakthroughs we're having with some information on increased density in well placement and things like that, lateral length of the wells we're drilling. And I'd say most of that uptick is better wells.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. So, when I \u2013 I'm going with \u2013 Devon's throwing out 450 plus. And when I chart the history of your wells, it looks like you're tracking to that plus-plus number. Am I off base there?","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think we think we're in some of the better areas in the basin and we drill some of the better wells.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Fair enough. Costs, service costs. Can you talk about what you've budgeted in the 2015 budget? Like what's reflected in that $2 billion reserve, 10%, 15% or what's baked there?","Jack F. Harper - Executive Vice President","Yes, David, we do have some cost saving assumptions in there that we haven't discussed. Where we are today is, we feel comfortable with what we've assumed and maybe even incrementally positive about the changes we're seeing.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Jack, can you talk about what \u2013 can you give us a percentage what you're seeing today already? Do you guys want to do that?","Jack F. Harper - Executive Vice President","Yeah. We're in that 10% to 15% range right now, David.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And we would expect to see more if we stay in this kind of a commodity price environment.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Last question for me. And whoever wants to address this, probably Tim. If you think about, this is the first downtick this industry's really seen since \u2013 you had gas prices ramp, oil prices ramp since. But evolution in the shales, this is the first meaningful extended down period. If you think about the structural changes coming out of this versus prior cycles, do you anticipate anything meaningfully different, do you think? Some people have talked about service costs being indexed to commodity prices. I don't know why service companies would ever do that. But do you see anything meaningfully changing coming out of this from a structural standpoint versus prior cycles?","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, you were with us when we through that last downturn in 2008, 2009.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Yeah.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And we actually got a lot of work done at a lower capital budget. We talked about reducing our capital budget and getting the same number of wells drilled and the same amount of production on. My expectation is that's kind of what's going on here as well. I do think that this kind of down cycle is going to point out the difference in asset quality as you look at the strength of the economics of different companies' programs and things like that. I think the Permian is advantaged. I think that our location within the Permian is advantaged. And I think that the service cost, and some of that is just a reaction to the rig count. But also, I mean what we're trying to point out here is the real capital efficiency of the longer laterals, the more increased intensity on the frac jobs and the cost savings we can get just from the breakthroughs we're having on how we complete our wells.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And what I hear, and maybe I'm reading \u2013 but what I hear is that this all bodes for a longer-term, lower price, right, than what we've seen in the last few years?","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I don't know if anybody can really say what, if it's V shaped or U shaped. I think you have to build a company with the assets and the technology and the people that do well in all these types of environments. And I think service costs will adjust and if we're in a $70 long-term world or a $90 or a $60, whatever, service costs will adjust and the asset quality will dictate where all the returns are going to come from.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. No, I appreciate the color. Thanks.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you for that question. The next question we have comes from the line of Ryan Oatman from SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Ryan Oatman - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Hi. Good morning.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Morning.","Ryan Oatman - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","The cumulative results from the Brushy Canyon, at least by our math, suggest new wells had 30-day rates about 80% above the prior average. Can you confirm if our math's correct and speak to whether that's due to lateral length or efficiency? Just any kind of broad comments on Brushy Canyon.","Jack F. Harper - Executive Vice President","Yeah Ryan. Your math is correct and again, I would caution to get too excited with one quarter's results. But that's the result of all of the above: longer laterals and improved completions.","Ryan Oatman - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Got you. That's helpful. Kind of a nearer term question here. It's been cold here in Houston, many parts of the U.S. as well. I was wondering if you could speak to current weather in the Permian and whether that's reflected in the 1Q guidance, any sort of potential downtime.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","No. We've actually had a pretty good winter out here. It's cold, but we haven't had anything unusual. And the things that we have, the weather interruptions we have we've kind of baked into our guidance and we haven't seen anything unusual.","Ryan Oatman - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Great. That's helpful. Thank you.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question we have comes from the line of Brian Singer from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Brian A. Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. Good morning.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Jack F. Harper - Executive Vice President","Morning.","Brian A. Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Recent equity offerings by other E&Ps would appear to indicate that at least for now, for higher quality companies, the capital markets are open and I was wondering if, when you look for further consolidation opportunities, do you sense that some of the smaller producers that you would want to consolidate are feeling the capital is sufficiently available to them? Or do you see enough distress in the system among smaller producers that Concho had an opportunity to bolster its balance sheet via equity and make accretive, meaningful acquisitions?","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I do think that, as we talked about in the past, that for numerous reasons, the game has changed and it's harder to be a small company today than it has been in the past both from a technology standpoint and from a capital standpoint. And so we talked in the past about how we thought that would drive consolidation. And so I do think Concho is in a good position relative to how people think about our company and our equity and I do think that, while we will remain focused on our balance sheet strength and also the \u2013 making sure that we always have strong core assets that are high-quality assets, that there'll be a great opportunity for us to grow.","Brian A. Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great, thanks. And my follow-up is, can you just give us an update on both the midstream JV and as well, how you're thinking about water disposal needs in the Delaware Basin?","Jack F. Harper - Executive Vice President","Yeah, Brian. The JV that we've described in the past is on that same timeline today. We have an eye towards that being operational by the end of this year. And then in the Delaware Basin in general, it has less infrastructure than other areas but we and industry are doing all the things necessary to make that better and ultimately push the cost structure down.","Brian A. Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. And do you see any issues with fresh water?","Jack F. Harper - Executive Vice President","Not today.","Brian A. Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question we have comes from the line of (24:41) from Simmons & Co. Please go ahead.","Unknown Speaker","Yeah, good morning. Where are your well costs currently across your major areas, the Northern Delaware Basin, Southern Delaware Basin, Northwest Shelf and Midland Basin?","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I'm going to give you general ranges because the lateral lengths are different. It differs by zone. We talked about the strong economics on the New Mexico Shelf where those capital costs run from $3 million to $4 million. But in the Northern Delaware Basin, those wells can range from $5 million to $8 million. In the Southern Delaware Basin they typically range from $8 million to $10 million and then we're seeing in the Midland Basin $7 million to $9 million.","Unknown Speaker","Perfect. Thank you, Tim. And then, at what oil price would you start ramping activity?","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I think we're on a glide path to get back to spend within cash flow by the second half of the year. So the way I would think about is not some magic price that causes us to step on the accelerator. But it's, we're going to estimate our cash flow which has been tricky in the last several quarters just because of all the things that are changing, and then try to identify a prescribed amount of work that we can do with that cash flow. So you'll see us probably have growing cash flow in the second half of the year and into next year.","Unknown Speaker","Great. Thank you, Tim, and congrats on a great year.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you for the question. The next question we have comes from the line of Matt Portillo from EPH (sic) [TPH]. Please go ahead.","Matthew Merrel Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Good morning.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Morning.","Matthew Merrel Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Just two quick questions for me. As we look at your results over the last few quarters, you've posted very strong oil cuts and improvement sequentially. I was curious if this is a function of improving oil cuts at the well level or if it's a function of the wells being brought online in various different areas within your development corridors.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","It's probably, if I understand your question correctly, I think it's a function of where we're locating the wells. And we're drilling more and more, focus in the 2nd Bone Spring. That's very oily. Our Southern Delaware Basin, very oily. So the oil cuts are more of a function of where the capital is being allocated.","Matthew Merrel Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Thank you. And then, just my second follow-up question, in regards to the inventory you've laid out, you run a fairly conservative program in terms of your downspacing assumptions. I was wondering if you could provide some context around some of the initiatives you have ongoing across the portfolio and how that may impact your views on inventory over the medium term.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, well, I specifically referenced the 2nd Bone Spring and the Avalon as areas that we're testing for density and those would be, to me, the logical first places that you would have a better understanding of well spacing.","Matthew Merrel Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Thank you very much.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. The next question we have comes from the line of Michael Hall from Heikkinen Energy Advisors. Please go ahead.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","Thanks. Good morning. I guess a little bit jumping onto the prior question, but any color around the rig schedule this year and how you see that playing out? And then along those lines as well, do you intend to build or draw down on any sort of backlog of the wells waiting on completion?","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Okay. The well schedule, we ended the year running close to 40 rigs. Today, if you added up all the different areas I was talking about, we're about at 29 rigs, and we've communicated that we thought we'd average for the year about 25 rigs. And that ought to give you some idea of how we're dropping rigs. What was the second part of the question?","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","Just if you're building up or drawing down any sort of backlog in wells waiting on completion.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. I mean, I think the way we think about it is trying to run a machine that, to the best of our ability, is efficient and stays running. So, we've communicated before that we thought that the backlog of completions ran about 1.5 to 2 times the number of rigs you have out working, and I think that's what you're going to see from us. We haven't really tried to accelerate or decelerate the completions of any of these wells that we have just drilled.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","That's very helpful. Thanks. And then I guess you all alluded to potential additional cost savings. Depending on how material those are, how do you think about that in terms of allocating that potential excess capital? Would you accelerate or let it accrue to the balance sheet or any thoughts along those lines?","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I think my first thought on it is we have a prescribed amount of work that we're trying to get done so to the extent that we have some cost savings, it would just in the short term be a strengthening of our balance sheet.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","Great. That's helpful. Thank you. Congrats.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you for that question. The next question we have comes from the line of Mike Kelly from Global Hunter Securities.","Michael Dugan Kelly - Global Hunter Securities LLC","Hey, guys. Good morning.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Morning.","Michael Dugan Kelly - Global Hunter Securities LLC","The Northern Delaware showed a bit of a decline in a 30-day rate sequentially. Was just hoping to get some color on that and if there's anything specific to that drove it or that's just (30:27). Thanks.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I think that's just the sample size and the type of wells that were in that mix. And I would point you to the, kind of the annual steady increase in productivity and that's what I would expect to see when you cut in bigger time slices.","Michael Dugan Kelly - Global Hunter Securities LLC","Okay. Fair enough. And the upgraded completion designs obviously paid dividends in the Northern Delaware. Curious if any of these optimizations have been applied in the Southern Delaware to-date.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes, they have and several different types that I'm very excited about and also in the Midland Basin as well. And I would just say that as we get more data around those, we'll be rolling that information out in the future.","Michael Dugan Kelly - Global Hunter Securities LLC","Great. Thanks, guys.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Jason Smith from Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Jason Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Good morning, everyone.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Jason Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So, staying on the Southern Delaware, it looks like the wells in the quarter were fairly spread out throughout your three areas in the play. So, I was just curious if the results were consistent throughout all your acreage, or was one area maybe better than the others. And I guess in particular, I'm curious about how South Harpoon performed.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Well, in this kind of price environment, the differentiation between different areas is made more noticeable. And so, we talked about the North Harpoon and the Big Chief areas giving us really good returns, good well results. Once you cross that county line into Pecos County, you're getting shallower and we have diminished pressure there. So, our drilling has not been as aggressive or as focused in that area, so I would point you to Big Chief and North Harpoon as the areas with the best results.","Jason Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And can you remind us how much, Tim, of your Southern Delaware acreage is amenable to long laterals?","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","All of it.","Jason Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","All of it. Okay. And just one last quick one in terms of HBP requirements this year, are there any acreage that you guys are looking at potentially letting go?","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","We're a company of the size, there's always acreage that's going out and always acreage that's coming in. Generally when you compare us to other companies, a big percentage of our acreage is held by production and relative to our peers. But there's always things that you're evaluating whether you're going to let go, and there's always new acreage we're picking up.","Jason Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thanks, guys, and congrats again.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Next one comes from the line of Jeremy (sic) [Jeffrey] Campbell from Tuohy Brothers Investment Research.","Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Good morning.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Morning.","Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","The 25-rig average that you mentioned for 2015, what's the horizontal and vertical mix within the 25?","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, it's almost all horizontal.","Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Okay. That's what I thought. Your horizontal Yeso results were up significantly quarter-over-quarter. As this program continues to succeed, is it possible that some of the vertical locations that you currently list might be shifted to horizontal locations?","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Oh, yeah. Technically there's probably some locations you'd knock out. But generally the vertical program and the horizontal program are accessing different zones in different ways.","Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Okay. So, there's geological differences that they're addressing.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Oh, it's more lease differences and area differences where you \u2013 vertically, we were picking up five zones in some of those vertical wells and on the horizontal, you're in areas where you might not have all five. But one zone is really productive. It's that kind of thing.","Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Okay. And if I can ask a last one real quick, because I thought it was really interesting. You mentioned that a 20% cost reduction in the Bone Springs at $60 equated to margins that were similar to $85 oil. Would you be willing to increase your activity in those \u2013 to those sorts of margins when you become confident in oil price stability?","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, like I said, I think that generally we're going to guide back toward spend within cash flow. And so, to the extent that we have a strong balance sheet that's able to take advantage of other opportunities, I think we can build a robust and growthy program with our cash flow.","Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Okay. Great. That was a helpful answer. Congratulations on your quarter and the year.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question we have comes from the line of Sven Del Pozzo from IHS. Please go ahead.","Sven A. Del Pozzo - IHS Herold, Inc.","Yeah. Good morning.","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Morning.","Sven A. Del Pozzo - IHS Herold, Inc.","I'd like to know, is there more of a thematic question here with perhaps your exposure to the Bone Spring sands is more amenable to, say, upsize fracs as you call them than shales would be. Do you think that's true? Are you getting better responsiveness out of the sands than you would on the shales which underlying the Bone Spring sand?","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think what I'd emphasize on my answer to that question is just the six different zones. All those zones are different, and they're all applicable to different types of enhancements on the way you design your completion. And as I said in my comments, I think we can make all six zones better.","Sven A. Del Pozzo - IHS Herold, Inc.","So, can you give us any idea where the six zones are? Some of the sands thicker than other ones?","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","It's such a large area that they vary in all those different areas.","Sven A. Del Pozzo - IHS Herold, Inc.","When you look at \u2013 just looking at a map, Eddy and Lea County in the center of it, it looks like it's relatively undrilled relative to the northern part and the states line area. Do you think \u2013 I mean how's that going to get filled in?","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","There's potash mines there so it'll be very slow, and \u2013 it's not oil and gas potential that's making that donut hole.

Or you guys going to be going along with the same distribution of activity across the laterals that you have been running in 2013 and 2014, just at a lower level of activity? In other words, is there any kind of change in the distribution across the zones?","Timothy A. Leach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","As we go to a lower level of activity, you have a higher percentage of your budget that is dedicated to things that are kind of commitments, I would describe them as.

My name is Celia, and I will be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Mr. Price Moncrief, Vice President of Capital Markets and Strategy. Please proceed, sir.","L. Price Moncrief","Good morning. Thank you for joining Concho's fourth quarter conference call. I'd like to take a minute to direct your attention to the disclaimers, including the forward-looking statements disclaimer contained in our press release. In summary, the forward-looking statements disclaimer says that statements in last night\u2019s press release and on this conference call, regarding the companies or management's expectations or predictions of the future, are forward-looking statements intended to be covered by the Safe Harbor provisions under federal securities laws. There are many factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations, including those we described in the press release, our 10-K and our other filings with the SEC. In addition, we will reference certain non-GAAP measures, so please see the reconciliations in our earnings release.","On today's call I'm joined by Tim Leach, our Chairman, President and CEO. Before we get started, I'd like to point out that in addition to earnings release, we have posted a presentation accompanying this conference call, which can be found on our website at concho.com.","On the agenda today, Tim will cover our fourth quarter and year end results and highlights, provide an operations update, and describe our inventory and resource potential. Members of our management team will be available at the end of the call for Q&A.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Tim.","Timothy A. Leach","Good morning. I'm starting on Slide 4 in the presentation. I hope you've had the chance to download it, you can follow along. It's an exciting time for Concho. We're in a unique position of hitting our execution stride just as we're beginning to find the true depth and scale of our resource opportunity that exists across our assets, and 2013 was critical in reaching this point.","We exited the year with a great deal of momentum. We delivered year-over-year production growth of 20% and year-over-year crude oil growth of 25%. In fact, our crude oil volume in the fourth quarter grew 7% over the previous quarter, despite 2 severe winter storms that impacted operators across the Permian. We replaced 266% of our production through the drill bit at an F&D cost below $17 per Boe. After another year of robust drilling activity, we're well underway in an effort to quantify our drilling inventory and resource potential.","Our drilling locations now exceed 22,000, which is nearly twice the locations identified at year end '12. The incremental locations are coming from our highest rate of return horizontal plays in the Delaware and Midland Basins. The depth of our inventory is bolstered by our expansive resource potential which is now over 6x our proved reserves. At over 0.5 billion barrels of proved reserves, we estimate that we have over 3 billion barrels of net recoverable resources potential on our existing assets. Of course, the confidence in our inventory and resource potential is driven largely by the drill bit, and our drilling success continues in the Northern and Southern Delaware Basins, as well as in the Midland Basin. All these assets will feature prominently in our 3-year accelerated growth plan, which is on track to double production by the end of '16. As we move into the first-year of our acceleration plan, it's worth noting growth and execution are nothing new to Concho.","Turning to Slide 5, we've consistently delivered oil growth. It's what we do. In fact, we delivered quarter-over-quarter oil growth for the past 16 consecutive quarters. First quarter to fourth quarter daily oil production grew 19% in '12, 18% in '13. And over that 2-year time period, we've seen our annual crude oil mix increase from 60% in '12 to 63% in '13. This trend of increased oil mix is something I expect to continue, over the next 3 years, as we move through our plan.","I'd like to give an update on the status of our acceleration plan on Slide 6, but first, let me revisit why we elected to start this plan now. Strategically, we have significant flexibility in how we choose to execute our business because of the success we delivered across our assets in both the Delaware and Midland Basins. The performance of our assets and the depth of our inventory indicate we can increase our growth rate. Combined with a strong balance sheet and scalable drilling machine, we're in an excellent position, today, to accelerate growth. We expect to double our production as a result of this plan, averaging annual growth of 25% over the next 3 years. As we described in November, our growth will be back-end weighted in '14, with our rate of growth increasing in the second half of the year. Our guidance for '14 is annual production growth of 18% to 22%, and we expect to average somewhere between 98,000 to 101,000 Boes per day in the first quarter. This back-end '14 growth profile is due to the horizontal rig ramp that has just recently been accelerated. As you can see from the slide, we have methodically increased our horizontal program over the last 3 years. Becoming the Permian Basin's #1 horizontal operator didn't happen overnight. We drilled a lot of horizontal wells all over the Permian and progressively moved up a very steep and expensive learning curve. But over the course of this transition, we've managed to deliver on our guidance year in and year out. Demonstrating consistent well performance while executing our capital program is precisely why this is the right time for Concho to accelerate the development of our inventory and create more value. And I think this is just the beginning. While we're just barely into '14, we made a strategic decision, last fall, to get an early start on our '14 rig ramp. We continue to believe that execution will be a major theme and that the key to our success was getting ahead of the competition and building the first big horizontal machine in the Permian. That move has proceeded as planned. In fact, we're actually slightly ahead of schedule with 34 rigs, 30 of which are horizontal.","Most of our rig additions went to the Northern Delaware position, and if you'll turn to Slide 7, I'd like to start there with an operational update. Our state line area in the Northern Delaware has been the poster child for multi-zone development in the Permian. Here, we have horizontal completions in 5 different zones with consistently strong results. This is the area where we completed the La Lina 802 [ph] in the second Bone Spring and had an average 30-day IP of 3,100 Boes per day. It's also the same area where we added the 30,000-acre Delaware Ranch lease. We've already drilled a couple of wells on that acreage in the second Bone Spring and we plan more activity in additional zones this year. Our second Bone Spring program in the state line area is now in development mode. We're actively extending the production boundary of the third bone spring and will test additional Wolfcamp ventures in '14.","Slide 8 summarizes our activity and results in our Lusk, Deep and Red Hills areas. Just like the state line area, we're moving into development mode for the second Bone Spring in each of these areas, especially Lusk and Deep. We're currently drilling another dual-lateral in Lusk, targeting the first and second Bone Spring zones. Our Deep area is predominantly third Bone Spring, but we're doing some interesting things here in the second Bone Spring as well. We're testing increased well density and staggered laterals in this area during '14.","Moving south to Red Hills, we drilled primarily Avalon Shale wells here and continue to see our oil cuts increase. And just across the border into Loving County, we've had some early success in the first and third Bone Spring. Between these 3 areas, we're currently running 9 horizontal rigs and will continue to add rigs here over the course of '14.","The last operational slide, in the Northern Delaware Basin, is our activity targeting the Brushy Canyon zone of the Delaware Sands, shown on Slide 9. Until just recently, this zone wasn't included in our inventory. Now we've drilled 11 horizontal wells to this formation and you can see the results of our first 6 wells with at least 30 days of production. We're very encouraged to have such early success with a relatively new concept. The Brushy Canyon is the oiliest and lowest cost zone we're targeting in the Northern Delaware Basin. But what's interesting about the Delaware Sands is that industry has targeted to formation for decades, having drilled nearly 6,000 vertical wells. As you can see from the map on Slide 9, there's quite a bit of vertical well control around significant portions of our acreage. During '14, we're dedicating 1 horizontal rig targeting the Brushy Canyon and plan to drill 12 to 15 wells in our state line, Deep and Red Hills areas.","The addition of inventory targeting the Brushy Canyon isn't the only new zone in which we've identified incremental inventory. Let's turn to Slide 10 and take a look at our inventory, by zone, in the Northern Delaware Basin. Since year-end '12, we've more than doubled our Northern Delaware Basin inventory to nearly 10,000 drilling locations. In addition to the Brushy Canyon, we're now distinguishing among the Bone Spring formations and quantifying inventory targeting the Wolfcamp shale. We've already said that our inventory follows the drill bit. You can see the bulk of our inventory is associated with zones that are supported by drilling data. And we have a lot of data. We've drilled 237 horizontal wells in the Northern Delaware that have at least 30 days of production data, and the average 30-day rate of all those wells is 745 Boes per day, 69% oil and an average lateral length of 4,210 feet. It shouldn't be a surprise that we've identified more locations in the second Bone Spring than any other zone, giving our success with this formation throughout the Northern Delaware. We're largely in development mode for the second Bone Spring, and given we now have 365,000 gross acres in the Northern Delaware, the second Bone Spring is the only zone, within our entire portfolio, that implies tighter well density than our standard 160-acre spacing. The quality of this inventory is high, as you can see from the quantity and strength of our drilling results. As we move through our acceleration plan and push additional zones closer to development mode, I have no doubt that we will continue to bulk-up our drilling locations across the Northern Delaware.","I'd like to move on to the Southern Delaware Basin on Slide 11. For competitive reasons, we've been reluctant to discuss well results, development strategy or delineation efforts. Those same competitive tensions remain, however, we're making progress not only increasing our exposure here, but also high-grading our acreage position. We were able to accomplish this through multiple transactions over the last few months and now have exposure to 165,000 gross acres. This is an area of great focus for Concho. We plan to allocate nearly $400 million to this asset in '14 and are currently running 6 horizontal rigs: 2 in North Harpoon, 3 in Big Chief and 1 in South Harpoon.","Our recent well performance has been very encouraging. Since our last update, over 6 months ago, our average 30-day IP rate on every horizontal well we drilled in the Southern Delaware Basin increased significantly to almost 1,000 Boes a day, 80% oil, and the average 24-hour peak rate was over 1,300 Boes per day. The average lateral length for these wells was just 4,378 feet.","Recently, particularly in the Big Chief area, we've been moving towards 7,000-foot-plus laterals. Most of our activity has been in the Wolfcamp A and B, but we're also testing deeper ventures as well as zones above the Wolfcamp.","We have increased our drilling inventory significantly to 800 locations, primarily within the North Harpoon and Big Chief areas, and a significant portion of those locations are extended laterals. South Harpoon continues to be an exploration project and is largely excluded from our current inventory.","Let's turn to Slide 12 and quickly touch on the Midland Basin, where we continue to find ways to optimize our completion techniques. Recently, we've been testing reduced cluster spacing and those wells have responded favorably. Our activity remains concentrated in the Wolfcamp A and B, but we have plans to test deeper benches and move up to the Spraberry in '14. While we will continue our legacy vertical Wolfberry program, we firmly believe that horizontal development is more capital efficient and provides greater returns. The average lateral length of our wells is still in the 4,400-foot range, but we're shifting to longer laterals to further increase efficiencies and returns. We're currently running 11 rigs, 7 of which are horizontal and expect to operate at that level for the remainder of '14. And, over the course of our 3-year plan, we expect to increase our horizontal activity in the Midland Basin.","From an inventory standpoint, we've identified over 2,500 horizontal locations targeting the Spraberry and the Wolfcamp A, B and C. With over 200,000 acres prospective for the Spraberry and the Wolfcamp, there's still quite a bit of opportunity to expand our horizontal Midland Basin drilling inventory.","We've clearly taken a significant step forward in the identification of our inventory and description of our resource potential, as you can see on Slide 13. Next to executing our growth plan, this is our top priority. The expansion of our drilling inventory and the scale of our resource opportunity is based on the combination of drilling and science. At Concho, we tend to be data-driven and our data is always tied to the drill bit. We drilled over 400 horizontal wells across the Permian, which has given us a great deal of confidence in the quality of our assets and the depth of our resource. It's no surprise that the incremental locations we've added to our inventory are almost exclusively horizontal within our highest impact assets. At the same time, we can apply science and geology to further define and expand our resource and inventory potential. For instance, we're using science to, one, extend the productive boundaries on our acreage; two, delineate additional zones; and three, increase our well density. Ultimately, we rely on the drill bit not only to prove up our inventory, but also identify more resource opportunity along the way.","When we apply this framework to our assets, which is based on our current interpretation of the data and science, we believe that our net recoverable resource potential is at least 6x our year-end '13 proved reserves of 0.5 billion barrels. The depth of that resource is driven by approximately 22,000 drilling locations, nearly twice as many locations identified at year end '12.","So what does this all mean? Concho is running a big horizontal drilling program. In fact, the biggest in the Permian Basin. As we move forward with our growth plan, we can run more than 50 rigs and accelerate that inventory to create more value. At the same time, the game has changed thanks to horizontal development. The opportunities across the Permian are substantial and require significant capital, such that we're likely to see a big consolidation over time. As long as we have this big drilling machine and advance our understanding of our resource base, we should be well positioned to take advantage of any consolidation play. In the meantime, we still have work to do to more clearly describe and quantify our inventory and resource potential. Over time, we plan to provide updates by core area, in which we'll describe the zones, oil extent and increase density opportunities across our acreage position.","I also expect us to continue our track record of execution and deliver the type of growth outlined in our 3-year plan. Given all the opportunity we have on our existing assets, I believe our 3-year plan is just the beginning of a much longer term growth plan.","So, with all that, I appreciate your continued interest in Concho and I and the team look forward to taking your questions. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of John Freeman, Raymond James.","John Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Looking at the average lateral length in the Northern Delaware, it's been running about 4,300 feet. And I know that Joe had mentioned, previously, that kind of over 1\/3 of the budget this year was going to go to long lateral. So, just sort of back in the envelope, that would sort of suggest the average lateral length, in that Northern Delaware Basin area, would go to kind of just over 5,000 feet. Is that kind of the right way to think about it, or is that likely too conservative?","Timothy A. Leach","I think most of our long laterals are going to be in the Southern Delaware Basin, John, where we've got big leases where we can drill further. We're also doing that in the Midland Basin. In the Northern Delaware Basin, we are drilling as far as we can based on the lease configuration we've got. So I think you'll continue to see that lateral length increase, but in the Northern Delaware Basin it's going to be constrained by partners and how much we can pool together acreage to create longer laterals. But I think the focus is going to be in the Southern Delaware and the Midland Basins in terms of really long laterals lease.","John Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then shifting to the Avalon Shale and I think it was interesting in the way that you broke out the different prospects in the Northern Delaware, just how much oilier the Avalon was when you sort of moved a little bit more over in the kind of Red Hills area. And I'm just curious, it does look like now that's going to be a little bit more of a focus, drilling-wise, as opposed to just the second and third Bone Springs. So, kind of on a return basis, the way that you're looking at it, at least in that Red Hill area, other than the second Bone Spring and Brushy Canyon, would it be sort of right there in that next slate of zones in terms of returns?","Timothy A. Leach","Yes, I think that's right. And there are so many zones have high potential for us. And the Avalon sits right at the top of all that, so we get to see it as we go through to all these other zones. So we're collecting a lot of information. But it's continuing to be more of a focus and we've had lots of success there. So it's been a big one for us.","John Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","And just a last question for me, on Brushy Canyon. Obviously, that's the zone that you've had the least activity in, so I'm assuming that, that inventory count of 850 provided is probably pretty heavily risked. When would you guys anticipate doing some maybe bigger step-out delineation work on Brushy Canyon as opposed to kind of -- most are clustered around that Red Hills\/State Line area.","Timothy A. Leach","Yes. This year we're going to drill 12 to 15, like I said, and it's going to be scattered out between those 3 areas. So, this year, we're pushing the Brushy Canyon to a wider aerial extent. And we try to show how many vertical wells have been drilled around our acreage. So we're using vertical wells to help set up some of those prospects.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Scott Hanold, RBC.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Good update. I was wondering on that resource update of 22,000 locations. Do you all have a general number of what the sort of the engineered number, consistent with the kind of prior reporting to be, versus the resource locations, just at a high-level?","Timothy A. Leach","Yes. Well, at a high-level, we used the same process to identify these locations. And we've been talking about this for quite some time. So we've gone through and -- every one of these locations has a location on the map and we have a pretty high degree of confidence, based on our drilling, around the number of locations and the resource potential. And we've used kind of the same type of assumptions relative to type curves per well and things like that. So this is something that we feel really good about. Most of this is coming from the Northern Delaware Basin, where we have the most information and through the drill bit. And the expansion has been driven through lateral expansion of where these zones exist, identifying more zones so that the vertical distinction that I talked about, and then also starting to understand increased density and what that could add to our property base.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay, okay. All good. Understood. And when you step back -- and I think you all appreciate the size of the opportunity you have here. When you look at sort a blue sky sort of case on what this could be, I mean, how big could that 22,000 location get, just from a kind of big picture view?","Timothy A. Leach","Well, I thought 22,000 was a pretty big number. But I would tell you that we have more information in Eddy and Lea County, and so we have more locations there with the higher degree of confidence. We also, then, in the Southern Delaware Basin and in the Midland Basin, where we're just getting started testing some of these zones, we've been more conservative there. And in the Midland Basin, we haven't -- the 7 Bakkens that you read about, we haven't drilled all those zones, so we haven't really assigned reserves to many of those zones in the Midland Basin.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay, okay. And then one last question. On Page 10, where you all provide the Brushy, Avalon, just the various breakdowns that's in Northern Delaware Basin. I mean, could you provide just a high-level sense of like, within each of the zones, what kind of like EURs or costs per well? Is that something that you think, over time, that you'd be willing to provide or can actually give some input on?","Timothy A. Leach","Yes. I think that's something that we can talk about over time. But, generally, the things you're familiar with there, the way we've done our type curves and the way we described the cost is similar to how we modeled it in this program. It's interesting, before you get off, I would say that we've got some of the best performing wells in the Permian Basin. But I think, when you compare our type curves to others, you might conclude that our type curves are more conservative than other companies. These type curves are things that we have a lot of data around and have a lot of confidence in, that we can deliver those type curves. So, I think if there's upside, maybe upside in the type curves compared to others in the industry.","Operator","Question from the line of Brian Singer, Goldman Sachs.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just following up on a couple of those other questions. On the EURs, I know you're not giving the specifics there, but can you talk if there were any changes within any of the zones in the Delaware or the Midlands relative to your prior assumption for reasons other than lateral length changes?","Timothy A. Leach","I mean we've gone through our year-end engineering. There were some ups and some downs, but generally, I'd say they're all about the same.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So when you think about the 5x or 6x approved reserves, in terms of that unbooked inventory, that's really entirely related to locations as opposed to changes and changes in the EURs?","Timothy A. Leach","That's exactly right.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then going to the Brushy Canyon. This just, may be an example or a bit of a microcosm, you drilled 11 wells there. Can you just talk about, given the relative concentration among those 11 wells, how, in your process, that goes from 11 wells drilled to 850 locations?","Timothy A. Leach","Yes. Well, like lots of things we've done. We start with an area where we think we'll have success. We try to make that repeatable. And then we will try to find other areas around our acreage basin in the Northern Delaware where the vertical testing indicates that the rock will be the same. And that's kind of the process we've used.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And so for the Brushy Canyon specifically then, I mean, does that take you all the way out to the limits of your Northern Delaware block or is that high concentration within halfway or can you provide any more color for how far your stake in that [ph]?","Timothy A. Leach","I'd say it's a high concentration around areas where you've penetrated it vertically and believe it to exist where you can capture it horizontally.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Lastly, any additional color as you think about the long-term guidance of 25% with regards to CapEx and CapEx specifics other than your leverage ratios will fall?","Timothy A. Leach","I think that's still the best way to think about it. And as we execute this program, we'll make adjustments as we see that we're going to have more cash flow or as we see our debt declining quicker than we expected, but I'd say our plan is right on track.","Operator","We have a question from the line of Irene Haas, Wunderlich Securities.","Irene O. Haas - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","My question is focused on Southern Delaware Basin. I noticed that you're pursuing the second Bone Spring and your Big Chief prospect area. Can you tell me where the second Bone Spring came from? Is it from the Southwest? Is it much like much the other ones? Sort of turbolite sand [ph]. And does it extend into Pecos County?","Timothy A. Leach","I'm going to turn it over to Matt, he can address that question.","Matthew G. Hyde","Irene, this is Matt. Good question. The second Bone Spring there has attributes that equate back to the Northern Delaware Basin. But there's also an element of it that looked very much like the Wolfcamp underlying it, in terms of the stratigraphic sequence. So it's a bit of the hybrid as you think about the Southern down bit [ph] limit of the Bone Spring.","Irene O. Haas - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","Does it have certain -- is it mappable? Does it have a certain sort of lateral extend that you can see, rather being a contiguous play, more like a traditional Wolfcamp shale?","Matthew G. Hyde","It has those attributes, yes. It'll allow it to be mapped in a continuous way. Yes, correct.","Irene O. Haas - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","Does it extend into Pecos area?","Matthew G. Hyde","Yes, it does.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Drew Venker, Morgan Stanley.","Andrew Venker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I guess just following up on the Southern Delaware. Can you talk about your plans to delineate that Pecos County area, I guess South Harpoon and the southern portion of Big Chief?","Timothy A. Leach","Well, I addressed the number of rigs we're running down there and I addressed that we've picked up more acreage that we're really happy with. Other than that, I don't think I want to see anything more about our delineation plans.","Andrew Venker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. So, I guess in that area, do you see Wolfcamp B and C being prospective as well?","Timothy A. Leach","Our wells are in the A and B primarily, and we're going to test deeper into the C.","Andrew Venker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And then you mentioned some down-spacing pilots in Big Chief. Can you provide more color on spacing or what exactly the pilots are going to test?","Timothy A. Leach","Those are generally long lateral wells, 7,000-foot wells down there, and they're being set up where instead of 4 wells per section, if you want to think about it that way, that we're setting them up where we can do 5 or 6.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Ryan Oatman, SunTrust.","Ryan Oatman - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","I wanted to also stick with the Southern Delaware Basin here. Obviously, a huge improvement with the latest wells averaging almost 1,000 barrels a day with 80% oil cuts. Is that a reflection of you guys doing something different within the same target zones from a drilling or completion standpoint or do you think that is more reflective of stepping out to different zones?","Timothy A. Leach","Well, I guess the way I think about it, the rates are reflective of us improving our drilling completion techniques. I think that the oil component is reflective of what that zone will produce in that general area.","Ryan Oatman - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","And then in the state line area, shifting back to the North. Obviously, the second Bone Spring well that you guys drilled, that did almost 4,600 barrels a day. Wanted to see if you guys were looking at the Wolfcamp D up there, given competitive results. And then kind of a leasehold question as well, see if there was any potential to potentially unitize that or kind of create larger units with the other leaseholders out there.","Timothy A. Leach","Yes. I mean, we have experimented with the Wolfcamp D, and we are, right now, I guess drilling one-section lateral length wells up there. Every place we can, we're trying to partner with our offset operators to drill longer laterals. Some places we're having more success than others in that partnering. But these wells have substantial economics on their own at one-section laterals, so you don't have a whole lot of pressure that you have to partner.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Mike Scialla, Stifel.","Michael S. Scialla - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Just a real basic clarification, on the 22,000 locations, I should know the answer to this, but is that the gross or net number?","Timothy A. Leach","That a gross number.","Michael S. Scialla - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Would you be able to guess at what the net might be there?","Timothy A. Leach","Can you just give Price a call off-line to get that?","Michael S. Scialla - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Yes, sure. No problem.","Timothy A. Leach","All right.","Michael S. Scialla - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","And in thinking then, in terms of your inventory in the Midland Basin, with the vertical Wolfberry, you've got 4,300 locations there in your inventory. You mentioned your preference for drilling horizontally there. I recognize that you're still pretty early in that program. But if that goes as well as you hope, would you anticipate that those 4,300 vertical locations might be converted into horizontal locations at some point in the future or do those remain?","Timothy A. Leach","That's a real complicated question because I think the vertical locations are independent and standalone. And the resources we've identified in the horizontal Wolfcamp are kind of different resources, different oil, if you will. So we are continuing to run vertical rigs. They have good economics and the number of zones we go horizontal in is something I think that we're going to be working on over the next few years.","Michael S. Scialla - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","You had mentioned the down-spacing test in the Lusk area, with the staggered kind of configuration. Can you indicate what kind of spacing you're testing there?","Timothy A. Leach","Well, it's denser spacing. I guess it would be one iteration more dense than 160 acres spacing with a staggered lateral, so you're varying the depth where you put the lateral.","Michael S. Scialla - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","So, essentially, if you look at it as one package, you're kind of testing 80-acre spacing with vertical offsets?","Timothy A. Leach","Yes, by the way you mean it, but I think it's more complicated than that because, with those staggers, it's not as dense as 80s.","Michael S. Scialla - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","And last one from me, you mentioned, too, that you're trying another dual-lateral. And any thoughts on what you learned from the first one, what you might do different with this one?","Timothy A. Leach","No, no. I don\u2019t have anything to talk about on that. I think the dual-lateral approach is something that will be tested over long period of time. We've got plenty of good economics and plenty of rigs to kind of attack all this with single laterals and we're testing the number of things, like duals, that could enhance the economics. But it's going to be -- there's lots of variables and lots of different ways to approach it.","Michael S. Scialla - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","So it's not anything you're really counting on, I guess, it's more a little bit of a science project that may come into play over the longer term?","Timothy A. Leach","That's right, that's right.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Pearce Hammond, Simmons.","Pearce W. Hammond - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Yes. I wanted to follow-up on Scott Hanold's questions about the well cost. Down in the Southern Delaware Basin, how much more expensive are those wells than in the Northern Delaware Basin?","Timothy A. Leach","Let\u2019s see. I'm going to fire off on this and if I get out of bounds, Joe you jump in. But I think, generally, the Northern Delaware Basin, if you look at average well cost, it's kind of $5.5 million to $6 million a well. Something like that. And those Southern Delaware Basins, depending on the lateral -- they're longer lateral lengths almost entirely, and they can range from $10 million to $12 million apiece to drill. And those are kind of current cost today. The Northern Delaware Basin is much more a development manufacturing kind of operation. We're further along at driving the cost down there. So there is efficiency gains to be made in the South plus just gains to be made from scale and the size of the operation. So I think, in our plan, we've planned for improved cost over this year and we are seeing that currently. And there's probably more of that in the South than in the North.","Pearce W. Hammond - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","And then, given the big horizontal rig ramp in the Permian grid [ph] large, right now, going on from the industry, are you starting to see any pressure on services, either availability or any bottlenecks?","Timothy A. Leach","Well, I think, once again, running a program the size and scope of ours, we have great advantages over the competition. And so, generally, where you might say there is price pressure in the Permian, I would say, at Concho, we're seeing increased efficiencies and we still think our cost will be coming down. And I think it's a factor of having this many rigs that are running full-time. Our frac crews are running 24 hours a day, which is much more efficient. So I think there's great advantages to having a big program.","Pearce W. Hammond - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","And then one last one from me. On differential outlook for the Permian, and maybe specifically for the Delaware Basin as you look out this year, are you starting to see increased levels of condensate have any impact on differentials?","Timothy A. Leach","No. I mean I don't think that -- I haven't seen any of that situation where I think condensates -- our differentials have been all over the place, with what's going on with the Kush [ph] differential. We've tried to hedge our way through that. I would also say, though, that there's a large number of infrastructure projects that are underway to make the gathering of this oil and gas more efficient, and I think we'll see some improvements in our pricing around that.","Operator","The next question comes from the line Matt Portillo, TPH.","Matthew Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Just wanted to dig a little bit more on your Midland Basin program. I was wondering if you could give a little color around the Wolfcamp opportunity that you see today, where you're focusing your drilling at the moment, in terms of the horizon. And then, obviously, given the acreage footprint across kind of Upton, Midland, Martin and Andrews County, how you think about kind of rig allocation across those plays and maybe where you may be might migrating to over time.","Timothy A. Leach","That's a lot of questions. Most of our activity, to this point, has been in the Wolfcamp A and B. And as you look around at where our properties are located and what other operators are doing, we think there's opportunities in the deeper Wolfcamp, like in the Wolfcamp C and D, and there are also opportunities up in the Spraberry. We plan to drill 70 wells on this asset this year. We plan to scatter those wells around our acreage position, to give us better information about how these things are going to perform, kind of in a widespread basis, and we plan to start testing these different zones. But, up to this point, our work has been pretty concentrated in the Wolfcamp and in the upper portions of the Wolfcamp.","Matthew Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","And could you remind us, I think you talked about a gross number before, but roughly how much net acreage you have in that area that you've highlighted in the presentation?","Timothy A. Leach","Hold on one second to get [ph] that number. It's about 100,000 net.","E. Joseph Wright","Little over 200,000 gross.","Matthew Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","And my last question is just -- you mentioned reduced cluster spacing, just wanted to see if you could give any incremental contacts on what you're testing and maybe kind of from where you're coming in terms of the number of stages to where you're going to.","Timothy A. Leach","Yes. Throughout our industry you're seeing widespread experimentation and success with the spacing on clusters and how much you're draining and the efficiency of the drainage. I think that's a really important thing and maybe a big breakthrough. We've a lot of success with it and that's kind of all I want to say at this point, that I think denser cluster spacing is going to increase the recovery efficiencies that we have in this reservoir.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Michael Hall, Heikkinen Energy Advisors.","Michael Hall","I guess I just want to jump back to the Southern Delaware real quickly. How would describe or characterize the results, compare the results, in the Wolfcamp versus the Bone Spring? And any general differences in terms of decline curves or anything along those lines that you're seeing as of yet?","Timothy A. Leach","We've got a lot more data in the Wolfcamp than we've in the Bone Spring and we've got lot more big rates from extended length laterals. I just don't think we have enough information in the Bone Spring, yet, to really comment on what we think those wells are going to do when we get the lateral lengths out further. I'd say Wolfcamp more data, more wells, high rates. We feel real good about it but we're very optimistic about the Bone Spring as well.","Michael Hall","And then in the Northern Delaware, thinking about the Bone Spring, you've obviously been increasing inventory there substantially. How has your thinking, I guess, evolved around the risking of the Bone Spring inventory and have the actual results maybe come in with a narrower distribution than you had initially thought and that's helping to give some added confidence? Just curious, if you have any color around that.","Timothy A. Leach","Well, in the second Bone Spring, we drilled a lot of wells, we have a lot of data and it's pretty widespread, and I'd say we've lot of confidence. And we're modeling it in such a way -- when we communicate the number of opportunities and what we think the magnitude of the reserves are, we're modeling in such a way that we think it's achievable with the technology we have today. We're not normalizing to any different kind of lateral lengths or anything like that. We're communicating what we think we're experiencing, on average, today and we have a high confidence level on those averages.","Michael Hall","And then just 2014 outlook and guidance. Can you just remind me kind of how you think about lateral length in the guidance? There's a lot of variability in terms of what you're targeting, and I'm just wondering, what's kind of the assumed and how is it risked in the 2014 guidance around lateral way.","Timothy A. Leach","Well, everything we're doing in 2014 -- I mean, we picked the locations, we know the lateral lengths. So I'd tell you that a 1\/3, a 1\/4 of what we're doing is longer than the section long. So it's a fairly substantial portion of our program. But I think, over time, you'll see more increased lateral length than what we're doing this year.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of David Tameron, Wells Fargo.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","A couple of questions. If I look at the rig count, just what you guys have in the presentation, you're ramping on the Delaware side. Where do the majority of those rigs go?","Timothy A. Leach","Well, most of them are going in the north.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. 75-25 kind of number?","Timothy A. Leach","Most of our rig ramp is going in the Northern Delaware and we'll add a few more rigs in the south, but most of this expansion -- from where we sit today -- I mean, we're at 34 rigs today, so we're just going to add couple of rigs a quarter throughout the rest of the year, and most of those will go in the Northern Delaware Basin.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I know, in the past, you've been concerned about the amount of -- I guess not flexibility, but how taxing it's going to be on the organization to ramp from 25 rigs to 50 rigs? It looks like you guys have just in the last 3 of 4 months out of 7, 8 rigs. Any integration problems with that?","Timothy A. Leach","I'll remind you of a couple of things, one, is this organization has run 45 rigs before, albeit in a mostly vertical program. The second thing is, as we gain efficiencies -- and I think we've got something in the slide deck on that -- what we originally planned to do in the Wolfcamp and the Midland Basin, we're going to able to execute that whole plan, this year, with fewer rigs than we originally thought, just because the drilling efficiencies are continuing to drive the number of days down. And that takes some stress off the organization, you don't have to run quite as many rigs to get all your wells drilled. But I mean, we've been talking about this for quite a while, trying to build the big drilling machine. Our organization has a lot of capacity. We're going to continue to expand that capacity, but I think we've got enough in-house to do the plan that we've laid out for the next couple of years.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Last question, back to the southern. If I just look at the September presentation, you said your first 11 wells, third day rates were 700, just under 700. Now with the 21 wells, you're just under a 1,000. So I'm not very good at math, but I mean, is 1,300 kind of where those recent wells have been coming in, the last 10 or so?","Timothy A. Leach","For someone who's not really good at math that's, I guess, a pretty good estimate.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","That's all I, got everything else has been asked. But the 1,300, okay, you talked about that earlier, just a combination of learning curve, not necessarily lateral length, but just more learning curve and getting your feet underneath there, is that the right way to think about that?","Timothy A. Leach","Yes, and we're really in a very good area, We've high-graded. We think we've got the fairway. We like that spot. And we're pretty happy how we put that spot together and how the whole thing works.","Operator","We have a question from the line of Jason Smith, Bank of America.","Jason Smith - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just a quick one, back on the Avalon, within your inventory of 1,500 locations. How should we think about the split between the gassier Avalon and state line area and the oilier Avalon and the Lusk, Deep and the Red Hills area?","Timothy A. Leach","Yes. We haven't broken that out yet. So I don't have -- that'll be something we can talk about in the future.","Jason Smith - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And, Tim, on the New Mexico Shelf, you guys have doubled your horizontal ESO [ph] locations, but obviously the rig count has gone down with some of the infrastructure issues. So what give you the confidence to increase location count there? And then also, when takeaway capacity, hopefully, improves later this year, are there any expectations that you're going to add more rigs to that area?","Timothy A. Leach","Yes. In our 3-year plan, we planned on adding rigs in '15, not so much in '14. And we've had a lot of really good success up there with horizontal drilling. So I think that inventory increase is predominantly horizontal. And we plan to get back to work up there probably next year.","Jason Smith - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","One last one, I think you kind of covered this in the last question. But in terms of people and G&A, and the release you guys mentioned, that the G&A was higher due to increased staffing through the years. Do you feel comfortable with where you are from a people perspective, now, to execute on the plan or you think that you still a little bit more to go there?","Timothy A. Leach","We've got between 900 and 1,000 employees, and our plan calls for adding another 100 or so a year for the next 3 years, and that's what the track record has been in the past. So I think it's very doable and I think we're right where we want to be right now.","Operator","A question from the line of Jeff Robertson, Barclays.","Jeffrey W. Robertson - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Tim, can you talk about the rates of return across the different plays in the Northern Delaware Basin, and within that, how you you're thinking about allocating capital between the different zones, whether it's development or still delineating the opportunity set?","Timothy A. Leach","Yes. Price is flipping to a page here to help me out. But, in general, the rates of return are very robust all across the Northern Delaware. I talked to you before, about this tension between allocating capital between the -- all this inventory we have is shooting fish in a barrel and then all the trying to delineate all the additional zones and do some testing on increased density and everything. I mean, I think we're going to feel that tension for a long time, capturing additional opportunity versus just executing a big drilling machine. And I think the rates of return up there, as the cost have come down and the wells have continued to get better -- I mean, these are some of the best rate of return things that we've ever done.","Jeffrey W. Robertson - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Is the second Bone -- it sounds like second Bone from what you said earlier, is the #1 rate of return currently?","Timothy A. Leach","Yes, I think that's right.","Jeffrey W. Robertson - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And from the early results in the Brushy Canyon, where would that rank?","Timothy A. Leach","Well, I mean, Brushy Canyon, we don't have very much data on it. But as I mentioned it's the oiliest and the cheapest, and those rate of returns are very high as well.","Jeffrey W. Robertson - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Second question, in the Southern Delaware Basin. With the rigs that you're going to run, is the well count there somewhere between 70 and 75 gross wells for 2014?","E. Joseph Wright","No. it's closer to about 40. Yes, and they're all about 100% wells.","Timothy A. Leach","100% ownership.","Jeffrey W. Robertson - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And, Tim, are there infrastructure issues in that area, since I think it's more remote, that impact how quickly you're able to pursue that program?","Timothy A. Leach","It doesn't impact how quickly we can pursue it per se, but the answer is yes. There's infrastructure issues everywhere. Getting electricity, where you need electricity. The Delaware is where we are experiencing higher cost because we're still hauling a lot of salt water, we've got a lot of salt water disposal systems to build. We're going to have to generate some of own electricity for a while. Right now we're running electrical generation that we're fueling with diesel or natural gas. So there's all of that kind of stuff. Over the next several years, there will be more infrastructure that drives the cost down. But we're going to have to build some of it and then industry will build some of it coming to us. But it hasn't really, necessarily, affected the pace, it has just mainly affected the cost.","Jeffrey W. Robertson - Barclays Capital, Research Division","The pace is driven by your drilling results and the science you're doing to keep it all in check?","Timothy A. Leach","Right.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of James Sullivan, Alembic Global Advisors.","James Sullivan - Alembic Global Advisors","I just wanted to get a little bit on your thoughts about acreage acquisitions in the Northern Delaware. I know you guys always have an enormous opportunity set in front of you and you've been opportunistic already with the Delaware Ranch. But you did talk about how lease configurations were maybe limiting lateral length in that area. How important is it to you guys, as you think about being opportunistic with acreage to block up what you have? I mean would you consider asset swaps and just how does that figure into your thinking there?","Timothy A. Leach","We've done a bit of that. I would say it's not transformational up there. But on the margin, we still always pick up additional leases from the lease sales and things like that, in order to make it where we can drill longer laterals. So there's always a bit of a budget for increased land in the Northern Delaware to make our drilling more efficient. I would say, in general, there's not a big acreage play available in the Northern Delaware any longer, most of that stuff is now in the hands of the folks who I think are going to actually drill it.","James Sullivan - Alembic Global Advisors","When you guys talk about -- I mean, you spoke at a very high level kind of early in your presentation about the possibility of consolidations in the Basin, but you're thinking of that is not picking up from smaller operators or non-operators.","Timothy A. Leach","In the north, I think there's probably more opportunity in the South. There's more acreage in the South in the hands of companies that aren't going to ultimately drill it, that there's going to be more consolidation I think.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of John Nelson, Citigroup.","John C. Nelson - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I'm just curious, with your Delaware results, it seemed to come in trending more oily every quarter. Do you think there could be upside to the 66% oil mix in 2016?","Timothy A. Leach","Yes, but you're getting close to the top I think.","John C. Nelson - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Also with regards to your current...","Timothy A. Leach","Yes, because all these wells we're drilling, with the higher oil rate, at the end of the day, they're incremental. So you'll have incremental moves, I think, upward. But we're pretty oily already.","Jason Miller","Fair enough. And then just following up on Jason's questions earlier. I think you said you'd add a couple of rigs to the New Mexico Shelf or you'd add some more rigs to the New Mexico Shelf in '15? Can you quantify that?","Timothy A. Leach","Can I do what?","John C. Nelson - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","How many rigs will that be in 2015?","Timothy A. Leach","We haven't put our '15 budget together. So we were running -- when we started shutting it down, we had 5 rigs running there I think. So I think, generally, it'd be going back to something like that level.","E. Joseph Wright","John, the rigs that we would add to the shelf would be a combination of horizontal and vertical. So it'd be a noticeable pick up in just rig count, most likely, by the time we get to '15.","John C. Nelson - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Fair enough. And then I guess just lastly from me. We all seem to be asking these same questions on conference calls and getting the same answers from operators. So I'll try to go about this a little differently. Just on service pricing, obviously you're most insulated from any potential service pricing increases given your size. But would it be fair to characterize the potential inflation as probably only the low single-digits, whereas the potential for efficiency gains for you over the next few years could be something along the lines of 10% to 20%? Is that a fair way to think about sort of your overall cost?","Timothy A. Leach","Yes. I think that's fair. Although I don't expect us to have cost inflation.","Operator","We have the final question from the line of Joe Magner, Macquarie.","Joseph Patrick Magner - Macquarie Research","Just one more point of clarification. The resource potential, the 6x year end '13 proved reserves, is that a gross or a net figure?","Timothy A. Leach","I'm sorry. Say that one more time.","Joseph Patrick Magner - Macquarie Research","Just curious. You referenced resource potential tied to this new inventory.","Timothy A. Leach","Yes, that's net. That's net recoverable to Concho and then the location count was gross.","Joseph Patrick Magner - Macquarie Research","Okay. And I guess as we think about the sort of ongoing evolution of your disclosure around some of the potential here, how should we expect to get updates on per well EURs or more specifics around some of these plays and some of these opportunities?","Timothy A. Leach","I think you ought to think that you'll get more information in the Northern Delaware because we'll have more information up there. That will come to you more quickly. Updates on the Midland Basin in the Southern Delaware will be a bit slower until we get enough wells that we feel comfortable, really, talking about type curves and different zones and things like that.","Operator","We will now turn the call back over to Mr. Tim Leach for closing remarks.","Timothy A. Leach","All right, thanks. Well, I appreciate all the good questions and the attention that you're paying to Concho. I think, as I've said before, this is a real exciting time for us. The acceleration that we've talked about, coupled with the growth in our inventory, I think, really puts us in a great position, and I look forward to talking to you more about it in the future. Thank you very much.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day."],"5951":["Concho Resources (NYSE:CXO) Q4 2012 Earnings Call February 21, 2013 10:00 AM ET","Executives","L.

My name is Derek, and I'll be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Price Moncrief, Vice President of Capital Markets and Strategy. Please proceed.","L. Price Moncrief","Good morning. We're glad you could join us today for Concho's Fourth Quarter 2012 Conference Call. Before we get started, I'd like to direct your attention to the forward-looking statement disclosure contained in the press release.","In summary, it says that statements in last night\u2019s press release and on this conference call that state the company\u2019s or management\u2019s expectations or predictions of the future are forward-looking statements intended to be covered by the Safe Harbor provisions under federal securities laws. There are many factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations, including those we've described in the press release, our 10-K and our other filings with the SEC.","In addition, we will reference certain non-GAAP measures, so be sure to see the reconciliations in our earnings release or our most recent investor presentation. Both the earnings release and the investor presentation can be found on our website.","On today's call, I am joined by Tim Leach, our Chairman and CEO; as well as other members of our management team who will be available to take questions later in the call.","With that, I'd like to turn it over to Tim.","Timothy A. Leach","Good morning. Thanks for joining us today as we review our results for the fourth quarter and year, as well as our outlook for 2013. The fourth quarter was a good one for Concho. We produced over 89,000 Boes per day and generated nearly $400 million in EBITDAX, both all-time records for the company. Fourth quarter production grew 5% over the third quarter, driven in large part by our oil growth, which was 7% over the third quarter. Full year '12 production came in at 29.8 million Boes as at the top end of our annual production guidance and is 26% higher than the previous year. Adjusting for acquisitions during the year, organic production in '12 was 28.5 million Boes, a 21% increase over '11. As notable, when you consider we deliver organic production growth in excess of 20% every year as a public company, but more importantly, we've delivered profitable growth over those 5.5 years.","2012 was an important year for Concho in terms of strategically positioning the company to keep that track record of profitable high return growth. While we greatly expanded our drilling inventory during the year, we also enhanced returns across our portfolio through a combination of the Three Rivers acquisition and our efforts over the second half of the year to accelerate horizontal activity in the northern Delaware Basin. The $1 billion Three Rivers acquisition was funded entirely with borrowings and a $500 million non-core asset divestiture. Since closing the acquisition in July, our team has identified nearly 2,400 drilling locations on Three Rivers assets, which represents about 20% of our total drilling inventory at year end. That's a material increase in inventory for a deal that didn't require any equity. And about half of those Three Rivers locations are located in the Delaware Basin where the returns are among the best in our portfolio.","Taking a look at our updated rate of return models in the latest investor presentation, you'll see the pretax returns across our Bone Spring inventory are between 50% and 60% at current commodity prices. That's an improvement over our last update and reflects the strength of our drilling results in '12.","As I've done over the previous quarters, I'd like to update you on our most recent progress in the northern Delaware, and I'm pleased to say that our results in the fourth quarter are the best to date. Since our last earnings call, we've added 25 northern Delaware Basin horizontal wells that have 30 days of production data, bringing our total horizontal wells in this area completed by Concho to 131, targeting 7 unique zones. The average 30-day production rate for those 25 new wells was in excess of 800 Boes a day from single zone completions and averaged 70% crude oil. 17 of those 25 wells were Bone Spring completions, with an average 30-day rate over 850 Boes and over 75% crude oil. Three of those Bone Spring wells averaged over 1,100 barrels a day of crude oil, not liquids, not equivalents, for the first 30 days.","Our efforts in the Delaware are paying off, as it's now a meaningful source of production growth. Net production from the horizontal Delaware Basin averaged over 21,000 equivalent barrels per day during the fourth quarter, a 32% increase over the third quarter. After just 2 years, the Delaware Basin represents about 30% of total net production, and we barely tapped the vast resource opportunity that it has to offer.","As you've probably read in our operations release 2 weeks ago, we added substantially to our northern Delaware Basin drilling inventory. It increased 125% over year-end '11 to over 4,200 locations. Only 250 of those locations are currently identified in the proven category, so we're clearly in the very early stages of increasing proved reserves and production growth from that region.","In 2013, we will spend nearly half of our capital budget or about $750 million there drilling 160 wells. At that pace, it would take us over 2 decades to process our entire inventory. But at current return levels, we should be able to grow and reinvest our cash flow annually to accelerate that pace of development just as we've done with our other core areas. It's a proven strategy that's created significant value for our shareholders over 5 years, and I'm excited about the prospect of extending that track record for years to come.","Concho is more opportunity rich today than it's ever been in its history thanks to the Delaware Basin and horizontal technology. Horizontal drilling has not only created an abundance of opportunities across the Permian, it's also shifted the playing field in favor of those capable of executing large capital and drilling programs. I expect that this will continue to drive consolidation in the Permian, and I expect Concho will be right in the mix as 1 of the largest operators in the Permian with over 30 operated rigs and the capability of running 40 to 50 rigs. However, I believe '13 will largely be an execution year for Concho given the depth of our high-return, high-growth inventory. We have lots of momentum behind us, and I'm confident that we have a great strategy in place to consistently deliver profitable growth.","Before we move to Q&A, let me get in the weeds on a few topics. The first topic is the Midland-to-Cushing basis differential and the expected impact on our oil realizations. During the fourth quarter, the average realized basis differential was $3.57 per barrel. While pricing for the first quarter is not quite complete, it appears the average Mid-Cush differential will be in the range of $7.50 to $8 a barrel. As a result, our expected unhedged realization in the first quarter as a percentage of NYMEX crude is likely to be in the low 80s.","Given the volatility in the differential and the impact it can have on our oil-weighted cash flows, we began to layer on basis hedges during the first quarter to protect a substantial portion of our oil volumes beginning in April and going through the end of '13. The average blended basis hedge is roughly $1.23 per barrel. Taking this into account and assuming the current strip, I believe that we will be able to deliver full year unhedged oil realizations there within our guidance.","Finally, I'd like to point out 2 things related to '13 production. First, on December 20, we closed our non-core asset divestiture, which contributed approximately 5,000 Boes per day of production during the fourth quarter. Secondly, we increased our full year '13 production guidance in our operations release a couple of weeks ago without changing our '13 capital budget. The new range is 33.4 million to 34.8 million Boes and excludes volumes associated with the recent divestitures. It also represents 15% to 20% organic production growth consistent with our track record.","So with that, I look forward to taking your questions, and let me turn the call now back over to the moderator.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question will be coming from the line of John Freeman, Raymond James.","John Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","First question I had, Tim, you sort of alluded to it in terms of the sizable increase in that rate of return slide that you've got in your presentation for the Bone Spring and then also the Avalon, and I'm just wondering if we could get maybe a little bit more specifics on what changed from the prior guidance? Just kind of going through the slides, it didn't jump out at me in terms of the EUR or completed well costs. Sort of what changed?","Timothy A. Leach","Okay. You want to take that, Joe?","E. Joseph Wright","John, this is Joe. I think the biggest changes you see over the quarters is our initial rates in those Delaware Basin wells. Those have been increasing each quarter and I guess, driving a lot of that rate of return growth, as you think about the Bone Springs part. The Avalon, when you look at it, certainly as we moved east this year in '12, we have become more oily with that model, and that's a reflection -- the rates of return there are reflection of that.","John Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then if I shift gears to the southern Delaware where...","Timothy A. Leach","John, let me add one thing on that rate of return. Those rate of returns were calculated using capital costs that were used in our capital budget we prepared last November. So the costs have come down since we prepared that, and we believe they'll continue to come down. So I think those rates of return will continue to go up just due to capital costs.","John Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","And then for the southern Delaware, you've drilled 9 horizontals there. You had 4 that looked pretty strong wells, but we're still not including any of those in our identified drilling locations. Maybe if you could just sort of elaborate, is it just a timing issue? It's too early? Anything you could sort of elaborate on that?","Timothy A. Leach","Yes, I think that we're still very high on that area. I still think it's early to do the end zone dance. We have plenty to talk about in the northern Delaware Basin, and I just think it's very early for such a large acreage position to go out and for us to start flapping our arms over a number of locations and what the EURs are going to be. I'll tell you quite frankly, with that much land and the wells we've drilled there, I don't know yet what the final EURs of those wells are going to be. But we still are pretty optimistic about it.","Operator","Your next question is coming from the line of Ryan Oatman, SunTrust.","Ryan Oatman - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","It looks like the company's replaced some vertical Yeso locations with horizontal ones. Can you talk about whether you're seeing greater success across the New Mexico Shelf with the Yeso? And what type of cost recovery and spacing assumptions we should be thinking about for horizontal Yeso development?","E. Joseph Wright","When you compare the rates of return on those verticals and those horizontals, I think in our new -- investor presentation on Page 11, you'll see the rates of return there. The horizontal Yeso have a very nice rate of returns, better than our vertical Yeso. When you think about spacing, we're drilling those basically on 40s at the moment. We will downspace that at some point. Cost wise, it's running between $3 million and $4 million. That cost is dropping. Though I think we'll be between $3 million, $3.5 million as we progress through the year.","Ryan Oatman - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","And what kind of recovery should we expect there?","E. Joseph Wright","You know our general model is somewhere between 300,000 and 350,000.","Operator","Your next question is coming from the line of Pearce Hammond, Simmons & Company.","Pearce W. Hammond - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Tim, we've heard that the A&D market in the Permian right now is a little bit saturated. Is that your experience or your view of it right now? And are there still plenty of privately -- the potential for private negotiated deals in the Permian?","Timothy A. Leach","Right. I mean, let me say that since we're solely focused in the Permian, we feel like we ought to be familiar with every deal that's out there. There are a lot of opportunities in the Permian right now. There's a lot of interest in the Permian. Yes, there are a lot of the same kind of opportunities that we've had that -- where we've traditionally built our company around. There's still some of those out there. I would only add that because of our large drilling inventory of high rate of return projects, that this is more of a year of execution for us. The bar has been raised pretty high on what a acquisition brings to us to make it attractive.","Pearce W. Hammond - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","And then can you provide any color on the horizontal Wolfcamp and Upton County on any of the wells that you've drilled there?","Timothy A. Leach","Yes. Well, we're not -- we are on -- we're drilling our third I think, and we haven't talked about individual wells yet. I think we talked about having success and it being a strategy that we're pursuing to convert maybe some of the downspaced increased density wells to capture those reserves more through horizontals at a higher rate of return. That appears to be on track.","Operator","Your next question is coming from the line of Arun Jayaram, Credit Suisse.","Arun Jayaram - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Impressive results on the Delaware given those 30-day rates. Were those well results -- you show 3 different areas in your presentation on 14. Were those concentrated in any 1 of those 3 areas? Or are they throughout the acreage position, the 800 Boe per day 30-day rate?","E. Joseph Wright","Yes, this is Joe. I was just checking at Slide 14. When you think about what they did and where we drilled in 2012, we did most of our activity down in the southern Lea County area and then over in the Lea County, kind of the middle part of that county. So when you think about really kind of as we move the ball in 2012 with additional locations, that's really where a lot of that add came from.","Timothy A. Leach","But he's asking about the 25 new ones we just reported. They're pretty well spread around...","E. Joseph Wright","Yes, and they would be spread out through those areas.","Arun Jayaram - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Fair enough. And just one question from the buy side I've gotten a little bit of is just looking at the PV-10. You guys did announce the Three Rivers acquisition last year, and I guess one of the questions that are on buy side is that the PV-10 went down, a little bit of a surprise there. So I was wondering if you could comment about overall value creation through the drillbit in 2012. Obviously, there are some limitations thinking about the SEC rules. I just wanted to -- Tim, if you could comment on that?","Timothy A. Leach","Yes. Well, the PV-10 reflects mostly the proven reserves. Gas prices were down. The differential on the liquids prices on the gas were down. That was the biggest effect on the PV-10. And then the PV-10 also reflects a fairly substantial divestiture of PDP properties.","E. Joseph Wright","And even if -- and I'd like to add, too, on that. If you ran that -- look at that PV at last year's pricing, it would be $9.3 billion. So it would be up substantially.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Ryan Todd, Deutsche Bank.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","A question for you on inventory and rig activity in the Bone Springs. You meaningfully increased your inventory in the northern Delaware and in particular in the Bone Springs. Can you talk to maybe a little bit what were some of the assumptions that you're using around the inventory in the Bone Springs? Maybe how much acreage is applicable if there's a spacing assumption or if they're all engineered locations? And then, finally, you've got a massive inventory life there. How do you view potential for acceleration going forward?","Timothy A. Leach","Sure, let me start with that, and I may call on Price to help me with some of those questions. But I think we handle our inventory maybe different than other companies, so when we talk about a well count in inventory, it's an engineered location that we know that we can go drill. So we're not doing acreage math. The pace with which we're drilling, we have started the process of taking every available dollar and moving it into the Delaware Basin. So we've underspent in the Yeso and the Wolfberry in order to move that cash flow over to the Delaware. And I think as you see the quarters roll along, you will see us continue to increase our activity and accelerate our pace in the Delaware, not only because that's the highest rate of return thing on the -- on our portfolio right now, but that's the newest area of discovery. So we're in -- and I would say that the economics ought to be improving because we're still just beginning to get the manufacturing process of getting these wells drilled. So I think you'll see the pace pick up there.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And in terms of the determining factor in the pace, is -- I mean, when you look at this year, is it effectively commodity price\/cash flow that's going to dictate?","Timothy A. Leach","That gives me a great opportunity to give the grow within cash flow commercial. So we start out with our estimated cash flow, and our attempt this year is going to be to show this growth by staying within cash flow. We're executing $1.6 billion capital budget. So yes, it's based on an oil price assumption. I mean, there's really 2 big factors. It's oil and gas prices and then the capital cost and the direction those things are heading. So right now it seems like we have a little -- the oil price is running a little bit better than what we budgeted around, and also, I think capital costs are a little bit lower than we entered the year with. So things are looking pretty good.","Operator","Your next question is coming from the line of Mario Barraza, Tuohy Brothers.","Mario Barraza - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Just wanted to follow up a bit on the Midland Basin side. I'd -- when will we get an update on the horizontal performance and on the Wolfcamp? Is it still -- are you still thinking the back half of this year when we could hear potential inventory numbers?","Timothy A. Leach","Yes. I mean, we've got a lot of our drilling in the Midland Basin. It's going to be moving the horizontal. So the back half of the year is a more reasonable time to think an update from us, but you're good to get plenty of information on the Midland Basin from other operators if that's their main activity level. But we've got great acreage over there. We picked up some more good acreage from Three Rivers. We've got horizontal wells drilling in all parts of our acreage over there, so the Delaware is our primary focus.","Mario Barraza - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Okay. And with the ramp-up in the Delaware, have you secured the midstream infrastructure if you were to further accelerate drilling activity there?","Timothy A. Leach","No. I mean, generally, I think the answer to your question is we're not a midstream operator. Now we will build out gathering facilities, especially in frontier areas where those kind of infrastructure things don't exist. We will participate more than we've had in the past in building, gathering and roads and electrical, those kind of things.","Operator","Your next question is coming from the line of David Tameron, Wells Fargo.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Tim, can you talk about -- we've heard -- I know Rich Kinder was out there talking about oil potentially going west out of Texas to California longer term. Can you just talk about -- do you guys have any plans for rail capacity? Or how you look at that bigger picture down the road 3 to 5 years? Any comment on that?","Timothy A. Leach","Yes, I'll comment. I'll let Joe jump in. But in general, I think that our strategy is to provide as many outlets for our crude coming out of the Permian as possible. And I think as you look out for the time frame that you're talking about, I think there's going to be ample capacity to go in many different directions, which I think will help our pricing out here. You want to talk any specifics around that?","E. Joseph Wright","Yes. Let me -- just so you know, in that same line is that we do move some of our crude by rail today. That's just trying to establish that link to that kind of service. And as Tim said, we're looking for options, many different options out of the basin.","Operator","Your next question is coming from the line of Irene Haas, Wunderlich Securities.","Irene O. Haas - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","A question on southern Delaware Basin. You guys have been probably one of the first movers down there, and my question for you is are you testing most of those zones one at a time and how many zones have you tested? And the Reeves County play, does it extend into Pecos County? And specifically, is this an area that has some challenges in terms of drilling? Is it a difficult area to drill? And also, when could we reasonably expect first production?","Timothy A. Leach","I couldn't could understand what you were saying, Irene. You're breaking up on the telephone a little bit.","Irene O. Haas - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","Okay. Can you hold for a second? Let me try something else. Can you hear me better?","Timothy A. Leach","Yes, I think so. Okay, try again.","L. Price Moncrief","Maybe one question at a time.","Irene O. Haas - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","The question is in southern Delaware Basin, how many zones have you tested? And does the play in Reeves County connect into Pecos County? Is it a difficult area? Any sort of technical challenges in drilling these wells because due probably to overpressure? And then when could we reasonably expect first production in such case?","Timothy A. Leach","Okay. Primarily the zones that we're drilling in the southern Delaware is the Wolfcamp zone. Although, we are beginning to test the Bone Spring section and it had good shows in that as well -- but that's -- right now it's a Wolfcamp exercise for us. We are drilling over in the Pecos County. We have plans for about 2 rigs running around the clock or throughout the year, both in Reeves and Pecos County in that section of our acreage. As we move into Pecos County, that has historically been a less drilled area with more -- when you say technical problems, it's a little bit tougher drilling in Pecos probably than it is in Reeves, not necessarily pressures, but there's other rig problems in that area. So I mean we're kind of -- that kind of dictates our pace a little bit to make sure that we -- the first well that we drill out there, we're proceeding with caution.","Irene O. Haas - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","And what was the reasonable time frame in such case and actually see first production from this part of the basin?","Timothy A. Leach","Well, I mean, we're already making a well out of this part of the basin, but as far as seeing some to start moving the needle for Concho, with the amount of capital we're putting in, the number of rigs we have running down there, it'd probably be the end of this year.","Operator","Your next question is a follow-up from the line of Arun Jayaram, Credit Suisse.","Arun Jayaram - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Tim, there's been some concern or talk about the Longhorn Pipeline reversal, a slight delay there. I was just wondering if you could -- Devon talked a little bit about this on their call. Can you give us an update on what you're hearing on Longhorn?","Timothy A. Leach","Okay. I'll turn that over to Joe.","E. Joseph Wright","Yes, we're not hearing of any delays on our end. We've already -- have had some crude move into that line. Certainly, there's a fill-up period, so that's going to take a while. But that's moving pretty well. And what we're seeing kind of generally with crude is things are moving a whole lot better out of the basin right now.","Arun Jayaram - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And second question for Tim, EOG Resources had an interesting update on the Delaware Basin, and I was just wondering, Tim, if -- I don't know if you listen to them but if you could maybe comment on potential read-throughs to your acreage position?","Timothy A. Leach","Oh, I mean, I don't like reading through anybody else's business, but I would just tell you it doesn't surprise me that a good operator like EOG likes the Delaware. I mean that -- there's plenty of opportunity out there. It's a great fit for a company that can run a drilling machine, and there are so many zones to drill, too. It's not surprising, and our acreage is in and around all the stuff they're doing. So we're glad other companies agree with us. It is a great place to be.","Operator","Your next question is coming from the line of Brian Singer, Goldman Sachs.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","A couple of questions and I apologize for joining late. But first, in the southern Delaware Basin, can you just talk about production mix there, how oily that is and whether you see variability around that and whether you expect that to change as wells go through their life?","Timothy A. Leach","You want to talk about that or answer that?","E. Joseph Wright","Yes. Brian, this is Joe. Really our oil mix down there is real high. We're looking at 75% plus. The -- and I think that's going to probably hold true to the Wolfcamp and the Bone Springs down in that area. You had a second part to the question.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Well, the second part was whether it changes over time or whether it stays -- it should stay constant as the well goes through its life.","E. Joseph Wright","That's certainly dependent on the interval. Maybe within the Wolfcamp, it might change, but we don't think it's going to change. We're pretty oily.","Timothy A. Leach","But I would remind you, for the total area, Brian, that there are areas that we think are gassier. And it's early, but when we were acquiring our acreage down there, we were trying to use our best judgment to stay in those oily areas.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And then in the Midland Basin, just between the wells that -- well or wells that you may have drilled that there's not necessarily a lot of granularity onto the public, and then the wells that others have drilled on the northern and central Midland Basin that were -- that they are obvious to the public. Can you just talk about whether you have any greater or less confidence in the potential horizontal expansion up in that direction?","Timothy A. Leach","Let's see. We've had success drilling horizontally on our acreage in the Wolfberry. As we said early on, where our acreage is positioned, we think the Wolfcamp is better reservoir rock on that edge of the basin than it is in the center of the basin. So there's a lot of oil in place. We have had some of the results as what you're reading from the rest of industry.","Operator","Your next question is a follow-up from the line of Pearce Hammond, Simmons & Company.","Pearce W. Hammond - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Yes, Tim, just a quick follow-up. I'm just curious about what you're seeing on service cost and service availability in the Permian right now in general as you look out in 2013.","Timothy A. Leach","I like the direction it's going. And since that's Joe's business, I'll turn it over to him.","E. Joseph Wright","Yes, Pearce, trending down, I think we're pretty pleased with where service costs are going today. A lot of the very big rigs, those rates are coming down on a day basis. High prices are coming down. When we think about all the extra frac fleets out here, those costs, the trend is down. The big thing right now, I'd say, is we're not waiting on services at all. Everybody is meeting demand currently.","Pearce W. Hammond - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","All right.

My name is Lisa, and I\u2019ll be your coordinator for today. Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following the prepared remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions)","I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Price Moncrief, Vice President of Capital Markets and Strategy for opening remarks. Please proceed.","Price Moncrief","","Good morning. Thank you for joining us. This morning Concho issued a press release announcing an underwritten public offering of common stock. We will not discuss that offering on this call or take any questions about it. We refer you to our press release and the prospectus supplement filed this morning with the SEC.","In addition, we have a hard stop today at 10.45 Eastern. Before we get started with Concho\u2019s first quarter conference call, I'd like to take a minute to direct your attention to the disclaimers, including the forward-looking statement disclaimer contained in our press release.","In summary, the forward-looking statement disclaimer says that statements in this morning\u2019s press release and on this conference call regarding the company\u2019s or management's expectations or predictions of the future are forward-looking statements intended to be covered by the Safe Harbor provisions under the federal securities laws.","There are many factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations, including those we described in the press release, our 10-K and other filings with the SEC. In addition, we will reference certain non-GAAP measures, so please see the reconciliations in our earnings release.","I\u2019m going to quickly turn this call over to Tim Leach, but before I do I\u2019d like to point out that in addition to our earnings release, we have posted a presentation to accompany this conference call, which can be found on our website at concho.com.","On the agenda today, Tim will cover our first quarter results and highlights, provide an operations update, and discuss our expanding midstream strategy, which now features our first midstream JV. Members of our management team will be available at the end of the call for Q&A.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Tim.","Tim Leach","","Good morning. If you follow along with me in our earnings presentation, I\u2019m going to start on Slide 4. The first quarter of our 2x3 growth plan is off to a terrific start. We reported record EBITDAX of over $480 million for the first time in the company\u2019s history. We averaged over 100,000 BOEs per day in a quarter. In fact, we produced about 102,000 BOEs per day during the first quarter which is above the high end of our guidance range and is 5% over the previous quarter.","Our crude oil mix during the quarter is right around 64%, which is also at the high end of our annual guidance. The early success of our growth plan is attributed primarily to our impressive well performance as well as improved operational efficiencies. While we\u2019re on track with our annual capital budget through the first three months of the year, it\u2019s clear that we\u2019ll complete our original $2.3 billion budget earlier than expected.","By maintaining our activity level through the end of the year, we expect to drill more net wells and we\u2019ll add approximately $300 million to our \u201814 capital budget. We\u2019re also increasing our annual \u201814 production growth guidance range to 20% to 24%, up from 18% to 22% and expect to see even more barrels arrive in \u201815 as a result of the incremental capital investment, which is weighted towards the second half of \u201814.","With respect to our quarterly production guidance, we expect to average somewhere between 104,000 and 108,000 BOEs per day during the second quarter. This range reflects our expectation that the second quarter is typically a peak turnaround season for gas processors and refiners. And we continue to see our rate of growth accelerating in the second half of \u201814.","Among the highlights of our most recent quarter is our well performance. We set new company records in the northern Delaware Basin for average 30-day and peak 24-hour IP rates. In addition, our southern Delaware Basin and Midland Basin horizontal wells continue to deliver consistently strong results.","The New Mexico Shelf is an area in which we\u2019ve allocated minimal capital in the last year due to infrastructure constraints. But that situation continues to improve and we\u2019re planning to allocate additional capital there in the second half of this year. Finally, we\u2019re moving forward with a midstream strategy that has both economic and strategic objectives. And this morning\u2019s announcement of our first midstream investment in the northern Delaware Basin is a significant step toward accomplishing those objectives.","Let\u2019s turn to Slide 5 now for an update on our 2x3 growth plan. I\u2019ve said before that the key to the success of our plan is execution. And we\u2019re very pleased with the way we\u2019re executing at the outset of the plan.","We\u2019re right on track to achieve our three-year execution goals to ultimately double production in \u201816. In this commodity price and service cost environment, we\u2019ll continue to delever. I\u2019ll speak more specifically about our operating efficiencies in just a minute but the improvements we are seeing are enabling us to accomplish more than we originally planned. As a result of our faster pace, we\u2019re increasing our annual production growth rate guidance range in \u201814 to 20% to 24%.","Over to Slide 6, through the first quarter, we spent approximately $540 million, excluding acquisitions, which is in line with our first-quarter capital expectations. However, we\u2019re proceeding through our development program faster and more efficiently than expected, primarily due to improved drilling times, additional frac crews and shortened spread to sales cycles in each of our major horizontal areas. ","Today, we\u2019re operating 33 rigs, 29 of which are horizontal and expect to average 33 to 35 rigs over the remainder of the year. That\u2019s fewer than we originally planned, and expect that we\u2019ll not only complete our original \u201814 development plan ahead of schedule, but also have the operational capacity to do more. All of this is really good news.","The initial ramp phase during the first quarter proceeded better than expected. Our horizontal rig count increased from 18 in the fourth quarter to 30 in the first quarter and now represents one of the Permian Basin\u2019s largest and most efficient horizontal drilling operations. Plus, we are just in the first year of a three-year growth plan. In order to maintain that activity level through the end of \u201814 and into \u201815, we expect we can drill approximately 40 more net wells than we originally budgeted in \u201814.","The capital associated with these additional wells is approximately $300 million. While we\u2019ve not established \u201815 production guidance or changed our three-year growth objective, we expect that accelerating our execution timing will have positive implications to our growth plan.","Our motivation to accelerate the development of our capital is driven by our continued execution strength across our assets, and Slide 7 really illustrates the success we\u2019re having in the northern Delaware Basin. We\u2019ve now drilled 276 horizontal wells in this area and our results have been very consistent while lateral lengths have averaged between 4,000 to 4,500 feet.","We set new records during the first quarter in terms of average rates. The 39 new wells averaged over 400 BOEs per day over the first 30 days, 74% crude oil and nearly 1,500 BOEs on a peak 24-hour basis. The average lateral length for those wells was about 4,500 feet, meaning that on a 30-day basis our first-quarter wells averaged 200 BOEs per 1,000 foot of lateral while the average of all our northern Delaware wells is 184 BOEs per 1,000 feet of lateral. All those rates are among the best in the northern Delaware and are on a two-stream production basis.","Equally impressive is the fact that during the first quarter of \u201814 we averaged over 42,000 BOEs per day in our horizontal Delaware asset representing 18% growth over the fourth quarter of \u201813. The added drilling capital in the northern Delaware is approximately $130 million, bringing our total drilling budget here to about $1.2 billion.","Our plan in the northern Delaware for the remainder of \u201814 is to continue to define and delineate new areas and zones, evaluate increased well density and test the potential for improved efficiencies through pad drilling, stimulation design and long lateral development. The Delaware Basin is an exciting area and our success is not limited to just the northern portion of the play.","Let\u2019s turn to Slide 8 and talk about the southern Delaware. We\u2019re delivering some impressive well results in the southern Delaware. We now have 28 wells online with an average 30-day IP rate of 1,014 BOEs per day, 79% crude oil and an average 24-hour peak rate of 1,340 BOEs. The average lateral length on all those wells was 4,714 feet, meaning 220 BOEs per 1,000 foot of lateral on a 30-day basis. These averages represent all of our southern Delaware wells including our exploration wells in the South Harpoon area.","Our most recent seven wells from the first quarter had an average 30-day IP rate of over 1,100 BOEs per day and an average 24-hour peak rate of over 1,450 BOEs with a lateral length averaging just 4,385 feet, which is a robust 255 BOEs per 1,000 foot of lateral on a 30-day basis. Again these rates are amongst the best in the southern Delaware and are on a two-stream stream production basis.","As part of our capital budget expansion, we\u2019re adding approximately $100 million of drilling capital to our southern Delaware program bringing our total \u201814 capital allocation here to $450 million.","Let\u2019s turn to Slide 9 and touch on the Midland Basin where we continue to find ways to optimize our completion techniques. Our reduced cluster spacing tests are showing encouraging signs. Our latest six new wells during the first quarter recorded an average 30-day IP rate of 714 BOEs per day, 83% crude oil and an average 24-hour peak rate of 1,115 BOEs with a lateral length averaging approximately 5,000 feet, meaning 143 BOEs per 1,000 foot of lateral on a 30-day basis.","Our activity remains concentrated in the Wolfcamp A and B but we had plans to spud our first horizontal Spraberry by the third quarter and test deeper Wolfcamp benches later in \u201814. Our \u201814 capital budget in the Midland Basin is now just over $500 million.","An area that we\u2019ve not discussed lately is the New Mexico Shelf shown on Slide 10. The theme here during 2013 was takeaway and processing bottlenecks. A year later, those issues have improved significantly. This is a reminder that Mexico Shelf is a world-class asset with higher rate of return horizontal and vertical drilling opportunities.","It\u2019s been a major platform and has funded our growth in the Delaware and the Midland Basins. We\u2019ve drilled over 1,500 successful vertical wells and over 100 successful horizontal wells here targeting the Paddock and Blinebry zones in the Yeso formation. Today, we are running a horizontal program primarily focused on the lower Paddock zone with successful wells spread across the Yeso fairway and down through the Southwest extension.","We\u2019re also having success with the horizontal Blinebry in the Yeso fairway and later this quarter, we\u2019ll spud our first horizontal Blinebry in the Southwest extension. We are currently running just two horizontal rigs. This is an asset that still has room to run at attractive economics. As we continue to see improved infrastructure support in the Shelf, we are allocating more capital here in the second half of the year.","I\u2019d like end on Slide 11 and describe an expanded strategic initiative for Concho. As one of the Permian Basin\u2019s largest producers, developing a more comprehensive midstream and marketing solution is critical to building long-term value.","Our midstream strategy\u2019s primary objectives are to secure physical transportation of our product to the best markets available and improve the prices we realized for our crude oil and natural gas production at the well head. Our first midstream project serves both objectives while providing the option to realize additional value down the road.","The partnership will construct and operate a crude oil transportation system that connects to virtually every Concho tank battery in the northern Delaware Band provide us delivery point flexibility. Currently, all of our northern Delaware barrels are transported via truck to various pipelines and refiners. While this is our first direct investment in a midstream project, I don\u2019t expect it will be the last as we continue to seek other opportunities that meet our strategic objectives.","In summary, this is a record quarter for Concho and our three-year plan is ahead of schedule. We continue to be encouraged by our operational results and are excited about the rest of the year.","So with that, I appreciate your continued interest in our company, I look forward to taking your questions.","Question-And-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) And your first question is from the line of Matthew Portillo of PTH. Please go ahead.","Matthew Portillo - PTH","","Just two quick questions from me. ","Tim Leach","","Matt, before you get started can I clarify something? I misspoke on Slide 7. The 39 new wells that we brought on averaged -- I think I said 400 BOEs per day, I meant 900.","Matthew Portillo - PTH","On a 30-day basis?","Tim Leach","On a 30-day basis. So that was a typo in my head I guess. So if you\u2019re following that, it was 900 not 400. So go ahead with your question Matt, I\u2019m sorry.","Matthew Portillo - PTH","Just alongside kind of the acceleration you guys have talked about here, I was wondering if you could maybe just provide a little bit more context of how you think about kind of continuing to accelerate that growth over the next year or two and as you guys kind of delever the balance sheet how we should think about some of your leverage targets here? Just trying to get a better sense of the ability to accelerate and pull forward some of that value that you clearly highlighted with the deep inventory depth you have.","Tim Leach","I think one of the major messages this quarter we just had is our ability to do more and the efficiencies we are seeing in our operations. So the additional capital for this year will fund 40 new net wells and the production of those 40 new wells will affect 2014\u2019s production.","We\u2019ve increased our guidance there but more importantly it will affect \u201815 and beyond. And I think the efficiencies we\u2019re seeing this year also will continue to accelerate and carry into \u201915 and \u201916. So I think we come out of the first quarter very confident about our ability to deliver the plan that we discussed and I think we have growing confidence that we can do more than that plan outlined.","Matthew Portillo - PTH","And just my second quick follow-up question will be in regards to -- you highlighted some pretty clear improvements, it looks like, on your rates either on a per lateral foot basis or on a 30-day basis both in the northern and southern Delaware Basin. And I was wondering if you can just talk about, as you think about the about those, are those in relationship to your new completions you\u2019re using in the Basin and how those maybe potentially enhancing your rate of return?","Tim Leach","I think that we are seeing better results for a number of reasons; larger frac jobs, stages that are closer together, longer lateral lengths and a better understanding of where to land the lateral and the section. So I just think the learning curve that we describe to you over time is continuing to pay off for us and these wells continue to get better for a number of reasons and I think when you look at the entire Permian Basin, the areas where we\u2019re located are some of the best rock in the Permian Basin.","Operator","And moving on to our next question, it\u2019s from the line of Brian Singer of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs","Just one question, looking at Slide 13 and 14 and then looking at the strength of your well performance that you highlighted, it looks like it\u2019s the Second Bone Spring that consistently in the northern Delaware Basin was where we saw an increase in the 30-day rates. Can you talk more to that one, is there something unique that you\u2019re doing there or seeing there and can you talk to the aerial extent across both the State Line acreage and the Lusk, Deep, Red Hills block in terms of how widely you\u2019ve tested there?","Tim Leach","The Second Bone Spring is a zone in the Bone Spring where most of our capital is going and as we drill more wells there, our results continue to improve and the second Bone Spring has enlarged in an aerial extended; it is in all of our major areas. That\u2019s not the takeaway from these other zones. I mean I think that as we drilled the zone first, we are continuing to drill other wells in the Third Bone Spring and in the Wolfcamp and the Avalon. And I think over time, those zones will be just as important to our company and just as productive.","But right now, the Second Bone Spring is our primary target, it\u2019s where most of the capital is going and we continue to invest additional capital, marginal capital in these other zones to delineate and to find them as well. That\u2019s the comment I made about the focus of our drilling being to delineate and expand our inventory count, that\u2019s kind of what that gets to.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs","Is there anything you are doing on the completion front? Just noticed that your average lateral length looked like it came down on State Line and yet your 30-day IP went up for the incremental wells. Or are you drilling closely to where you've already drilled successful wells? Or are there any more specifics on that zone and what you've done on State Line?","Tim Leach","It\u2019s a mixture of both those. I will say that the answer to most frac questions is pump more sand and that\u2019s what\u2019s happening here as well.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Scott Hanold of RBC. Please go ahead.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets","I was hoping you could give a little bit more color on some of the infrastructure additions you are going to have, or the joint venture. What do you perceive as the potential cost savings of moving the volume through the pipelines from the tank battery versus trucking?","Tim Leach","I mean for us this is a particularly interesting opportunity because the pipeline has its own economics that it generates from tariffs on the pipeline. But at the same time, connecting all these tank batteries directly to a pipeline is much more efficient and it removes and reduces that trucking cost. There is more efficiencies than just the trucks, I mean you get it on an automatic measuring system and things like that. So and that has direct economic benefit to Concho outside of this pipeline project.","In addition to this, Eddy and Lea County, New Mexico are going to be a major source of new production development. This pipeline will move between 100,000 and 120,000 barrels a day and it\u2019s in our strategic interest to see that this pipeline is built and by being involved in it, we can make sure that our wells are connected and that our interests are protected in getting this pipeline positioned. So I\u2019m really happy about this project. It also will allow us to gather our production at one point and then give us multiple options on what markets we can send it to.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets","That's some great color. And so, it sounds like then, when you look at it, you are producing about 42 a day in the northern Delaware Basin from horizontal Delaware stuff. So, there's a lot of capacity to help bring third-party stuff in there too. Is that what I'm hearing, as well?","Tim Leach","Yes, that\u2019s right. And that 42 is -- that\u2019s a net number as well.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets","On your rig counts going forward, it sounds like you've got some better operational efficiencies going on there because you are able to kind of do more with less. Where are you really seeing some of the savings? Is it drill time? Is it rig moves? Is it completion times? Where are you seeing some of the most efficiencies coming into play?","Tim Leach","The drilling times have come down dramatically, but probably the biggest cost savings in addition to drilling times -- we\u2019ve just added our fifth frac crew that\u2019s working 24 hours a day. And the way we plan our business and the way we work with the pressure pumping companies really allows that to become an efficient operation. And so that\u2019s one of the benefits of scale that we can plan our business to allow these frac crews to work around the clock.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets","Can you give us a comparison on what -- and I know you have different formations you're targeting, but your core -- your big focus right now is the Second Bone Spring. What does a typical well cost now, say, to what it costs a quarter or two ago?","Tim Leach","Compared to a quarter, things are changing so much. I told you that the frac design pumps more sand, that\u2019s more expensive, but it makes a better well. The lateral lengths continue to increase. That costs more, but makes a better well. But I think we\u2019ve said on the whole if you compare it to six months ago, we\u2019re something like that. Per foot of completed lateral is something like that. We\u2019re probably down 10% to 20%.","Part of it too is what area are you talking about because as we get more confidence around these wells, you get not only efficiency with your suppliers, but you also get efficiency and how you drill the wells and that drives your cost down also.","Operator","Moving on to our next question, it\u2019s from the line of Ryan Oatman of SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Ryan Oatman - SunTrust","With the Brushy Canyon wells, it looked like you all stepped out in the past quarter. Can you describe how the wells literally on that State Line with Culberson County and then further east into Lea County compared with those first tests that you've drilled?","Tim Leach","My first point on the Brushy Canyon is it\u2019s early, I think we only have eight wells in the dataset. My second point is we\u2019re still very encouraged about the potential of the Brushy Canyon as being the shallowest and oiliest zone, the step outs were successful, but I think we knew all along that they would produce water and in some places, it looks like these will be the kind of wells that you get your entire frac load back before you cut oil and then the oil rate builds over time.","So a little bit different profile than when you have a 30-day IP and then it goes on a dramatic decline right away. So these wells are new. There is not a whole lot of data we are encouraged and -- but it\u2019s depending on where you are, I think the profile of the well production is going to be different.","Ryan Oatman - SunTrust","So, these Brushy Canyon wells are similar to, say, what we see from some of the other operators on the Midland Basin side with the Spraberry, in terms of how they kind of clean up over time. I guess speaking to that, have you guys set the location for your first Spraberry test, and kind of what your pre-drill expectations are for those wells relative to your Wolfcamp wells?","Tim Leach","Yes, but we haven\u2019t publicly talked about it.","Ryan Oatman - SunTrust","And then one final one for me. Guidance for 2014 differentials is unchanged. Yet we are seeing some weakness here in the second quarter. Can you talk about what gives you confidence in differentials moving forward, kind of what drives the expectation for things to get better?","Tim Leach","I think the biggest driver for us in the Permian is this BridgeTex line as supposed to come on in July. So I think most folks that are working on those differentials are thinking that we will have improved differentials once the oil starts flowing on BridgeTex.","Joe Wright","LongHorn expansion, too, is right behind that.","Operator","","Our next question is from the line of Pearce Hammond of Simmons. Please go ahead.","Pearce Hammond - Simmons & Company","Tim, can you provide an update on service cost right now in the Permian, especially given the big rig ramp we've seen from a bunch of different producers?","Tim Leach","Yes. I think if you\u2019re not a close follower of the Permian, the rig count has gone up by 100 in the last year. And so I think for most operators in the Permian, more rig activity translates to higher costs and I think you\u2019ve heard some of that. I think that one of the great things about being Concho is that with our scale and our efficiency, we haven\u2019t really experienced that up to this point.","Pearce Hammond - Simmons & Company","And then can you provide some color on the LOE guidance range? I saw that it was increased just slightly. You mentioned an increase in activity across the Permian and then certain related infrastructure challenges.","Tim Leach","Yes. I think that the increased guidance on the LOE is primarily driven by these new wells that we\u2019re bringing on that we\u2019re more frequently now running electrical submersible pumps into the hole to move more volume. Those typically generate higher LOE in the early time and then the saltwater disposal costs until we get in -- we\u2019ve had so much new oil come on in these areas that we\u2019re still drilling infrastructure to get the saltwater disposals in. So the increased costs primarily are electricity costs for the submersible pumps and also disposal costs of that saltwater. I do think that long-term that\u2019s a range that we can maintain though.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Michael Hall of Heikkinen Energy Advisors. Please go ahead.","Michael Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","I just wanted to hit on the Southern Delaware a little bit. You had some good updated results there. How would you characterize what you are seeing in the Northern Harpoon area versus Big Chief and Southern Harpoon, currently, any additional characterization across the results from those areas?","Tim Leach","I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s any additional characterization over what we\u2019ve given in the last quarter, I mean our wells in North Harpoon are very, very good wells. Our wells in Big Chief are very, very good wells. So the wells we\u2019re drilling down at Big Chief tend to be on big leases and therefore allow us to drill longer laterals and -- but that entire area is really something we\u2019re excited about. And some of the acreage that we\u2019ve added recently to our company has been down in that Big Chief area so that\u2019s a real area of focus for us.","Michael Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","","Then, on the additional 40 wells, are those -- am I kind of reading it right that maybe a third of that would be in the Northern Del, and then kind of spread the rest of it evenly across Southern Del, Midland, and the New Mexico Shelf, is that --?","Tim Leach","I think that the additional 40 wells should be distributed about the same way as the capital is being distributed throughout our capital budget, so more focused on the northern Delaware Basin.","Michael Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","Then last one on my end, as it relates to the additional spend in \u201814, should we kind of expect those levels of activity to just continue to ride forward? Any additional commentary there?","Tim Leach","Yes. Well, I think, as I said on the call, that I think that the efficiencies we are seeing will carry into \u201815 and \u201816 and beyond. So I think being able to deploy billions and billions of dollars of capital at 50% to 60% rates of return is really the big value proposition here and the faster we can do that and the more we can bring that forward I think it\u2019s just creates a better business.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Jason Smith of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Jason Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","On the Wolfcamp, it looks like you drilled a few more wells in the State Line area. Can you just talk about the crude quality you are seeing there and maybe crude quality elsewhere across your acreage?","Tim Leach","Sure. The Wolfcamp in the State Line area is the area that you probably heard of throughout the industry where the crude has a higher gravity, maybe 50 degree API that makes it closer to a condensate. We haven\u2019t drilled that many Wolfcamp wells in that area, but that would be my expectation.","Now that\u2019s to be contrasted with the Wolfcamp down in the southern Delaware Basin, that has more 40 gravity-type of crude oil and all the Bone Spring stuff we\u2019re doing and all the Yeso or on the Shelf is a crude quality of about 40 or so. And so really the only area that we are drilling in the Permian where we\u2019ve experienced that high gravity crude oil is the Wolfcamp kind of around the State Line area.","Jason Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And it looks like you focused mainly on the Wolfcamp. Do you so far have any plans to go further up and test the C and A this year?","Tim Leach","We have a modest Wolfcamp in the northern Delaware Basin budget, so we will be testing different zones, but not as aggressively and most of our capital is going into development of the Bone Spring section.","Jason Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","","And one last one. On the Shelf, you guys mentioned that you might look at adding another rig. Can you just maybe talk about the potential timing around that?","Tim Leach","I don\u2019t think I mentioned adding another rig. I think I mentioned just deploying more capital, so I think we can deploy more capital with the two rigs we have there and drill more horizontal wells as we move into the Southwestern extension of that field.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Jeffrey Campbell of Tuohy Brothers. Please go ahead.","Jeffrey Campbell - Tuohy Brothers","My first question was, as you pointed out in your preliminary remarks, you provided a wealth of data on average production rates and lateral length in your major plays. I was just wondering, do you have average stages per lateral handy for Northern Delaware, Southern Delaware, and Midland Basin?","Tim Leach","I\u2019m going to look around the table here, I\u2019m getting --.","Jeffrey Campbell - Tuohy Brothers","We could go off-line.","Tim Leach","Let\u2019s handle that one off-line.","Jeffrey Campbell - Tuohy Brothers","And my other question was going back to Big Chief. It looks like you are currently producing Wolfcamp A and Bone Spring. I was just wondering, do have exposure to any other zones of interest there? And, if so, when they might become exploration targets?","Tim Leach","We\u2019re working on that right now moving up the hole into the Bone Spring and also testing deeper Wolfcamp and that\u2019s going on currently.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Mike Kelly, Global Hunter. Please go ahead. Thank you.","Mike Kelly - Global Hunter","I was hoping you could just talk about your expectations for the South Harpoon area in the Southern Delaware Basin, if there's any notable geological differences between there and Big Chief in the North Harpoon area. Thank you.","Tim Leach","Yes. We\u2019ve talked a lot about that area and South Harpoon and as you move in that direction, you are getting shallower, the maturity of the clays change, but recently we\u2019ve drilled a couple of encouraging wells out there and we are adding to our database of understanding and we\u2019ll probably be doing more out there. But at some point, down in that region, I think you run into clay maturity at least in the Wolfcamp zone that will be a challenge.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of John Nelson of Citigroup. Please go ahead.","John Nelson - Citigroup","I wanted to build on an earlier question. I think at the time of the 3Q call you guys characterized the \u201815 and \u201816 CapEx budget, as a good placeholder, might be something like $2.6 billion. With the efficiency gains you guys are talking about today, would it be fair to say that there is potential upside to that number, but then also probably some higher production associated with it should we get there? Any color around \u201815 and \u201816, and how we should think about it?","Tim Leach","Yes, I think you described it accurately.","John Nelson - Citigroup","Any thoughts on how much higher that might be or just sort of wait and see?","Tim Leach","Well, we haven\u2019t given guidance for \u201815 or \u201916. I would just say that I think the levels that we\u2019re at now and the type of growth targets we have now will carry into those years and 2x3 plan that we talked about I think is very achievable.","John Nelson - Citigroup","And then just color on the New Mexico Shelf? You guys talked about a second half activity ramp. Any more details with regards to what that could be?","Tim Leach","No, it\u2019s not anything great. It\u2019s just deploying more capital there. We\u2019ve got several thousand locations left to drill there that are very high rate of returns. So we will be happy to get back to deploying capital on the Shelf and that crude oil is very high quality and is in a good location relative to where it\u2019s refined.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of James Sullivan of Alembic Global Advisor. Thank you.","James Sullivan - Alembic Global Advisor","I just want to go back for a second to the midstream JV. You guys had made a point a couple of times of saying that this is the first of what may be -- well, at least more than one agreement out there. Can you speak to whether this current agreement is geographically delimited in any way? And if it is, or if it isn't, where the kind of area of initial focus for the build-out, this first phase of the build-out, is.","Tim Leach","Sure. We have dedicated a substantial portion of our acreage in the northern Delaware Basin and Lea and Eddy county, New Mexico, to the project.","James Sullivan - Alembic Global Advisor","And, so, agreements beyond that would be in the same area? Or how does that work kind of in terms of the dedicated areas?","Tim Leach","This is for oil production. It\u2019s an oil pipeline and we\u2019ve talked about that we have infrastructure opportunities for both oil and gas and the southern Delaware Basin is also a greenfield area that there are opportunities to build-out and control your destiny on where your oil goes and the opportunities you have to move it to different markets.","James Sullivan - Alembic Global Advisor","The second thing was, obviously recognizing it's very early on this, but you guys did drill a couple of wells on the Delaware Ranch acreage, can you characterize that at all, beyond just that you drilled them? Is there a section thickness? Is there any color you can give on that?","Tim Leach","I don\u2019t think we\u2019re giving additional color there. I mean we\u2019re very pleased with that acreage. We\u2019re happy we\u2019ve got it, it\u2019s early and continuing to drill.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Richard Tullis of Capital One. Please go ahead.","Richard Tullis - Capital One","Just two quick questions. Tim, it looks like the last six wells drilled in Midland Basin horizontals took a pretty nice step up in average 30-day rate too. I know you've talked a lot about the Delaware Basin. But any talk or detail on those Midland Basin wells, and then what gets you a little more active in that Basin, as well?","Tim Leach","We, in our -- this year\u2019s capital budget plan to become more active. We\u2019ve got quite a few rigs dedicated to that activity. It\u2019s primarily in the Wolfcamp A and B. We\u2019re continuing to optimize frac designs, that\u2019s primarily the area where we\u2019re going with denser cluster spacings and that seems to be working quite well. So I think you can count on seeing that ramp up over time.","Richard Tullis - Capital One","And then, just lastly, I'm not sure if you mentioned this, what share of the cost -- the total cost for the oil transportation system in Northern Delaware Basin will Concho be funding? What percentage of the JV?","Tim Leach","We\u2019re currently about 50\/50 partnership.","Operator","And the last question is from the line of Joe Allman of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Joe Allman - JPMorgan","Tim, I think you gave an indication of the reduction in cost per 1,000 foot of lateral. But could you just give us some recent well costs on an absolute basis? So, for example, on your northern Delaware Basin, Second Bone Spring, what are some of those wells costing now versus six months ago? And what's the uptick in EURs versus six months ago or a year ago?","Tim Leach","I\u2019m going to turn it over to Joe. He is sitting across the table from me.","Joe Wright","Yes, Joe, this is Joe Wright. I think a good area to talk about the State Line where probably six to 12 months ago, those wells were costing about $5.6 million to drill a one mile lateral with kind of a typical stimulation job on it in the Second Bone Spring. Today that well is AFE-ing right around $5 million, to give you a good indication in that area. And those areas that are development like that, that\u2019s what we\u2019ve seen.","Joe Allman - JPMorgan","So, Joe, you are talking about a lower cost with a bigger frac?","Joe Wright","I\u2019m trying to compare the same size frac job, what I call, a typical job between that time frame you gave me.","Joe Allman - JPMorgan","With the bigger frac, how much are those wells costing these days?","Joe Wright","Where we can use a, what we had termed before, larger job, they can add somewhere around $1 million.","Joe Allman - JPMorgan","And what kind of uptick -- what EURs are we looking at, say, six months ago, for those wells? And what kind of EURs are you looking at with the bigger fracs?","Joe Wright","We\u2019ve not given any of those -- I don\u2019t believe we\u2019ve given any models on that up to this point.","Joe Allman - JPMorgan","Could you just describe on a percentage basis what the increase in EUR might be?","Joe Wright","Well, it\u2019s the same type of economics, if not, just a little bit better, so to give you a little handle there.","Operator","Thank you for your questions. I\u2019d now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Tim Leach for closing remarks. Thank you.","Tim Leach","Okay. Thank you again everybody, and I hope you can tell that our whole team is very excited about the first quarter and all the operational success we\u2019ve been having and we think this will carry well into \u201815 and \u201816 and I look forward to talking to you more about in the future.

My name is Lisa, and I'll be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.","I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Mr. Price Moncrief, Vice President of Capital Markets and Strategies. Please proceed.","L. Price Moncrief","Good morning, everyone. We're glad you could join us today for Concho's Third Quarter 2012 Conference Call. Before we get started, I would like direct your attention to the forward-looking statement disclaimer contained in the press release.","In summary, it says that statements in last night\u2019s press release and on this conference call that state the company\u2019s or management\u2019s expectations or predictions of the future are forward-looking statements intended to be covered by the Safe Harbor provisions under the federal securities laws. There are many factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations, including those we\u2019ve described in the press release, our 10-K and our other filings with the SEC.","In addition, we will reference certain non-GAAP measures, so be sure to see the reconciliations in our earnings release or our most recent investor presentation, which includes details on our 2013 capital budget and guidance. Both the earnings release and the investor presentation can be found on our website.","On today's call, I am joined by Tim Leach, our Chairman and CEO; and Joe Wright, our Chief Operating Officer, who will discuss, among other things, our third quarter results and 2013 budget and annual guidance. We're also joined by other members of our management team who will be available to answer questions later in the call.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Tim.","Timothy A. Leach","Good morning. I'm pleased that you could join us this morning as we review our third quarter results, provide an update on our recent drilling activity and detail our capital budget and production outlook for 2013.","As I'm sure you saw on last night's press release, the third quarter was a good quarter for Concho. We produced nearly 85,000 barrels per day and generated $387 million in EBITDAX, both all-time records for the company.","I'm especially pleased with the progress of our development strategy in the Delaware Basin, which now represents over 25% of our net production and continues to deliver sequential double-digit growth rates. It's a real driver of our growth and noteworthy considering this horizontal effort in the Delaware is barely 2 years old.","There's lots of exciting things happening in the Permian, and the Delaware is just an excellent example. I spoke to you last quarter about the advantages of being positioned in the Permian. I continue to believe that this is the place to be in terms of profitability and growth. At the same time, the Permian is going through a transformation and the playing field is rapidly evolving.","Against this backdrop of rapid changes, it's important to step back and reflect on our strategy, our results and then consider how we're positioned for the future.","Since inception, Concho has always focused on a rate of return growth. Our belief has been simple. We invest in high rate return projects that really work. The results should be strong profitable growth. This approach enables us to preserve our balance sheet, while remaining flexible enough to capture Permian opportunities when they develop. Historically, the strategy has delivered annual production growth in excess of 40%, about half of which has been organic and the other half from acquisitions.","Looking forward, I see no reason why that strategy in resulting organic production growth should change, given the increase in opportunities in the Permian. The efficiencies realized through horizontal development are real, and in the not-too-distant future, horizontal rig count will exceed vertical rig count in the Permian. That's truly a revolutionary change.","Today, half our operated rigs are drilling horizontal wells, thanks in large part, to many of the strategic moves we made over the last 12 months. Most notably, we have nearly doubled our footprint in the Delaware Basin through the acquisition of OGX, Three Rivers and other lease hold.","We've entered areas like the Southern Delaware Basin, the Southern Midland Basin and the Northern Midland Basin. We are a better company today because we've expanded the opportunities to reinvest capital across the Permian, without having to sacrifice returns. As a company that remains committed to returns, I cannot be more optimistic about Concho's ability to deliver consistently strong organic growth, while creating value for the shareholders.","As you probably read in the press release, we announced a 2013 capital budget of $1.6 billion. We expect to fund this budget largely within cash flow and deliver about 20% organic production growth.","It shouldn't surprise you that over 60% of next year's capital is dedicated to horizontal drilling, and that 1\/2 of the 30 rigs we expect operate next year are drilling horizontal wells.","Just a year ago, we outlined a smaller budget for 2012, which called for an average of 35 rigs and 20% growth.","The ability to invest more capital per rig and still deliver the same type of organic growth is a reflection of the operational and capital efficiencies achieved through horizontal drilling. It also means that we have the operational scale in place to deploy more rigs to accommodate their well performance, lower cost or reduced take away constraints.","Over the last few quarters, I've updated you on our progress in the Northern Delaware and I'm pleased to say that our results are continuing to improve.","Since our last earnings call, we've added 15 Northern Delaware Basin horizontal wells that have 30 days of production data, bringing our total horizontal wells in this area completed by Concho to 106, targeting 7 unique zones. The average 30-day IP rate of those 15 new wells was in excess of 750 Boes per day from single zone completions. 10 of those 15 wells were Bone Spring completions, with an average 30-day IP above 800 barrels a day and over 60% of that, crude oil. On the basis of EUR and rate of return, we think this area competes with anything going on in the Permian and most likely across the entire U.S. As a result, we will spend nearly half of our 2013 drilling budget in the Northern Delaware Basin.","Moving on to the Southern Delaware, our team now has 4 horizontal Wolfcamp wells with at least 30 days of production data. The average 30-day IP rate of those wells were 675 Boes per day, 84% of that being crude oil.","As a reminder, we have not included any drilling locations from the Southern Delaware in our most recent inventory count, but except -- but expect that we will add substantial locations as we continue to de-risk our 140,000-acre position. This will be in addition to the locations that we will add in the Northern Delaware Basin at the end of the year. So drilling inventory is not going to be a problem for Concho.","Before I hand things over to Joe for a more detailed review of our 2013 capital budget and operations, I'd like to highlight that we have recently signed a PSA to sell noncore assets for $520 million. Proceeds from this divestiture will be used to reduce borrowings under our credit facility and bring our pro forma leverage back within 2x EBITDA. But the biggest take away here is that the combination of acquiring assets from Three Rivers and subsequently selling noncore properties is consistent with our strategy of increasing our exposure to high rate of return drilling opportunities, while maintaining a conservative capital structure.","Going into '13, there are a lot of exciting things that are taking shape for Concho. I'm confident that we have a great strategy to consistently deliver profitable growth in the Permian. And I look forward to taking your questions at the end of the call.","I'll, now, turn things over to Joe.","E. Joseph Wright","Thanks, Tim. On the last quarter conference call, I outlined a plan for the balance of 2012 that called for a shift to horizontal drilling across our portfolio. Today, I'm pleased with that progress as over half our rigs are drilling horizontally. In the Delaware Basin, we currently have 11 rigs, 9 in the North and 2 in the South, all of which are horizontal.","The Yeso, which has, traditionally, been in a vertical play is currently running 3 horizontal rigs out of a total of 5. And over in Midland Basin, we'll continue to run 1 horizontal through the remainder of the year. The good news is that we've advanced this shift on a compressed timeline without having to adjust our 2012 capital budget or production guidance, and we expect to carry this momentum into 2013.","As Tim discussed earlier, our 2013 capital budget is $1.6 billion, of which $1.4 billion will go towards drilling in our 3 core areas, which I'll discuss in more detail.","We plan to operate on the average 30 rigs and we'll drill or participate in approximately 630 wells. We expect 50% of our operated rigs will drill horizontally, and the rig distribution among our core areas will be very similar to where we are today.","We're planning to allocate 54% of our drilling capital to the Delaware Basin. By comparison, we allocated 35% in 2012 to the Delaware. So clearly, this core area has emerged as our most significant source of capital investment in a very short amount of time.","Between the Northern and Southern Delaware Basin, we plan to operate 11 rigs, all horizontal, and we'll drill or participate in approximately 175 horizontal wells. Those wells will target zones as shallow as the Delaware Sand and as deep as the Penn Shale.","The New Mexico Shelf calls for 21% of our drilling capital, where we expect to drill or participate in approximately 190 Yeso wells, 60 of which are horizontal. We expect to average 5 rigs in the Shelf, comprised of 3 horizontal and 2 vertical.","Lastly, we plan to allocate 25% of our capital to the Texas Permian core area, where we expect to drill or participate in approximately 240 wells. We plan to average between 1 and 2 horizontal rigs out of the total of 14.","For the balance of 2012 and into 2013, we plan to continue to test a number of new concepts in all 3 of our core areas. During the third quarter, we spudded our first dual lateral in the Northern Delaware Basin, and expect to test a few more during 2013. We also continued to experiment with extended link laterals with encouraging results.","In the Southern Delaware, we continued to drill horizontal Wolfcamp wells across our acreage in Reeves and Pecos County, and expect to have drilled 10 horizontal wells -- Wolfcamp wells by the end of 2012, including the 4 producers Tim discussed in his opening comments. And within this area, we'll also test additional zones horizontally above the Wolfcamp.","Moving north to the New Mexico Shelf, our horizontal Yeso program continues to perform in line with our expectations. We're currently modeling these wells at an ER range of 300 to 350 MBoes with a 30-day IP rate of about 200 Boes per day. AFVs are between $3 million and $4 million for a rate of return in excess of 40% at $85 oil and $4 per Mcf.","We currently have 370 horizontal Yeso locations identified and we're working to expand our inventory of horizontal locations as we test the productive boundaries to the north of the shelf and in the shelf's extension to the Southwest.","Shifting gears now to the Midland Basin. We've drilled 2 horizontal Wolfcamp wells on our Upton County acreage. Those wells are in the areas with limited 40-acre Wolfberry drilling. Part of our efforts in 2013, we'll test the areas that are currently slated for vertical 20-acre Wolfberry development. The results of those horizontal tests will be measured against the results of our ongoing 20-acre pilot program to determine the most efficient way to capture those reserves.","In an ideal case, we would find the horizontal returns compelling enough to convert the vertical locations to horizontal locations, and accelerate the development of resources that would otherwise wait to be drilled through 20-acre vertical program.","Over in Irion County in the Southern Midland Basin, where we acquired acreage from Three Rivers, we're currently drilling the first horizontal well in that acreage and it will target the upper Wolfcamp.","Over the course of 2013, we'll average 1 horizontal rig to drill additional Wolfcamp horizontals in Irion, as well as horizontal plant wells in Glasscock and Terry County.","Our 2013 capital budget is predicated on current third quarter service cost. From a year ago, we've seen a softening in pricing, particularly in large ticket items like high pressure pumping in rigs. However, the real cost savings continues to come from improved logistics and scheduling, thanks to the drilling efficiencies, getting wells online faster and an increasing supply of services.","Concho has always reinvested its cash flows, so if we do see lower costs and greater efficiencies in 2013, we would stand up additional rigs where the returns are justified.","One current situation we're watching is the recent widening of the Midland to Cushing differential. I believe much of the current spread is a combination of scheduled refinery maintenance at the Phillips 66 Borger refinery and outages along the Northeast caused by Hurricane Sandy.","Current shipments to the Northeast from regions like the Bakken are now heading to Cushing. So we'll keep an eye on the situation and expect that there might be some impact to the fourth quarter realizations, but probably not enough to alter our 2012 annual guidance.","Takeaway capacity in the Permian will continue to be a key theme in 2013. However, we do see some meaningful release in the very near future. In fact, we've added some slides to our latest investor presentation that provides some good detail on planned capacity additions for both oil and NGLs.","On the oil side, Phase 1 of the Longhorn reversal will commence in the first quarter of next year, with Phase 2 coming in online in the second quarter.","Combined with the Permian Express expansion in the first quarter, we should see over 300,000 barrels per day of capacity addition, all of which is going to Gulf coast.","On the NGL side, the Lone Star expansion will be completed by the first quarter and will be followed by the Sandhills and the Texas Express in the second and third quarters, respectively. In total, we see 740,000 barrels per day of incremental takeaways capacity in 2013, all of which is going to Mont Belvieu.","These projects will add much-needed relief to crude and NGL displacement in the Permian, resulting in fewer volume mix and potentially enhanced economics.","Lastly, I would like to address one housekeeping item. As reported, our LOE in the third quarter was $7.15 per Boe, which is well below our annual guidance. The sharp decline was primarily due to lower work over costs and reductions in the cost of well service rigs, contract labor and chemical costs. However, I anticipate an increase in well servicing activity in the fourth quarter, causing LOE to range between $7.75 and $8 per Boe. We still expect full year 2012 LOE to sell around $7.15 -- $7.50 per Boe, as previously guided.","With that, I look forward to your questions and would like to turn it over to Price.","L. Price Moncrief","Thanks, Joe. I'm going to touch on a few third quarter highlights, as well as our 2013 guidance before moving to Q&A.","The third quarter was another strong quarter in terms of production growth and cash flow. We produced 7.8 million Boes, representing a 24% increase over the third quarter of 2011 and 14% sequentially. Driven in part by the contribution of assets from Three Rivers. However, a significant driver of our organic production growth is coming from our horizontal program in the Delaware Basin, where we produced approximately 16,000 Boes per day, an increase of 80% over the third quarter of 2011 and 15% sequentially.","Our production mix for the quarter was 59% crude oil, but excluding the impact of the Three Rivers properties, crude represented over 60% of our volumes. Looking at revenues, oil accounted for 82% of our total sales during the quarter, while dry gas accounted for only 5%.","Unhedged realized oil price for the third quarter improved to 96% of NYMEX relative to the previous quarter of 92%, as the average Midland to Cushing spread narrowed to $1.75 per barrel.","On the natural gas side, our unhedged realization declined to 164% of NYMEX relative to the previous quarter of 196%, reflecting a slight decline in NGL pricing and an increase in the average price of natural gas.","Despite the decline in natural gas realization, our unhedged realized price per Boe increased over the second quarter to $63.74 and our cash margin improved to 75%, still among the best in the industry and indicative of our strong oil-driven cash flows.","Moving on to 2013 guidance, you've probably read the detail in our press release, but I'd like to specifically address a few of the components.","We have outlined a 2013 capital budget of $1.6 billion, which we can fund largely through cash flow from operations, assuming NYMEX crude and natural gas prices of $85 per barrel and $4 per Mcf, current service cost environment in the midpoint of our production guidance.","We expect to produce 32.9 million to 34.3 million Boes, which implies 15% to 20% growth over our 2012 organic production estimate. Please refer to Slide 13 of our most recent investor presentation for a detailed reconciliation for the year-end guidance to this organic production estimate.","At a high level, our 2012 organic production estimate is adjusted to take into account a partial-year production contributed by Three Rivers assets, which produced 6,700 Boes per day in the third quarter, and a full-year production contributed by our divestiture properties, which produced 5,800 Boes per day during the third quarter.","As customary with our annual production guidance, we plan internally around the midpoint of our range. The ability to outperform the midpoint of our guidance will likely come through improved capital efficiencies, better productivity or reduced takeaway constraints. Our LOE expectations for 2013 is $7.50 to $8 per Boe, which is above our 2012 guidance.","This is largely due to the fact that we are allocating a greater proportion of our capital budget to areas like the Delaware Basin, where there is limited infrastructure in place. Over time, we would expect per unit LOE to improve as key infrastructure items like gathering systems, electricity sources and disposal systems are put in place.","We expect to see a slight increase in per unit DD&A next year, reflecting the effects of recent acquisitions, as well as increased drilling in emerging areas.","With respect to 2013 interest expense, the press release detailed the interest rates on our existing notes. But I'd like to remind everyone that we did issue $700 million of new 5 1\/2% senior notes during the third quarter, which will add to our fixed interest expense.","Additionally, we are rolling out guidance for our noncash interest expense of approximately $14 million to $16 million for 2013, reflecting the amortization of debt issuances costs.","Concho continues to maintain an active oil hedging program. Over 60% of our expected oil production for 2013 is hedged at $96 per barrel, which provides a greater degree of certainty around our cash flows and our ability to fund our capital budget.","In closing, this was an excellent quarter for Concho and as you can tell, we will enter 2013 with tremendous momentum behind us. Our horizontal transition is in full swing and we look forward to executing the same return focus strategy that has delivered consistently strong organic growth.","Thanks for joining us. Now let's move to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of John Freeman with Raymond James.","John Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","First question I had -- the drilling budget for next year is basically flat. I mean, the increase is due to the infrastructures spending and then some bit of lease hold. And I guess specifically on the infrastructure, price sort of alluded to the fact that you're having to spend a good bit in the Delaware Basin when the infrastructure is more limited. And I guess I'm just trying to get a sense of sort of longer term, maybe like 2014 beyond, like how much of the spending you're doing next year on infrastructure was just sort of view as one-time? And sort of what would be a more normalized sort of infrastructure spend?","E. Joseph Wright","John, this is Joe. Let me answer that one real quick. Right now, when you look at the infrastructure cost, that's about 8% of our capital budget. Normally, I think after '14, we'll probably be in that 4% range, when you kind of think about it, just on going top of the cost.","John Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. So back to sort of more normalized like it was this year and the prior year?","E. Joseph Wright","I think so. John, remember the infrastructure capital cost, primarily a salt water disposal, and so it has a rate of return on that capital expenditure as well, and probably the payout versus trucking all that salt water is very short. So from a capital standpoint, that's not sunk capital with no return, it probably has a faster payout than the entire capital budget.","John Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","That's a good point. On the dual lateral well that you all did in the Northern Delaware, I mean, I'm not looking for like a rate or anything. But just in general, can you talk about -- did you -- what you learned from it? Did you happen the change, maybe the well design or anything that you could elaborate?","E. Joseph Wright","John, so far everything is going well on that one. We're actually still drilling it. We've started our second lateral in that. Everything's going real well. So I think we feel very good -- we drilled the lower lateral first and we're drilling the second, the top lateral now.","John Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just last question for me. You mentioned Joe, you all are pretty encouraged by some of the work you all have done on the longer extended laterals. Could you just sort of elaborate on how much longer those laterals were? Anything else should you want to add to it?","E. Joseph Wright","Yes. I mean, we've had them out as far as 1.5 mile to 2 miles and it's working out very well right now so.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Lively with Tudor, Pucking -- Pickering and Holt.","Brian Lively - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Looking at the guidance for next year from the production side, and just thinking about how you guys have started making the transition -- bigger transition towards more horizontal drilling. Could you guys just provide some context around how much conservatism you build in to those production numbers based on, I guess, timing of wells? And also just some uncertainty how with the wells will look like?","Timothy A. Leach","Yes, let me take a stab at that and I'm going to kind of jump around a little bit. But the way we think about guiding and the risk we've applied in the past has a lot of components in it. And as you know, the timing of bringing those wells on, takeaway constraints out of the basin, the risk embedded in the type of drilling that you're doing, and we try to stew all that into our guidance and come up with a range that we feel comfortable that reflects all the uncertainty that's out there in the industry right now. So I think, if you summarize all of those factors in our guidance, the range from risk to unrisk is about 3 million barrels and about 2 million of those barrels are associated with the PDP properties and about 1 million with the drilling. And the horizontal component of our drilling is going up. We have less -- we drilled thousands of vertical wells, so our confidence in those wells is higher, the risk is lower. But I would tell you that we now are getting more and more confident in the horizontal drilling and the results continue to improve, and continue to either hit or exceed the way we think about it and the way we model it.","Brian Lively - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","That's helpful. Then maybe just more -- taking a step back, you guys are talking about, I guess, doing a little bit more activity on the Midland side as it relates to the horizontal program. Just wondering if your confidence in that the Midland horizontal potential has increased over the last quarter or so, based on your own results and industry results? Are you thinking kind of the same as you were 6 months ago?","Timothy A. Leach","Well, I don't think I'm thinking the same as 6 months ago, but I think the Delaware Basin is further along in development. I think there's twice as many rigs running in the Delaware horizontally as there are in the Midland right now. So there's just -- there's more information and it's further along in being de-risked. In the Midland Basin, the activity is more spread out. It's in different benches of the Wolfcamp or it's in the Cline shales, and there's just fewer wells that have been drilled. And we've had success over there, but I just think it's earlier stages and not in full development.","Brian Lively - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","And last question for me, Tim, if maybe you could compare some of your earlier Delaware results with, which what you've seen on the Midland Wolfcamp in Cline side. How did those in kind of early apples to apples return stack up to one another?","Timothy A. Leach","I don't have anything in front of me to talk about actual numbers. But it seems like that the highest rate of return thing we have going right now is horizontal Bone Spring sand, and that's as high as the Yeso rates of return, they were among the highest things that we've ever done as a company. And it looks like, probably on a risk basis, the Midland Basin stuff is maybe, I don't know, 20 points below that in terms of the rate of return. So it's substantially a lower rate of -- a substantial lower rate of return. But that reflects a lot of the risk in that it's newer and we don't have as much data.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of William Butler with Stephens.","William B. D. Butler - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Can you all talk a bit more about -- you all mentioned you're going to [indiscernible] the upper Wolfcamp and even the Glasscock and Terry decline, sort of what's driving those decisions one zone versus the other initially?","Timothy A. Leach","Let me call on Matt Hyde to address that one.","Matthew G. Hyde","Sure, this is Matt. There are number of designation of zones within the Wolfcamp. Our designation is up for our Wolfcamp is fairly generic. I think alternatively, industry uses A, B, C and D benches. So when we talk about Upper Wolfcamp, we're generally referring to the A and B benches, generally.","William B. D. Butler - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Okay. And as it pertains to the Cline in the Glasscock and Terry County areas, there any Wolfcamp potential there initially, at least looking geologically at it?","Matthew G. Hyde","At this point in time, in the Glasscock County area, our focus is, in fact, the Cline, as you know, we've been producing from the Wolfcamp there, historically, in the vertical sense, and continue to do that. But at this point in time, our horizontal activity in that Glasscock County area is focused on the Cline.","William B. D. Butler - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Okay, and then in Dawson County, is there any activity going on there and is there any Mississippian potential on that acreage?","Matthew G. Hyde","Some of that acreage actually will be or was part of the divestment that we just announced. We do not have a substantial acreage position up there in the Dawson area beyond that.","William B. D. Butler - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Okay. And is there any update on, maybe this is for Tim, more on acquisition activity in the play in general?","Timothy A. Leach","Well, I mean, in the Permian, in general, there's as many deals out there as I've ever seen, I think, and part of it is driven by year-end stuff and part of it is driven by the new technology, and just how much opportunity we're finding but it's harder to be a small company because these wells are more expensive and more complicated. So there's a lot of deal flow but, I would say, I mean, from a very big picture for Concho, our inventory that we have on our existing acreage is so compelling and has such a high rate of return that, that's probably the highest and best use of all the capital that we have. And so it's really tough for acquisitions to compete with accelerating our existing inventory.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","You talked about 4 Southern Delaware Basin wells, can you say how close together or far apart those wells were on your 140,000-acre position? What percent of your acreage do you think is prospective at this point? And then make a comment on the well cost that you're seeing there?","Timothy A. Leach","Well, we think all our acreage is prospective and I'm looking at Matt Hyde, but it seems like there's a couple or 3 of those wells that are in the North and then one in the South, and they may be 30 miles apart.","Matthew G. Hyde","Or about 20 miles.","Timothy A. Leach","20 miles apart.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got you. And well costs?","Timothy A. Leach","They're kind of in that -- they're in the science stage so Matt's spending money aggressively on gathering data, but it's $8 million to $9 million.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I assumed you would expect that, that would fall just overtime as the science phase ends or?","Darin G. Holderness","Yes, yes.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And in the Delaware, are you seeing or do you expect any differences in performance from the Bone Spring wells that are being drilled on the Three Rivers acquired properties versus those on your legacy properties?","Timothy A. Leach","Well, in the northern Delaware Basin, there's basically 3 or 4 different areas where you have a different set of primary targets, and Three Rivers had acreage in all of those and we have acreage in all those plays. So when you move from play to play, your primary target changes, whether it's the second Bone Spring sand or it's the third Bone Spring sand or the Avalon, and we're getting good rates of return out of all of those.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got you. And then finally, in the Midland Basin, just wanted to follow up on your comments. Are there any specifics can provide on Terry or Howard County wells?","Timothy A. Leach","Terry or Howard, no. I would you say that Northern Midland Basin activity that we have, we drilled our first well and it was inconclusive and what we saw -- we're preparing to drill our second well and I still think of that whole thing is an exploration play up there.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Irene Haas with Wunderlich Securities.","Irene O. Haas - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","Yes, I have a question on Southern Delaware Basin. You have about 10 wells drilled in the area. Just wondering if you have done anything in Pecos County yet and whether do you do plan to keep your 2 rigs in that area next year? And then in the [indiscernible] case, when would with this part of the Delaware Basin impact your top line? Is it going to be like a '13 event or '14 and how's infrastructure there? I suspect you probably have to do quite a bit of work?","Timothy A. Leach","That's a whole lot of questions. Let's see. We plan to have 10 wells drilled in that southern Delaware Basin position by the end of the year. We're moving toward Pecos County. We haven't drilled one in Pecos County, both those -- we have vertical monitoring wells. So the activity is going that way. A lot of the infrastructure that is planned will be infrastructure down in that area because, as you've seen, when you come out here and tour that area, there's not much infrastructure in the Southern Delaware. And that's an area that, as we ramp up on it, and I think we have the ability, as we mentioned in the call that we can add a lot of rigs as a company, so that will be an area I think that you'll see us with continued success to ramp rapidly.","Irene O. Haas - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","And would it impact you in 2013? Or '14? I mean when would we start seeing sort of incremental production from this part of the Basin?","Timothy A. Leach","I think you'll see in '13.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mario Barraza from Tuohy Brothers.","Mario Barraza - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Can you talk a bit more about the horizontal Yeso delineation? You talked about there's upside to your horizontal count there. What percentage of your acreage position there is delineated horizontally? And what do you think you could potentially add there?","E. Joseph Wright","Yes, this is Joe. If you remember our extension to the Southwest, that acreage is really going to be developed fully with horizontal drilling. So if you think about that, that area, and potentially, we'd like to add additional acreage in that area. And when you look at the fairway of what we call the traditional shelf, traditional Yeso, that was developed pretty tightly. But out on to the North and into the edges of that fairway and in the acreage that we picked up from Marbob, we're developing areas in there horizontally. So potentially, by maybe sometime by mid-next year, I'll have a really good number for you in terms of total locations. But we've moved to where the majority of our development now is horizontal in that play.","Mario Barraza - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Okay. And then just on the completion front, did the delta amongst your quarters this year, is that more just because you're tilling -- you have more horizontal activity? Or is that also tied to midstream constraints?","E. Joseph Wright","You're talking about the number of wells?","Mario Barraza - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Yes. You completed -- was it 66 in the first quarter, 84 in the second and then it was down to 55 this quarter?","E. Joseph Wright","Yes, it's just a little bit of a function of timing, but as we did bring our well count down as we shifted over to horizontal, our vertical count dropped so as you think about that, now, the Delaware Basin has always been horizontal. There's not a slowdown in terms of completion timing. There's actually -- things are really pretty -- happening pretty quickly now. So...","Mario Barraza - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","So is it more than it's all horizontal, it doesn't have to do with midstreams at all?","E. Joseph Wright","No, no, it doesn't.","Mario Barraza - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Okay. And then lastly, at the end of your prepared comments, you talked about basis differentials widening. Where are those tracking today? And you said it could potentially impact or it could -- it likely won't, but it could potentially impact fourth quarter price realizations?","E. Joseph Wright","Yes, you have October, November, that differential is already set, so we're really just look at December. And so the effect of December on the fourth quarter is going to be in that range that I gave you. So it's probably not going to hit the fourth quarter that bad. And right now -- what's the price -- did you get a current -- about $5 today is the differential.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeb Bachmann with Howard Weil.","Joseph Bachmann - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division","Just a couple quick questions. First, Tim, I think you talked about one of -- or an inconclusive well up in Terry County. But I saw there was another well in the release that was P&A-ed, and just wondering where that other well is located?","Timothy A. Leach","I believe that one was over in Irion County, over in the stuff we got from Three Rivers, yes?","E. Joseph Wright","One was vertical shallow Wolfcamp wells.","Timothy A. Leach","I'm not sure which well he's talking about.","E. Joseph Wright","I think it's the same well.","Timothy A. Leach","It's probably the same well.","E. Joseph Wright","I think you're talking about the same well, that we drilled up in Terry County and we have TA-ed that well.","Timothy A. Leach","But he said there was 2.","Joseph Bachmann - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division","Yes, I think there were 2 in the release.","Timothy A. Leach","The other one's an Abo well. We're not helping you out very much here.","Joseph Bachmann - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division","That's okay. And then second question, more of a wish, have you guys talked about having an analyst or investor day anytime in the near future?","Timothy A. Leach","Yes. We talk about that a lot. We want to make sure that when we have one, we can completely enlighten you and so I think the best timing on that would be when we get our year-end reserves done, have our third-party work done and all of these new curves and things like that. So probably sometime after the first quarter, or not after the first quarter, but in the first quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Scialla with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Michael S. Scialla - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I apologize if any of these have already been asked, but it looked like your divestiture package was a little higher than the $200 million to $400 million you've originally guided too. I'm just wondering, did you add anything to that package? Or is that a fair apples-to-apples comparison?","Timothy A. Leach","Yes. That's probably not apples-to-apples. I mean, when we bought Three Rivers, we said that the way we're going to finance that $1 billion acquisition was by selling $200 million to $400 million of assets, in that range. And -- but that wasn't really a target for our entire divestment program. So we identified assets that we thought were ones that weren't in our core area or part of our core program, and that totaled more than the $200 million to $400 million.","Michael S. Scialla - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Got you. So I think you included the Abo in there, is that correct?","Timothy A. Leach","Right, but I think on most of that Abo acreage, we kept the Yeso rights.","Michael S. Scialla - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Are you done now for a while with divestitures or is there anything else you'd like to let go?","Timothy A. Leach","No, that was it. We're not very good at divesting of things that we -- because we like to be selective in what we acquire so I don't think we're going to be selling anything else in the near future.","Michael S. Scialla - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Was there any capital gain associated with that $520 million sale?","Timothy A. Leach","Darin's here. I think we did a tax break exchange on most of that. So there wasn't any -- the capital gains on the sale?","Darin G. Holderness","Right. We will seal that through a 1031 exchange.","Michael S. Scialla - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Good, I'd like to see that. And then you mentioned the $8 million to $9 million well cost for Southern Delaware Basin wells because they're in the science phase, but how does that compare to where your horizontal wells are in the Northern Delaware right now?","Timothy A. Leach","Most of those Bone Spring sand wells are kind in the $5 million to $6 million range.","Michael S. Scialla - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Is it fair to say that over time you could get the Southern Delaware Basin down to that range or they're geological different, where that's not possible?","Timothy A. Leach","It's a little bit deeper but -- I'd say, still in the North, we're in the process of still squeezing more efficiency out of it.","Michael S. Scialla - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","So $5 million to $6 million may not be the limit there. How about over in the Midland side, well costs for horizontal Wolfcamp incline?","Timothy A. Leach","Oh, those things are kind of all over the board depending on where you are but ...","Unknown Executive","It's $7 million on the East and a little more on that on the West, at this point.","Timothy A. Leach","And it depends on whether it's one section lateral or extended. You got to make sure you know what kind well you're talking about.","Michael S. Scialla - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just,  I guess, conceptually from your dual lateral, it sounds like you're getting your well costs down at pretty low levels. What are you really hoping to accomplish there? It seems like on the surface, you're saving the well costs of just a vertical portion of the hole. Is there anything beyond that? Or is that...","Timothy A. Leach","Yes, I think there's -- I'm mean, that the -- the point of that is, there's 2 points. One is better capital efficiency just from saving part of the wellbore. But the other thing is acceleration of inventory, being able to get 2 of them done at one time.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Pearce Hammond from Simmons.","Pearce W. Hammond - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","How do you see rig efficiencies, in specifically maybe in spud to sales time evolving in '13 for Concho? Do you have a lot of running room to improve efficiencies?","E. Joseph Wright","Yes, this is Joe. We always like to think we definitely have running room for that. We can always get better. Especially when you think about the Delaware Basin and all the different type of areas that we're drilling in, so  we've got a lot of room to improve in and, like the question before, when you think about that Southern Delaware Basin wells and the cost there, I mean, we will be getting those costs down and from an efficiency to spud to sales, think a lot of that will depend upon just the area that you're in, but I believe we will get better. It's going fairly well, as you think about the Northern Delaware Basin in terms of that timing. Of course, our core areas, like the Yeso and the Wolfberry, the timing in those areas is very good. So...","Pearce W. Hammond - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Great. And do you think you're reaching the plateau on the number for frac stages per well? Or do you expect a meaningful change year-over-year?","E. Joseph Wright","I think it'll all depend upon lateral length, as you think about the areas that we've developed so far. Now the Midland Basin, we haven't really kind of pinned that down yet, but that has some room, a little more science to go, but it'll all depend on lateral length really.","Pearce W. Hammond - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","And what is your average lateral length in like the Northern Delaware Basin and then the Southern Delaware Basin?","E. Joseph Wright","Well, most of the original drilling was just what we call a section lateral. That's starting to -- we're starting to move out a little bit than that and we have drilled up to 2 mile, about 1.5 mile. Some of the areas that we have there, we don't have quite the acreage in terms of blocking it up and drill 2 mile laterals. So at this time, limited to one section laterals.","Pearce W. Hammond - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Great. And just last one for me, how good do you feel from a personnel standpoint, as far as executing your plan for next year, are you still actively trying to hire people? And is it still difficult to secure good quality technical folks?","Timothy A. Leach","That's not a phenomena of just today. It's always been hard to find good quality technical folks, so we're really pleased with what we've got. As I said earlier that because of the efficiency in the horizontal drilling, we could run at a higher rate than we're running today with 30 rigs. So we still have a lot of job openings here. We still have room to add a lot of people. We've had success so far in 2012 at getting people, but we have the capacity to do more with what we've got.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joe Magner with Macquarie Capital.","Joseph Patrick Magner - Macquarie Research","Just wanted to, I guess, ask about the shift in --  there's a bit of a shift in the oil\/gas mix in the third quarter. Just curious, with a lot of the Delaware focus being in the North where, I guess, at least, it appears on the surface that wells are a little less oily than some of your other areas. How do you see that sort of playing out through this year and into the next?","E. Joseph Wright","I think what you're seeing in the third quarter is the effect of having a full quarter of Three Rivers production, because that was -- they had more gas production in their base. However, the growth in our production is in oily areas and, as I mentioned on those, the different wells we've added in the Northern Delaware Basin, they're very oily. So I think that's going to have a big influence on future quarters.","Joseph Patrick Magner - Macquarie Research","Okay. And then just on that comment a second ago about the 1031 exchange, to shield from the taxes from the taxes on the sale. Is there a look back allowed there, can it be applied to Three Rivers? Or will that need be applied to future acquisitions?","Unknown Executive","It's a look back to Three Rivers.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sven Del Pozzo from IHS.","Sven Del Pozzo - IHS Herold, Inc.","It's Sven. Just conceptually, it wasn't too long ago that you had favored vertical development as opposed to horizontal development, because of the areas where you were in, I'm thinking, particularly, in the Midland Basin with thicker vertical sections. So now, call it about -- fast-forward a year, it seems like you've switched over to embracing the horizontal development concept. Could you just give me a general description of that change in attitude?","Timothy A. Leach","Yes. I mean, most of the reservoirs that we're tapping today are not the same reservoirs we were tapping 2 years ago. So all the resource oil play that are in the Bone Spring and the Wolfcamp vertical development won't really provide you the same kind of economics. So it's a reflection of the new stuff we found and even like in the Yeso, for example, the best applications of horizontal in the Yeso are in areas where the vertical would've been challenged for one reason or another.","Sven Del Pozzo - IHS Herold, Inc.","So you could extend the limits of the -- of your fields, I mean, in terms of areal extent, moving to the periphery of the fields, developing them horizontally?","Timothy A. Leach","Right. And in that Yeso, as you move to the edges, that was a 2-zone development. Some of the edges, you only have one zone so you couldn't capture that with a vertical wellbore, but it's very economic with the horizontal wellbore.","Sven Del Pozzo - IHS Herold, Inc.","Okay. And then back to Mike's question about the dual laterals. I just have heard of dual laterals introducing complications in the completion procedures or by introducing down hole risks. I mean, I guess, as you -- I guess, we're still pretty early stage in this dual laterals so it's not all set and done that you would definitely use this development, the dual lateral development on a lot of your drilling in the future?","Timothy A. Leach","I think, by definition, we haven't even drilled our first one yet, so we're in the very early stages. But there will be things like that, that we will continue to experiment with and that's, I think that's how all this innovation has come about in our industry is, try new things. So the dual lateral is one type of thing that we will experiment with, but there'll be other things.","Sven Del Pozzo - IHS Herold, Inc.","Okay. And would you just describe -- I've heard the Abo and the Dawson County acreage being part of the sales package. In a top-down sense, I'm thinking, you kind of swapped these -- the assets that you announced in this sale in the third quarter with -- for the Three Rivers stuff. So just generally, what is that -- is it right to think of in terms of a swap of that kind -- of the Three Rivers exposure for the stuff you just sold? And what did you just sell so I can have a better feel for what you're giving up and what you're gaining?","Timothy A. Leach","Well, what we sold didn't have this -- it's close to having the same amount of production, but not quite. However, I think the way you ought to think about it is, we acquired from Three Rivers, acreage that had lots of drilling locations. We sold Central Basin Platform assets, they were out of those core areas that had good production, but they didn't have very much growth opportunity.","Sven Del Pozzo - IHS Herold, Inc.","Okay. So not much horizontal upside in those areas, you might say?","Timothy A. Leach","Not anything that we saw at Concho.","Sven Del Pozzo - IHS Herold, Inc.","Okay. And then, just out of curiosity, what can you tell me about the prospectivity of the Cline shale in Terry County versus Glasscock County, where you're drilling? Because, yes, they're far way from each other and I'm just kind of curious as to what draws you to those 2 areas? What might make the Cline prospective in both those areas?","Timothy A. Leach","Well, the Cline is a very large formation in the Midland Basin and its equivalent exists in the Delaware Basin as well. So it's a basin-wide type of deposit and industry has pushed the play, starting from the very southern end of the Midland Basin. There's been -- entire companies have been built around Cline development in that Glasscock County area, so you've got a lot of wells coming online there and up the North, it's just in the early stages. There's not that much data on it.","The rocks look similar though.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Frank [ph] with Fortress.","Unknown Analyst","Just a quick follow-up to the question that was just asked, up in the Northern Midland Basin, Terry County. Do you know how many other horizontal wells are being drilled up there right now? And also, I mean, is there anything you learned from that Red Headed Stranger well that you'll use in drilling the -- I think it's the Midnight Rider well that you're currently drilling?","Matthew G. Hyde","Yes, this is Matt, I'll take that question. There are a couple of other competitors up there that have moved into the horizontal realm. They're privates that are doing the drilling in addition to Concho at this point in time. I believe there are 4 incremental horizontals to our Red Headed Stranger. As to using the Red Headed Stranger data, absolutely, we're continuing to evaluate both the rock data and then our completion of stimulation results up there as we think about our next well. The Midnight Rider is a permit. We are evaluating data from the Red Headed Stranger and are continuing to evaluate locations for a go forward drilling.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Hanold with RBC Capital Markets.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","When looking at some of that horizontal Yeso activity you have right now, you say IRR is in that sort of 40-plus range at $85 per barrel and that seems surprisingly pretty strong and actually, when I look at some of your returns that you provide on your slide deck, it's competitive to basically your other core areas. Can you kind of give a sense or color on what it really would take for you guys to think about turning that horizontal play primarily and accelerating the activity more?","Timothy A. Leach","The Yeso? Yes. Well, I mean in Yeso play, we drilled 1,000 wells vertically on 10-acre spacing, so the horizontal was a nice surprise, but it really gives us the opportunity for expansion of the size of the play. It's hard to go back on existing areas that are drilled up and really accelerate. So I think up there, you can think about it more, I think there'll be expansion on the margins. I mentioned that we -- that Abo acreage, we kept the Yeso rights, well that -- as you move North, that we have a pretty good block of acreage that way. But I think the better way to think about it is just -- of our remaining vertical locations, how many of those can be converted and made more efficient through horizontal drilling. And if I was going to direct you to  expansion, I would say the expansion acceleration is taking place more in the Delaware Basin, to the South, with the Bone Spring, and then we're pretty excited about what we're seeing in the Southern Delaware with the new wells down there.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. So just for me to clarify. So really, the opportunity in the horizontal stuff is in the margins because development is done so tightly in the core Yeso play. Is that a fair statement?","Timothy A. Leach","Yes, I think that's right. I mean, we've identified like 300 and something locations there that are $3 million to $4 million apiece. They have great economics, but we're talking about thousands of locations to the South that are more capital intensive and -- so that's where the real impact of the company is going to come from.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Tameron with Wells Fargo.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Did you guys give a infrastructure constraint number, meaning how much production was constrained in the quarter? Or could you give that, if you haven't.","E. Joseph Wright","No, we didn't. We haven't quantified that or...","Unknown Executive","We weren't constrained, except from line pressures, which is... that it's hard to quantify that number, right?","E. Joseph Wright","Just an ongoing...","Jack F. Harper","It happens every day.","E. Joseph Wright","Every day. Right.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. All right. Fair enough. And then, Tim, in the Northern Delaware, you talked a lot about the other zones, but have you guys done a lot in the Delaware Sands or the Penn in the Northern Delaware?","Timothy A. Leach","The Delaware Sands, we've only drilled a handful of wells and that looks like potential and looks successful. The Penn Shale is much deeper and, no, we haven't really brought on any wells from the Penn.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","So all the focus for next year is going to be in Avalon, the Bone Spring and the Wolfcamp?","Timothy A.

Well, I think we had a great list of people attending this call. So thank you very much. Again, as far as the metrics go, I think we've turned in a quarter that we are pleased with the production and the cost and, I think, it builds momentum into the fourth quarter and going into next year.

After the speakers\u2019 presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today\u2019s conference call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]","I would now like to [indiscernible] this conference call. Ms. Megan Hays, you may begin.","Megan Hays","Thank you. Good morning and welcome to Concho\u2019s third quarter of 2019 earnings call. Our earnings release and corporate presentation are both available on our website.","Participants on today\u2019s call will make forward-looking statements based on current expectations. They are subject to risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements and other disclaimers are provided in the earnings release and presentation. Our comments today may also reference non-GAAP financial metrics. You\u2019ll find the appropriate reconciliations in our earnings material.","I\u2019m joined in Midland today by Tim Leach, our Chairman and CEO; along with President Jack Harper; Chief Operating Office, Will Giraud; and members of the Concho\u2019s senior management team. Following our prepared remarks, we will host a question-and-answer session. Please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up.","Now, let me turn the call over to Tim.","Tim Leach","Thanks, Megan. Good morning. Last quarter's results undermined our consistent track record and raise concerns about our execution ability due to the performance of several spacing test. We of course corrected and our priorities are to demonstrate our execution ability, highlight our asset quality, and continue to show financial discipline and cost management.","Our results for the third quarter demonstrate that we're focused on these priorities and that we're making solid progress on what we set out to do. I'm confident that Concho hasn't lost our ability to execute, and that our performance is sustainable over the long term.","During today's call, I hope these key messages resonate. Well cost improved dramatically. We're reducing our operating cost structure. We generated strong cash flow, which exceeded our exploration and development cost. We continue to high grade our portfolio. We have a strong balance sheet which we reinforce with proceeds from asset sales, and we're positioned for growth and returning capital to shareholders.","We want to use our call this morning to emphasize that we're executing a clear strategy and taking steps to position the company for 2020 to provide free cash flow and growth. An important step in improving our capital efficiency and cost structure is the sale of the New Mexico Shelf. The cash flow from this asset funded our discovery and development of other plays in the Permian. However, within our broader portfolio, it no longer competes for capital, and the sale is consistent with our ongoing effort to high grade our assets and accelerate returns to shareholders.","We have a strong foundation for future success and the fundamentals of our business are improving. Looking ahead to 2020, planning around a conservative commodity price, we can deliver oil growth, free cash flow, and shareholder returns. At lower oil prices, our financial strength provides flexibility and we'll manage the business within cash flow. At higher prices, we'll generate more free cash flow which will fund more shareholder returns.","The industry has faced a lot of different challenges over time. Today, sentiment toward the sector is low and amplified by campaign promises to severely limit or regulate away oil and gas operations. This comes at a time when Concho and our peers are making significant strides in reducing our environmental footprint.","All the while unlocking an energy source in our country, this provided us with more security and change the global balance in our favor. Since we don't know how the politics will resolve, I'll clarify that our exposure to federal acreage is about 20% of our total gross and net acreage position. And our capital allocation toward that acreage is roughly the same. We have a great deal of flexibility if we need to reallocate that capital.","In the last five years, WTI has averaged between $50 and $60 with frequent moves outside this range. This has provided a dynamic backdrop as we transition from delineation mode to development, while also optimizing drilling and completion methods.","In this new phase for US shale, we were early to recognize the importance of scale. We built a strong team and high quality portfolio, both of which have been our biggest competitive advantages. Our results for the third quarter demonstrate our ability to leverage those advantages and create value for shareholders.","Before I hand it over, I want to say that I'm proud of the efforts of our employees. I'm thankful for your hard work and dedication to Concho. Now here's Jack with more details on the quarter.","Jack Harper","Thanks, Tim, and good morning. Operationally, we performed well in the third quarter. Production average 330,000 Boe per day and exceeded the high-end of our guidance range. It also represented a 15% interest from the same period last year.","Oil volumes increased 12% year-over-year to 206,000 barrels per day. For the fourth quarter we expect production to average between 318,000 and 325,000 Boe per day, which includes one month of production volumes from the shelf, and compares to our pre-divestiture outlook of 334,000 to 341,000 Boe per day.","Lastly on production, our spacing tests are cycling through and our guidance incorporates our expectations for those tests. In other words, we believe that we've adequately risked the volume guidance to account for the remaining tests that are coming online. And importantly, as we plan for 2020 and beyond, we will develop fewer wells per project at wider spacing.","Financially, we are focused on the things within our control. Our performance was also good. Controllable cash costs which includes lease operating, G&A and interest expense totaled $9.57 per BOE which represents improvement year-over-year and sequentially. We're working to further reduce controllable cash cost to $9 per BOE by year-end 2020.","With the shelf sale, we will divest one-third of our wellbores which will contribute to lowered lease operating expense. Also, we plan to allocate a portion of the sales proceeds to pay off our revolver balance which will reduce interest expense.","I'm happy to report that the third quarter operating cash flow before working capital changes of $706 million exceeded exploration and development capital of $670 million. This marks an important return to free cash generation for the company primarily driven by better capital cost. As you can see on slide 7 in the earnings materials, third quarter well cost represent a strong rate of change admittedly from a high starting point.","Our progress this year is the culmination of a lot of work across the organization which has resulted in efficiency gains in improving cycle times. Key initiatives include continuing to optimize drilling and completion design. Water is also an important part of the supply chain. And in the second quarter, we entered into a joint venture with Solaris that leverages the scale of their system to provide cost effective water management to our operations in Eddy County.","These operating efficiencies and well cost productions provide momentum as we come to the end of 2019 and look ahead to 2020.","Oil has been a decade in the making, and our work in 2019 informs our go forward development strategy. We are assembling a 2020 development program that incorporates everything we've learned this year, from well spacing and density, to lateral placement and completion techniques. We will continue to learn and adapt but not at the expense of returns or consistent execution you expect from us.","With a sharp focus on capital efficiency and managing leverage we control, we're well positioned to deliver on the framework for 2020 that Tim outlined. Sustainable oil growth, free cash flow and shareholder returns. We plan to run a steady program in 2020. This will support predictable performance and a growing wedge of free cash, which we estimate to be $350 million at $50 WTI and $750 million at $60 oil.","Importantly, if oil prices increase, we won't chase the incremental barrel. We have a strong commitment to capital discipline because we believe it's key to maintaining a strong balance sheet and growing long-term value.","Now we\u2019ll turn the call over for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from John Freeman with Raymond James.","John Freeman","When I \u2013 when I look at slide 12 that you all provided which is sort of gives the guide posts on the free cash flow outlook for 2020 which looks \u2013 it's very similar to what you all have communicated in the past about sort of steady Riyadh and then free cash flow positive at $50 billion as you get closer to $60 billion. Should I assume that the kind of same applies with the previous commentary you have had on production in terms of kind of double digit kind of production growth with kind of oil production outpacing the overall growth?","Tim Leach","Yeah, John. I think that the way to think about 2020 is those are the sideboards, and we're going to run a steady ship within those sideboards. And so, that pro forma oil growth within those sideboards is kind of that low double-digit growth no matter if it was $50 billion or $60 billion. And if it goes above $60 billion, then you -- it'll -- we won't chase oil up as Jack said. If it goes below $50 billion, we have the flexibility then to stay within cash flow.","John Freeman","Great. And then just a follow-up from me. Can you sort of talk about kind of the decision process to drawdown DUCs maybe a little earlier than anticipated and maintain sort of the steady frac crew count? Was that just mainly due to the improvements that you have on the cost front?","Will Giraud","Hey John, its Will. That's exactly it. We've seen a pretty meaningful efficiency gain in cost savings over the last quarter. And so, that's going to allow us to keep running two frac crews that we were planning on dropping in the fourth quarter. And the result of that is a more smooth transition from the fourth quarter of 2019 into the first quarter of 2020 and a reduction in the year in 2019 DUC countdown to roughly 70. But importantly, our 2019 capital budget guidance is unchanged.","John Freeman","Great. I appreciate it. Well done, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from Doug Leggate with Bank of America.","Doug Leggate","Hi. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. Tim, I wonder if I could go back to the gate post for 2020 and ask what \u2013 I know you're going to a guidance later on. But what kind of capital goes along with that $350 million to $375 million to $750 million free cash flow number. Because I'm guessing the CapEx has started through the year. And if I could bolt-on to that, maybe this is my part two. If you could help us with, what was the cash flow given up from the sale of the shelf. I'll leave it there. Thanks.","Tim Leach","Well, we haven't come out with our capital budget and communicated that for 2020. But it's \u2013 we have said, that would be kind of steady throughout the year. And Jack you want to comment on the [indiscernible].","Jack Harper","Yeah. Yeah in previous calls, we've talked about a $60 oil free cash approaching $1 billion. And so, when you add the shelf cash flow at that level plus revert to gas prices that were \u2013 they look more like they looked a year ago, that that kind of bridges that gap.","Doug Leggate","That\u2019s helpful guys. Maybe I will take a second if I may that the cadence on the tails, I just wonder if you could \u2013 obviously you've step by a couple of completions again, as you pointed out with the additional frac or retaining the frac crews. But it looks to us it\u2019s going to set you up with pretty strong momentum going into the back end of the year. I'm just wondering if you could give us some idea as to what the cadence of those completions looks like as we head into 2020. Now, I\u2019ll leave it there. Thank you.","Will Giraud","Sure. I mean, just for clarity sake, what we're doing is not dropping those two crews. It\u2019s not that we\u2019re adding to the cadence on that pretty steady.","Doug Leggate","Through the quarter, Will?","Will Giraud","Yes.","Doug Leggate","Okay. Great, stuff. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan.","Arun Jayaram","First question regarding your free cash flow outlook for 2020. It looks to be, call it $100 million above the street is at, using a more conservative deck. I was wondering if you could give us some color on what kind of D&C cost savings that you're assuming which is underpinning that free cash flow outlook? It looks like you did about $955 per lateral foot in the third quarter. I was wondering if you maybe comment on what drove the declines that you saw in the third quarter, the sustainability and how our service costs are factoring in to the overall D&C environment?","Tim Leach","Sure. Arun, going to your first question, that outlook kind of reflects the world as we see it today from a cost standpoint. And we were showing it there on slide 7, the cost were running in the back half of 2018 and have been a major focus point throughout 2019.","The inefficiencies peaked in the first quarter with several shorter lateral projects and negative impact from rapidly ramping down from kind of a mid-30s rig count to 18 we're at today. And that steady improvement in cost per foot in the second and third quarters were driven both by sustainable gains and how we drill and complete the wells, but also more cyclical benefits of an overall slowing Permian activity.","Arun Jayaram","Great. And just my follow up, Tim, you mentioned some thoughts on maybe a low double digit oil growth number in 2020. Just for our modeling, could you give us what your pro forma in a 2019 oil number excluding the impact from shelf volumes would be? So what the pro forma 2019 oil number including the fourth quarter guide.","Tim Leach","Oh I think we'll probably have Megan to follow up with you on that. But as we've said before, the shelf was producing about 25,000 Boes per day and it was 13,000 oil \u2013 about yeah, 57 \u2013 56% 57% oil, so I think that could get you there.","Arun Jayaram","Okay, thanks a lot, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from Derrick Whitfield of Stifel.","Derrick Whitfield","Hi, good morning, all, and congrats on the strong quarter and operations update. Perhaps for Tim. Could you elaborate on the measures management can take to mitigate potential federal exposure from a frac band and perhaps more specifically how fluidly can the company redeploy capital into nonfederal lands.","Tim Leach","Yeah, I commented on that in my prepared remarks that we can move rigs and our capital around pretty efficiently. It's obvious that the federal lands are in New Mexico and the permits on federal lands take longer to get, so there\u2019s a more lead time.","So the things that we are doing to mitigate that are, we have quite a bit of activity on them right now, and then we've always run a program where we have properties right across the state line where you can move rigs back and forth, so that\u2019s \u2013 some of the beauty too of having assets in both the Delaware and the Midland Basin and in New Mexico and the Texas side the Delaware Basin.","Derrick Whitfield","Great. And for my follow up, perhaps for Jack or Will, based on our last meeting, I know management generally wants to let the results do the talking from here. Having said that are there any qualitative or quantitative comments you can make on the performance of your Q3 wells put on production? And also, would it be safe to assume that the tighter and wider space wells are performing in line or better than your expectations?","Tim Leach","Sure. I mean, we've shown you there on slide 8 kind of a 180-day look at a couple of different assets. And so, we\u2019ve \u2013 for better or worse, we have a series of spacing tests in 2019. Our guidance here in the fourth quarter bakes in kind of what we're seeing on that. And I would say it's all generally performing as we expected.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Hall with Heikkinen Energy Advisors.","Michael Hall","Thanks. Congrats on the progress. I guess kind of follow-up a little bit on that, I mean, when do you think \u2013 so, it seems like to us the capital side of the equation has very clearly been addressed and has a lot of momentum behind it. And, I guess, we still see some questions around the productivity side of the concerns raised in the first half of the year. And it sounds like you're still working some of those projects through here obviously in the back half.","How quickly do you think we see or we see in the quarterly results the kind of improved productivity from the shift to wider spacing and smaller projects away from the spacing test? That's something that very quickly becomes evident, you think, in the beginning of 2020, or is it going to take a little longer to work its way through the system?","Tim Leach","Sure. Well, we began moving into the wider spacing program this summer. So, while we still have a few spacing test rattling through the back half of this year, you see those less density space projects could be put on a production in the fourth quarter and then increasingly into 2020.","Michael Hall","And okay. And so like I guess early in 2020 that seems reasonable to start to maybe see an uplift in capital efficiency.","Tim Leach","From a productivity standpoint, That's right.","Michael Hall","Right. Yeah. Okay. And then, yeah, I was just curious as we \u2013 as you think about the cost side, the substantial improvements you saw in the third quarter versus the first half, how you\u2019re thinking about the rest of the year like is it, I guess how are you playing that through the guide and the commentary for next year. But then, yeah, do you think it's reasonable? Do you think we'll still see continued improvement in the fourth quarter? Or do you think you've kind of cut what you can now at this point?","Tim Leach","Oh, that's a tough question. I mean, there's been a lot of work that that's happened this year to get us in the position we are today. There are certainly things we're continuing to work on both from kind of a structural sustainable improvement side, which we've seen a lot of improvement there.","On the cyclical side, that\u2019s really hard to predict. I mean the big question is what happened when the calendar turns to 2020. I think it's clear that the independents have got religion around capital discipline. And so we don't expect a meaningful pick up of activity there. But any real incremental benefit there on the cyclical side probably relies on the majors in the private that\u2019s not increasing activity into 2020 which is a big unknown.","Michael Hall","Yeah. Okay. Fair enough. I appreciate it and I'll turn it over. Thanks.","Tim Leach","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs.","Brian Singer","Thank you. Good morning. A couple of follow-ups on similar topics. On slide 9, you talked about decades long inventory in the six to eight per section spacing range. To what degree would you be planning to be using the low end of that range in the 2020 program? And what do you see as the impact on productivity, i.e., what is the gain in EU are that are six well per section program would provide versus, say, an eight well per section?","Tim Leach","Sure. Probably we\u2019ll get into a whole lot more detail about 2020 and individuals facing the projects probably next quarter. But I think the main takeaway there ought to be that regardless of the ultimate spacing density, we expect to have an inventory life measured in multiple decades. But clearly, 2020 will move towards a more meaningful up space program than we've had in the past \u2013 that we\u2019ve had in 2019.","Brian Singer","Got it. Okay. Thanks. And then, you do have a few moving pieces that are impacting end of year into early next year production trajectory. You\u2019ve got tighter spaced wells which have the strong first three month production. But the greater subsequent declines and one would think there would be an impact from wells drilled in third quarter or even second quarter that are going to be seen then.","You've got that mix to the wider spaced wells and then you've got the docks that were highlighted earlier coming online. Can you just speak to what you see as the aggregate impact on the trajectory in the first half, first quarter, second quarter next year, and whether you expect ratable growth particularly on the oil side through the quarters or more backend loaded production profile?","Tim Leach","Yeah, Brian. So I think to say it another way, the collection of those things and the sale of the shelf has increased our base decline a bit. However, the efficiency gains that we've seen on the up space program in 2020 I think provides a pretty good offset to that. So we expect to continue the fourth quarter momentum into 2020.","Brian Singer","Got it. And can you say what the base \u2013 what the updated base decline is? And does that come down over the course of 2020?","Tim Leach","Sure. Yeah. The \u2013 our overall base decline is in the high 30s and oil is in the low 40s. And as we move through 2020 and move into 2021, we see that oil decline moving back into the 30s.","Brian Singer","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Vin Lovaglio with Mizuho. Vin, your line is open. You can ask your question.","Paul Sankey","Hi. Sorry, guys. It's Paul Sankey. I wasn't thinking. The outlooks 2020 is obviously very important. We really appreciate the free cash flow parameters that you've laid down. Could we just dig in a little bit more, if possible? I know you may be reluctant to answer some of these questions, but on [indiscernible] you've implied that you're using a lower gas and NGL price.","Could you talk more about what you're assuming there? Could you talk a bit about non-operated activity assumed as well, and any thoughts about well cost reductions and any other parameters that you can give us to sort of dig into that 350 at 50 number which is so important? Thank you.","Jack Harper","I don't want to comment on the exact gas and NGL assumption other than to say it's conservative. And then on the non-op side, I think what we should expect from us year-over-year is probably a bit less activity in that area and more control over our higher percentage of our capital for 2020.","Paul Sankey","Okay. Thank you. And then a follow-up is simply is there potential for more disposals and can you talk a little bit more about the decision to buy back stock as opposed to for example raising the dividend? Thank you.","Jack Harper","Sure. On slide 10, we show kind of the last four years-worth of asset divestitures, and I think some level of that is, it should be expected. I think this year was a little bit higher because of the shelf.","Tim Leach","Yeah, let me \u2013 on the how we balance dividend versus stock buybacks. I would say that it would kind of laid out a framework for where we think the free cash flow could be under the different side boards. And I think philosophically you'll see us kind of increase the dividend more in a systematic way and in a way that we can sustain forever. And then every other dollar that's available especially at this price, I'm going to be buying stock back.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Deckelbaum with Cowen.","David Deckelbaum","Good morning everyone. I appreciate the time. Jack, I wanted to ask a little bit more on the comments about not chasing the incremental barrel with the 2020 thoughts, I guess, one, should we think about those bookends of free cash as sort of underpinning an identical rate program at the bottom and top ends of that spectrum?","And then two, are you conceptualizing this as finding a steady state rig program that you would then just extrapolate into 2021 unless oil prices were lower than $50, so that this free cash wedge that you're targeting in 2020 would grow into 2021.","Jack Harper","Yeah, good question. We \u2013 as we've mentioned in the prepared remarks, we really value a steady program from here out. And so to answer your specific question, there is no rig change is assumed in that different \u2013 in those different oil price scenarios.","And then beyond 2020, we'll have to see what the landscape looks like. But combining growth with an ever increasing free cash flow amount is what we're targeting. And so, whatever rig count is appropriate to effect that is what we're targeting. But anything that \u2013 from this point on will be steady and marked as we move up.","David Deckelbaum","I appreciate that. Also, just curious as you commented earlier that your gas and NGL assumption for next year is conservative. Well, obviously what's happening on the screen is that influencing any differencing capital allocation next year maybe away from Delaware into Midland that's maybe helping that oil growth a bit in the model.","Jack Harper","Sure. There's a lot of things impacting our allocation decisions in 2020. And I really don't want to get into too much detail. But we do have a portfolio that allows us to target more oily zones if need be. I would also remind you, we have some gas hedges in place in 2020,as well, that help offset some of those declines.","Tim Leach","And the sale of the shelf is gassier than the whole company.","Jack Harper","Exactly.","Tim Leach","But that improves it.","David Deckelbaum","I appreciate the responses guys. Good luck. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Scott Hanold with RBC Capital Markets.","Scott Hanold","Thanks. Good morning. Nice rebound guys If I go back to page 7, because I think this is to me an important slide, it shows certainly a great progression on the cost side. Obviously, you guys came down to a very competitive level relative to the best peers this quarter already. And do you find these as generally sustainable levels?","And is there more opportunity to improve as you go to these pilots that aren't as \u2013 go to development that's not as tightly based as the pilots, meaning, as you kind of more from the tighter space pilots, off to your 2020 program later in the year, does that provide a little bit of a tailwind on the cost side?","Tim Leach","Sure. I mean, I do think the teams have done a great job getting the cost down pretty impressively over the course of the year. And I wouldn't want to predict the ability to improve from here, but certainly that's a major focal point. I kind of talked earlier about what some of the factors are on the cyclical side that could cause it to improve potentially from here.","There are definitely things -- there's a whole slew of smaller gains around how we drill and complete the wells that should allow us to shave kind of days and thus cost off. But it's going to probably be a bit of a slog from here to implement those.","Scott Hanold","Understood.","Tim Leach","And I would I would just add that we pointed out before that changing pace, there's a lot of inefficiency into the system. And that's when we slowed down in early 2019. They created a lot of inefficiency in our system as well. And as Jack has described a more steady pace, I think just by its very nature, that steady pace will be more efficient than what we've done in 2019.","Scott Hanold","Okay. Perfect. And as a follow-up, and, Tim you'd talked about with free cash flow priorities, certainly the dividends, one of those, can you give a little color on what you see as a competitive dividend for your company? Is it relative to some of your large cap E&P peers? Do you look at the S&P 500? What is sort of that benchmark you'd like to see it at?","Tim Leach","Well you know we've said for a couple of years now that we would like the dividend to be an important part of your investment decision in Concho. And so I think it has to be competitive with other peers and other industrial companies eventually. But I think the most important thing on the dividend is just the steady growth of the dividend.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bob Brackett with Bernstein Research.","Bob Brackett","Hey. Good morning. If we can revisit the comments you made on the federal frac band, could you give us any color you've had with conversations with the New Mexico government given your important role in that state?","Tim Leach","Yeah, they've become very -- an important partner to work within the state of New Mexico because of how much of their budget comes from the oil and gas industry. And probably more than half of their lands in New Mexico, more than half of the revenues they're getting are coming from federal activity. So they're running a budget surplus right now.","They understand completely that that budget surplus is coming from the activity and Lea and Eddy County, New Mexico. And so they're very much on the same page with us. Interested in continuing that economic activity and understanding that that's what's going to fund schools and roads in their state.","Bob Brackett","Good. Thanks. And a follow up on a different topic. You mentioned the allocation of asset sale proceeds, they\u2019re sort of 60:40 split between the debt and share repurchases, how do we think about that ratio for future free cash flow or another way to think about it, what's the ideal sort of debt level at which you're happy with debt and incremental cash goes to share repurchases?","Tim Leach","Sure, we'll close this sale and paying down our revolver balance, we are happy with where our debt stands for now. And so incremental cash flow in the near term will be divided between our dividend and the share repurchase.","Operator","Our next question comes from Leo Mariani with KeyBanc.","Leo Mariani","Hey guys just wanted to conceptually follow up a little bit on the goalposts here for 2020. You guys did mention some steady rig ads throughout the year. Obviously you guys reduced the activity substantially during 2019. In the past, you guys have talked about kind of a similar level of activity and CapEx in 2020. Just trying to get a sense, does that still apply or are we going to see similar activity or should we expect maybe a little bit lower activity in 2020 versus 2019?","Tim Leach","Oh, I think whatever you should expect. It will be steady and nothing drastic when we do add a rig or two from where we are at this moment. So we will give all those details though in February when we stew in the correct cost at that time, our current efficiency outlook. So that's when we'll roll that out.","Leo Mariani","Okay, and I guess just a question around your comment about low double-digit oil growth in 2020, is the expectation. I\u2019m just trying to get a sense, is that sort of adjust for the New Mexico shelf sale. I guess where I\u2019m going is, would that sort of assume you didn't have the shelf in 2019 when we do the kind of low double-digit percentage increase to get there.","Tim Leach","Yeah.","Jack Harper","That\u2019s correct.","Tim Leach","Right. It\u2019s pro forma oil growth.","Leo Mariani","Okay. Now, that makes sense. All right. And just a couple questions on a few of your guidance numbers. So, you guys talked about GP&T going up to about $1.40 per Boe in the fourth quarter. Just trying to get a sense if that\u2019s the right run rate we should be thinking about into 2020. And then the same question on the G&A side, I guess that went down a bunch this quarter. Is that kind of right run rate on G&A as well?","Tim Leach","Sure. I'll take the GP&T piece which is just \u2013 what you're seeing there is that Gulf Coast pricing contract coming into effect in the fourth quarter [indiscernible] we have 400 GP&T rather than the impact on our realized price. And I think Jack you want to hit the G&A.","Jack Harper","Yeah. I think they're \u2013 when you think about G&A in the near-term, roughly $2 a unit is the right way to think about that and trending down over time as we work towards that $9 controlled book cash goal.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ryan Todd with Piper Jaffray.","Ryan Todd","Thanks. Maybe just the high level kind of from a philosophical point of view and how do you think about the ideal pace of growth for your company over the medium to long-term. I mean you indicated low double-digits for next year. Is that the right number in terms of kind of maximizing the efficiency, the organization that you have. Or how do we think about that relative to the mid-single or mid-double-digit type of growth number in terms of the most efficient use of your organization.","Tim Leach","I've always thought of growth being an output of good execution and efficiency. So, I don't start with a targeted growth number. I think on this, and if we described in the slides, we've kind of targeted a lower commodity price that we could operate and have free cash flow breakeven cash flow at lower oil prices. That's the starting point.","And then at \u2013 while we think the average oil prices I described in my prepared remarks, the average of what it's been over the last five years, that gives you the sideboards of our activity level and how much free cash flow you can expect in addition to what I think double-digit growth is growth enough. I think for our industry to start attracting capital again, we're going to have to offer an investment thesis that is different than what we've done in the past.","And I think having growth and a robust amount of free cash flow this return to shareholders, I think we can do that. And we may be one of the few companies that can do that. And so, that's what we're going to demonstrate.","Ryan Todd","Thanks. That's helpful. I appreciate the color there. And then maybe just a quick one, though, on slide 8, the production curves that you have there that show the comparison between the more tightly spaced and the wider spaced wells, are those wider spaced curves there, are those based on recent developments of yours that have been sort of been a wider spacing?","Going back a couple of years over different projects you have, that's based on actual data and is that kind of representative of what we should expect filling going forward from a real well productivity point of view?","Tim Leach","Yeah, I mean we've been on a relatively long evolutionary track of density testing kind of over the eight years we\u2019ve been drilling holes for oil. And so yes, that reflects the wider spacing we tested before we moved to the more dense space, and that's really what underlies our confidence and what will happen is we revert to a wider spacing better.","Ryan Todd","Great, I appreciate it. Great quarter, guys.","Tim Leach","All right, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Nitin Kumar with Wells Fargo.","Nitin Kumar","Oh, good morning and thank you for taking my questions. Just want to touch base on the slide 7 there. Obviously very impressive defining your cost, I'm just wondering, was that \u2013 you had a few more closely spaced wells in the first half of this year, was there any part of the design of those wells that drove cost up. You've talked about efficiencies and other things. I mean, you said differently, could you deliver closely spaced well for about $1,100 a foot today?","Tim Leach","That's a \u2013 that's a good question, I mean, probably not, is the answer today. I mean, clearly one of the things you saw there was the higher cost in the end of 2018 and the very first quarter of 2019 was, we found some inefficiencies as you try to more densely develop and keep wells as you're drilling with it, and more tightly spaced window for example.","And so force you to slow down relative to what you can do if you don't have such a narrow window that you're targeting. So I do think there\u2019s \u2013 some of the improvement is the decision to move to a water spacing.","Nitin Kumar","Okay, great. And, so my follow up at the end of the quarter, you had 85 docks, that\u2019s about 4.5 wells per rig. I think you\u2019ve mentioned 70 docks by the end of this year. What's a normal run rate as you move through a wider spacing and shorter \u2013 sorry, smaller projects in 2020? What\u2019s a good run rate for us and think about in terms of docks per rig?","Tim Leach","Probably in that two to three times territory or rig count.","Nitin Kumar","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Gail Nicholson with Stephens.","Gail Nicholson","Good morning everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. In regard to the JV with Solaris, can you just talk about any potential CapEx, well cost or ROE savings we should conceptualize with that agreement?","Tim Leach","Oh, one of the big benefits is they have a very sizable amount of existing infrastructure. And then as part of that deal, we contributed in Eddy County are water handling infrastructure as well. So it should help us mitigate the need to spend incremental capital on those types of things in the future.","Gail Nicholson","Okay. Great. And then just from a housekeeping aspect, what are the \u2013 what was the ROE for the shelf assets on a per daily basis?","Tim Leach","It was substantially higher than our company average.","Operator","Our last question comes from Richard Tullis with Capital One.","Richard Tullis","All right. Thanks. Good morning everyone. Two quick questions, one for Will, what\u2019s the planned average project size for 2020? And at a high level, what do you expect the allocation of CapEx to be between the Midland and Delaware basins next year?","Will Giraud","Yeah. Those are definitely topics we'll get into in a lot more detail here in February. But in general, I would say the average project size will be slightly smaller the average project size will be slightly smaller, and certainly, the change will be \u2013 the very large projects will be a lot closer to that average number.","Richard Tullis","Okay. And then just lastly for Tim or Jack, just maybe more of a macro view question. What's next for the US E&P sector? Are you expecting a acceleration of consolidation due to the current investor environment for free cash flow, slower growth and maybe the scale required to deliver consistent operational results?","Will Giraud","I think yes on both fronts. I think first of all, more disciplined capital decisions and capital efficiency, more discipline across the industry. And then, yeah, I think \u2013 we've been talking about consolidation for years, though, and it's just a slow process to grind out cost at a \u2013 and efficiency out of this industry.","Tim Leach","Yeah. Richard, I think this price discovery phase is \u2013 it will single out the companies that have the scale and the capabilities to do what we're talking about over a multiple decade period. And I think that's what will define the winners.","Richard Tullis","All right. Very good. Nice quarter. Thank you.","Tim Leach","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's Q&A portion. I'd like to turn the call back over to our host.","Tim Leach","Great. Thank you again for dialing in. This is a great conversation, very proud, as I said, of our employees at Concho and the work they've done this quarter. And I'm very happy with the results and look forward to talking to you in February. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's presentation.

And welcome to the Fourth Quarter 2011 Concho Resources Incorporated Earnings Conference Call. My name is, Chris, and I\u2019ll be your conference moderator for today. Presently, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will facilitate a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions)","At this time, I would now like to turn the conference over to your presenter for today, Mr. Price Moncrief, Director of Corporate Development. Sir, you may proceed.","Price Moncrief","Good morning, everyone. We\u2019re glad you could join us today for Concho\u2019s fourth quarter and year end 2011 conference call. Before we get started, I\u2019d like to direct your attention to the forward-looking statement disclaimer contained in the press release.","In summary, it says that statements in the press release and on this conference call that states the company\u2019s or management\u2019s expectations, or predictions of the future are forward-looking statements intended to be covered by the Safe Harbor provisions under the federal securities laws. There are many factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations, including those we\u2019ve described in the press release, our 10-K and other filings with the SEC.","In addition, we will reference certain non-GAAP measures, so be sure to see the reconciliations in our earnings release.","On today\u2019s call, I\u2019m joined by Tim Leach, our Chairman and CEO; and Joe Wright, our COO. He will discuss our 2011 results. We are also joined by other members of our management team, who will be able to answer questions later on the call.","With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Tim.","Tim Leach","Thanks, Price, and thanks everyone for joining the call. The management team is with me here in Houston, where we just concluded our quarterly board meeting and we\u2019re looking forward to spending some time at the [late] conference.","I was pleased at this meeting to welcome Gary Merriman to the Concho Board. Gary\u2019s careers included 26 years at Conoco, where he ultimately retired as President of Conoco ENP in 2002, and he recently served as a Board member of Petrohawk. So we\u2019re very pleased to add his talent to our team.","Before I turn the call over to Joe to discuss the operational highlights, let me comment on what I think are some of the important achievements for the year. 2011 will be remembered as the year that natural gas prices collapsed and everyone tried to get oily.","As a result, more attention was directed toward the Permian, where a combination of new technology, courage and luck unlocked new sources of oil from overlook formations. The industry discovered vast new resources. Concho finds itself right in the middle of the action. People and equipment are moving to the Permian, we are reaching record levels of activity.","Profit margins remain high even with the lower natural gas prices. Our cash margins are as strong as they\u2019ve ever been. To that point, it\u2019s worth highlighting that less than 10% of our revenue came from the sale of residual gas in \u201811.","The main challenge at Concho in the short-term is to capture as much of this opportunity as possible without over extending. We\u2019ll have to be very selective in the opportunities that we choose to pursue and there are now many, many opportunities.","Now for the more mundane achievements. We ended the year with record levels of production, reserves and cash flow. Production grew 51%, 27% organic organically. Reserves were up nearly 20% and we drilled over 800 wells.","To put things into perspective, Concho is now the second largest producer on a gross operated basis in the Permian. While it seems like an uneventful year for Concho, we signed up over $600 million in acquisitions. We added 185,000 new acres to our inventory through leasing and acquisitions. We sold our Bakken assets for $200 million. We completed a $600 million bond offering and we hired 219 new employees. That\u2019s a lot of activity for such quiet year.","Let me talk a moment about our assets. We continue to be encouraged by our result in the Delaware Basin. This core asset now is contributing 16% of the company\u2019s total production. That\u2019s up from just 7% in the first quarter.","Our team has now drilled about 180 horizontal wells here since 2009 and continued to expand our knowledge and confidence in this play. This opportunity is quite large, both geographically and from the standpoint of multi-stack pays. We\u2019re continuing to identify highly productive pay zones up and down the strake column.","There\u2019s been a lot of excitement lately on the Wolfcamp play primarily in the Midland Basin. But we are enthusiastic about our recent success with the Wolfcamp in the Delaware Basin where we just drilled and completed two horizontal wells that have an average 30 day IP of 1,241 BOEs a day.","We currently have four other wells targeting the Wolfcamp that are either completing or drilling and another 14 horizontal Wolfcamp wells ending in \u201812. This is all additive to the Bone Spring and Avalon success that we\u2019ve also had.","As we discussed in the past, the Wolfcamp is present across the entire Permian, we believe that we currently have over 100,000 net acres perspective for the Wolfcamp in the Delaware Basin. There will be a lot to do here for many years and with our position and our infrastructure, we\u2019ll continue to be a leader.","Over in Texas, we previously announced our PDC Wolfberry acquisition which is set to close at the end of February. This deal will help us reload our Wolfberry inventory, increase our interest, expand our presence in the play to the north. This type of smaller bolt-on opportunities seem to be coming to us more frequently than ever.","And with all this change that we\u2019re experiencing, we remain committed to the philosophies that build Concho, drilling within cash flow, maintaining a strong and simple capital structure, producing high profit margins and reinvesting in high rate return projects.","Let me now hand the mic over to Joe for an operations update and I look forward to taking your questions during the Q&A.","Joe Wright","2011 was a challenging year for operations in the Permian. Mainly around issues like takeaway, service cost, weather conditions and logistics. But 2011 was a great year for us. Our year end results demonstrate our ability to execute when faced with challenges and either meet or exceed our goals for the year.","As we complete our 2011 budget and are now moving into implementation of our 2012 plan, there seems to be an easing of the pressure of our product sales, cost and manpower. I believe our contractors have done a good job of increasing capacity. At the same time that the number of drilling rigs continues to increase.","We\u2019ll continue to see the rig count grow though as these rigs that are capable of drilling the oily horizontal plays move out of the gassy plays and into the Basin. Our company is ready to meet any challenges in 2012.","Now to our year end results. We grew proved reserves approximately 20% to 386 million barrels, while producing 23.6 million barrels. This production volume was 51% above our 2010 production and above the high-end of our guidance of 23.3 million barrels for \u201811.","At the end of 2011, 61% of our proved reserves were classified as proved developed, which is up from 57% in 2010. The oil and gas mix of both our proved reserves and our production was 62% oil and 38% wet gas, which has remained steady since the Marbob acquisition. As you recall, Marbob had some legacy gas production from the Morrow and Atoka intervals which caused our oil percentage to be slightly reduced.","All three of our core assets contributed to the production and reserve growth in 2011, with the largest contribution coming from our Delaware Basin assets. We\u2019re proved reserves and production more than doubled in 2011.","Since closing the Marbob transaction, we\u2019ve completed 55 horizontal wells with an average 30 day IP of greater than 720 barrels a day. 31 of these wells had a peak one day IP of greater than 1000 barrels a day. So you can understand why we\u2019re excited about the potential of this play.","So -- one of our goals for the Basin in 2011 was to identify and better understand the multi-pay horizontal targets ranging from the Delaware formation through the Bone Springs and Wolfcamp intervals and into the Penn Shale. That\u2019s why we drilled several initial tests in these targets over a large aerial extent.","The results have been very encouraging and lead us to believe that multiple targets exist across most of our acreage position and we plan to test different development methods such as multi-lateral drilling in 2012.","As a result, we have allocated a greater portion of our 2012 drilling capital, relative to 2011 to the Delaware Basins. Another area of focus in 2012 is our most Southern Delaware Basin acreage where we now own over 100,000 net acres. We have drilled several vertical Wolfcamp, Bone Spring wells and we will be drilling at least seven horizontal wells in that area during 2012.","Over the Midland Basin, we drilled our first horizontal Cline well in Glasgow County, which is on the eastern side of the Midland Basin. Our early production tests are in line with our initial projections. We\u2019ll evaluate this acreage with another horizontal well this year and in 2012 we plan to drill two horizontal wells on the western side of the Midland Basin\u2019s well.","Lastly, I want to comment on our lease operating expense for 2011. Our lifting cost in the fourth quarter was higher than the last guidance I gave you in November and caused our full year 2011 LOE to be higher than forecasted.","This increase is primarily driven by higher than normal contract labor costs, lease maintenance and service work on our shale properties, as our production related activities increased with the Marbob acquisition.","Also contributing to the overall increase were higher wages and cost of services. But a significant amount was non-recurring cost. The asset team has and will be working hard to reduce these expenses in 2012.","Despite the higher per unit LOE in the fourth quarter and for the full year, our business remains as profitable today as it has in the past and even with our revised 2012 LOE guidance of $6.80 to $7.20, I expect our profitability and margins to remain consistently strong.","Overall, I\u2019m very pleased with our operational success in the fourth quarter and for 2011.","I would now like to turn the call over to the moderator and we can answer any of your questions you may have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from the line of John Freeman with Raymond James. You may proceed.","John Freeman \u2013 Raymond James","Good morning.","Tim Leach","Hey, John.","John Freeman \u2013 Raymond James","Just wanted to follow up, Joe, on what you were discussing on the higher end and some of the reasons for the higher LOE. Has any of that carried over on to just sort of the complete well cost side, the last quarter you\u2019d said costs had been pretty flat on the well costs, you expected that to remain flat in \u201812. Should we also start assuming that the well costs a little bit higher now?","Joe Wright","No. I wouldn\u2019t assume that at all. 2011 we had a slight increase in the first quarter to the second quarter, but have kept those costs pretty much flat through the last three quarters of \u201811. I anticipate the same moving into \u201812 now and that\u2019s the way we modeled our budget for 2012.","John Freeman \u2013 Raymond James","Okay. And then on the two recent, the horizontal Wolfcamp wells, the really strong 30-day rates is and I know this is obviously very early. But is there anything that you\u2019ve seen in those two wells that would indicate that the general decline curves are any different than what you\u2019ve had on the Avalon and the Bone Springs? I guess, another way to say it is, in your prior guidance, you\u2019ve said that the northern Delaware Basin, if you had a 30-day rate that was somewhere around 1,200 to 1,300 that would indicate an EUR of around 600 to 700, is that kind of the ballpark assumptions that we could use on the first two wells?","Jack Harper","Hey, John. This is Jack. I\u2019d say it\u2019s probably too early to make the assumptions on the EURs. But clearly that kind of rate is strong and higher than we\u2019ve seen out of some of the other formations.","John Freeman \u2013 Raymond James","Okay. And then last question, I\u2019ll turn over to somebody else, you mentioned the Cline shale that you tried on the Midland side. Are there any plans to or if you\u2019ve already done any Penn Shale wells on the Delaware side? ","Joe Wright","Yeah. We\u2019ve got one drilling right now, John.","John Freeman \u2013 Raymond James","Okay. Great. Thanks, guys.","Joe Wright","Okay. Thank you.","Operator"," Our next question comes from the line of Neal Dingman with SunTrust. You may proceed.","Neal Dingman \u2013 SunTrust","Good morning, gentlemen. Just a couple questions. First, just on well design, as you look now, are you about on, when you look at sort of, I guess, just looking at the Mexico Shelf first, on sort of this stages lateral if those set are just on the completions, are you trying to said where you are or are you still sort of tweaking that?","Joe Wright","We\u2019re still tweaking that. I mean, I think that\u2019s parts of the cycle, part of the evaluation.","Tim Leach","He\u2019s talking about the shelf?","Joe Wright","Well, I think in general, I\u2019m answering for even the Delaware plays well.","Neal Dingman \u2013 SunTrust","Yeah. That\u2019s exactly. I\u2019m just kind of in general.","Joe Wright","Yeah. It and -- it\u2019s -- we will continue to look at ways to increase our EUR and increase those rates of return and lower those cost. So I think we will see longer, longer and longer laterals. That\u2019s a good example that you mentioned.","Neal Dingman \u2013 SunTrust","So, I guess that\u2019s what I was getting at. So it seems you\u2019ll continue to see improving results and it\u2019s fair to say that based on some of the modifications you\u2019re still doing, it\u2019s fair to say, I guess, you wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see these results continue to improve as they have over the last couple of quarters?","Joe Wright","Yeah. I mean, they\u2019re good, the results are really strong and have exceeded our expectations. So predicting they\u2019ll even get better, I think it\u2019s a little dicey, but we\u2019ve been very pleased with what\u2019s happened so far.","Neal Dingman \u2013 SunTrust","And then, Tim, just lastly and then I\u2019ll turn it over, just, you\u2019ve done a great job of just doing some of these, not just bolt-on acquisition, but even mixed with some of these large ones, is there still things available that you are seeing, now you have been approached with things are now given the environment are things just getting a little too pricy to make that, where it getting right?","Tim Leach","Well, I mean, we\u2019re in a really hot area, so everything, there\u2019s pressure on pricing when we look at deals and everything of course. But, as we talked in the past, I think having the ability to execute and drill and put these things online, really, gives us an advantage. And I think that causes us to see a lot of deals and have things come our way, and I don\u2019t ever remember a time where we had more deals lined up in the queue than we got right now.","Neal Dingman \u2013 SunTrust","Well and last with that, last one if I could, just you did mention on the takeaway, I know infrastructure continues to be an issue throughout the play. It seems like though you are in better position than a lot of your peer. Is that just something you continue to work on as far as just continuing to add the infrastructure or do you have enough now to add the capacity that you\u2019re growing into or will you just continue to add that infrastructure?","Tim Leach","Well, we don\u2019t really own much infrastructure. But we are a very large producer and we have good relationships with the midstream guys, whether it\u2019s oil transportation or NGLs or gas. So we\u2019ve been able to move our product when others haven\u2019t.","And I think that the midstream guys have done a good job because there\u2019s so much profit in it of racing to keep the capacity up with the activity. So I think, we think that we will continue to have adequate takeaway capacity and I think over the next three or four years, it will even -- there will be more capacity for the entire Basin.","Neal Dingman \u2013 SunTrust","Got it. Thanks Tim for the answer.","Tim Leach","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Scott Hanold, RBC Capital Markets. You may proceed.","Scott Hanold \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Thanks. Hey, guys.","Tim Leach","Hey, Scott.","Scott Hanold \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Question on the Cline well that you indicated that you drilled and saw some results that were, I guess encouraging. I mean, could you give us a little bit more context to color, maybe there is a pay zone or sort of I know you guys tend not to like give initial production rates, but some general color on what that means?","Tim Leach","Yeah. You guys, anyone want to address that?","Matt Hyde","Sure. This is Matt Hyde, Explorations VP. We are in that area on the Eastern Midland Basin. Our thickness is in that Penn Shale Cline interval are similar to what other operators are operating in back to the west of us and to the north of us and actually to the south, so we\u2019re pretty surrounded by similar thicknesses.","The total section thickness is several hundred feet thick and obviously the net pay age within that is the variable component of that. But we\u2019re very enthusiastic about what we\u2019re seeing in terms of rock over there at this point in time.","Scott Hanold \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","So, based on what you see, I mean, how, I guess, I mean earlier, you are in the process here and this is an area that you could be more active yet some time this year?","Matt Hyde","Well, I think, as Joe intimated, it probably will be following up with the second well on this almost 10,000 acre block on the eastern side of the Midland Basin. So the answer would be yeah to that.","Scott Hanold \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Okay. And then, in the Delaware Basin on the horizontal Wolfcamp well you drilled, it sounds like those rates were, I think it was 1,241? How much gas is there? Are you seeing it a little bit more gassy than like the Bone Springs and Avalon, and can you give us a sense of\u2026","Tim Leach","Right.","Scott Hanold \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","\u2026 kind of what you saw with those?","Tim Leach","Well, it\u2019s shaley. And as we\u2019ve said in the past, the shaley producers produce a little bit more gas. So it\u2019s more in line with the Avalon production. Although we do think in the Avalon there is an oil window. But these Wolfcamp wells tends to be a third, a third, a third, a third crude oil, a third NGLs and a third dry gas.","Scott Hanold \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Okay. Okay. Great. And one last question, if I could, when you\u2019re looking at sort of your development program here in 2012, obviously a lot more focus in the Delaware Basin? What do you expect from the Yeso and the Texas Permian in general? I mean, is that production going to see sort of a modest growth in general and most the activity or most of the growth is going to be happening in the Delaware Basin?","Tim Leach","Yeah. Well, I think, that\u2019s a way to characterize it. I mean, we are taking cash flow out of both those areas to help fund the Delaware Basin. At the same time, in the Wolfberry, for example, we\u2019ve been able to do more and more bolt-on acquisitions that give us higher interest and higher economics. And so that you\u2019ll see a ramp-up in rigs there in the Wolfberry.","And also, in the Yeso, I mean, we\u2019re doing a lot of horizontal work in the Yeso and I think there is still a lot of oil in place there. In addition, there are some acquisition opportunities there as well. So it\u2019s not like those things are on autopilot.","Scott Hanold \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Got it. Okay. Thanks.","Tim Leach","Yeah.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jessica Chipman with TPH. You may proceed.","Jessica Chipman \u2013 TPH","Hey. Good morning, guys.","Tim Leach","Good morning.","Jessica Chipman \u2013 TPH","Just a couple of quick questions. I think you mentioned you\u2019re drilling two horizontals this year in the Midland Basin. One would be Cline and the other would be Wolfcamp more south in Upton County?","Joe Wright","We\u2019re going to really be drilling more than that. We\u2019re looking at another well on the eastern side in the Cline. And then we\u2019ll drill two Wolfcamp horizontals on the western side of the Midland Basin, around our existing production base there.","Jessica Chipman \u2013 TPH","Okay. And then you mentioned a 10,000-acre block in Glasscock, I guess, prospective for the Cline. Have you any sort of idea around what acreage would look like around the Wolfcamp in the western Midland Basin at this point, I know you have yet to total it out?","Joe Wright","Yeah. That\u2019s where our core Wolfberry position is and we have a substantial acreage position there.","Jessica Chipman \u2013 TPH","And then just following up on an earlier question on infrastructure, I know you have good relationships with the midstream guys. I\u2019m just wondering, do you have specific plans to add incremental processing or oil takeaway capacity over the next two years?","Joe Wright","Well, we\u2019re not really in that business, but there is a considerable amount of incremental capacity being added. I mean, there is -- there are projects right now that are being completed. There are projects under construction and there is project still on the drawing board.","Jessica Chipman \u2013 TPH","And just last, I think there are couple operators out with some more variable results in that southern part of the Delaware Basin around Wolfbone acreage and I know you give a wide range from 100,000 to 400,000 barrel EURs. I mean is it reasonable to assume the midpoint of that range or do you just at this point don\u2019t see a lot of variability?","Tim Leach","Yeah. There\u2019s definitely still a lot of variability and most of the activity has been vertical. But as Joe said we\u2019re going to test some horizontal well there this year, so it\u2019s most certainly evolving at this point.","Jessica Chipman \u2013 TPH","Okay. All right. Thank you.","Joe Wright","Thank you. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Pearce Hammond with Simmons & Company. You may proceed. ","Pearce Hammond \u2013 Simmons & Company","Good morning. ","Tim Leach","Good morning. ","Pearce Hammond \u2013 Simmons & Company","Could you elaborate on the attributes of targeting the Wolfcamp in the Delaware Basin versus the Midland Basin as far as well costs, rates of return, IP rates, et cetera?","Jack Harper","Sure. This is Jack. I\u2019ll take a shot at that. That\u2019s a lot of questions.","Tim Leach","Yeah. Everybody pointed at Jack because no one else wanted to answer that question. ","Jack Harper","It\u2019s, again, early and all, and there\u2019s still science involved in both areas. Generally, the wells in the Delaware targeting the Wolfcamp are going to be more expensive and we would expect higher initial rates and so it\u2019s hard to compare economics but they both appear to have economics at this point.","Pearce Hammond \u2013 Simmons & Company","Do you think that the Delaware Basin is more attractive, at least from your perspective than the Midland Basin for the Wolfcamp?","Tim Leach","I\u2019ll take that one. That\u2019s more kinds of up my alley, I think. I like the Delaware Basin because it\u2019s deeper, thicker. I think you have more potential stack pay zones there probably than you have in the Midland Basin.","At the same time, when we look at our projects in the Midland Basin and look at the rates of return there, they are real competitive. But on the margin, I like having multiple pay opportunities and we really haven\u2019t started baking in the impact of having multiple pay opportunities yet into the economics that we\u2019re talking about.","Pearce Hammond \u2013 Simmons & Company","Do you think you could have the largest acreage position in the Permian that\u2019s perspective for the Wolfcamp?","Tim Leach","In the entire Permian, no, probably not, I mean, there are major oil companies that have bigger acreage footprints than we have and Pioneer may have a bigger acreage footprint than we have in the Midland Basin anyway.","Pearce Hammond \u2013 Simmons & Company","And then lastly, if you could just touch on service costs and service availability, and how that has changed here thus far in this quarter and\u2026","Joe Wright","Yeah. This is Joe. It really has been a little bit of relief there in terms of just that in Cline. I think we\u2019ve done a really good job of maintaining those costs on the capital side and of course. I\u2019ve already commented on the LOE side. The capacity has increased, a lot of it depends on how the rig count, what happens with the rig count as we kind of move forward in the increased demands in that basin, but right now, it feels very good.","Pearce Hammond \u2013 Simmons & Company","Thank you.","Tim Leach","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bob Morris with Citigroup. You may proceed.","Bob Morris \u2013 Citigroup","Good morning.","Tim Leach","Good morning, Bob.","Bob Morris \u2013 Citigroup","Good morning. You had mentioned that you have more bolt-on opportunities than ever before. Why is that that all of a sudden with the hot environment, people are more willing to let lose their properties. And in that regard, is there anything other than price that would restrain your appetite to significantly add to your inventory this year, like just manpower availability or anything else? ","Tim Leach","Yeah. I don\u2019t know that I can know the answers why everybody wants to sell. But I think, I mean, there\u2019s a combination of things. It\u2019s tougher to be a smaller operator right now and get the services necessary to go out and drill the wells. And so I think our size and scope has an advantage that causes things to come our way. I think that also that you\u2019ve got companies that are redeploying capital from one area to other that kind of drives things as well.","And you also, I mean there\u2019s, on the last 10, 15 years, there\u2019s been more private equity firms that and companies that are back with private equity that have a limited life on how long they are going to stay in these things and that causes this smaller deals to come our way.","Bob Morris \u2013 Citigroup","And then just anything that would restrain other than price or appetite to significantly add to your inventory this year or\u2026","Tim Leach","I mentioned trying to capture as much inventory or opportunity as possible without over overextending. So we always keep an eye on our balance sheet. I want to keep a strong balance sheet. I want to make sure that we drill within cash flow, so I want to make sure that we buy things that we have immediate plans to drill on and immediate cash flow to drill with. So those are, it\u2019s more of an art than it is a science maybe.","Bob Morris \u2013 Citigroup","Sure. Then on a separate topic, you mentioned last quarter, you planned to average 35 rigs for the year. Is that still the plan and when do you expect to begin adding those or putting those rigs to work?","Joe Wright","That is still the plan to average that. We have already started adding to our rig fleet and we have scheduled the additional rigs to meet that budget.","Bob Morris \u2013 Citigroup","Okay. Great. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks.","Tim Leach","Yeah.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rhys Williams, Global Hunter Securities. You may proceed.","Rhys Williams \u2013 Global Hunter Securities","Most of my questions have been answered, guys, but can you talk about how much exposure you have to the oily part of the Avalon shale and at least what portion of your exposure there you think is expected for oil.","Tim Leach","Yeah. I may turn in the middle of this answer over to somebody else to finish up. But in general, we don\u2019t have a bright line defining where the oily section is yet. There\u2019s not enough data, but generally it\u2019s over on the eastern side of New Mexico, mostly in Lee County.","And we\u2019ve been adding a lot of acreage there recently in our OGX acquisition and other acquisitions. I don\u2019t -- does anybody around here know how much acreage we have over on that side or do we have a way to answer that question.","Joe Wright","I\u2019d say, it\u2019s hard to define right now.","Tim Leach","Yeah.","Rhys Williams \u2013 Global Hunter Securities","All right. Thank you. ","Tim Leach","Yeah.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Irene Haas. You may proceed.","Irene Haas \u2013 Wunderlich Securities, Inc.","Kinds of want to focus on Cline Shale in specific, which county are you active in, are you at the Glasscock County area? And my second question is, how deep it is and what\u2019s the potential aerial extent, I mean, shale should be pretty kinds of extensive throughout the Midland Basin, so what are your constraints? Are you just trying to hit the oil window, something like that?","Tim Leach","Yeah. Hi, Irene. Good morning.","Irene Haas \u2013 Wunderlich Securities, Inc.","Yeah.","Tim Leach","I\u2019m going to turn it over to Matt to fill all those questions but its good hearing from you.","Irene Haas \u2013 Wunderlich Securities, Inc.","Yeah.","Matt Hyde","Hi, Irene. Good questions. The Cline in the Glasscock County area where our acreage block is in that 9,000 plus range which is comparable to other operators in the area. As you know, the Penn Shale or Cline has a fairly wide geographic extent across the greater Midland Basin even into the eastern shelf area. So industry is fairly early in evaluating this opportunity, but Glasscock County is certainly the focus area at the moment from a drilling standpoint.","Irene Haas \u2013 Wunderlich Securities, Inc.","And what\u2019s the big attraction, is it -- does it have really good porosity, high carbonate content and things of that nature, you see good TOC, et cetera, et cetera? Can you give us a little more color, really Cline versus the Wolfcamp, are you seeing comparable sort of attractive attributes?","Matt Hyde","I think given some of the production volumes that are being reported or seen out of it, obviously, we think it has the quality of rock attributes that we like. We\u2019re still in the process of gathering data from a core that we took over there at the moment Irene. So we\u2019ll be just drilling and probably providing you little more information go forward on that.","Irene Haas \u2013 Wunderlich Securities, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Tim Leach","Thanks Irene.","Operator","And the last question comes from the line of Richard Tullis with Capital One Southcoast. You may proceed.","Richard Tullis \u2013 Capital One Southcoast","Hi. Thank you. Good morning. Just a couple quick questions here. What are the oil price differentials you\u2019re seeing currently in the Permian?","Tim Leach","We\u2019re still guiding to like 95% on NYMEX, so it\u2019s kind of holding in there where it has been historically.","Richard Tullis \u2013 Capital One Southcoast","Okay, Tim. Thank you. I know you\u2019re currently, I guess, around 31 rigs heading to 35 this year and I assume that budget was probably built on lower oil prices than what we\u2019re seeing currently. What\u2019s your ability to add rigs going forward and what areas could possibly see some higher activity if these sort of prices hold for most of the year?","Tim Leach","All right. That 35 rig counts is an average for the year, so I think we\u2019ll end at a higher number than 35 as we continue to develop a program to reinvest our cash flow. So oil -- we budgeted around $85 oil and $4 gas, and the commodity prices have moved off that obviously. We have pretty aggressively hedged our oil as we have had in the past, so the current oil prices. I think our oil price hedges we provide that information that you can go look it up.","Richard Tullis \u2013 Capital One Southcoast","Sure.","Tim Leach","I think it averages kind of the mid 90s and so that dampens the effect of $100 plus oil, at the same time with the much lower gas price at $4. I think when you stew it altogether, we have more cash flow than what we budgeted for, but it\u2019s not as extreme as just if you think 85 versus 105. All the extra cash flow that we generate we\u2019re going to reinvest in the drilling program and probably most of that will go into the Delaware Basin.","Richard Tullis \u2013 Capital One Southcoast","Okay. And then lastly, could you talk about the well cost you\u2019ve seen so far for your initial Wolfcamp and Cline wells?","Tim Leach","I think it\u2019s, we don\u2019t really want to talk too much about that. It\u2019s still kind in the early competitive stages. But they\u2019re in line with what we\u2019ve kinds of indicated for other horizontal activity out there. But Wolfcamp and the Cline are deeper zones, so there\u2019s a marginal increase in cost due to the depth.","Richard Tullis \u2013 Capital One Southcoast","Okay. Thanks.","Tim Leach","The completions are roughly the same.","Richard Tullis \u2013 Capital One Southcoast","Okay. Thanks, Tim. Appreciate it.","Tim Leach","Thanks.","Operator","And we have no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Tim Leach for any closing remarks.","Tim Leach","Well, thank you everyone. I know you have a busy schedule, I think there were several other calls going out the same time. I appreciate your participation in this one and look forward to talking to you in the future. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen that concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you so much for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day."]}}
