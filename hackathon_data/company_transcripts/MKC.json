This is Kasey Jenkins, Vice President of McCormick Investor Relations. Thank you for joining today\u2019s First Quarter Earnings Call. To accompany this call, we've posted a set of slides at ir.mccormick.com. Currently, all participants are in listen-only mode. Following our remarks, we will begin a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll begin with remarks from Lawrence Kurzius, Chairman, President and CEO; and Mike Smith, Executive Vice President and CFO.","During our remarks, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. These include information in constant currency as well as adjusted operating income, adjusted income tax rate and adjusted earnings per share that excludes the impact of special charges, and for 2018 transaction and integration expenses related to the acquisitions of our Frank's and French's brand as well as the net non-recurring income tax benefits associated with the December 2017 U.S. Tax Reform Legislation. Reconciliations to the GAAP results are included in this morning\u2019s press release and slides.","In our comments, certain percentages are rounded. Please refer to our presentation which includes the complete information. In addition, please note that all comparisons discussed today, both for results and outlook, are calculated from the 2018 days that have been recast for the two accounting standard updates we adopted on a retrospective basis in the first quarter of 2019, as well as for certain other reclassifications noted in this morning\u2019s first quarter results press release. Please refer to the recast 2018 financials section of the press release and the Form 8-K, we furnished on March 11 for further details, as well as the fillings of our Form 10-Q later today, which reflects all the changes to our previously reported 2018 results and the historical financial information that has been recast.","As a reminder, today\u2019s presentation contains projections and other forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those projected. The Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements whether because of new information, future events or other factors. As seen on Slide 2, our forward-looking statements also provide information on risk factors that could affect our financial results.","It is now my pleasure to turn the discussion over to Lawrence.","Lawrence Kurzius","Thank you, Kasey. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. Our first quarter results were a great start to the year delivering sales, operating income and adjusted earnings per share growth as well as margin expansion. Our successful execution of our strategies and engagement of employees around the world has driven strong performance across both of our segments. And we\u2019re confident they will continue to drive the momentum and success as we go through the year.","Starting on Slide 4, our broad and advantaged global flavor portfolio continues to position us to meet the demand for flavor around the world and grow our business. Among our first quarter highlights across our portfolio, we drove growth on our consumer segment with strength particularly in U.S. spices and seasonings, recipe mixes and new Frank\u2019s Zatarain\u2019s frozen products, as well as in China, sauces and Chicken bouillon.","In our flavor solutions segment, our Americas and EMEA regions drove significant growth in flavors, brand and food service and condiments with strong contributions for both new products and the base business. We are confident our breadth and reach will continue to differentiate McCormick and be the foundation of our sales growth as consumer demand for flavor continues to rise. No matter where or what you choose to eat or drink, you're probably enjoying something flavored by McCormick every day.","Now let me go into more detail on our first quarter performance as seen on Slide 5 as well as provide some business comments before turning it over to Mike. We'll go more in depth on the quarter-end results and the details of our 2019 outlook. As we said on our year-end earnings call in January and at CAGNY in February, we have confidence in our strategies and are well positioned to deliver strong results in 2019. You can see this beginning with our first quarter performance, but the strong sales growth, operating profit growth, margin growth and EPS growth.","Starting with our top line for the first quarter, versus a year ago period we grew sales 1% and a constant currency sales grew 4% for the total company with strengthened both segments. This growth was due to higher volume and product mix. It was entirely organic, driven by the base business and new products as we had no acquisitions impact in the quarter. In our consumer segment, sales were flat, including an unfavorable impact from currency and grew 3% in constant currency. In our flavor solutions segment, sales grew 3% and then constant currency grew 6%.","In addition to our top line growth, we grew adjusted operating income and expanded our adjusted operating margin. With our higher sales and cost savings led by our comprehensive continuous improvement program or CCI, we grew the first quarter's adjusted operating income 4% or 6% in constant currency and expanded our adjusted operating margin 40 basis points. At the bottom line, our first quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.12 was 12% higher than the $1 in the first quarter of 2018, driven primarily by our adjusted operating income growth and the lower adjusted the tax rate. And this 12% adjusted earnings per share growth includes an unfavorable impact from currency. Our solid first quarter results were in line with our expectations and our outlook for 2018 performance, which we shared on our January earnings call continues to be strong.","I'd like to turn now to a business update with a focus this morning on highlights from our consumer and flavor solutions segments, our exciting new products for the first half of 2019. And finally touch on some of our recent announcements.","Starting on Slide 6 with our consumer segment, as I just mentioned, we grew constant currency sales 3% with increases at each of our three reasons. In the Americas, we grew constant currency sales 3%, driven by higher volume and product mix. In the U.S., the unusual impacts we had in the fourth quarter, as we previously indicated on our January earnings call and at CAGNY are behind us. Our IRI data indicates U.S. spices and seasoning scanner sales through multi outlets grew 4% for the category and 5% for McCormick branded reflecting a continuation of the strong consumption and share trend improvement realized in the fourth quarter. In fact, we grew spice and seasoning share in the first quarter. Our performance in the market is being driven by new products, expanded distribution together with our strong marketing programs and merchandising execution. Additionally, we again had strong growth in unmeasured channels, including club, e-commerce and Hispanic retail chains.","Overall, combining strong consumption growth in other parts of our U.S. branded portfolio with spices and seasonings, we continued to see an acceleration in our consumption trends, which shows we're winning with consumers across our portfolio. McCormick branded dry recipe mixes continuing their momentum of consumption and share growth and Stubb's barbecue sauce consumption growth again outpaced this category. Frank's Red Hot Sauce, Grill Mates and Lowery's Marinade, all grew consumption, partially driven by leveraging Super Bowl marketing and promotional programs across our condiment portfolio. New products including Frank's Red Hot frozen wings and Zatarain\u2019s frozen items are also gaining momentum and contributed to first quarter growth.","As I mentioned, our strong marketing programs contributed to driving our growth. We've also increased our effectiveness and are getting more value out of each marketing dollar. In the first quarter, we've funded increases in our working media with decreases in our non-working spend. Our newly formed marketing excellence organization, which I discussed that CAGNY is optimizing our brand marketing spend and driving greater speed and effectiveness. For instance, with our innovative approach for Frank\u2019s brand support, we had a big win on Super Bowl Sunday. We spent significantly less than the cost of the Super Bowl commercial and leverage the power of social media with the strong creative idea. With our plateful splat, Frank's garnered over 250 million consumer impressions and was awarded Twitter's Brand Interception award for driving the highest percentage of branded conversations during the big game without a national television ad. Not only did we win the award, we won with significant Frank\u2019s consumption growth.","Now turning to Europe, Middle East and Africa, the EMEA region, constant currency growth was driven by new products as well as expanded distribution and successful promotional activity. New product launches in the UK, in the second half of the year, First Choice, our brand renovation initiative and street food seasonings, which are adventurous flavors for millennials continued to do well, and we're excited to build on strong early results with continued expansion to additional markets in 2019. In the Asia Pacific region, our constant currency growth was led by China, driven by new products as well as the base business growth due to successful merchandising execution and expanded distribution. We're also excited by the momentum we're gaining on Frank's and French's. At the end of the first quarter, products with localized Chinese labels are beginning and we listed at retail stores and we expect distribution to build over the year.","Turning now to Slide 7, in our flavor solutions segment, our sales performance was excellent. Our constant currency sales growth was 6%, driven by higher volume and product mix on base business as well as new products in the Americas and EMEA regions. We're continuing to win with our customers with the new products, expanded distribution and promotional activities. In the Americas, we drove constant currency sales growth of 7%. We had strong sales growth to quick service restaurants as well as in our flavor product categories. Our flavor sales were driven by snack seasonings, particularly due to new products and our customers' promotions and by products that deliver the clean label and better-for-you attributes our customers are seeking.","We also had strong branded food service growth, driven by the increased distribution with national and regional customers, promotional activity with operators and expansion in emerging channels. In branded food service, we continue to realize the benefits of leveraging our full portfolio of McCormick spices and seasonings and Frank's French's and catalyst products across operators.","Our sales growth in EMEA was outstanding, 9% in constant currency was broad-based across the portfolio both from product category and customer perspective. The momentum we built in this region last year carried into the first quarter. We grow sales growth to quick service restaurants, partially due to their strong promotional activities, and the packaged food companies with new products being a key driver. Our new products are an important point to differentiate our brands and drive growth.","Now I am happy to share with you our consumer segment's robust plans for new products in the first half of 2019, as seen on Slide 8. We're delivering against consumer demand for healthy options and transparency in the quality and source of ingredients. In the U.S., we've launched the Zatarain's Garden District kitchen range. These new solutions inspired by the rich culinary heritage of New Orleans, a plant-based and high in both protein and fiber. And we continue to renovate are dry recipe mixes with simple and clean ingredient segments that still deliver delicious flavor.","We\u2019re continually improving our portfolio to strengthen our relevance for consumers. In the U.S., we're expanding our McCormick gourmet line with the range of premium salts and peppers. In France, we launched the range of Ducros, grown in France herbs, for French consumer, values, provenance and local sourcing. And in China, we're re-launching our packaging with new graphics that drive premium perception and better shelf visibility. With ease and convenience, we\u2019re making a key driver of consumer trends. We are offering consumers convenience with flavor.","In the U.S., we've launched new Grill Mates marinate flavors, which provided convenient ways to introduce more flavors to grilling and French's dipping sauces, which deliver fantastic taste with the convenience of ready to eat. We've also launched Zatarain's frozen entree rice bowls, made with clean ingredients and leverage the popularity of cilantro lime with shrimp and chicken. And we'll be launching our one product platform, instead of one dish recipe mix flavors to make dinners easy, which includes new flavors created using the combination of artificial intelligence and our consumer insights.","And finally, we continue to introduce new flavors and varieties to drive flavor exploration and experimentation. In Canada, we are renovating our line of La Grille barbecue sauces with a new bottle and reformulated flavors. In the UK, we're targeting the millennial consumer with the launch of a new range of rapid recipe mixes, which capitalize on the sandwich wraps trend at home and the restaurant menus. And also targeting the millennial consumer, we're launching a new range of co-branded tasty McCormick recipe mix blends in the U.S., Canada and the UK, which I will expand on further in a few minutes.","Turning to flavor solutions on Slide 9, while we do not get specific with our product developments in this segment, we're continuing to capitalize on our culinary foundation, customer collaboration both of which differentiate us with customers. This unique combination allows us to continue our new product momentum as our customers continue to move their portfolios to on-trend flavors, and more natural and better-for-you product while ensuring that taste is not compromised.","We have a broad portfolio of product platforms and technologies to deliver a range of natural solutions for our customers. Along the natural flavors spectrum, clean flavor is the next emerging space. We're excited to have re-launched our new clean and natural platform Flavor Real, McCormick is setting the benchmark for development of on-trend organic, non-GMO and better-for-you products with their unparalleled natural ingredients supply chain and technologies enabling clean label transparency.","To support the consumer movement to healthier and more natural, our proprietary modulation technology called Flavor Full, solves common flavor challenges, including masking bitter or sour notes and enhancing sweet, salt or fat. We can sell for any low or no challenge without sacrificing iconic flavor.","And finally, our two flavor delivery technologies deliver optimal flavor experiences. Our Patented Flavor Cell is a controlled release encapsulation technology designed to deliver flavor where and when and how you need it. Our flavor spice technology delivers flexible natural replacements for ground spices and herbs for increased concentration and solubility.","Our strategy to begin with understanding real food and beverage, to create authentic flavors, combined with the breadth of our product platforms and technologies, is driving our new product wins with our customers, with sales from product launch as a key growth driver in our first quarter results.","Now I'd like to highlight some recent news on Slide 10. As announced in early February, McCormick has partnered with IBM to pioneer the application of Artificial Intelligence or AI, for flavor and product development. We were entering into new era of flavor innovation. This proprietary cutting edge technology, which we have previously discussed as computational creativity, sets McCormick apart across our consumer and flavor solutions segments. Our product developers are now able to export flavor territories across the globe more quickly and efficiently utilizing technology to extract key insights for millions of data points across sensory science, consumer preference and flavor palettes. As we've continued to expand the use of this system, we've launched our first AI-enabled consumer product platform, one, which I mentioned a few moments ago in my new product comments. I also mentioned earlier a new range of co-branded tasty products, which I'd like to expand on further.","During the first quarter, we launched a global partnership with Buzzfeed Tasty, the number one cooking video website in the world for Millennials and Gen Z with over two billion views a month. This partnership allows us to gain significant reach as we are now the official spice in the videos and recipes these generations used while seeking recipe inspiration through social media.","In the second quarter, we will be launching our seasoning blends range, which will be available both through the direct to consumer channel and retail. We're thrilled with this new partnership, which will deliver substantial incremental impressions in reach to an audience, primarily under the 35 years of age and further accelerate our digital platform.","In February, we were recognized on Variance 2019 100 most sustainable companies list for the second straight year. At McCormick, we\u2019re driven to do the right thing for people, communities and our planet, and as such we're recognized as a leader in sustainability.","On a final note, I'd like to acknowledge Mike Fitzpatrick, who is retiring from our Board of Directors after serving as a director since 2001. We sincerely appreciate Mike's contributions to our success over the last 18 years and thank him for his service.","Now I'd like to provide a few summary comments as seen on Slide 11, before turning it over to Mike. At the foundation of our sales growth is the rising consumer demand for flavor. We are aligned with the consumers' increased interest in older flavors, demand for convenience and focus on fresh natural ingredients as well as with emerging purchase drivers such as greater transparency around the sourcing and quality of food. With this increased interest flavor continues to be an advantaged global category, which combined with our execution against effective strategies will drive strong results. We have a solid foundation in an environment that continues to be dynamic and fast pace we are sure that we remain agile, relevant and focused on sustainable growth. Our experienced leaders and employees are executing against our strategies, which are designed to build long-term value for our shareholders.","Our first quarter financial results across both our consumer and flavor solutions segments were a great start to the year. We delivered these results according to our plans and are excited by our momentum. Our fundamentals are strong. And we're confident the initiatives we have underway position us to continue our growth trajectory. We\u2019re balancing our resources and efforts to drive sales with our work to lower costs to build fuel for growth and higher margins. We have confidence in our fiscal year outlook and are well positioned to deliver another strong year in 2019. Around the world, McCormick employees are driving our momentum and our success. And I thank them for their efforts and engagement. Thank you for your attention. And it is now my pleasure to turn it over to Mike for additional remarks on the first quarter financial results and 2019 outlook.","Mike Smith","Thanks, Lawrence, and good morning, everyone. As Lawrence indicated, we delivered strong growth with our first quarter results. I'll begin with a discussion of our results and then follow with details of our full year 2019 financial outlook.","Starting on Slide 13, we grew sales 4% at constant currency. And as Lawrence mentioned earlier, this was entirely organic growth, driven by the base business and new products as we had no acquisition impact in the quarter. Both our consumer and flavor solutions segments delivered strong top line constant currency growth, driven by volume and product mix. The consumer segment grew sales 3% in constant currency with growth in all three regions.","On Slide 14, consumer segment sales in the Americas rose 3% in constant currency versus the first quarter of 2018. As Lawrence described earlier, this increase was primarily driven by higher volume and product mix across several product lines spices and seasonings, dry recipe mixes and frozen products. Pricing related to the incremental impact of 2018 actions also contributed to the increase.","In EMEA, constant currency consumer sales were up 1% from a year ago. Higher volume and product mix were driven by new products, distribution gains and promotional activities. This growth was partially offset by pricing actions, including those related to planned trade commercial activities for new products and a holiday season. We grew consumer sales in the Asia-Pacific region 4% in constant currency led by China growth with strength in new world flavor sauces and chicken bouillon as well as herbs and spice.","Turning to our flavor solutions segment and Slide 17, we grew first quarter constant currency sales, 6%, attributable to a strong growth in the EMEA and Americas region. In the Americas flavor solutions constant currency sales increased 7% with broad-based growth across the portfolio, driven by quick service restaurants and continued flavors momentum. New products, expanded distribution and our customer's promotional activities all contributed to the sales increase. In EMEA, we grew flavors solution sales 9% in constant currency, driven by new products and volume growth on the base business. Sales increased to both packaged food companies and quick service restaurants, partially due to their promotional activity and spanned across all categories. In the Asia-Pacific region, flavor solution sales and constant currency were flat to the year ago period due to the timing of our quick service restaurant customers' promotional activities.","Across both segments, adjusted operating income, which excludes special charges, and for 2018, the transaction and integration costs related to the acquisition of our Frank's and French's brands rose 4% in the first quarter versus the year ago period, and excluding the impact of unfavorable currency rose 6%. Adjusted operating income in the consumer segment rose to $135 million. And in the flavor solutions segment we rose to $64 million. Both of which we\u2019re at 4% increase. In constant currency, adjusted operating income increased 6% in the consumer segment and 7% in the flavor solutions segment. For each segment, the increase was driven by higher sales and CCI-led cost savings. As seen on Slide 22, in the first quarter, we expanded adjusted operating margin 40 basis points. This expansion was driven by the leverage from sales growth, CCI-led cost savings and lower brand marketing, partially offset by investments to drive future growth.","Turning to income taxes on Slide 23, our first quarter adjusted effective income tax rate was 13.9% as compared to 18.9% in the year ago period. Our first quarter adjusted rate was favorably impacted by discrete tax items, primarily one related to our entity structure as we mentioned in our January earnings call. We continue to project our full year 2019 adjusted effective tax rate to approximate 22%.","Income from unconsolidated operations was $10 million compared to $8 million in the first quarter of 2018 with the increase led by our joint venture in Mexico. For 2019, we continue to expect a low-single-digit increase in our income from unconsolidated operations.","At the bottom line, as shown on Slide 25, first quarter 2019 adjusted earnings per share was $1.12, up 12% from $1 for the year ago period, mainly due to higher adjusted operating income and a lower adjusted income tax rate. And this increase included an unfavorable impact from currency.","On Slide 26, we summarize highlights for cash flow and the quarter-end balance sheet. Our cash flow provided from operations was $104 million in the first quarter of 2019 compared to an outflow of $21 million in the first quarter of 2018. This increase was driven by higher operating income and working capital improvements. As we execute against programs to achieve working capital reductions such as extending supplier payment terms and inventory management programs, we continue to see improvements in our cash conversion cycle, finishing the first quarter down four days versus our fiscal year-end.","We returned $75 million of cash to shareholders through dividends and used $25 million for capital expenditures this period. We expect 2019 to be another year of strong cash flow, driven by profit and working capital initiatives. And our priority is to continue to have a balanced use of cash making investments to drive growth, returning a significant portion to our shareholders through dividends and to pay down debt.","I'll now move to our current financial outlook for 2019 on Slide 27. We are reaffirming our 2019 outlook for another year of strong performance with our broad and advantaged flavor portfolio, effective growth strategies and focus on profit realization. We continue to estimate, based on prevailing rates, a two percentage point unfavorable impact of currency rate on net sales, adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share. We expect unfavorable currency impact will be greater in the first half of the year than in the second half.","At the top line, we reaffirm our guidance to grow sales 1% to 3%, which in constant currency is a 3% to 5% projected growth rate. As a reminder, this will be entirely organic growth driven, primarily by higher volume and product mix as well as the impact of pricing to offset any anticipated low-single-digit cost increase. We continue to protect our 2019 gross profit margin to be 25 to 75-basis points higher than in 2018 in part driven by our CCI-led cost savings.","We reaffirm our adjusted operating income growth of 7% to 9% from $930 million in 2018, which in constant currency is a 9% to 11% projected growth rate and reflects our continued focus on profit realization. Our cost savings target is approximately $110 million, and we expect the brand marketing to be comparable to 2018.","As I previously mentioned, we continue to expect our 2019 adjusted effective income tax rate to approximate 22% based upon our estimated mix of earnings by country, in addition to our state tax rates. This projection is lower than our underlying effective tax rate of 24%, due to the favorable first quarter discrete impact, I mentioned a few moments ago.","Our full year 22% outlook versus our 2018 adjusted effective tax rate of 19.6% is approximately a 300-basis-point headwind to our 2019 adjusted earnings per share growth. We reaffirm our guidance for the adjusted earnings per share in 2019 of $5.17 to $5.27. This compares to $4.97 of adjusted earnings per share in 2018 and represents a 4% to 6% increase, which in constant currency is a 6% to 8% increase. This increase includes the expected tax headwind, I just mentioned.","In summary, we are projecting strong growth in our 2019 constant currency outlook for sales, adjusted operating profit and adjusted earnings per share following record double-digit performance across each objective in 2018.","I'd like to now turn it back to Lawrence for some additional remarks before we move to your questions.","Lawrence Kurzius","Thank you, Mike. Now that Mike has shared our financial results and outlook in more detail, I'd like to recap the key takeaways as seen on Slide 28. With the first quarter results, we have a strong start to the year. We\u2019re delivering against our plans for both sales and profit realization and are confident in the momentum of our business. We're reaffirming our strong 2019 outlook for sales, adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share growth. This outlook reflects strong operating performance driven by our solid foundation and continued momentum. We\u2019re confident 2019 will be another successful year. We're sustainably positioned for growth, and are continuing to deliver differentiated results, while also investing to build the McCormick of the future.","Now, I'd like to turn it to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions] Our first question is coming from the line of Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Andrew Lazar","Good morning, everybody. Lawrence, you'd mentioned that flavor solution sales in EMEA benefited from new product activity from package food companies. And I'm curious if you've seen any of these trends develop yet in the U.S. as so many packaged food companies do seem more committed at least versus the past few years to getting back to top line growth and seem to be thus far reinvesting to get there?","Lawrence Kurzius","We have seen improvement in that part of our flavor solutions business in the U.S. really through the second half of last year even and continuing into this year. It's hard to tell whether it\u2019s their trend is improving or whether it's us gaining share. One of our advantages is that we are very strong in the whole area of creating natural flavors, clean flavors systems. And the huge amount of the work that we do with our customers involves kind of making their ingredients statement more consumer friendly and more in line with the trend towards consumers not wanting to see anything unnatural or artificial sounding on the label. So a lot of our work is in that area and we think we're advantage there. So we have to think that part of the strength that we\u2019re having there is gaining share. I'll say the European part is also partially driven by the acquisition of Giotti a couple of years ago, which gave us some greater capabilities in the area of developing, fresh and natural flavors in Europe, in particular.","Andrew Lazar","That's helpful. I appreciate that. Thank you for that. And then just one last one would be, typically in your fiscal first quarter there's always a little bit of retailer inventory reduction that's typical that you typically even budget for each year. I am curious if any of that sort of normal type of inventory reduction might have taken place such that maybe you expect your consumer Americas' organic sales to perhaps accelerate more in keeping with what you see in terms of consumption maybe going forward? Thanks so much.","Lawrence Kurzius","That's a great point Andrew. And if you look at the consumption data, you can see that we -- although I'm certainly not going to apologize for the organic sales growth in the Americas on the consumer side, which is really strong. If we did ship below consumption, our consumption rate as measured through the scanned channels was higher, and we know that from unscanned and unmeasured channels that they would have been additive about another percentage point of growth over what the scanner would suggest. So our underlying consumption is quite a bit stronger then. And shipments, we always see some inventory reduction in the first quarter. As we said, we plan for. I\u2019d say what happened in the first quarter was really in line with what would be normal activity, nothing like the extraordinary activity. We saw in the fourth quarter of last year which is well behind us.","Andrew Lazar","Great, thank you.","Lawrence Kurzius","\u2026 wasn't impacted in the first quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Driscoll with Citi. Please proceed with your question.","David Driscoll","So I had two flavor solutions questions, and just a little quick one on pricing. On flavor solutions, margins were flat in the quarter. But there was a 6% increase in constant concurrency sales growth, a terrific number, and it's volume-led. So I'm just curious about the effects of volume leverage through the facilities. And it was -- two of the bigger pieces of flavor solutions that seemed to have it. So can you just maybe bridge the gap and maybe why we need a few more margin expansion within the segment? And then just related to flavor solutions, is there anything to be learned about the very strong constant currency growth this quarter in terms of what it might mean for the next several quarters? Is there anything quirky in the year ago comparison? Or I'm just asking questions like that, so I can understand maybe the cadence of sales growth within flavor solutions?","Mike Smith","Hey, Dave, this is Mike. I'll answer the margin question. I mean, we were really happy with the performance we did in the first quarter, which is the smallest quarter of the year for us, with 6% constant currency sales growth and 7% operating profit growth as you said. So we're basically flat, slightly up on our margin. But we did -- we had some unfavorable product mix. If you look at -- we talk about this some of the QSR sales we had. We mentioned it specifically with regard to Asia where these limited times offers, which we generally make higher margin on, were a little bit down this quarter, little bit similar to last quarter, and the base business was up. That's where we're growing. So there is a little bit of a product mix within that segment for the first quarter, but for the full year we feel real good about these margin opportunities there. And from a growth perspective, we used the term lumpy for sales with flavor solutions because we\u2019re relying on promotions from -- and new product launches from customers. But we're really happy after some of the -- if you remember the fourth quarter, we got a lot of questions about Americas sales growth, which I think, in that quarter was 2%, that rebounded nicely. So we\u2019re going to have some variability throughout the year. We're still comfortable with our general 4% to 6% excuse me, 3% to 5% constant currency growth.","Lawrence Kurzius","Overall.","Mike Smith","Overall.","David Driscoll","One quick follow-up on pricing. I think what you said is that you indicated on the sales guidance that it also expected to include the impact of pricing would be taken to offset anticipated low-single-digit increases in the costs. However, first quarter pricing was flat. Is this mean that there is some more significant pricing coming later in the year? Can you give us any sense on scope or timing?","Mike Smith","Hey, David, this is Mike again. You really got to look at the segment and the regional level. And while you're right the total company isn't just flat. If you look at it by region, for example, consumer, Americas was up almost 1%, which was the same as it was last year, same with flavor solutions. The other segments and regions are similar. One area that was down with EMEA consumer, where we had significant trade promotions around the holiday season and we\u2019ve launched a lot of new products in the first quarter, and we see that moderating the rest of the year.","Lawrence Kurzius","We got our complete re-launch of our core business over there behind the first choice initiative. And so there are some costs associated with that in terms of promotional dollars and listing fees that run through the difference between gross and that's reflected as pricing.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Alexia Howard with Alliance Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.","Alexia Howard","So great to see the improvement in the consumer Americas business this quarter. I'm curious about the slowdown on the Asia-Pacific side. So that the China is still doing very strongly over there, but we can see a slowdown in the constant currency sales growth, I think, from 10% process and this time around. Maybe a little bit of color on what's doing well in China? And can you quantify how quickly that segment or that country is growing? And then maybe what is going down elsewhere in there? Thank you.","Lawrence Kurzius","Well, first of all, I'm not going to apologize for the 4% sales growth in Asia-Pacific, which I still think is pretty good. But the China continues to be strong \u2026","Alexia Howard","I think you just came back, but we lost you right at the beginning of the answer to that question.","Lawrence Kurzius","Well, sorry about that. I'm not sure what you heard. So I'll just start from the beginning. China's growth continues to be strong. We had some softness in couple of the other minor markets around the region that dampened the results for overall Asia-Pacific. I think 4%, it's a little bit lower than we've been reporting, but it's still pretty solid. We don't have any -- really don't have any concern over there that there's a meaning -- that there's any kind of meaningful change in the trend line for that region. If there is any part that might be a bit slow, it\u2019s the food service portion of the China business where there's some, I think, there is a bit of a slowdown in the economic growth in China. I think that that is impacting food service more than anything. But I'm sure consumer part of that business is still rock solid.","Alexia Howard","And then as a follow-up, can I just ask about where the leverage is at the moment? You're obviously paying down the debt from the RB Foods acquisition pretty quickly, but wondering what the number is right there? And how actively are you looking out for other either bolt-ons or possibly, essentially broader M&A or larger scale M&A opportunities? Thank you. And I'll pass it on.","Mike Smith","Yes, Alexia, it's Mike. We\u2019re right now four at the end of the first quarter and we still plan as we said to be three times in 2020. So we're still very confident. And we had really strong cash flow in the first quarter, and we think that's going to happen for the rest of year. So we're still bullish on that. Now, I'll turn it to Lawrence, for the second part.","Lawrence Kurzius","Yes. So as we've started to get below four and into the 3s, we're pretty optimistic that we're going to be in the low 3s by the end of the year. It is time for us to start taking a look at opportunities again. So while I will continue to say that our priority is paying down debt, we are starting to look at some acquisition opportunities.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Jonathan Feeney with Consumer Edge. Please proceed with your question.","Jonathan Feeney","You've commented about some low single-digit input cost pressure. And I guess I'm wondering how those beyond what you said? Any detail you could give within the commodity, how that's trending? And how that input pressures specifically you see over the course of the year, because, obviously, there's some expectation for improved margin realization over the course of the year. I'd like to see how that plays in.","Lawrence Kurzius","Yes, I mean, obviously, we have a huge market basket of different commodities. Some of the major ones like pepper have come down, vanilla stayed very high. We've talked about that in the past couple years. But there's a lot of other items that have gone up. And that's kind of builds into the low single-digit costs inflation. We also have in their freight costs, which, as you know, last year, for most of the industry way up. You see those how stabilized to be up in order to be up, but that\u2019s included within that low single-digit guidance. When I say from a margin perspective throughout the year, early in the year, and we\u2019ve talked about this before, the first half of the year we're getting hit from a currency perspective. In the first quarter was 3%. If you look at last year, we were getting a benefit of foreign currency in that same range, in the first half of the year. That drives some FX trends and that's the translational impact on our P&L. If you look at the transactional costs, that is an underlying headwind early in the year for us, which we see reversing in the second half. So that's a little bit of the color of why we think margins will improve throughout the year.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Robert Moscow with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Jake Nivasch","This is actually Jake Nivasch on for Rob. Just a couple quick questions for you guys. One, do you - due to the late Easter, is there going to be any impact for you guys this year?","Lawrence Kurzius","Yes, it is. It's going to be washed within the quarter because our second quarter is March, April, May. So as Easter moves around, I would expect there may be -- there\u2019s some impact on our month to month timing, but within the quarter, it's not -- it\u2019s just not going to -- it's not going to matter. So whatever difference there is not going to be material.","Jake Nivasch","Got you, okay. And then, just one more, just quick one. For the margin expansion, is that going to be more 4Q loaded than 3Q? Or just kind of evenly split in the back half or maybe the growth as well?","Lawrence Kurzius","I mean, we're not going to get into quarterly guidance or anything. But I would just kind of keep it in half's at this point?","Jake Nivasch","Got you. I'll \u2026","Mike Smith","We expect them to be strong in the second half. And again one of the drivers is that transactional impact on our costs, transactional FX impacts on our costs, which we expect to moderate in the second half.","Lawrence Kurzius","And we also did see, as you know, some of the challenges that we had in the fourth quarter in the consumer business of our high margin products. That will reverse hopefully in the fourth quarter and be positive too.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Adam Samuelson","Maybe going back into the flavor solutions side and just wanted to think about the organic growth side and the pieces there. It sounds that this quarter had some upside benefit especially in Asia from some of lower margin seasoning business. I mean anyway to characterize the growth by the different kinds of businesses that you have kind of where the legacy seasonings business versus the food service supply business versus the flavor side, just the growth between those different buckets?","Lawrence Kurzius","Well, I'm going to say that in this quarter, we did have strong growth in some of our really quick service restaurant customers and on their core business side and less on their promotional items. And so, that was the mix that Mike was talking about that had the impact on margin. So, it wasn't consumer -- it wasn't the consumer food manufacturers, it's really quick service restaurants. Those are mostly condiment product, not seasoning. We're huge supplier of condiments globally to the restaurant industry, well beyond what we do on the consumer side of the business.","But our performance on flavor solutions overall was pretty broad based with both branded food service and quick service restaurants, showing strength and the packaged food manufacturers, not just food and beverage manufacturers showing strength, I'd say it was pretty broad. The margin story there was around a mix within U.S. quick service restaurants that drove -- was meaningful enough that it kept our margins flat during the quarter. Mike, do you want to add anything to that?","Mike Smith","It was broad based -- yes, when you get -- we had over 6% growth in flavor solutions in the U.S. and 9% almost in EMEA. So across all the categories, but there was a little bit of a mix issue as Lawrence said.","Adam Samuelson","Okay and just maybe more, not\u2026","Lawrence Kurzius","Almost not called it a mix issue by the way\u2026","Adam Samuelson","Taking a step back from this quarter specifically though, I mean, I would look at the mix businesses within the flavor solution side, the opportunity in flavors both from a margin opportunity as well as a growth given kind of where you are devolution of that business. I mean, do you have a target on the long-term kind of opportunity your growth side on the flavors piece specifically versus branded food service and condiment ingredients.","Lawrence Kurzius","Well, first of all, I completely agree with you that the opportunity is to increase the proportion of our business and to grow most quickly, the most value added parts of the portfolio and that is indeed our strategy and has been overtime has generated both an improvement in operating margin for this part of our business, particularly over the last few years with the strategies been in place and has enabled us to grow faster because the wins that we get tend to be stickier and longer lasting. So that is our strategy, but we have not put a specific target out there for our kind of the final call for margin, but I will just -- we have said and I'll say again that there's a very long runway for margin expansion.","Our margins for this segment of the business are quite a bit lower than some of the pure play flavor companies. And within those segments, our margins are very comparable to their. So as that part of the business comes to be a bigger portion of our flavor solutions business, I would expect to see our margins -- we not only expect, we're driving to have our margins moving in that direction. So, I think there's still quite a long runway of margin growth ahead of us, not just for this year but for years to come.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Akshay Jagdale with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.","Akshay Jagdale","I wanted to ask about the impact of retail disruptions. Can you help quantify that the top-line margin, need to know what that was?","Lawrence Kurzius","Hey, Akshay, let's try and understand the question. When you talk about the impact of retailer disruption, I'm not\u2026","Akshay Jagdale","Yes. So, I'm talking about, I'm sorry. Yes, I'm talking about the issues that you have within specific retailer on the inventory system, et cetera. Like that you talked about the last quarter, and you said, it's behind you now, but it did have an impact on the quarter. That's what I'm asking about. Sorry, I wasn't more clear.","Lawrence Kurzius","Well, it is impact on our last quarter. I don't -- I will disagree that had an impact on this quarter. We did get our customers back in stock. And so, the out of stock situations that occurred last quarter were resolved. But retailers don't need the same. It's not a just we got it back. Retailers don't need the same level of inventory in the first quarter, which is the lowest seasonality period as they do in the fourth quarter, which is the highest. And the mix of products that they need on hand is different in the first quarter than the fourth quarter as well. The shelves are restocked, but Thanksgiving isn't going to come again until fourth quarter. And so, it's not -- so while the situation at retail has recovered, it really didn't have it. All that meant was that we didn't have an ongoing impact from the out-of-stock situation into the first quarter.","Akshay Jagdale","But anytime\u2026","Lawrence Kurzius","And you can see the underlying consumption was really strong.","Akshay Jagdale","Yes, and then just to follow up on gross margin. So, can you give us some sort of puts and takes, I know, you said more stronger in the back half and we talk about the FX impact being less in the back half. But to get 25 to 75, I think you saw this quarter was flat right with accounting new restatements. So can you give us some sense like, what are the other big pieces that are going to accelerate in the back half? And maybe how much of that is dependent on mix in the fourth quarter?","Michael Smith","This is my Mike, Akshay. I mean at high level, our pricing and cost expectations are in line for the year is what we've said. So, we're comfortable there. You've highlighted some of the unfavorable transactional FX, which is going to be a timing issue as is a little bit of a recovery of some of that fourth quarter challenge we had. You talked about some of the product mix. So, it was also in the first quarter little bit of segment mix because as a flavor solution segment grew at about 6% constant currency sales and consumer was 3%, the margins are slightly higher within consumer. So you can get some mix there. I will remind you though that ROIC return on invested capital for flavor solutions is comparable to consumer. So, it is really just on the P&L you see that impact. So, these are the kind of factors I think about as you model.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Rob Dickerson with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Rob Dickerson","So I just want to go back quickly to just a conversation around retail trends, consumption, which continue to accelerate very strong, obviously, relative what we saw in reported results, just really more, more specifically to the Americas consumer division. And what I want to ask is not just the healthy shift in the inventory and what happened in Q1 relativity to Q4, but really more specifically around pricing. It seems like the guidance for the year total company is more volume driven. The results, we saw the quarter in that region, were more volume driven. So, that's a very positive. But at the same time, we did see a little bit of a deceleration in the region in relativity to Q4 on a two-year stock basis because just to compare in the year ago, before relative to Q1 was massive. But what's been -- what's driving the deceleration is really pricing, right? So, there\u2019s less price year-over-year. So I am just trying to get a sense as to, like, why is that pricing kind of a little bit software than we've seen before? And then why is reporting results more volume driven versus price driven which is what we're seeing in the regional trends, if that makes sense?","Lawrence Kurzius","Well, those are the longest questions. So, let me take the first part. I think you're focusing on Americas consumer and our pricing, and I don't know that the number you're looking at reflects what we've actually reported because the first quarter of 2019, we\u2019ve recorded about 1% pricing positive in the first quarter of '18 was the same number. So, we're not seeing an increase in pricing activities year-over-year for the Americas or difference at the same number.","Rob Dickerson","Yes, I was just trying to compare. So in Q4 '17, you were at 3%; in Q4 \u201918, you're at 3.6%; Q1 \u201918, you\u2019re at 1%, you\u2019re right; in Q1 \u201919, you\u2019re at 0.9%. So it's 1.9, relative to 3.6. So, the way I look at it is I have to compare, I have to think about the year ago and that's the deceleration.","Mike Smith","Are going back to '17? So we had vanilla, there were some commodities I mentioned before that was really spiking up at that point. So, as I mentioned, we will take pricing when we need to cover commodity cost increases. The last few years, we've had low single digits, commodity cost inflation.","Rob Dickerson","So, there's nothing that's in there you're paying more to the retailers, et cetera. Because I mean, if I'm seeing 4 plus percent pricing in the scanner data, I'm seeing less than one reported results.","Mike Smith","You\u2019re troubled by this, we\u2019ve bit reflects ourselves by what is what we're seeing in the scanner, which is a for continuation of the disconnect, that we've been experienced with the scanner, data services and some regards know, clearly we're reporting strong volume and mix for the only 1% pricing was some of the scanner services are in our reporting huge price increases and actually declining volume and mix. You know, we can't reconcile it to Nielsen but I've seen the data I can simply say we did not take 5% price increase, which is\u2026","Rob Dickerson","Okay. Fair enough. So, I'll look at the data. So, I have to ask","Lawrence Kurzius","No, no, we'll look at it too. But we do have really strong underlying volume growth and I think that's what the key is you know. I mean, we've had strong consumption as we've talked about across all of our financial. Fourth quarter was very strong and strength has continued in Q1. We focused on the dollar volume growth, but if you look at units and herbs and spices, we're up 4% as well, and that's really solid growth.","Rob Dickerson","Fair enough, I agree. Quick question too, for Mike. Just in terms of the other income line this year, I don't think I may have missed it before today, if there's guidance just given the recast is kind of what we saw last year plus or minus about what you think you come in this year or just any incremental color would obviously be helpful, that's it?","Lawrence Kurzius","I'd say all those other items below the line like interest expense and other income would, to your point kind of mashed together and be approximately the same at this point.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question this morning is from the line of Ken Goldman with JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question.","Ken Goldman","One question for me, I don't know, I'll let it go. Some of your biggest customers, they're openly talking about their desire to drive revenue and alternative sources, right. They'll mention in store advertising, data analytics things like that. I think the idea is from these retailers they can convince vendors like McCormick, like other CPG companies to spend more of their marketing budgets directly with their customers rather than on more traditional areas. I know obviously every CPG company is shifting away from traditional, but I'm just curious specifically. What McCormick's appetite is to sort of meaningfully ramp up its marketing budget, directly spending with its customers to buy things like analytics or in store advertising from them or whether it's more a sort of share gain, where you might say, we\u2019ll give a little bit here and take away little bit there? I'm just trying to get a sense of how important that is to you because some of your customers are talking as though vendors will start spending a lot more with them over the next couple of years?","Lawrence Kurzius","So, let me comment on that, I may ask Mike to joint in as well and we're hearing some funny noises, so are we still connected?","Ken Goldman","I can still hear you.","Lawrence Kurzius","Okay, so in terms of our overall spending first of all, we're comfortable with the overall level of A&P spend that we have as a business system we've guided to, our spend being comparable into last year, we're very comfortable with the overall level of support that we have behind the brands. We've been one of those companies that never really disinvested in marketing. We're increased our A&P expenses year-over-year pretty consistently and last year was the tremendous growth that we experienced at the top and bottom line through we took it as an opportunity to make a significant ramp-up of our expense of over 25% last year.","So, we don't view the level of spending as an issue for us, as a core issue for us at all. The mix of that spending is driven more and more towards digital spending and the same is less visible but true on a trade promotional expenses as well. And so, this is an area where we have done what I will call more advertising like promotion activity with our customers really repurposing in your funds that might have previously been spent on price promotion that such much more efficient vehicles, efficient and effective vehicle that they offer. Particular those customers to develop strong omni-channel and digital marketing programs have their own, these programs.","We've seen a tremendous, can have a tremendous ROI, particularly compared to traditional trade promotion, which I think everybody knows, it is ROI negative. So we have made some of those changes, and some of the retailers do have programs that we believe are legitimate advertising vehicles that I'm going to want to names, but if you think about your pure play e-commerce providers, I think a pretty good case that consumers make some of their brand choices looking at their sites. So, we do have some of that going on generally is a shift from traditional free promotion to digital social programs that are offered by the customers and all that's in the context of our, us being comfortable with our overall spending models. Mike, do you want to.","Mike Smith","No, I think. I mean, I can tell you from personal experience. We've been doing this for a long time, five years ago, in the EMEA, we're using trade funds to work with a brick-and-mortar customers to be more efficient on our trade spend. So, I think you're Ken, it's continuing to move in that direction.","Operator","At this time, I will turn the floor to Lawrence Kurzius for closing remarks.","Lawrence Kurzius","So, I just want to say, this was a solid no drama quarter for us. We had good sales growth at over 4% and attracted bit behind consumption and align with our expectations. Our operating margin expansion is right in line with our algorithm. Our EPS growth of 12% included a tax benefit that we expected and signaled. And the underlying EPS was strong too. It's a solid start to 2019 and we're confident in our outlook.","I'd like to thank you all for your questions and for participating in today's call. McCormick is like a global leader in flavor and we're differentiated with a broad and advantage portfolio, which continues to drive growth. We have a growing and profitable business and operate in an environment that is changing in an never faster pace, responding readily to changes in our industry with new ideas, innovation of purpose with our relentless focus on growth, performance and people.","We continue to perform strong globally and build shareholder value. I am pleased with the strong results to start the year and I have confidence in delivering our 2019 outlook, while continuing to make investments and fuel our growth to build both the McCormick of the future and shareholder value.","Operator","Thank you, Lawrence, and thanks to all for joining today's all.

This is Joyce Brooks, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you for joining today's call for a discussion of McCormick's first quarter financial results and our current outlook for 2015. We've posted a set of slides to accompany our call at ir.mccormick.com. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow our remarks. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, the conference is being recorded.","With me this morning are Alan Wilson, Chairman and CEO; Gordon Stetz, Executive Vice President and CFO; Lawrence Kurzius, Chief Operating Officer and President and Mike Smith, Senior Vice President Finance Capital Markets and CFO North America. During our remarks, we will refer to non-GAAP financial measures. These include adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share that exclude the impact of special charges as well as information in constant currency which we formerly referred to as local currency. A reconciliation to the GAAP results is included in this morning's press release and the slides.","As a reminder, today's presentation contains projections and other forward-looking statements.

The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or other factors. As seen on Slide 2, our forward-looking statements also provide information on risk factors that could affect our financial results.","It's now my pleasure to turn the discussion over to Alan.","Alan Wilson","Thank you, Joyce. Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us. ","McCormick\u2019s first quarter results demonstrated progress with our growth strategies and our actions to reduce costs. While sales rose 2%, the growth rate was 6% in constant currency with a mid single digit increase in each of our two segments. These increases were largely driven by volume and product mix. ","Special charges along with currency had an adverse impact on our operating income results. In fact, we now anticipate a more significant impact from both special charges and currency this year as Gordon will discuss as part of our 2015 outlook. Excluding both of these factors, adjusted operating income rose 1%. We expect this growth rate to improve once our 2015 pricing actions are fully in place and the benefits of our aggressive cost reduction activity begin to build. ","Earnings per share this quarter were $0.55 and excluding special charges, grew to $0.70 from $0.62 in the year ago period. This was largely the result of a favorable tax rate and higher income from unconsolidated operations. The 2014 success of our joint venture in Mexico continues in 2015 with sales up 7% and increased profit margins. ","We generated strong cash flow as we kicked off the year and returned cash to shareholders through dividends and through share repurchases that lowered our average shares outstanding by 2% year on year. Based on these results, and our latest 2015 outlook, we\u2019re reaffirming our expected growth rate for sales, adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings-per-share on a constant currency basis. ","Gordon will share the details of our quarterly results and outlook. I want to comment on each of our business segments. ","First, our consumer business. We grew sales for this segment 1% and in constant currency by 5%. In the US, we continued to gain share with recipe mixes while in spices and seasonings, we still see robust category growth but we still have some work to do in this market. ","Our key initiatives in North America are innovation, building brand equity and category leadership at retail. Our innovation activity includes completing the rollout of McCormick skillet sauces. We\u2019re pleased with the retailer acceptance and began advertising in the first quarter to build awareness and trial. The relaunch of our entire gourmet line is in full swing. Our brand-new look features greater variety, a Flavor Sealed technology that locks in flavor, color and aroma and a packaging that has more premium fresh appearance. ","We\u2019ve also achieved good retail placement for our flavored sea salt and have new varieties of Old Bay, Lawry\u2019s marinades, gluten free recipe mixes, and Zatarain\u2019s rice mixes. As we head into grilling season, we\u2019re gaining self-space for our new line of Grill Mates, burger mix and sauces and a variety of seasoning such as Blue Moon blend leveraging the popularity of this craft beer. ","We\u2019re building brand equity in our US market through both digital and traditional media, informed by our ROI analysis. We leveraged over 25 million impressions on Facebook over the holidays and our engagement rates are up 25% from a year ago. We attribute this to the strength of our community as well as the quality of our content which includes user generated photos and comments and step-by-step visuals. ","As for digital shopper marketing, we partnered with retailers on the first quarter Big Game campaign that had an above average conversion to purchase and 20% sales increase on advertised products and to support our upcoming grilling campaign, we\u2019re launching two new television ads that capture the effort and passion that consumers apply when grilling. ","Our efforts to win at retail have included the sales force reorganization and customer category management leadership. Heading into 2015, we have a sharp focus on retail price points and are putting more advanced analytic rigor around pricing management. While price elasticity is low for many of our seasonal items, we've identified key staples that are price sensitive. A major focus of our sales team is to target these key items and use existing trade promotion fronts and retailer negotiations to optimize shelf-price thresholds. ","We\u2019re also leveraging our Gourmet relaunch to win at retail. Third-party analysis shows that greater product assortment is beneficial to the consumer shopping experience but too many brands can be detrimental. Specifically, an increase in McCormick\u2019s gourmet product assortment led to an 8% increase in our sales and a 5% category increase. However a shelf set with three brands resulted in a 13% drop in category buyers. The message for our customers is simple. Expand their product assortment of McCormick gourmet and discontinue competitive brands. ","Our win at retail efforts extend to e-commerce and we\u2019ve made particularly good progress with Amazon. McCormick has gained 4 share points at Amazon in the past 12 months and our Taco Seasoning Mix has been reported as number two item in Prime Pantry. Across each of these initiatives, innovation, brand building and winning at retail, we believe we have the right team and the right actions underway to improve our performance in spices and seasonings. ","For our consumer business in China, we maintained the pace of double-digit sales growth this quarter, driven by brand building activities, geographic expansion and great in-store execution. We also are realizing sales synergies with WAPC now that the integration of this acquisition is basically complete. The opportunity for this cross-selling opportunity is illustrated on Slide 6 which depicts the core markets for our McCormick brand in the coastal regions and our WAPC Daqiao brand in central China. ","Beyond China and the US, we grew constant currency sales for our consumer business across a number of other markets this quarter, including France, Canada, Australia and Central America. ","Let\u2019s turn to our industrial business. We grew sales for this segment 3% and in constant currency by 7%. Each of our three regions had strong results. Our US business led this growth with higher pricing related to commodity cost increases and increased demand for our branded food service products, as well as customized seasonings largely for snacks. ","Success with innovation and partnership with leading snack companies is part of this growth. This innovation also drove industrial sales higher in Mexico this quarter. These increases more than offset weak sales to quick service restaurants that is extended into 2015 in the Americas. ","In EMEA, we have been growing sales to quick service restaurants and we had a solid increase again this quarter. From facilities in the UK, Turkey and South Africa, we supply a broad range of flavor solutions across this region. Our team in EMEA is not only growing sales but improving profitability through greater efficiencies and a shift towards higher-margin products. ","We\u2019re pleased with the return to sales growth in China where the demand from quick service restaurants has been volatile. In 2015, these customers are expecting a gradual improvement in sales. However our first quarter sales rose at a double-digit rate due to a new limited time menu items and increased sales of products that we manufacture in China for export to other Asian markets. ","Across both business segments, we continue to be encouraged by the global increase in demand for flavor. Flavor is well aligned with the broader changes in the way people are eating today, whether it's spicier food, eating more fresh produce and protein, simple ingredients or the move toward healthier eating. These are driving strong category growth rates in developed markets and in emerging markets we've added the benefit of the rise of middle-class consumers who are seeking the safety and quality of branded spices and seasonings. ","This increased demand for flavor underpins the growth of our current portfolio of leading brands and the breadth of flavor solutions across the entire food industry that we provide through our industrial business. It also supports acquisitions as another avenue of growth for McCormick. We\u2019ve developed a strong record of adding profitable businesses to our portfolio and we\u2019re pleased to recently announce two more. ","In late February, we signed an agreement to purchase Drogheria & Alimentari for approximately \u20ac50 million and a potential 2018 earn-out payment of up to \u20ac35 million. As a supplier of both brand and private-label products, this business is a spice and seasoning leader in Italy with approximately one-third of the category share. In addition, its products are exported to 60 other countries. We anticipate strong growth of this premium brand particularly in the US and key international markets where consumers are seeking unique and authentic ethnic flavors. ","Since its founding in 1880, the owners and employees of Drogheria & Alimentari have built a great business and we look forward to working with them to achieve continued success. We expect to complete this acquisition by midyear. ","In early March, we acquired Brand Aromatics for $63 million, our first industrial acquisition in quite a few years. With Brand Aromatics, we expand our breath of flavor solutions to value-added natural savory flavours, marinades and broth and stock concentrates. This business has packaged food customers that complement McCormick\u2019s industrial customers as well as the USDA manufacturing facility and 40 employees that include an experienced product development team. We look forward to working with the employees of Brand Aromatics to drive growth and strengthen our customer intimacy. Beyond these recent announcements, we\u2019re actively pursuing a strong pipeline of other acquisition opportunities. We've added resources across our business to support this activity. ","In our January call, I discussed the North American effectiveness initiative. This is more than a cost reduction program. We currently have operating units for our consumer and industrial businesses in the US and Canada that are comprised of both commercial and support functions. Through this initiative, we\u2019re moving to commercial units comprised of sales marketing and R&D and centralized support functions for groups like finance, human relations and supply chain. ","Our simplified commercial teams are focused on growth and innovation and our support functions will be more effectively able to leverage scale and drive cost reductions. As a part of this initiative, we are increasing spans of control and eliminating some senior positions while adding analytical talent and new capabilities. We expect to simplify our decision-making process and execute faster to capture growth and profit opportunities. ","We anticipate a very good payback with an estimated annual cost savings of $25 million and charges of about $25 million. In just two months since announcing this program, we've made significant progress toward this goal. Between the EMEA project announced 18 months ago, our North American initiative and other actions, we expect to lower our annual selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales by approximately one percentage point by 2016. We\u2019re confident that we can achieve further reductions to SG&A as a percentage of net sales through scale, our CCI program and future cost reduction programs. ","To summarize, our first quarter results have us off a great start in 2015. I'm encouraged by our strong innovation pipeline, our brand building activity and aggressive cost reduction efforts. And we've announced two acquisitions that offer great growth opportunities. I like to recognize and thank McCormick employees around the world for their engagement and high-performance that's driving our success. ","Now my pleasure to turn it over to Gordon. ","Gordon Stetz","Thanks, Alan and good morning everyone. I will begin with a review of our first quarter financial results and then update you on our latest 2015 outlook. ","We were pleased with our sales and profit performance in the first quarter. However as with many other US-based food companies with international operations, we had a significant headwind from currency this period. On a constant currency basis, the underlying growth in sales was very strong at 6%. Our adjusted operating income excludes special charges and declined 2% but if we also exclude currency, we achieved modest growth of 1%. ","Let's take a look at these results for each of our two segments. Slide 14 shows that we grew year-on-year consumer business sales 5% in constant currency driven by higher volume and product mix. Sales in the Americas rose 5% in constant currency from the first quarter of 2014 mainly due to higher volume and product mix. As Alan indicated, the growth was in core items such as recipe mixes and Grill Mates. ","In EMEA, consumer business sales in constant currency grew 2% as a result of growth in volume and product mix. This growth was led by France as well as other smaller markets and more than offset a modest volume decline in the UK where we faced a challenging retail environment. ","In France, our brand marketing support and innovation drove increased sales both of course spices and seasonings as well as homemade dessert products. In constant currency, we grew consumer business sales in the Asia-Pacific region 10% with a 13% increase in volume and product mix. This was led by sales in China which rose 18% mostly from higher volume and product mix. ","Constant currency sales in Australia also rose this period while sales in India declined due in part to lower prices in the market. In total for the consumer business, adjusted operating income was $92 million compared to $94 million in the first quarter of 2014. In constant currency, adjusted operating income was comparable to the year ago period with the benefit of sales growth and cost savings offset by the unfavorable impact of material costs, retirement benefit expense and product mix. ","As we indicated in our January call, the increase in retirement benefit expense is mainly due to the non-cash impact of a lower discount rate and new mortality table assumptions. Our brand marketing this period was up $1 million from the first quarter of 2014 and we also recorded $1 million in acquisition-related transaction costs for this business segment. ","Turning to our industrial business. We grew first quarter sales a robust 7% in constant currency from the year ago period. Higher volume and product mix contributed four percentage points and pricing actions taken in response to higher material costs added three percentage points. ","In the Americas region, industrial business year-on-year sales rose 5% in constant currency, including the impact of pricing actions. We also grew volume and product mix. Throughout 2014, snack seasonings had been a source of strong growth and this continues in 2015 with a strong pipeline of innovation. This performance along with increased sales of branded food service products more than offset continued weakness in sales to quick service restaurant customers. ","In our EMEA industrial business, we grew sales 9% in constant currency with a 6% increase in volume and product mix. As Alan described, we are supporting the growth and geographic expansion of leading quick service restaurants and food manufacturers in this region. ","We grew industrial business sales in the Asia-Pacific region 15% in constant currency. We were particularly pleased with this performance especially in China given the marketplace challenges of major quick service restaurants. ","Adjusted operating income for the industrial business was $31 million and comparable to the year ago period. In constant currency, we grew adjusted operating income 5% with the benefit of higher sales and cost savings, more than offsetting the unfavorable impact of material costs and retirement benefit expense. ","Let\u2019s turn to Slide 24. Across both segments, adjusted operating income, which excludes special charges, was $122 million, a 2% decline from $125 million in the first quarter of 2014. In constant currency, we grew adjusted operating income 1%. ","As we projected, gross profit margin declined year on year. We indicated in our January call that the timing of material cost increases versus our pricing actions and cost savings would be a headwind this quarter. We also recognize that the impact of our pricing actions and cost savings would build in the upcoming quarters and we still protect a slight increase in gross profit margin for the fiscal year. ","As a percentage of net sales, our selling, general and administrative expense decline 40 basis points due in part to the higher sales and scale advantage over our cost basis. Special charges at $28 million have exceeded our initial guidance of $20 million and we now estimate charges of $30 million for 2015. As Alan noted, we had a greater acceptance rate from our voluntary retirement program in North America and $4 million of charges from an action in EMEA. ","Below the operating income line, the tax rate was 25% and below our guidance due in part to discrete tax items recorded in the first quarter. This rate compared favorably to 31% in the first quarter of 2014 which included the impact of a higher tax rate in France that was subsequently reversed later in 2014. Based on our current outlook, we continue to expect a tax rate of 27% to 28% for 2015. ","Income from unconsolidated operations rose 94% to $10 million this quarter, led by an excellent performance from our joint venture in Mexico as Alan described. For the fiscal year, we continue to expect an increase of at least 10% which reflects our caution on the impact of currency rates on this venture. ","At the bottom line, adjusted earnings-per-share for the first quarter of 2015 was $0.70. As you can see on Slide 27, this was an $0.08 year-on-year increase led by the lower tax rate and increased income from our joint ventures. ","Turning next to slide 28. We\u2019ve summarized highlights for cash flow and the year-end balance sheet. Our cash flow from operations this period was $96 million compared to $77 million in the first quarter of 2014. During the first quarter of 2015 we used $65 million of cash to repurchase nearly a million shares of McCormick stock. ","At quarter end, we had $51 million remaining on our $400 million authorization. Early in March, we used $63 million in cash and debt to acquire Brand Aromatics. In addition, we expect to use cash and debt for the initial payment of approximately \u20ac50 million when we close on the acquisition of Drogheria & Alimentari in mid-2015. ","As we've done in the past, we expect to slow the pace of our share repurchase activity in order to return to our target debt to adjusted EBITDA level of 1.5 to 1.8. Even at a slower pace, we still expect to lower our shares outstanding by 1% in 2015. ","Our balance sheet remains sound. We're generating strong cash flow and we believe we are well-positioned to fund investments to drive growth, including future acquisitions. ","I will wrap up with our latest 2015 financial outlook. We are reaffirming our expected 2015 growth rate in constant currency for sales, adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings-per-share. Since the time of our 2015 financial guidance, we've increased our estimated special charges and increased the projected unfavorable impact of currency rates. These are the primary changes to our initial guidance. ","We anticipate further currency volatility in 2015 and as necessary we will continue to update the impact on sales and profit. Because this is challenging to forecast, we rely on prevailing rates as the basis for our projections. We continue to project a 4% to 6% sales increase in constant currency. The acquisitions we have announced should add about 1% of growth and these sales along with our first quarter results give us more confidence in achieving the upper end of this range. ","We now believe currency rates will reduce our sales growth rate by five percentage points versus our initial guidance of three percentage points. We expect to grow adjusted operating income 6% to 7% in constant currency from $608 million of adjusted operating income in 2014. While this is unchanged from our initial outlook, we have lowered our expected operating income on a reported basis to 0% to 2% from $603 million in 2014. This reflects an increased impact from unfavorable currency and an increase in special charges. ","We expect adjusted earnings-per-share of $3.44 to $3.51. This includes the increased impact of currency and therefore is a reduction from our initial guidance. Excluding the impact of currency, we expect to grow adjusted earnings-per-share 6% to 8% from $3.37 in 2014. On a reported basis, we expect earnings-per-share of $3.28 to $3.35 compared to earnings-per-share of $3.34 in 2014. ","For fiscal year 2015, we expect another year of strong cash flow. This will provide funding for our dividend, our latest acquisitions and further share repurchase activity. ","Let\u2019s turn now to your questions, then some closing remarks from Alan. Operator, we're ready for the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Alexia Howard with Sanford Bernstein.","Alexia Howard ","Can I come back to the US consumer business? I remember last quarter a negative mix effect of what was going on with season at Walmart was troublesome. And also the smaller brands encroachment that started probably a little over a year ago was a problem. It seems as though you might be coming through that a little bit better now; I just wanted to get the latest on what you are seeing on those fronts. ","Alan Wilson","Thanks, Alexia. We are encouraged by the trends that we\u2019re seeing. We still have a lot of work to do. There's still a pretty fragmented category and merchandising support for a number brands continues but we\u2019re encouraged by the progress that we are seeing. ","Alexia Howard ","So on both sides of the small brands, and the control brands as well.","Alan Wilson","Yes. We feel like our stories are gaining some traction but we know it's going to be a fair bit of time to really see all that come through. ","Alexia Howard ","And then just switching to China. I seem to remember that you were talking about how you were tapping into \u2013 this is the industrial business, you were tapping into local restaurant chains as an avenue for growth, because some of the big American restaurant chains were having so much trouble. Where are you on that and do you see sort of fairly sustainable growth in that area from here?","Alan Wilson","I am going to ask Lawrence to take that one.","Lawrence Kurzius","Hi Alexia, we are continuing to make progress with the local Chinese customers but I will say that in this quarter the biggest part of our performance has been new product wins, export from China and progress in the recovery of the Western quick service restaurants, which are beginning to see foot traffic improve. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Chris Growe with Stifel. ","Chris Growe ","So two questions if I could. One of the comments, I think Gordon, in relation to product mix seemed like it was pretty positive across the business. If I heard correctly for the consumer division, I believe you said mix was a negative for profit. I just want to make sure I heard that properly and want to understand the dynamic there if I could please on the consumer division in particular. ","Gordon Stetz","I will start with total company. On a total company basis, product mix was neutral to our results. The gross margin impact was driven, as I said, by the increased raw material cost and the timing of our savings programs coming in and our pricing actions. On the consumer division, the raw material cost increase was still the primary story although there was a slight negative product mix as well within consumer but this -- again the bigger story on the quarter for both segments was the raw material cost increases. ","Chris Growe ","And then also just a question if I could on the US consumer side and Alan, you\u2019re discussing the gourmet relaunch and how that\u2019s progressing that it\u2019s allowing you to \u2013 I don\u2019t know, to say, this way to box out some of the smaller competitors and try and have a better selling story for the retailers. I guess I want to understand \u2013 are you still seeing competitions at lower end of the category and how is gourmet helping sort of address that challenge for the business?","Alan Wilson","Yes. We\u2019re still seeing competition at the value segment as well. And as we segment consumers there is a gourmet consumer who really cares about the products that they put in their food and understand the difference and origins in spices and so that's what we\u2019re targeting with the gourmet consumers. So it's not necessarily helping on the value end. The work that we\u2019re doing at retail on price thresholds and absolute price points, are where we\u2019re combating value side. ","Chris Growe ","And I guess just to follow on that, the competition from some of the smaller competitors, that\u2019s mostly been on the value side less so on the premium or gourmet side, is that correct?","Alan Wilson","No, we\u2019ve seen a fair bit of competition on the premium side as well. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ken Goldman with JPMorgan.","Ken Goldman ","Alan, I wanted to dig in a little bit into domestic pricing for consumers. If we look at Nielsen data and your price per unit at the retail level has been slipping but it\u2019s the opposite at the wholesale level. You\u2019ve talked about your efforts to convince retailers to sort of get their on-shelf prices right. I will admit I was skeptical if this could be done without I guess wholesale prices dropping first. But it seems to be happening. So can you talk a little bit about first, is that accurate? And second, what\u2019s really making that dynamic, which isn\u2019t easy to pull off successful?","Alan Wilson","We\u2019re still seeing the dynamic with the mix because of some value products that we continue to supply and we expect that that's going to continue. But what we are doing is showing a category profitability story on key items that \u2013 where prices are pretty sensitive and working with the customers on getting those prices right. It is a kind of a store by store and customer by customer negotiation but we have a very compelling category story which is what we\u2019re outselling.","Ken Goldman ","Isn\u2019t the implication that the retailers are giving up some margin which is never an easy thing to get them to do?","Alan Wilson","Well in some cases it\u2019s making sure that they have the prices right to compete in their marketplace, because their competition with other retailers has them a little bit out of whack. So that\u2019s part of the story. The other is just reapplying some of the trade funds that we already have and getting on to the products that are more price sensitive.","Ken Goldman ","If I can ask a quick follow-up. Consumer Americas organic sales significantly better than what Nielsen would've suggested. I appreciate Nielsen doesn\u2019t capture everything but just as we think about modeling 2Q and beyond, any retail sell-ins of any new product in 1Q or anything we should be aware of that might be considered a nonrecurring event?","Alan Wilson","I wouldn\u2019t expect any nonrecurring events that is going to move the dial significantly. But remember what you see in Nielsen and we have --I know that the investment community has a real focus on spices and seasonings, we\u2019re growing share and growing the recipe mix category. That is certainly a help. We've got a number of channels that aren\u2019t necessarily captured at their site. So while we want to see the Nielsen, the IRI data in spices and seasonings to improve and we have seen some of that sequentially it doesn't capture the whole picture. ","Operator","Our next question is from the line of David Driscoll with Citigroup.","Unidentified Analyst","This is [Kruno Brunette] in with a question for David. So going back to US consumer, operating margins were down 50 basis points in the quarter following a \u201814 in which they were down 70 basis points and we saw market shares in and spices down about 80 basis points in the quarter. So when we go forward, what do we need in order to get margins going in the right direction? Is it a matter of seeing stabilized market share trends within that spices segment?","Alan Wilson","It is a couple of things. One is our cost reduction activities are going to start to take hold an impact through the year as we offset the increased cost. We get increase costs early in the year and it takes a while for our cost reduction activities to impact it. So that\u2019s one. Secondly, as we stabilize and start to grow share in our higher-margin items and spices and seasonings, we should start to see recovery in gross margin. Gordon, do you want to add anything to that or Lawrence?","Gordon Stetz","No, that those are the two key items. Obviously this year as we mentioned is the story of raw material price, or cost increases. So the cost reductions are going to be meaningful as we progress through the year and as you\u2019ve seen us talk earlier that we\u2019ve stepped up our game in that respect. So therefore they\u2019re going to have a bigger impact as we progress. And obviously volume growth is key to leveraging our scale and that is a good start to the year as you saw on our results and we would need to continue that momentum.","Alan Wilson","I think I would echo that Gordon, we\u2019ve been very clear that the cost impact from the higher raw materials impact us immediately from the beginning of the year of the cost reduction activities, the cost improvement activity that we\u2019re highly confident in, phases in as we go through the year. We also emphasize that we took no list price decreases or conducted any extraordinary promotions in this quarter, the change in the margin structure is strictly related to the impact of cost and a minor contribution from product mix.","Unidentified Analyst","And then looking at the EMEA consumer business, noticeably no pricing in the quarter but significant headwinds from foreign-currency and it looks like you\u2019re expecting good acceleration in pricing in EMEA going forward. Just was wondering what type of risk do you think that will have to volumes in that EMEA consumer segment given that your cost position may be little bit unfavorable to local competitors, given that you\u2019re dealing with higher raw material costs and FX at the same time?","Alan Wilson","Yes, the local competitors are going to have the same issue because spices and seasonings are mostly priced in US dollars. So part of what you'll see is the pricing change to reflect the impact of raw materials on currency. We feel pretty good about our ability to execute in the UK and \u2013 I am sorry in EMEA. ","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Rob Dickerson with Consumer Edge.","Rob Dickerson ","Just have a pretty simple maintenance question. So I just want to clarify, I think I thought you said \u2013 or I know this morning you stated that I guess constant currency EPS growth didn\u2019t change, that\u2019s 6% to 8%. But then I thought, maybe I am misreading this but I thought at the time of Q4, at least in the transcript or some of the call was that constant currency EPS excluding special charges was 7% and 9%. So I just want to make sure there wasn\u2019t a change to constant currency EPS and if there is a change, what's driving that?","Gordon Stetz","There is no change. In the fourth quarter call, we also highlighted pension as another impact that got us to that 7% to 9%. So excluding in constant currency and excluding the impact of the increased benefit costs, EPS growth is \u2013 was 7% to 9% and still at 7% to 9%. ","Rob Dickerson ","And then just kind of a quick follow up then, I guess, the same rationale applies to adjusted operating income which was 4% to 5% including FX, so that was off of the 608, and now we are just including an additional point of FX, I am assuming that that's just very simplistically we\u2019re now just at 3% to 4% off of the 608?","Joyce Brooks","This is Joyce. That's right, in our initial guidance of 4% to 5% growth in adjusted operating income, that had about two percentage points of currency implied in there. So the constant currency growth rate was 6% to 7% which continues to be. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse.","Robert Moskow ","If I go back to what, I was kind of concerned about three months ago, it was my thought that McCormick would have to or was going to reduce sizes on certain SKUs and maintain less prices. So it was kind of like a laid-out strategy in response to higher commodities. And McCormick was doing at a time when competition was intensifying and price gaps seemed to be getting bigger with private-label. So can you just give us kind of an update on that, on where you are in that process and has competition followed or do you feel like your price gaps are getting bigger on any items as result of this?","Alan Wilson","And obviously because of the fragmented competition that we have, it's a mixed story. But our larger competitors have announced price increases as we\u2019ve gone into the year both on the industrial and the consumer side because they are seeing the same level of commodity cost increases that we are.","Robert Moskow ","Just also a follow-up, you said quick service restaurants in the US kind of weak, I would've thought by now there could be some kind of a pickup here and maybe the industry is saying. So can you give us a reason why, is it one or two retailers or is it all retailers where you\u2019re seeing that weakness in the environment?","Alan Wilson","Our quick service business in the Americas is pretty broad to a number customers but there are couple of customers that are large enough to have an impact. And those larger customers as they\u2019ve reported have been struggling somewhat with foot traffic and sales and that impacts us as well. We are gaining with some of the smaller quick service restaurants and we feel pretty good about that .But it's not enough to offset the very large chains that are well-publicized and their challenges. ","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The next question comes from the line of Eric Katzman with Deutsche Bank.","Eric Katzman ","One specific question, Alan, on the cost cutting, I guess, there are now two initiatives to lower SG&A as a percentage of sales. Not to be too I guess specific but when you say fiscal \u201916, do you mean by end of fiscal \u201816 that hundred basis point improvement should occur or kind of at the start?","Alan Wilson","We expect it to be in our guidance for -- not giving early guidance but we expect that to be a full year impact for 2016 because the costs that we\u2019re taking out are coming out now. ","Eric Katzman ","So kind of like on a run rate basis but building over this year as well. ","Alan Wilson","That's right. ","Eric Katzman ","And then I guess you just opened up this figure for M&A, you\u2019ve done two deals and I think you were quite frank last quarter about saying that the pipeline looked pretty good and you\u2019re kind of reiterating that. So I mean maybe you could go a little bit more into the deals that you're seeing, why is there kind of a pickup in that today?","Alan Wilson","There is the benefit right now of the low interest rate environment so that is -- and I am assuming that some sellers are anticipating that\u2019s going to change in the not-too-distant future. So it\u2019s an optimum time, if you\u2019ve got a business that\u2019s got good traction that maybe needs and as we've seen with the businesses we have been able to buy that need a little investment for growth because there is growth opportunities, now is pretty good time. They are probably also looking and seeing as we have that multiples are attractive for a seller, a little more challenging for a buyer but as we've always done we\u2019ve been pretty financially disciplined to make sure we get the returns that we expect. But it's a pretty robust environment for the kinds of deals that we like to do right now. ","Eric Katzman ","And then my last question is, during, I guess that you seem to be coming out of it but during the depths of the US consumer segment pressure, you not only noted the competition in spice and seasonings but you also mentioned slower growth or missteps in some of the other products whether it was Grill Mates or marinades, spice and rice, and Zatarain\u2019s etc. So I guess one, kind of would you -- those other businesses, are they seeing some better traction in the market and do you see like adding through M&A other kind of niches which has been very successful for the company in the past but we haven't seen much of late?","Alan Wilson","Yes, we do see adding more adjacencies in our businesses both in consumer and industrial. And so we see these opportunities and we\u2019re little mixed on the smaller brands at least in the quarter. So we had good traction in some of the smaller brands and some that still have some level of challenge. I will say that as we talked about Grill Mates, we are aggressively pursuing an earlier grilling season this year and we feel like we\u2019re getting the kind of traction that we expect. Last year grilling \u2013 our grilling promotion started closer to Memorial Day, we\u2019re getting them out a lot earlier this year. ","Operator","Thank you. Our final question today will be from the line of Akshay Jagdale with KeyBanc. ","Unidentified Analyst","Good morning. This is actually Luby [ph] on for Akshay. I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about how you\u2019re thinking about the marketing around your new product launches slated for the remainder of the year? And maybe if you could just touch on sort of the rollout plan and in-store merchandising etc. for those new products? And then I have a follow up, thanks.","Alan Wilson","I will let Lawrence take that one.","Lawrence Kurzius","Sure. Thank you, Alan. Well, as is always the case, we have a fairly robust launch of new products. Most of them are in our core categories. So they get the benefit of all of our branded advertising and in turn the work that we do on them supports of the growth of our core business as well. We are really quite encouraged by the launch of skillet sauces that we introduced last year and that we\u2019ve continued the introduction this year. We had advertising for those products in the first quarter. So we have new grilling products and new gluten-free products that we launched this year, that we\u2019re also quite excited about.","Unidentified Analyst","And then just on the income from unconsolidated operations line, it came in quite a bit better than we were expecting and we were modeling pretty decent growth there. But can you just talk a little bit about what's driving the results there and also do you expect to see sort of the same level of growth for the remainder of the year that we saw here in the 1Q?","Gordon Stetz","This is Gordon. As we mentioned in the call, it\u2019s driven by great performance from our joint venture in Mexico. As we talked in previous calls, there is a new facility that has been ramping up and improving productivity. The sales growth there in the market has been strong and they have been very good in managing their cost positions. So all of that has contributed to some very very strong growth in the first quarter. We don't expect that pace of growth as we continue through the rest of the year and the reason for that is the impact of currency on a go forward basis on that business. So we do expect moderating growth in that area, especially as we get towards the back half of the year where their performance was also very strong and we start to lap that. ","End of Q&A","Operator","Thank you. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Alan Wilson for closing remarks.","Alan Wilson","I want to thank you for your questions and for participating in today's call. Consumer demand for flavor is increasing and our categories have strong growth rates. Our geographic presence and product portfolio are expanding and ideally aligned with the move towards healthier eating, fresh ingredients, ethnic cuisine and bold tastes and we\u2019re driving growth through innovation, brand marketing and acquisitions. In 2015, we stepped up our cost reduction activity and we will continue to pursue ways to improve our productivity and profit as we continue to grow. We look forward to reporting to you on our continued progress in the upcoming quarters. ","Joyce Brooks","Thanks, Alan. And I\u2019d also like to thank those who joined us this morning.

To accompany this call, we have posted a set of slides at ir.mccormick.com. [Operator Instructions]","With me this morning are Lawrence Kurzius, President and CEO; Gordon Stetz, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Mike Smith, Senior Vice President, Corporate Finance.","During our remarks, we will refer to non-GAAP financial measures. These include adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share that exclude the impact of special charges as well as information in constant currency. Reconciliations to the GAAP results are included in this morning\u2019s press release and slides.","As a reminder, today\u2019s presentation contains projections and other forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those projected. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or other factors. As seen on Slide 2, our forward-looking statement also provides information on risk factors that could affect our financial results.","It\u2019s now my pleasure to turn the discussion over to Lawrence.","Lawrence Kurzius","Thank you, Joyce and good morning everyone. Thanks for joining us. McCormick\u2019s second quarter results continued the momentum we saw in the first quarter of 2016. We are driving this performance with our growth strategies and our people, but thanks to McCormick employees around the world for their effort and engagement for their first half financial results and business momentum. Together, we have greater confidence in our financial outlook for fiscal year 2016.","The strong results this quarter started at the top line. In constant currency, we grew sales 6% for the total company. And the increase in our consumer segment sales was particularly strong with an 8% increase. Contributing factors were three acquisitions completed in the last 12 months along with growth in our base business and new products, our three drivers of long-term sales growth. Based on these results, we reaffirm our fiscal year outlook for a 4% to 6% sales increase in constant currency and with he recent acquisition of Gourmet Gardens have greater confidence in the upper end of this range.","We saw sequential improvement in gross profit margin with a gain of 130 basis points following a 70 basis point increase in the first quarter. This improvement was led by our Comprehensive Continuous Improvement program, CCI, and we had a benefit this period from favorable business mix, including strong sales in our core U.S. consumer business. As a result, we are now tracking toward the higher end of our fiscal year projection for gross profit margin improvement.","Back in February, we set a goal to achieve $400 million of cost savings over the next 4 years. At about 2% of sales, this is an ambitious target, but one that is backed by increased resources under Mike Smith\u2019s leadership. Importantly, we are taking a deliberate approach so that we do not disrupt the great progress underway with our top line growth strategies. Through the first half of 2016, we are off to a great start with this work and are increasing our fiscal year 2016 projection to a range of $100 million to $110 million. This is our fuel for growth as demonstrated by our second quarter investment in brand marketing, which we increased 16% or $10 million from the year ago period. As a further investment, we funded $5 million of increased incremental spending in the second quarter in support of our acquisition activity, a key element of our growth strategy.","Even with the incremental spending to drive growth, we increased constant currency adjusted operating income 7% led by the higher sales and gross profit margin. Year-to-date, this puts us at a 9% constant currency increase, which is within our fiscal year 9% to 11% objective. At the bottom line adjusted earnings per share of $0.75 was comparable to the year ago period. We had a strong increase in adjusted operating income although this was offset by a higher tax rate. Keep in mind that this year-to-year comparison of adjusted earnings per share for the second quarter includes the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates.","For the fiscal year 2016, we reaffirm our outlook for adjusted earnings per share of $3.68 to $3.75 and have more confidence in achieving the upper end of this range based on our financial performance through the first half and our projections for the next two quarters. On Slide 5, we have summarized our fiscal year 2016 guidance in constant currency, which is at or above our long-term outlook. In his remarks, Gordon will provide some additional insight into the quarter and into our outlook.","I would like to turn next to some business updates with a focus this morning on the steady improvement on our U.S. consumer business, our great new product lineup for the second half, highlights of other parts of our business and comments on our acquisition activity and outlook. For our U.S. consumer business, category growth for spices and seasonings continues to be strong, reaching an 8% year-on-year increase in the latest quarter. Two-thirds of this increase was higher volume and we believe this is being driven by new product launches, such as our herb grinders, brand marketing support and the recent dietary guideline news. A lot of the growth is in those herbs and spices that are pantry staples.","During this same period, retail sales of McCormick brand spices and seasonings rose 7% year-on-year. As the graph on Slide 6 shows, this continues our trajectory of sequential increase and compares to a 5% increase in the first quarter consumption data. Across all of our spice and seasoning brands, not only McCormick, but niche brands like Lawry\u2019s, Old Bay and El Guapo, our share performance continued to improve. We were down just 10 basis points, so almost even in this latest period. When Gourmet Garden is included, our share is up 20 basis points, again, a sequential improvement from the first quarter. The information on Slide 6 is based on retail dollar sales for spices and seasonings.","As noted on Slide 7, on a unit basis, second quarter retail sales grew 6% for the category and 7% for McCormick brand spices and seasonings. There are three key messages here. First, we gained category share on a unit basis. Second, the McCormick brand is helping drive the unit category increase. And third, this is evidence that certain retailers are implementing our recommendations to lower retail price points on the McCormick brand. As for the recipe mix category, retail dollar sales of our McCormick brand recipe mixes were up 3% and we gained 10 basis points of category share. We are driving this great performance by our actions to win at retail, build our brand equity, and accelerate innovation.","Win at retail we have been increasing our investment in category management tools, resources and capabilities. We are pleased with our progress and continue to build our capabilities. We are getting great feedback from our customers. They have commented that McCormick has really stepped up its game and is having a more thorough conversation on the category. Part of our category management work is focused on retail price points. At retail customers who have partnered with us on pricing recommendations, the year-to-date dollar share from McCormick brand spices and seasonings is up 120 basis points versus a 70 basis point decrease with the remaining U.S. food retailers. The good news is that this increase in share for McCormick brand is typically a profitable mood for both us and our customers.","As I indicated, we had a significant increase in brand marketing this quarter and about half of the increase was in the U.S. This included marketing support for our Pure Tastes Better campaign, the launch of our herb grinders, Hispanic advertising and digital marketing for Grill Mates as we headed into the Memorial Day and peak grilling season. We are also getting good traction with our product innovation and in January showed you our plans for the first half of 2016. Let\u2019s take a look ahead at the second half lineup for our U.S. consumer business.","We are poised to launch a number of new products for consumers in this market, as seen on Slide 8. These include flavored black pepper, five different tastes for McCormick\u2019s iconic black pepper, from mild and smoky to tangy and hot; organic recipe mixes for convenient flavorful weeknight dinners; organic kitchen basics stocks and a new bone broth to add protein to your diet. Within our gourmet line, we are launching signature Asian flavors inspired by our flavor forecast that include Japanese 7 Spice and Korean-Style Red Pepper and pairings of helpful ingredients like chia, flax and matcha with spices and herbs, and a line of Lawry\u2019s brand Casero blends that deliver authentic Mexican and Latino taste. We are also re-launching our entire produce partners\u2019 line with new packaging. These products, like great guacamole and salsa seasoning, are merchandised right in the high traffic produce department.","We also have an exciting lineup for markets outside of the U.S. In the Americas region, Canada is targeting millennial consumers with limited edition recipe mixes and flavors like Sriracha buffalo wing and Peruvian roast chicken, and extending their line of produce partner blends. Our team in Central America is introducing a line of 5 new cooking sauces. In Europe, Middle East and Africa, EMEA, our goal is to lead the development and growth of the barbecue category. And our latest product introduction is the line of the burger seasoning mixes in the UK. Across a number of countries in this region, we are getting distribution for our herb grinders and have a new television ad ready to drive consumer awareness. And in France, we are continuing a steady stream of innovation for our Vahin\u00e9 dessert brand with new decorating items and new packaging features.","Moving to our Asia-Pacific region, we are extending our recipe mixes in China. These products help consumers to create hot and spicy Szechuan dishes and experience flavors from around the world like lemon curry roasted chicken wings and Brazilian barbecue seasoning. Part of our Wuhan Asia-Pacific condiment economy business in China, we are introducing cooking line and vinegar. And then in Australia, our iconic Airplane brand has a commanding lead in gelatin and we have been stretching the branch to other desert categories. Our latest plans are to launch Airplane liquid shake mixes.","While we do not get too specific with our industrial product development, McCormick is well positioned for innovation with our certification as global supplier for an increasing number of our large customers. Our range of flavor solutions for these customers is one of the broadest in the industry as evidenced by recent product development work for snack chip seasonings, cracker seasonings, beverage flavors, ice cream toppings, sandwich sauces and burger seasonings.","Let\u2019s turn next to our performance and outlook for some other parts of our business and we will start with China. China is our second largest market after the U.S. We have been in this market for more than 25 years, made a very successful acquisition in 2013 and are excited about our prospects for growth. For our consumer business, we grew constant currency sales through the first half by 8% with new products, expanded distribution and brand marketing. There has been some fluctuation in sales growth by quarter due to shifts in timing related to promotional activity as well as the timing of shipments related to a successful implantation of SAP in our central China operation. Our consumer business in this market remains solid and we continue to expect good growth in 2016 and beyond.","For our Industrial segment, year-to-date constant currency sales in China were up 8% with higher volume and product mix. We anticipate some sales pressure in the second half as a large customer will be diversifying their supply chain by adding a second supplier for some core items that McCormick supplies. Based on our current pace of growth and latest outlook across both our consumer and industrial businesses in China, we expect our success in this market to continue with fiscal year 2016 constant currency sales growing at a mid to high single-digit range.","As for the industrial business in the Americas, we are delivering strong sales of branded foodservice products along with new product wins for snack seasonings, beverage flavors and burger seasonings. On the innovation front, we are in a great position as we see accelerated moves by our customers towards no process flavors and non-GMO ingredients. We are making inroads with some additional restaurant chains. And Brand Aromatics, acquired just over a year ago is ahead of plan in both sales and profit. Together, these successes are driving not only top line growth but higher profit margins with a more favorable mix.","In EMEA, or industrial sales slowed this quarter as we lapse some of the new distribution wins that drove a portion of our sales growth in 2015, but we are still encouraged by our innovation pipeline and the geographic expansion of our customers in this region. We also had weak sales for joint venture in South Africa that we plan to exit by year end. Our consumer business sales in EMEA benefited from a roughly 50% increase in brand marketing in the second quarter. Excluding acquisitions and on a constant currency basis, we grew volume and product mix 3% versus the year ago quarter, which strengthened our largest market France and a double digit increase in both Poland and Russia that was driven in part by expanded distribution.","The last update I wanted to provide was on our acquisition activity and outlook. During the second quarter, we were pleased to announce our purchase of Botanical Food Company in Australia, which manufactures and sells the Gourmet Garden brand. Gourmet Garden is a global market leader in on trend chilled, convenient packaged herbs, exporting products for our manufacturing location in Australia to 15 other countries, with the largest being the U.S. Annual sales are more than $50 million and the purchase price for this high growth business was a 12x multiple of EBITDA. We anticipate continued double digit sales growth for these products that offer consumers a convenient flavor alternatives to fresh herbs. Importantly, these closer to fresh products are shelved with produce and allow us to participate in this highly traffic perimeter department.","Going forward, we have a robust pipeline of acquisition opportunities. These include assets where flavor and health intersect to extend our current footprint with healthy flavors and great brands. Value added higher margin industrial assets, acquisitions that build scale, where we currently have a presence and developed in emerging markets and in size, both large assets as well as smaller bolt-on opportunities. Our pursuit of Premier Foods earlier this year demonstrates our interest in larger businesses that fit with our growth strategy and I hope that our ultimate decision not to make a firm offer also showed investors that McCormick remains financially disciplined in its use of cash. To summarize my remarks, we are well positioned as a global leader in flavor and are driving strong momentum with our growth strategy. We achieved great results through the first half and have increased confidence in delivering the higher end of our 2016 financial outlook.","Now, before I turn it over to Gordon, we announced yesterday Gordon\u2019s decision to retire at the end of this year. Gordon has been an exceptional leader at McCormick. During his 28 years with the company, he has built a world class finance team that under his leadership has helped deliver exceptional returns for our shareholders. His strategic leadership focused on value creation have been instrumental in driving our successful acquisition agenda, expanding our shared services around the world and managing our cost and cash, including the establishment of our CCI program. Gordon is the embodiment of McCormick values and teamwork and will truly be missed by me and employees throughout the organization. Gordon, congratulations on your successful career, all of your achievements and your upcoming retirement.","Gordon Stetz","Thanks very much for those remarks, Lawrence. Joining McCormick 28 years ago was one of the best decisions I have ever made. This is a great company. It\u2019s only gotten better during my time here. During my years at the company, we developed our focus on flavor and led to terrific growth opportunities and strong shareholder return. We improved our productivity, generating our fuel for growth. I am so proud of our teams in finance, shared services and information technology and appreciate all of their efforts. I truly feel blessed I have had such a talented team. My decision to retire at this time is based in part on Mike\u2019s readiness to move into this role and my confidence that Lawrence, Mike and the rest of our leadership team have the energy and vision to create a bright future for McCormick shareholders and employees. This is the right team to manage the challenges of an increasingly complex world and capture the great opportunities that are ahead for this company. For those on the call, I value the opportunity to build relationships and provide insight into our business. You have been generous in sharing your views of our business and your knowledge of the food industry and I thank you all greatly for that.","Lawrence Kurzius","Thanks Gordon. You are with us through December so don\u2019t say too many goodbyes just yet. In the same announcement, Mike Smith was named Executive Vice President and CFO effective September 1. Mike will serve on our management committee and assume Gordon\u2019s responsibilities, which include oversight of the company\u2019s global finance organization as well as McCormick\u2019s shared services and information technology. Mike brings to this role a deep knowledge of the company and experience as a finance leader in both corporate and operational roles, including those in North America and in our EMEA region and across both Consumer and Industrial segments. In each of these roles, he has been a \u2013 he has a proven track record of creating value and growth. He is actively driving our positivity improvement and led the work behind McCormick\u2019s recently announced goal to reduce $400 million of costs over the next 4 years to create fuel for growth. Mike, congratulations on this promotion, I look forward to working with you in this new role.","Mike Smith","Thank you, Lawrence. I am excited about serving as CFO of McCormick and the opportunity together with McCormick\u2019s leaders and employees throughout the company to drive our growth and performance. It\u2019s been great to work closely with Gordon and the entire management committee for the past year to prepare for this new role. Gordon, I wanted thank you in particular, for your mentorship and offer my congratulations. Over the past few years, I have gotten to meet a number of the analysts and investors who follow McCormick and look forward to continuing to build these relationships and your knowledge of our business.","Gordon Stetz","Mike, let me add my congratulations. And for those on the call, in addition to Lawrence\u2019s remarks, I want to express my supreme confidence in Mike\u2019s leadership and role as new CFO. I have had the privilege of working with him for many years and has watched him, his career progress and witnessed his strong financial leadership and ability to drive results. So congratulations to you, Mike.","Now let\u2019s get back to our latest financial results. As Lawrence indicated, we are pleased with our second quarter results and have good momentum heading into the second half of 2016. I will provide some additional remarks and insights on our second quarter results followed by the details of our current 2016 financial outlook. On a constant currency basis, we grew sales 6%. Acquisitions, higher volume and product mix and pricing taken in response to higher material costs each contributed to the increase, as seen on Slide 14. The growth this quarter was led by our consumer segment.","On Slide 15, consumer segment sales in the Americas rose 6% in constant currency with about half of the increase from acquisitions, both Stubb\u2019s and Gourmet Garden. The balance of sales growth this period was led by strong performance in our U.S. sales of McCormick brand spices and herbs, recipe mixes, our Lawry\u2019s brand and Simply Asia products. These were offset in part by a lower rate of growth in our sales of private label and economy brands. Also, volume and mix declined in Canada as consumers adjust to some significant price increases related in part to currency pressure. In EMEA, we had another quarter of robust sales, up 20% in constant currency. This increase was driven by our year ago acquisition of Drogheria & Alimentari, which added 14 percentage points to the sales growth. We also expanded distribution of our products in Poland and Russia and delivered a strong performance in France with new products in brand marketing.","Consumer sales in the Asia-Pacific region were up just slightly in constant currency. Sales from Gourmet Garden added 3 percentage points of growth. In China, as Lawrence noted, sales growth moderated in the second quarter due to the timing of customer purchases related to promotions and the successful implementation of SAP in our Wuhan facility. Year-to-date, we have grown consumer sales in China at a high single-digit rate on a constant currency basis and we expect to return to a higher growth rate in the third quarter versus the second quarter. Lowering our second quarter sales in this region was a decline in India resulting from our decision to discontinue certain low margin products. This action in India lowered our second quarter sales growth rate in the region by 6 percentage points.","For the consumer segment in total, we grew adjusted operating income 7% to $86 million. In constant currency, adjusted operating income rose 8% from the year ago period with the impact of sales growth and cost savings more than offsetting an $8 million increase in brand marketing, a $5 million increase in acquisition-related expenses and higher material costs.","Turning to our industrial segment in Slide 19, we had solid results this quarter in both sales and profit, although this was a moderation from the first quarter which included an incremental impact from Brand Aromatics. We grew industrial sales in the Americas 2% in constant currency. We increased U.S. sales of branded foodservice products and gained some new distribution with restaurant customers. In both the U.S. and Mexico, sales volume and product mix for snack seasonings were strong although pricing was down due in part to lower cost for dairy ingredients.","In Canada, we pass through higher material costs to our customers with higher pricing, but this was offset by some volume weakness for industrial products in that market. While we have had a long run of excellent performance from our industrial business in EMEA, this quarter, we lapped some of the new distribution gained in 2015. As a result, the sales growth rate moderated to a slight increase in constant currency. Also affecting industrial sales in this region was sales weakness in a small consolidated joint venture based in South Africa that we plan to exit by year end.","We grew industrial segment sales in the Asia-Pacific region 9% in constant currency. The main driver was higher sales to quick service restaurants in the region mainly from our operation in China. As Lawrence indicated, we expect industrial sales pressure in the second half of 2016 in this market.","Adjusted operating income for the industrial segment ended the quarter up 1% at $43 million. In constant currency, the growth was 5% driven by higher sales and our cost savings offset in part by higher material costs and a $2 million increase in brand marketing to drive our branded foodservice business. Adjusted operating income margin for this segment in the second quarter reached 10.1%.","Across both segments, adjusted operating income which excludes special charges rose 5% in the second quarter from the year ago period. If we also exclude the impact of unfavorable currency, we grew adjusted operating income by 7%. This is below our 9% to 11% goal for the fiscal year, but includes the higher brand marketing and acquisition-related costs. Year-to-date, the increase in adjusted operating income in constant currency is 9% as Lawrence indicated. We increased gross profit margin 130 basis points year-on-year to 40.7% in the second quarter of 2016. This improvement was the result of cost savings from our CCI and organization and streamlining actions, favorable mix and pricing actions taken to offset a moderate level of cost inflation.","Our selling, general and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales was up year-on-year by 110 basis points from the second quarter of 2015. The increases in brand marketing and acquisition cost as a percentage of net sales were 140 basis points more than accounting for the 110 basis point increase. Below the operating income line, the tax rate on a GAAP basis this quarter was 23.1% compared to a very low 15.9% in the year ago period. Both periods were favorably impacted by discrete tax items. The second quarter 2016 tax rate of 23.1% was one of the reasons why the second quarter adjusted earnings per share came in ahead of the guidance we shared with you back in March. Given this result and absent additional discrete tax items for the remainder of the year, we are now estimating a fiscal year 2016 tax rate in the range of 27% to 28%.","Despite unfavorable currency, income from unconsolidated operations rose 4% to $8 million. Our largest joint venture, McCormick to Mexico, is performing well with sales in constant currency up 7% year-to-date although profit for this business was unfavorably impacted by higher material costs, especially the currency impact on soybean oil purchases. For the fiscal year, we expect income from unconsolidated operations to be down about 10%.","At the bottom line, second quarter 2016 adjusted earnings per share was $0.75. This was comparable to the year ago period with the impact of higher adjusted operating income offset by the higher tax rate. Keep in mind that this year-to-year comparison includes the unfavorable impact from currency on both consolidated and unconsolidated income.","On Slide 28, we have summarized highlights for cash flow and the quarter end balance sheet. Through the first half of 2016, cash flow from operations was $213 million compared to $186 million in the year ago period mainly due to the increase in net income. We returned $210 million of cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases and used $55 million for capital expenditures. At the end of the second quarter, $469 million remained on the current $600 million share repurchase authorization. Our balance sheet remains sound. We are generating strong cash flow and we are well positioned to continue funding investments to drive our growth strategy.","Let\u2019s move now to our current financial outlook for 2016. Our strong outlook for the year is unchanged. In fact, we have greater confidence in achieving the upper end of our sales growth and earnings per share ranges. At the top line, we reaffirm our plan to grow sales 1% to 3% on a reported basis and 4% to 6% in constant currency with higher pricing adding 1% to 2% of the increase. And with the addition of Gourmet Garden, we now expect acquisitions to add 2% to 3%. We expect this latest acquisition and our year-to-date performance to place us at the higher end of our 4% to 6% constant currency sales growth range.","We continue to expect a 9% to 11% constant currency increase in adjusted operating income from $614 million of adjusted operating income in 2015. Currency is expected to lower this range by 3 percentage points. We plan to drive our growth with higher sales and our stepped up cost savings target of $100 million to $110 million. With this fuel for growth, we expect to increase brand marketing approximately $20 million consistent with our initial plans.","Our guidance range for adjusted earnings per share remains $3.68 to $3.75. Excluding the estimated 3 percentage point impact of unfavorable currency rates, this range is an increase of 9% to 11% from adjusted earnings per share of $3.48 in 2015. With our year-to-date results and outlook for the second half, we have more confidence in achieving the higher end of this range.","Regarding last week\u2019s referendum outcome on Brexit, the immediate impact to our business will be currency rates. Early this week, we reevaluated our guidance and determined that a 3% impact from currency is our best estimate at this point in time. Any longer term impact on our business will depend in part on the outcome of tariff, trade and regulatory negotiations. As a point of reference, our sales in the UK were 8% of total company sales in fiscal 2015. As a final remark on our outlook, we are on track for another year of strong cash flow for fiscal year 2016 with higher adjusted net income and actions underway to improve our working capital.","That completes my remarks. So let\u2019s turn now to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. At this time we will be conducting question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of David Driscoll with Citigroup. Please proceed with your questions.","David Driscoll","Great. Thank you and good morning.","Lawrence Kurzius","Good morning David.","David Driscoll","I wanted to ask about the U.S. consumer performance, the Nielsen data has been just so strong, you mentioned it in your prepared comments, I think the sales in the segment were up like 3%, were you under shipping or anything like that relative to the number kind of \u2013 and I know there is more things than just spices in there, but that number just seems so strong, perhaps I thought we might even see a stronger number in the quarter, but I don\u2019t know if there is a delay in shipment timing?","Lawrence Kurzius","Hey David. Thanks and it\u2019s great to hear from you this morning. First of all, I will just start by saying we are very pleased with the results in our U.S. consumer business. We are quite pleased with the shipments. We are even more pleased with the continued improvement in the off-take information and this continued sequential improvement in our performance versus the category. I know that there has been a lot of questions both from the U.S. and from others who are listening on the call about exactly when our share will turn positive and we keep saying that we are going to get there and I believe that this is evidence that that\u2019s true. As we noted on the call, our sales increase for the U.S. consumer business includes more than just the McCormick brand. In our business, we also have economy brands and private label and the growth of the economy brands and private label were both lower than our sales of \u2013 growth in our sales of branded products. And so that is a contributing factor to the difference versus \u2013 in our shipments versus the off-take data for our brand. That\u2019s a mix shift that has also help lift our profit margin, obviously. The second thing is that we are going through some major transitions on a couple of our product lines within herbs and spices. And in some cases, we have limited shipments to keep from having inventory of old packaging on the shelf as we go through that transition. That particularly affected the transition of our gourmet business to organic. The timing of Memorial Day also may have pushed some of our barbecue and grilling product sales into Q3. Memorial Day is a week later. It\u2019s on the calendar. It\u2019s on the 30 this year. It was almost the last possible day that it could be. And so we believe that that probably influenced the start of grilling. We know that\u2019s the case with a couple of particular customers. But that wasn\u2019t a surprise to us. We knew what the calendar look like and so that was already reflected in our thinking about both Q2 and about Q3. And then finally, in Canada, the Americas number that we reported and just for the U.S. and that includes Canada and a small Latin American operation. In Canada, we took a lot of pricing in this time period, due to the \u2013 in part, to recover the transaction cost of currency. And this has had an impact on the volume growth in that market. Gordon, Mike, do you want to comment on this any further?","Gordon Stetz","No, I think you covered it very well.","David Driscoll","Gordon, can I just think one other one and I just wanted to hear your thoughts on the pacing of input cost inflation and for the remainder of the year and then if you might just be able to give us any insight as to how it would progress beyond that, spices are very difficult for us to understand, how the input costs might change?","Gordon Stetz","We are still expecting this year to be low single-digits. And I wouldn\u2019t \u2013 low single-digit inflation on our input costs. And I would expect any material change quarter-to-quarter on that. So you may get some noise but generally, it\u2019s pretty consistent. In terms of next year, we are in the midst of strategic plans and looking into our budgets so that we are still developing and as a result, we will be providing that guidance, as we always do in the beginning of next year. So we are still pulling all that together and looking all the puts and takes there.","David Driscoll","Okay. Thank you.","Joyce Brooks","Thanks David.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Akshay Jagdale of Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.","Akshay Jagdale","Good morning.","Lawrence Kurzius","Good morning.","Joyce Brooks","Hi.","Akshay Jagdale","Hi, I just wanted to follow-up on the U.S. business, can you elaborate a little bit on the economy brands and private label, I mean I don\u2019t recall that being a call out anytime in recent history, is that \u2013 am I remembering that correctly and was that planned, is really the first question. And then, how long should we expect that to continue, so in other words, how long should we expect the \u2013 there to be sort of a gap between the Nielsen data and what you are reporting in your U.S. consumer business?","Lawrence Kurzius","Sure, Akshay. Well, first of all, regarding the gap and off-take versus shipments, that\u2019s \u2013 obviously, it\u2019s not something that is sustainable. We always expect that shipments will ultimately reflect consumption. So this gives us a good bit of optimism about the course of our branded business. We are not particularly calling out economy and private label, but we have talked about certain control brands that major retailers have that they put emphasis, promotional emphasis on in the past. We are lapping that. That was a year ago. A major retailer took a very strong promotional stance on a very low priced economy brand, control brand that we manufacture for them. And that has really run its course. And I think that\u2019s what\u2019s coming through and maybe some softer shipments on economy and private label. I will say this is, that that change in mix is quite positive for us.","Akshay Jagdale","And should we expect that to continue for \u2013 I mean, on a quarterly basis, obviously you lapped it, but was this is something only to content for in this quarter or should we expect the same sort of trends going forward?","Gordon Stetz","Our expectation is, as Lawrence indicated in his opening remarks, is that we will start to see the trends, start to migrate closer to the actual consumer take away numbers. We are starting to anniversary some of that heavy promotional activity from that customer. So these should start to become more in line as we go forward.","Akshay Jagdale","Okay. Congrats Gordon and also Mike.","Gordon Stetz","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Alexia Howard with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.","Alexia Howard","Good morning everyone.","Lawrence Kurzius","Good morning Alexia.","Alexia Howard","So first of all Gordon, it\u2019s been great working with you. Sorry to see you go but wishing you all the best for the future and Mike, really looking forward to working with you going forward. Couple of questions, first of all, on margin goals, I just wanted to ask or make the observation that a number of other companies in this space have gone beyond just laying out, this is the $400 million of costs we are planning to get at as you have and actually gone on to set explicit operating margin goals over the next 2 years or 3 years, just wondering if that\u2019s something you have on the radar screen and whether you would consider that. And then as a follow-up question, coming back to the U.S. consumer business, it seems as though the regular spices and herbs are doing very, very well, very aligned with cooking from scratch, definitely on a roll, it seems as though the seasoning mixes, the recipe mixes are a bit slower. Do you have a view as to why that might be? You made a loss of the GMO-free statures of a lot of the regular herbs last quarter. Are people worried about some of the additives in those recipe mixes? I mean is that something you can address? Thank you and I will pass it on.","Mike Smith","Hey Alexia, it\u2019s Mike. I will talk about the margin goals first and I do look forward to working with you. The margin goals, if you look at our guidance, our external guidance right now, 4% to 6% net sales growth, adjusted operating profit growth of 7% to 9%, we do have implicit in there, margin growth of about 40 basis points if you look at the middle of the range. We do think about that sometimes, but at this point, we felt very comfortable with putting up the $1 target, seeing how we progress against that and something we may consider in the future, but we feel good with our long-term guidance there.","Lawrence Kurzius","And I will take the recipe mixes. Alexia, in the year ago period, we had some really strong performance. There was a product recall of an ingredient that was in a lot of our competitor\u2019s products that did not impact McCormick. And so we had a bit of an advantage at the shelf for a period and we have certainly lapped that. We are quite optimistic actually about the outlook for our recipe mixes for the rest of the year. We are launching our organic recipe mixes this quarter. We think that those are going to be a significant increment to our business. We have shown that recipe mixes are quite responsive to innovation. A big part of the improvement that we have had in this business has been the launch of recipe mixes, such as the non-GMO \u2013 sorry, not non-GMO, the gluten-free recipe mixes and we have got a great incremental response to that and we expect the same for the organic recipe mixes.","Alexia Howard","Great, thank you very much. And I will pass it on.","Joyce Brooks","Thank you.","Lawrence Kurzius","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Ken Goldman with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your questions.","Tom Palmer","Good morning. It\u2019s Tom Palmer on for Ken. Thanks for taking my questions.","Joyce Brooks","Hey, Tom.","Lawrence Kurzius","Hey, Tom. Good morning.","Tom Palmer","From an innovation standpoint, where are we with the rollout of non-GMO and organic products? Are you still on track to reach targets of 70% non-GMO by late this year or 80% gourmet line organic? And maybe you could comment on customer reception and maybe the incremental pricing power you are seeing in these products. So, when you add the non-GMO label to spices, are you able to drive a little bit of incremental margin?","Lawrence Kurzius","Hey, Tom. I am glad to give an update on that and probably we should have built that into our prepared remarks. First of all, on the conversion of our gourmet to organic, that is continuing on pace. We set a goal of having 80% of our gourmet sales organic by the end of the year. We still expect to achieve that. I will say that the conversion of organic has been more challenging for us than perhaps we anticipated. The supply chain and the kind of quality controls that we insist on in terms of product supply has been harder for us to develop. It\u2019s just a less mature supply chain out there. And we have gotten such a lift from the conversion to organic that the volume has been higher than we initially anticipated, which has slowed the transition just because it\u2019s just that much more pressure on an immature supply chain. For the non-GMO conversion, that really was more about us calling out what we already do. And so that one has gone quite a pace and actually I would characterize that one as really running ahead of \u2013 little bit ahead of pace, little bit ahead of the pace that we had anticipated. We are not really looking at either one of these as opportunities to take more pricing. Both of these moves were done to give greater transparency to the consumer, to continue to differentiate McCormick versus competition, to frankly take credit for all that we do in terms of quality and purity of product, much in line with the communication we are giving to consumers in our purity advertising campaign. We also did this in part to take away some of the reason for being for other competitive brands and some of the smaller brands in the store have gotten in because they have made claims like this and we wanted to take away the reason for being for those smaller brands as well as we thought to rebuild our share position. Gordon and Mike, you want to comment on this?","Mike Smith","I think your pricing question, I mean some of these organic supplies do cost a little bit more, but we consider that when we did our U.S. consumer pricing increase this year, our surgical pricing, so we have that covered.","Tom Palmer","Okay, thank you for the detail. And just a quick modeling question you highlighted $5 million in acquisition-related costs on a year-over-year assuming no additional M&A activity, would this cost be non-recurring starting in the third quarter or might we anticipate some carryover?","Gordon Stetz","Yes. I mean, this cost as we have said in the remarks is specifically attached to the activity we had around the Premier Foods that we were approaching. So, obviously that doesn\u2019t occur every quarter. And to the extent that we don\u2019t have that size or that type of an activity, we would not expect that to recur. We always have pipeline activity and year-to-year, those costs are fairly similar. You know we closed the Gourmet Garden activity in the second quarter, we had cost associated with that. But we also had cost in the prior year. So, the $5 million incremental is something that I would characterize as somewhat unique given the nature of that deal and the size of that deal.","Tom Palmer","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Chris Growe with Stifel. Please proceed with your questions.","Chris Growe","Hi, good morning.","Lawrence Kurzius","Good morning, Chris.","Chris Growe","Good morning. I just wanted to ask two questions, if I could. The first one would be that you are calling out more CCI cost savings and as we think about sort of outlets for that incremental cost savings, one of the obvious ones is marketing. With marketing, you are kind of keeping in place. So, a nice increase for the year, but you haven\u2019t raised those expectations. I was just trying to think about how those incremental savings benefit you. Are you reinvesting those in some way? Are they going to help \u2013 could they help provide stronger EPS growth? How should we think about those incremental savings coming through?","Gordon Stetz","Well, I think, this is Gordon, Chris, I think certainly part of our confidence in indicating the upper end of our range is in both gross margin and the EPS is a function of our confidence in seeing these CCI benefits come through. They partially gone to absorb the incremental acquisition cost that I just described. We talked about $5 million in the first quarter \u2013 I mean in the second quarter, but we had probably another additional $1 million in the first quarter as well. So, part of it has gone towards absorbing the incremental cost associated with that deal I referenced earlier. But it certainly has given us greater confidence in our outlook for the year. Hence, we are expressing confidence on the upper end of the ranges.","Chris Growe","Okay. Yes, that\u2019s helpful. So just really more flexibility, I guess. And then the other question I had was in relation to pricing overall. You mentioned like some incremental pricing in Canada. Is pricing in place now were you expected it? And there was a little bit of a slowdown sequentially in volume. Is that \u2013 have we seen kind of the elasticity effects in relation to that pricing? Is that pretty well embedded now in the volume performance in the quarter?","Lawrence Kurzius","The major pricing actions that we anticipated taking this year are all in place, Chris. So, we don\u2019t have any broad scale price increase activity. There are a couple of specific items where there is some cost pressure and were some unique, very targeted pricing actions are planned, but I would not expect that to be \u2013 it\u2019s not going to be something we are going to be talking about particularly.","Chris Growe","And were you comfortable with the volume effects to that pricing, Lawrence? Was that \u2013 it did weaken a little bit sequentially, but have you seen a pretty normal level of elasticity in relation to that pricing?","Lawrence Kurzius","Actually, for \u2013 let me differentiate between the U.S. and Canada. Canada, we had to take quite substantial price increases just reflecting the change in cost and change in currency value. And so that we have seen an elasticity impact there and that was what we were, what I was calling out in the answer to that first question that David Driscoll had. But in our U.S. business, the price action that we took was quite surgical. We had a good understanding of elasticity. Our anticipation was that we would see minimal impact on volume from it and in fact that has been the case. We really don\u2019t see any kind of volume detriment in our U.S. business. I think if you look at our unit off-take data versus our dollar off-take, the units were doing better than we are on dollars. We did take pricing, but we have also worked with retailers on category pricing recommendations, that to a great extent, has mitigated that.","Chris Growe","Okay. Thank you for the time and good luck Gordon. Wish you all the best.","Gordon Stetz","Thank you.","Chris Growe","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Jonathan Feeney with Consumer Edge Research. Please proceed with your question.","Jonathan Feeney","Good morning. Thanks very much. And I ordinarily don\u2019t like to get into it, but Gordon, man, it\u2019s been forever. Congratulations and you had a great career. I have loved working with you and Mike look forward to working with you very much. Just one question, I spent some time at FMI last week talking to a lot of different people and one of the things that came up is this decline in loyal brand users. And it\u2019s funny, it seems like food companies of all shapes and sizes are working harder to get \u2013 they are actually having success, they are telling the truth about that, doing a great job getting new customers, they just have a hard time generating repeat among all customers at least versus where we were 5 years ago, it seems like your business, at least in North America, maybe a little bit different and able to hang on to loyal customers maybe a little bit better and maybe explain some of the better results, if you could kind of comment about how that \u2013 how you think about that, do you see that trend and is \u2013 how the McCormick portfolio is better or worse than what\u2019s going on broadly in the industry? Thanks.","Lawrence Kurzius","Hey, Jonathan. First of all, good morning, I think we didn\u2019t say hello when you got on there. It\u2019s an interesting question. I think that McCormick is really advantaged in this area. There are a lot of reasons for consumers to both have their heads and their hearts behind the McCormick brand. There are good rational reasons why our product is better and it\u2019s the story that we are telling to consumers. But there is also real heart reason. And so, we are \u2013 I am not sure that we are seeing the same kind of erosion of loyalty that perhaps some of the other food companies might be talking about. I think also, our brands are and our product \u2013 really our category is in line with the way consumers want to eat today. And as consumers cook at home more and are more ambitious about the things that they cook, our brand is a big beneficiary of that. I think that we have a bit of a natural tailwind from two sources. One is the new dietary guidelines news that came out this year. That has really encouraged consumers to make greater use of herbs and spices. That\u2019s a positive for our category, but as the leader in the category, we are a very big beneficiary of that. And then the second thing is that we actually do better with Millennials than we do with boomers. And so as Millenials come to be a bigger part of the shopper universe, that is actually a natural tailwind for us, which is different than some of our food company peers.","Jonathan Feeney","Thank you. That\u2019s very helpful.","Lawrence Kurzius","Thanks Jonathan.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Brett Hundley from BB&T. Please proceed with your questions.","Brett Hundley","Hey. Thank you. Good morning everyone.","Lawrence Kurzius","Good morning Brett.","Brett Hundley","Thanks for taking my questions. Gordon and Mike let me just offer my congratulations to you both as well. I just had two questions for you guys today. One, I just wanted to revisit raw materials real quick. Gordon, you kind of reiterated your expectations for low single-digit increases in raw material inflation this year, I am curious if we can maybe get inside that a little bit and maybe there has been a move down from \u2013 maybe there was a plus two to three to a plus one now, but just curious kind of given a slight move down in pepper, black pepper, I don\u2019t know where exactly were your strategic reserves were, but just curious now if you would think that your net pricing actions are really in a place to fully offset expected raw material inflation as opposed to I think earlier in the year where you were kind of calling that pricing as somewhat of an offset, just wanted to get additional color from you there?","Mike Smith","Hey Brett, this is Mike. We haven\u2019t moved off our guidance for the year. I mean there has been, with the thousands of different raw materials we have, some things are up and some things are down. We put the pricing in place, I am talking about you U.S. consumer here, to offset that at the beginning of the year, but low to mid single-digit inflation is what we are calling for the year and we are sticking to that and the pricing actions, as Lawrence said, have been put in place. So it\u2019s just a variety of moving parts, but our \u2013 we have a great procurement team and we have strategic supplies for some of these things as we make buys during the year and we feel good about where we are.","Brett Hundley","Okay. I appreciate that. And then just lastly Lawrence, I thought it was interesting that you brought up accelerated growth trends on the industrial side, I think you called out a move towards natural, a move towards non-GMO and certainly in our own ingredients coverage, we hear instances of industrial customers looking to replace or reduce sugar or replace or reduce sodium and I am curious if you guys kind of fit into that role nicely as well with some of the products that you offer, but really I wanted to come back to maybe exploring the type of growth or the type of lift that you could be seeing recently from this accelerated move and how it trickles down to really helped your margin profile? Thank you.","Lawrence Kurzius","Sure, I will take the \u2013 I will start with this and maybe Gordon and Mike can pick up on the margin side of it. But about 40% of the briefs that we do for our industrial customers have some sort of health and wellness aspect to them and that\u2019s actually been the case for several years now. All of the TPG companies are trying to improve their portfolios with cleaner labels, healthier sounding ingredients, statements. No one wants to have a flavor in there that they have to call a flavor. And many of the \u2013 of our consumer products go to customers, we are trying to reduce sodium, reduce MSG, take out sugar. And so, that\u2019s about 40% of our briefs globally. It\u2019s a higher percentage in the U.S. And so we believe that we fit right in. It\u2019s a bit of a sweet spot for us. I mean part of the unique selling proposition that we take to our industrial customers is that we are not a chemical company, we are a food company. We approach their problems from a food and culinary perspective and that\u2019s where we start. We offer unique, technical solutions that are very competitive. We have an increasing portfolio ourselves of proprietary technologies to solve their problems and this we believe is an important part of our long-term growth story.","Mike Smith","And from a margin perspective, generally, when we engineer new products or reengineer products, we have pretty good margins. We get cost optimized later as we know as the product becomes successful, but we are really happy with the margins we can get on this new business.","Brett Hundley","Okay. Thanks so much.","Joyce Brooks","Thanks Brett.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your questions.","Robert Moskow","Hi. All of my questions have been answered, I just wanted to...","Lawrence Kurzius","Hi, Rob.","Robert Moskow","But thank you Gordon for all the years of helping everything, Mike looking forward to working with you more. I guess one question, your growth in U.S. retail has really taken off here, the category has taken off, I don\u2019t know if you talked more about incremental merchandising that you might be getting, is that a big driver, are you gaining shelf space outside of the traditional spice rack or is the spice rack kind of the area itself getting bigger at all, is that helping at all, too?","Lawrence Kurzius","I think that we are improving the assortment in the price \u2013 and in the main spice section, we are, if anything actually kind of reducing assortment outside of that area. That reduction is coming at the expense of other brands. But \u2013 and I don\u2019t really see a material change in the merchandising. If anything, I think we may be doing a better job on quality of merchandising, but there is not any kind of meaningful increment in merchandising activity. Really, the growth is being driven by the consumer. We have got a great message for the consumer, both for the category and for our brand. And there is a lot \u2013 for the category, there is this strong interest in cooking from scratch and flavorful healthy eating that that does benefit the category. And for ourselves, I believe that the moves that we have made to improve the appeal of our brand to consumers, particularly younger consumers and the stronger marketing messaging that we are doing on the A side of the marketing support versus the P side, both through traditional media and through digital media, that\u2019s really paying off for us and a great innovation program that\u2019s brought new news to the category as well. And in particular, with some of the recent activity, we are working to get our own brands a stronger presence in the perimeter of the store, particularly over in produce and again I think that, that\u2019s going to be a benefit for us.","Robert Moskow","Okay. Let me ask one follow-up, Lawrence. You gave your criteria on acquisitions here. How big is the pipeline of large opportunities for you now that Premier has kind of gone away? Like are there several large ideas that you might consider or is the opportunities much more bolt-on?","Lawrence Kurzius","I don\u2019t want to get too specific on that, but I will say that, that we have \u2013 we have got a robust pipeline of opportunities and targets. As you would expect, we are always in dialogue with somebody or multiple somebody, but there is no \u2013 but I really can\u2019t comment specifically on \u2013 I don\u2019t want to get too specific on that. I would say that there are plenty of opportunities for us out there.","Robert Moskow","Okay. Thanks, again. Bye-bye.","Lawrence Kurzius","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Mario Contreras with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Mario Contreras","Good morning.","Lawrence Kurzius","Good morning, Mario.","Mario Contreras","I just wanted to follow-up on the increased confidence around the high end of the guidance range. So year-to-date, first couple of quarters, your EPS growth has been more in the low to mid single-digit range. Back half would be implying closer to double-digits. I know you have mentioned the incremental CCI savings that will be coming through, but you do have some additional advertising spending coming through. You are exiting the JV. There was the industrial customer that\u2019s diversifying. So, I just wanted to drill down a little bit more on what is giving you the increased confidence that you can see that type of growth in the back half? Thanks.","Mike Smith","Well, certainly the underlying business we see is performing quite well. So, that\u2019s one of it, the CCI you just mentioned. I would point to just from a math perspective, the tax rate was biggest headwind in the first part of the year. And we have pretty much gone through that. So, the back half of the year, the tax rates will be more comparable to the prior year. So, the strength that you see on that operating income line growth is what will be driving a lot of it. Obviously, to that incremental marketing spend is \u2013 about half of it was in the first part of the year, that\u2019s impacting smaller quarters. As you go into the bigger quarters in the back half of the year, it doesn\u2019t have as much of an impact, because just by virtue of the size of the quarters that are starting to come, it will not as have as much of a negative impact on the growth rate, because it\u2019s the same absolute dollars we are talking about. So, I just point to strength of the business, CCI, tax comparison and the relative size of A&P as it relates to the size of the quarters in the back half of the year.","Lawrence Kurzius","And absorbing the incremental acquisition-related\u2026.","Gordon Stetz","And that\u2019s a very good point. And we absorbed the incremental acquisition cost in the first part of this year as we mentioned earlier.","Mario Contreras","Okay. And then I guess maybe just following up on that, I am just a little bit curious why you don\u2019t break that down as sort of one-time item or something that would be excluded from the EPS that you give on a non-GAAP adjusted basis?","Gordon Stetz","We are very \u2013 we have acquisition activity all the time. The one that we described earlier I would say is as unique as those of you have followed us. I would also say we are very cognizant of the financial reporting requirements as required by the SEC and there has been certain amount of guidelines put out recently. So, we certainly honor that and respect that.","Mario Contreras","Okay, thanks everyone.","Joyce Brooks","Thanks, Mario.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from the line of Erin Lash with Morningstar. Please proceed with your questions.","Erin Lash","Good morning. Thank you for taking my question.","Joyce Brooks","Hi, Erin.","Erin Lash","Hi. I just wanted to start, I think on Slide 7 you mentioned, I know there has been a lot of discussion in the call about pricing specifically within the U.S. consumer business, but you mentioned a point about certain retailers lowering price points on the McCormick brand and I wondered if you could give some additional details surrounding that if it was related to the push for some of those economy brands by those particular retailers a year ago or what I guess more contact surrounding that point?","Lawrence Kurzius","Sure. This has been an ongoing program that we have been talking about on calls and in conferences for the last 2 years really as we have evolved our analytic capabilities and understanding of price elasticity and worked with retailers on modeling the category in a way that really optimizes the profitability of the category for them. And as it generally works out what optimizes the category for the retailer tends to be a good news for the McCormick brand as well. So, we have been adding tools that allow us to give greater and greater precision and give fact and database guidance to retailers on pricing decisions for the category as a whole and assortment decisions for the category as a whole. Those recommendations include, in many cases, lowering the price points on McCormick brand products. Sometimes that includes our recommendations about changes in the price points for their private label, for economy brands and for other brands in the category where they may have some irrational pricing that\u2019s happening in the store or where they may have pricing that they don\u2019t even know about, because there maybe a rack of spices in another department of the store that the spice category buyer doesn\u2019t even have visibility to. And category profitability is leaking out through that backdoor. So, we have made those kinds of recommendations. And those retailers who have accepted those recommendations have tended to outperform the category and we have outperformed \u2013 and we have definitely gained share in the cases where those retailers have taken our recommendations. I think in our remarks though we may have \u2013 I don\u2019t know if we included it in our remarks, but with retailers who have taken our recommendations, I think in the first quarter, we reported that we have gained about 60 basis points of share. We can now track that to 120 basis points of share gain in those retailers who have accepted our recommendations and that set is becoming a bigger and bigger set of retailers. One of the ways that bleeds through in the syndicated data is that our unit share growth has been stronger than the category where our dollar share of growth is tracking slightly behind of the category. That\u2019s really reflecting that shifting at the retail price points.","Erin Lash","Thank you. That\u2019s very, very helpful. I just had one follow-up. I realized it\u2019s small, but you mentioned about exiting the JV in South Africa and I just wanted to get some additional insights into whether that is potentially a reflection of I guess different market dynamics than maybe what you had anticipated before or whether that was more reflective of the quality of the JV partner. Any insight you can provide will be very helpful.","Lawrence Kurzius","Actually, we have got two businesses in South Africa. We have a fully consolidated industrial business. That\u2019s an ongoing business that we are continuing with. We do have a JV in South Africa with a specific customer. That JV is almost captive supplying almost 100% of its volume to our JV partner. We had a 10-year supply contract that is coming to an end. And so as part of concluding that, we are working with them to wrap up that JV. So, it\u2019s not really a reflection on the market. It\u2019s really very specific to that one relationship.","Mike Smith","And for clarity around the accounting treatment, it is a consolidated joint venture because of the operating control nature of it. So, it is impacting the consolidated sales results.","Erin Lash","Thank you. That\u2019s very helpful. And I just wanted to add my congratulations, Gordon. It\u2019s been great working with you. And Mike, I look forward to working with you more over the coming years. Thank you.","Mike Smith","Thank you. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you.

Reconciliations to the GAAP results are included in this morning's press release and slides.","In our comments, certain percentages are rounded. Please refer to our presentation which includes the complete information. As a reminder, today's presentation contains projections and other forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those projected. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements whether because of new information, future events or other factors. As seen on slide two, our forward-looking statements also provide information on Risk Factors that could affect our financial results.","It is now my pleasure to turn the discussion over to Lawrence.","Lawrence Kurzius","Thank you, Kasey. Good morning everyone. Thanks for joining us. With our strong second quarter and first-half results, we are confident we are well-positioned to deliver strong results in 2018. Our successful execution of our strategies and engagement of employees around the world have driven strong double-digit sales, operating profit and EPS growth as well as significant operating margin expansion across both segments in both the second quarter and year-to-date.","Starting on page four. We have a broad and advantaged global flavor portfolio which is continuing to drive growth. Among the second quarter highlights across our portfolio, we grew our underlying business in our consumer segment, particularly in the Americas and China. In our flavor solutions segment, we continued to make progress on expanding our portfolio with additional growth in flavors, particularly in savory this quarter, while pruning some low margin business, and we are driving strong broad-based growth in our branded foodservice business. The reshaping of our flavor solutions portfolio is a significant driver of operating margin expansion.","In addition to the solid growth on our core business, we are pleased with the Frank's and French's performance and their positive impact on our portfolio of condiments and sauces and branded foodservice. Overall, we are confident that the breadth and reach of our portfolio continues to position us to fully meet the demand for flavor around the world and grow our business.","Now let me go into more detail on our second quarter performance on slide five as well as provide some business comments before turning it over to Mike, who will go in more depth on the quarter-end results and discuss our 2018 financial guidance. Starting with our topline for the second quarter, we grew sales 19% and in constant currency grew 16% for the total company. This was driven by strong results from both segments led by the Americas. Base business growth, new products and acquisitions, our three drivers of long-term sales growth, were all contributing factors. Incremental sales from our acquired Frank's and French's brands contributed 13%.","In our consumer segment, we grew sales 16% in constant currency and in the flavor solutions segment we grew sales 15% in constant currency. The growth of both segments was led by incremental Frank's and French's sales, which contributed 14% to our consumer segment and 12% to our flavor solutions segment. In addition to our topline growth, our focus on profit realization drove additional adjusted operating income growth and adjusted operating margin expansion with our higher sales, cost savings led by our comprehensive continuous improvement program, CCI and our portfolio shift to more value-added products, including the addition of Frank's and French's, we grew second quarter's adjusted operating income 48% in constant currency and our adjusted operating income margin expanded 330 basis points. Both segments contributed double-digit adjusted operating income growth and a triple digit basis point expansion in adjusted operating margin. We are achieving the margin accretion we expected from the Frank's and French's portfolio and equally as important we are driving significant margin expansion in our core business led by CCI as well as a shift in our portfolio to more value-added products.","At the bottom line, our second quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.02 was 24% higher than the $0.82 in the second quarter of 2017. Our strong growth in adjusted operating income drove this increase partially offset by higher interest expense from debt related to the RB Foods acquisition as well as higher shares outstanding. Our strong results are in line with our expectations and with the increased guidance we provided last quarter and our outlook for 2018 performance remains strong.","I would like to turn now to some business updates. I will begin with highlights from our consumer and flavor solutions segments and follow with a fairly deep look at our Frank's and French's portfolio. In the consumer segment, as seen on slide six, we grew sales nearly 16% in constant currency with incremental sales from Frank's and French's contributing 14% and our base business and new product growth contributing 2% driven by the U.S. and China. In the Americas, growth was particularly strong driven by the large impact of Frank's and French's, which contributed 20% growth. Our underlying Americas business grew 2% on both pricing and higher volume and mix.","In U.S. spices and seasonings, our IRI data indicates scanner sales through grocery channels grew for the category at 4% and McCormick branded at 3%. Both the category and to a greater extent our consumption was impacted by a slow start to the grilling season driven by cold and wet weather. While we had strong growth in other parts of the portfolio, such as branded recipe mixes, partially due to this cold and wet weather, it did have an unfavorable impact on overall sales.","Outside of grocery, we continue to be impacted by a large retailer's decision to convert a control label to private label, along with related promotional and merchandising actions which we have discussed on previous earnings calls reducing McCormick's measured multi-outlet sales growth to 1%. While this decision hurt our branded spices and seasoning share performance, it drove growth in our private label sales. We again had solid branded growth in grocery and growth in unmeasured channels including club, e-commerce, and Hispanic markets. The environment remains dynamic and we continue to work with our customers to optimize category performance. Overall we continue to see good growth in our spice and seasonings brands in the U.S. market and remain confident the initiatives we have underway position us to continue our trajectory of long-term growth.","In Europe, Middle East and Africa, the EMEA region, growth was led by France. Year-to-date, France's broad-based growth across both branded and private label has driven this region's growth. In the Asia-Pacific region, our strong sales in China led the consumer segment growth driven by continued share gains on core products as well as e-commerce growth. China's direct-to-consumer storefront on Tmall continues to gain momentum since its launch earlier this year. It is already ranked in the top 15% of food [ph] category at Tmall stores.","Our confidence for our consumer segments growth for the second half of 2018 is bolstered by a strong America summer grilling, fall and holiday season with the combined McCormick's and Frank's and French's promotional and merchandising programs, as well as a significant increase in brand marketing, Frank's and French's continued momentum and actions I will mention in my update on that portfolio in a few minutes. Americas new distribution gains secured in spices and seasonings and the full impact of pricing actions effective late in the second quarter, new product growth in the EMEA plus our launch of our first choice brand renovation initiative in addition to significant brand marketing increases related to new products, advertising, and product superiority. And importantly, our products remain well aligned and on-trend with consumer demand for flavorful, healthy eating.","Turning now to the flavor solutions segment. We grew sales 15% in constant currency in the second quarter with incremental sales from the Frank's and French's portfolio contributing 12%. In the Americas, constant currency sales growth of 22% was led by 17% from Frank's and French's, 5% growth was driven by strong momentum on flavor and seasoning sales and branded foodservice. Branded foodservice sales growth was broad-based driven by increased distribution with national and regional customers, promotional activity with operators, and expansion in emerging channels. And within flavors, our most significant growth was in on-trend savory flavors where we have been winning with existing business as well as with new products and new customers.","In our EMEA and Asia-Pacific regions, we continue to win with our customers through new products and promotional activities and particularly with quick service restaurants. We are continuing to refine and optimize our portfolio, increasing our sales of higher margin flavor business and exiting lower margin business. Across our flavor solutions segment, the migration of our portfolio to more technically insulated and value-added categories will continue in 2018. We have again realized further results against this strategy in our second quarter with flavor sales up double digits in North America.","Beyond our strategies to drive sales growth, we will continue to focus on profit realization as is again evident in our second quarter results. Our confidence for our flavor solutions segments growth for the second half of 2018 is bolstered by strong momentum of our flavor growth, particularly in on-trend areas and new product and new customer wins driven by our expertise in clean label and culinary approach, Frank's and French's continued momentum and actions I will discuss in a few moments, growth in branded foodservice driven by expanded distribution and increased marketing activity and customer promotions and wins with quick service restaurant customers through new products and promotional activities.","Let's move now from our strong core business results and onto our Frank's and French's portfolio, starting on slide eight. We are pleased with our progress so far and with the results from the Frank's and French's portfolio. With the acquisition and integration complete, we are excited about the impact we are having on these brands and the growth plans we are continuing to successfully execute against. I would like to share now some updates our progress, starting with our North American consumer business. We are successfully growing these brands through strengthening distribution, by leveraging the scale and capabilities of our newly organized sales force, particularly in category management, as well as applying our strength in emerging channels.","Starting with the performance of Frank's. As of the end of May, our Fix the Mix initiatives, which focuses on having the right assortment of flavors and sizes on shelf to drive velocity has increased our U.S. total distribution points of original RedHot and Buffalo by 7% and 12%, respectively and we are increasing Frank's share distribution on shelf. One example of how we are driving the increase is through the addition of original RedHot small and large bottle sizes at a significant retailer. These sizes are underdeveloped in the market and are critical for building trials and providing a value offering.","An another example, through our investment in a new smaller case pack for recent Frank's line extensions, we were awarded more space at a significant retailer as it allowed a more efficient placement on shelf. These wins drive both our branded and overall category sales growth. We are just beginning to see the benefits of the additional sizes come through the consumption data. From a regional perspective, we have worked with retailers in areas where Frank's is not the market leader and as of the end of May increased our total distribution points in the West by 8% and Midsouth by 7%. These distribution gains on Frank's RedHot sauce and Buffalo sauce create a foundation for growth.","Turning to French's mustard. We are seeing success in our initial category management efforts. We are convincing retailers to remove duplicative secondary brands as they work to maximize the efficiency of their shelf space. Our analyses have been well received and retailers, including several large ones, are beginning to implement our recommendations, eliminating lower ranking yellow mustard brands and expanding the share of shelf for French's and their store brand. As we said before, mustard will take a while to turn around but we are pleased with the progress we have made thus far to influence the fundamentals on shelf. After years of declining distribution, we have stabilized overall points of distribution year-to-date and expect to lap the losses we inherited in the second half.","We still have many key objectives yet to implement in our category management efforts and continue to dedicate resources and increase capabilities related to mustard category management. We are confident our ongoing focus in this area is driving results. We are also focused on accelerating growth in unmeasured channels and are establishing these brands with early success. While off a small base, we have already realized double-digit growth in this area, including increasing the e-commerce availability of Frank's and French's. While influencing distribution share of shelf and channel participation is a continuous effort, we are pleased with our progress so far. We are in the early stages and have robust plans to further leverage our scale and capabilities to deliver growth.","We are also excited about being able to drive stronger promotion and merchandising performance by combining the strength of our entire portfolio. Our first opportunity to leverage increased promotional scale is through the launch of our summer grilling event. U.S. grilling season begins with Memorial Day and heightens during the summer months. This year the grilling season was delayed due to a rainy and cold spring in broad parts of the country. Despite this, we experienced solid May consumption growth across our grilling portfolio including Frank's, French's, Stubb's, Grill Mates and Lawry's products. The summer grilling season has just gotten started and we have planned substantial increases in third quarter grilling promotions and display pallets to drive growth across the portfolio.","For the combined Frank's and French's portfolio, this was the best start to summer grilling since 2014 and we are seeing the same if not better performance in Canada where grilling is off to a strong start. We are winning with increased merchandising displays across large retailers. As an example, at one large Canadian retailer consumption of French's was up 79% versus last year's second quarter, driven by an unprecedented level of display. With the same retailer, we also launched a promotional grilling kit to meet grilling flavor needs of the consumer.","The kit combines Canada's classic La Grille Montr\u00e9al steak seasoning with Frank's hot sauce, French's mustard and ketchup as well as Stubb's barbecue sauce and new La Grille products for trial. The promotional kit sold out in less than one week. We have also begun to drive an innovation agenda on Frank's and French's. To date, we have launched new SKUs in seasoning and dip mixes and retailer interest and acceptance has exceeded our expectations. As I mentioned it CAGNY, there is an exciting longer term pipeline of new concepts developing and I look forward to sharing details of innovation news in the coming months as we launch these products.","We are planning increased marketing support against Frank's and French's, which will be more significant in the second half of 2018 than in the first half. We are just starting to launch new messaging and support for the brands. In April, Canada was our first location to launch a new television commercial with their Do You French? campaign for mustard and ketchup. The commercial received breakthrough scores in consumer testing. In the third quarter, we are launching the first dedicated mustard campaign in the U.S. in three years. This campaign actually kicked off this week. And for Frank's, we are significantly increasing working media in the second half and will be running a U.S. national television ad for the first time in seven years.","To date, we have dramatically improved social media engagement by 115% and an exponential increase in online content. For example, our McCormick culinary experts have already created 100 new recipes for mustard usage which we are already promoting across our robust digital platforms, including 15 how-to videos. Wrapping up North America consumer for Frank's and French's, performance in these categories is robust and we are very happy with our results.","Next, I am excited share some Frank's and French's updates related to our North American flavor solutions business on slide nine. Our combination of complementary strengths of the McCormick and RB Foods foodservice sales organizations and strengthened our go-to-market model in the North America's flavor solutions business and is enabling us to leverage our full portfolio across operators. Our new scale has created strong momentum within foodservice and over the past months we have had successes in key areas. We are pleased with our progress on increasing penetration with national and regional chain accounts.","Through May, we have incremental sales to over 19,000 new restaurant locations, including to more than 10 large national accounts, as well as regional accounts. In addition, we are also gaining momentum with securing and converting local restaurant operations. Deeper penetration across restaurants also includes an increased menu participation and front of house presence. Our successes on menu items have included permanent additions as well as limited time offers and include products across our full portfolio. As an example, we have partnered with a Canadian quick service restaurant to launch a menu item including our Montr\u00e9al steak, Cattlemen's BBQ and French's crispy products. We have also secured menu mentions in both restaurant on-site and television media campaign to build brand awareness with the end consumer through foodservice.","Our efforts in increasing front of house presence are not limited to restaurants but cover the full spectrum of the foodservice industry, including business cafeterias, sports venues and lodging. Examples of our early successes include double-digit increases of French's mustard dispenser placements and mid single-digit sales increase across our portfolio of Frank's, French's, OLD BAY and McCormick's Tabletop items. Enabled by our new scale across our commercial teams, we are successfully cross-selling our culinary line McCormick For Chefs and Frank's and French's foodservice items into restaurants.","Our foodservice promotional activities are also driving results. With Frank's, we have doubled the operator participation in the King of Wings program anchored in the February and March sports season. We are planning to capitalize in this success and increase Frank's awareness during another high wing consumption period, the beginning of football season by offering King of Wings for the first time in the fall. Further, for North American flavor solutions we are leveraging our product superiority to drive differentiation. Products like our Cattlemen's BBQ sauces provide superior performance and therefore tangible benefits to operators such as the more natural appearance, thicker consistency and better overall application on product. We have strengthened our marketing and selling materials to more prominently emphasize these functional differences and have started leveraging them in our sales efforts.","Turning to the international markets on slide 10. We are progressing on integrating the Frank's and French's portfolio into our global network. We are continuing to apply discipline to establish the proper foundation to manage the brand globally, for example, ensuring proper product registration, trademarks and labels. We are also building a more professional presence in the market with a more sophisticated and optimized network and country specific labeling where applicable to enable stronger growth. We have transferred nearly 50 distributors from RB Foods management to McCormick and we have also added new distributors in 14 countries. We are also converting McCormick direct infrastructure where we have scale.","As an example in Mexico, we are already utilizing the infrastructure of our joint venture partner. We have established a comarketing program with a leading food company specializing in protein to drive awareness and trial of Frank's. The program is targeting the millennial consumer social eating occasions such as at University's, concerts and sporting events to enjoy wings and other snacks. Overall, we are progressing as we plan to grow these brands and are excited about the momentum we are carrying into the second half of 2018. Now that the integration is behind us, we are even more confident that the combination of our powerful flavor brands will drive significant shareholder value.","Mike is now going to provide more details on the financial results for the quarter and on our financial guidance. Before I turn it over to him, let me provide a few summary comments on slide 11. At the foundation of our sales growth is the rising consumer demand for flavor. We are aligned with the consumer's increased interest in bolder flavors, demand for convenience and focus on fresh natural ingredients as well as with emerging purchase drivers such as greater transparency around the sourcing and quality of food.","With this increased interest, flavor continues to be an advantaged global category which combined with our execution against effective strategies will drive strong results as we go through the year. We are balancing our resources and efforts to drive sales with our work to lower costs to build fuel for growth and higher margins. Our second quarter financial results across both our consumer and flavor solutions segments are strong. We have confidence in our fiscal year outlook and are well-positioned to deliver another strong year in 2018. Around the world, McCormick employees are driving momentum and success and I thank them for their efforts and engagement.","Thank you for your attention and it is now my pleasure to turn it over Mike. Mike?","Mike Smith","Thanks Lawrence and good morning everyone. As Lawrence indicated, we delivered strong growth with our second quarter results. I will begin with a discussion of our results and then follow with comments on our current full year 2018 financial outlook. As seen on slide 13, we grew sales 19% and in constant currency 16%. Acquisitions, pricing and higher volume and product mix each contributed to the increase. Both our consumer and flavor solutions segments delivered strong topline growth driven primarily by the Americas. In addition, we have delivered significant increases in adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share as well as significant operating margin expansion. The consumer segment grew sales 16% in constant currency. Our acquisition of the Frank's and French's portfolio contributed 14% of the sales growth.","On slide 14, consumer segment sales in the Americas rose 22% in constant currency versus the second quarter of 2017, with 20% of the increase from Frank's and French's incremental sales. The remaining increase was driven by both pricing and higher volume and product mix. Pricing included some incremental impact of 2017 pricing actions as well as actions taken late during the second quarter of 2018. While the colder weather impacted the start to the grilling season, as Lawrence mentioned, it drove volume growth in items such as branded recipe mixes.","EMEA consumer sales increased 2% in constant currency driven by sales of Frank's and French's, as well as growth in France led by private label. Partially offsetting these increases was an impact from trade payments to expand distribution in the U.K. We grew consumer sales in the Asia-Pacific region 7% in constant currency led by China base business growth in herbs and spices, ketchup and bouillon.","For the consumer segment in total, we grew adjusted operating income 44% to $131 million. In constant currency, adjusted operating income rose 40% from the year-ago period. The impact of sales growth and cost savings more than offset increases in brand marketing and freight costs. We expanded our consumer adjusted operating margin compared to the second quarter of last year by 280 basis points.","Turning to our flavor solutions segment in slide 18, starting with sales growth. We grew constant currency sales 15%. Our acquisition of the Frank's and French's portfolio contributed 12% of the sales growth. The remaining growth was driven by both the base business and new products, offset partially by pricing actions across all regions related to the pass-through of certain commodity cost declines in our ingredients business as well as the elimination of some low-margin business. In the Americas, flavor solutions sales increased 22% in constant currency, including a 17% contribution from Frank's and French's and a 5% increase from the base business and new products.","This base of new product increase was led by seasonings and branded foodservice sales as well as double-digit growth in savory flavors. It was partially offset by a decline in ingredient sales, attributable to both pricing and the elimination of some low-margin business as well as the global realignment of a major customer sales from the Americas to EMEA. We grew flavor solutions sales in EMEA 3% in constant currency with Frank's and French's contributing 1%. The remaining sales growth was driven by volume and product mix, which included a favorable impact from the global realignment of a major customer sales from the Americas to EMEA, as previously mentioned.","Partially offsetting the volume and product mix growth was a decline due to pricing and the timing of customer promotional activity. In the Asia-Pacific region, flavor solutions sales were down 2% in constant currency, driven by the exit of low-margin business in the region as well as commodity cost declines passed through in pricing. New product sales to quick service restaurants in China partially offset these declines.","As shown on slide 22, adjusted operating income for the flavor solutions segment ended the quarter up 67% at $77 million with a 3% favorable impact from currency. The increase was driven by favorable impact of higher sales, a shift to more value-added products and the impact of our CCI program. These impacts more than offset increases in brand marketing and freight costs and led to a 420 basis point expansion of adjusted operating margin compared to last year. Across both segments, adjusted operating income, which excludes the integration costs related to RB Foods and special charges, rose 51% in the second quarter from the year-ago period and in constant currency by 48%. This increase includes the impact of increasing our brand marketing in the second quarter. As Lawrence mentioned, our focus on profit realization and the reshaping of our portfolio has driven significant margin expansion.","As seen on slide 24, in the second quarter, we increased gross profit margin 340 basis points year-on-year. While this expansion includes an accretion impact from the addition of the Frank's and French's portfolio, the core business was also a significant driver of the margin growth. Our portfolio shift to more value-added products and CCI-led cost savings continued to drive across profit expansion across both our segments.","Our selling, general and administrative expense, as a percentage of net sales, increased by 10 basis points from the second quarter of 2017. Leverage from sales growth as well as CCI-led cost savings were more than offset by significant increases in distribution expense, driven by freight. The net impact of the gross margin expansion and the SG&A increase resulted in an adjusted operating margin expansion of 330 basis points from the second quarter of 2017. Below the operating income line, interest expense increased $29 million in the second quarter from the year-ago period, primarily driven by the debt secured for the RB Foods financing.","Turning to income taxes on slide 25. Our second quarter adjusted effective tax rate was 22.2% as compared to 23.1% in the year-ago period, which included a favorable impact from a lower U.S. tax rate partially offset by a lower level of favorable discrete items. Our second quarter adjusted rate was lower than anticipated due to discrete tax items. There can be volatility in our rate quarter-to-quarter due to the impact of these discrete items and changes to our forecasted mix of earnings. Income from unconsolidated operations was $7 million compared to $8 million in the second quarter of 2017, a 12% decrease, mainly due to the elimination of higher earnings associated with minority interest. We continue to expect our 2018 income from unconsolidated operations to be comparable to 2017.","At the bottom line, as shown on slide 27, second quarter 2018 adjusted earnings per share was $1.02, up 24% from $0.82 for the year-ago period, mainly due to higher adjusted operating income, partially offset by higher interest expense and shares outstanding.","On slide 28, we summarize highlights for cash flow and the quarter-end balance sheet. Our cash flow provided from operations was $235 million for the second quarter of 2018 compared to $177 million through the second quarter of 2017. This change was driven by the increase in our net income. We continue to see improvements in our cash conversion cycle, finishing the second quarter at 67 days, down nine days versus our fiscal year-end, primarily driven by our extended terms and inventory programs. We returned $137 million of cash to shareholders through dividends and used $60 million for capital expenditures through the second quarter of 2018.","We expect 2018 to be another year of strong cash flow and our priority is to continue to have a balanced use of cash, making investments to drive growth, returning a significant portion to our shareholders through dividends and to pay down debt. Year-to-date, we have made $100 million of prepayment on our three-year term loan secured as part of the RB Foods acquisition financing. This brings our total prepayments to $350 million.","Let's now move to our current financial outlook for 2018 on slide 29. Our sales, adjusted operating margin and adjusted earnings per share targets for the year remain unchanged. At the topline, we reaffirm our guidance to grow sales 13% to 15%, including an 8% incremental impact of the acquisition of Frank's and French's and underlying base business and new product growth of 3% to 5% from higher volume, product mix and pricing as well as a two percentage point favorable impact due to currency.","Previously, we expected at least $100 million of CCI. We now expect at least $105 million. With our revised CCI guidance, the momentum of our first half gross margin expansion and our continued strategy of shifting to a more value-added portfolio, we are now projecting our 2018 adjusted gross profit margin to be 175 to 225 basis points higher than 2017. This is an increase from our previous projection, which was a 150 to 200 basis point increase versus 2017. We expect this additional favorability to be offset by incremental freight costs.","As a reminder, for 2018, we are planning to increase brand marketing at a rate above our sales growth and for the first half of 2018, our brand marketing increase was lower than the rate of our sales growth. We also expect currency favorability to be greater in the first half of the year than in the second half and we have seen more volatility and uncertainty recently. As such, our adjusted operating income increase remains unchanged. We expect to increase adjusted operating income 23% to 25% from $786 million in 2017, which includes a one percentage point impact from favorable currency rates.","We reaffirm projected adjusted earnings per share of $4.85 to $4.95, an increase of 14% to 16% versus our $4.26 adjusted earnings per share in 2017. This range of growth includes an estimated one percentage point impact from favorable currency rates. For the fiscal year, we expect our higher profit and working capital initiatives to lead to another year of strong cash flow.","In summary, we are projecting excellent growth in our 2018 constant currency outlook for sales, adjusted operating profit and adjusted earnings per share, following record double-digit performance across each objective in 2017. We also reaffirm our 2018 GAAP earnings per share range, which is projected to be $6.85 to $6.95. There are several projected 2018 adjustments which are expected to drive our GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation. First, approximately $23 million for integration expenses related to RB Foods, which is in line with our previous estimate. Second, approximately $18 million of special charges. And finally, the net impact of two nonrecurring items required by the U.S. Tax Act, which is currently expected to be a tax benefit of approximately $298 million in 2018. The total net impact of these adjustments is anticipated to be a $2 favorable impact to our GAAP earnings per share for fiscal 2018.","Finally, before we move to your questions, let me recap the key takeaways from our remarks this morning. Our momentum has continued into the second quarter and with our excellent first half results, the strength of both of our core business and our Frank's and French's portfolio is evident. We are delivering against our plans for both sales and profit realization and are confident in the effectiveness of our strategies. And finally, we are reaffirming our strong 2018 outlook for underlying sales, adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share growth.","Now let's turn to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse.","Robert Moskow","Hi. Thank you. Good morning. I was curious about --","Lawrence Kurzius","Hi. Good morning Rob","Robert Moskow","Good morning. Mike, I think you said that brand marketing was slower than sales growth in the first half and then it's going to reaccelerate in the back half and then your CCI is a little bit ahead of expectations, but then you said, I think that there's more volatility than you expected and I didn't quite get in what that was. So I guess the question is, did you have to reduce some of the advertising in the second quarter or shift it to take into account that volatility? And then I guess, the follow-up question is, the quarter is so much better than what consensus had, but it sounds like it was just in line with what you were planning and the phasing is different than what the street had forecasted for the year. Is that fair?","Mike Smith","Yes. Rob, as you know, we are performing according to our plans and we really don't give quarterly guidance. So we feel it was a great quarter, as you said. The thing is, you have got to realize that some of this is timing and we talked about A&P. We have under-spent net sales growth year-to-date, but we have always planned for the year, the second half was going to be back-loaded from an A&P perspective. We are launching our first choice advertising late in the third quarter in Europe for our brand relaunch there of our Ducros and Schwartz. We have our French's and Frank's plans and strong grilling across the summer. So the comment about volatility was more around FX. You\u2019re seeing some of the FX rates jumping around the last month or so. That's it. And our FX has been very favorable year-to-date, about 3.5%. We see that going down for the year about 2%.","Robert Moskow","I see. Okay. And then just one follow-up on French's. I think that it sounds like getting the distribution right is being well received by the trade but it's going to take a while to execute. What's the obstacle to getting it done? Like why not just have it done for this year's grilling season? Is it just kind like you have to convince retailer-by-retailer to do it? Or what is it?","Lawrence Kurzius","Well, Rob, this is Lawrence. Well, first of all, I would say we are getting it done. So the change in the distribution that we talked about in our prepared remarks really reflects a lot of real execution that's already happened at retail, especially on Frank's, where we have substantially improved the distribution or the total points of distribution on the Frank's brand and we have made some good progress on mustard really just by stabilizing it, a story that's pretty positive. We inherited some distribution losses there, and the longer-term trend on distribution had been negative as well. So bringing stability to that is a good step in the right direction.","Retailers, resetting a shelf operationally is a big deal for them. You do, do it customer-by-customer, but it's a disruption to their stores. And so they tend to have specific windows in which they will do the resets. And so even some of the changes that we have sold to customers and they have accepted haven't unfolded just yet because we are not at the window when they are going to reset that aisle or that section of the store.","Mike Smith","Or the competitor product has to sell through.","Lawrence Kurzius","Yes, exactly. But we have made a lot of progress in this area. I mean I am really pleased with it and there's a lot of runway for continued improvement there. We are really in the early innings of the improvement in distribution on French's and Frank's. They were tremendously under-skewed and under-shelved and the progress that we have made while it is meaningful and we are going to see it in the numbers in the second half, there's a lot more to be had there.","Robert Moskow","Yes. I didn't catch what you said about the competitor. Is the competitor also -- ?","Mike Smith","Yes. Rob, even if you win and as Lawrence said, there are windows you have to reset things, the competitor product is on-shelf that has to sell through. It's still in their supply chain. So that is a natural delay.","Robert Moskow","Okay. All right. Thank you.","Lawrence Kurzius","But there were a few of them or I don't think you have written a note on this, but some of your peers have written notes about noticing some of our competitors disappearing at certain accounts.","Robert Moskow","Well, they are doing a great job, those competitors. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ken Goldman with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","KenGoldman","Hi. Thank you.","Lawrence Kurzius","Hi Ken. Good morning, by the way.","Ken Goldman","Hi. Good morning everyone. I wanted to ask a couple of things. First, just in the store checks that we do when I put my hat on as a food retail analyst, we have seen, I know you don't want to mention specific customers, but I guess I can. Kroeger, moving some of spice and seasonings products around the store and in some cases, putting spices and seasonings in areas of the store where there's no other food. And I am just wondering, is this something you are seeing on any kind of broad scale? Or are these really, as far as you know and maybe you haven't seen this at all, are these sort of one-off changes in your view? I am just trying to get a sense of whether this is something that we should see as a canary in a coal mine a little bit.","Lawrence Kurzius","So Ken, Kroeger certainly is doing that. I would say that that actually isn't anything new and it's something that we see is pretty widespread practice to put spices and seasonings into secondary locations. It's not abandonment of central sections for spices and seasonings, but putting spices and seasonings into the meat area, taco and so forth with the Hispanic product, some presence in the produce area, these are things that not only does Kroeger do but other accounts do and is actual performance that we sell to retailers to accelerate sales and in fact, we have got specific brands that are designed to live in those other parts of the store over in the produce section, we have Gourmet Garden brand and our Produce Partners brand. For example, Adolph's very often appears over in the meat section. So this kind of secondary placement is not unusual and really part of the health of the category.","Ken Goldman","Yes. I think I asked that question. I could have asked that in a better way. What I really meant was the primary placement has shifted. But I will follow up offline with that.","Lawrence Kurzius","Okay. I would say we are not seeing the primarily placement shift really.","Ken Goldman","Okay. Good. Thank you for that. I appreciate that. And then I wanted to ask, we are looking, obviously, scanner data is becoming less meaningful for a lot of food manufacturers. It seems to be really less meaningful for you as you shift to some alternative customers. But we are seeing that for a number of your brands, not just with season, a number of brands, whether it's Zatarain's, OLD BAY, et cetera, that McCormick is losing distribution points as a company with a major customer. And I don't see a reason really for concern because at the same time that your distribution points are dropping, your velocities are getting a lot better with these brands. But is there anything that you can see in the data or help us understand why your TDP with this particular customer or with any one big customer is rolling over? Or is the data incorrect?","Lawrence Kurzius","Sure. Well, Ken, let me take this in two parts. First of all, there's a syndicated Nielsen report that is widely drawn upon that's kind of a standardized product that they sell to the industry and we have had a disconnect versus that for a long time. It does not accurately track us. And where it does track, we believe, it's tracking the channels that are losing share, not where we are losing share, but that are actually losing share to other channels. And so we think it understates consumption overall, not just for us but for everybody. That's my opinion. I don't have a quantification on that. But what we call unmeasured channels have been outpacing the growth than measured channels for a long time.","The second part of that, regarding the distribution point loss on some of the specific items. Yes, there's a statistical artifact in that, when you change your package, the old package shows up in the data and the new package, as if they were two separate items. So in OLD BAY, in particular, which is one of the ones that you mentioned, a year ago, we were converting from the metal tins to BPA-free plastic containers that they are in today. And while that transition was taking place, the syndicated data is reporting those items as if they were two separate things. So a three-ounce OLD BAY package was showing up really kind of as a double count and that has come out of there right now. So noise like that around packaging transitions makes a difference. And it sounds like, that wouldn't be very much on OLD BAY, in particular, that's actually quite a big difference and we haven't lost anything in OLD BAY. It's a great-performing product.","And others like Zatarain's, rice mix is a category that is a little bit off trend right now due to carb consumption and TDPs for that entire category have declined and Zatarain's has lost some distribution along with that as consumers have gone more towards protein-based foods and away from carbohydrate-based foods. We will say that Zatarain's has an advantage and that it's more of a dinner mix than a side dish and so people add meat to it when they consume it but there has been some distribution loss on Zatarain's. But if you step back, the changes in distribution that are coming through in the syndicated data around OLD BAY and also on some of the spice items in, what we call the super deal size, reflect packaging changes. And there were also some limited-edition Grill Mate items that were out there a year ago and they have come out. So thus for those, we have actually gained distribution. So if you take that noise out, our points of distribution are actually up, not down.","Ken Goldman","That's really helpful. Thanks very much.","Lawrence Kurzius","Sure.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Alexia Howard with AllianceBernstein. Please proceed with your question.","Alexia Howard","Good morning everyone.","Lawrence Kurzius","Good morning Alexia","Alexia Howard","Okay. So one main question and a quick follow-up. Can you elaborate a little bit on how things are going in China? It looks as though the flavor solutions business is under a little bit of pressure sales-wise, but the consumer business is doing well. Is that e-commerce taking off? Or is that in more of the traditional trade? That would be great And then just a quick follow-up. Can you quantify the gross margin impact of the RB Foods acquisition? How much of a benefit has that been since that deal was closed? Thank you.","Lawrence Kurzius","Great. Hi, Alexia, I will take the first half of that and then I will pass it over to Mike to talk about gross margin. But our business in China has been really robust on the consumer side. The majority of the growth that you are seeing over there is still being driven by really base business growth. We have continued to expand distribution, household penetration and we have gained share in every category that we compete in over there on the customer side of the business. So it's a great story. We are having tremendous growth on our new Tmall store, but I will temper that by saying it's still small and these are early days. We have only just opened it this year. So while, it's a contributor to the growth, that's not what the real growth story is in China just yet.","On the flavor solutions business, yes, that business is just a choppy, lumpy business and we have a fair degree of customer concentration there. And so customer promotional activity can change the quarter-to-quarter numbers, but the trend line for flavor solutions in our business in China has been positive and continues to be and we have got a very good outlook for that.","Mike, do you want to comment on gross margin?","Mike Smith","Yes. I think the thing, just to follow up on your point on China, China flavor solutions actually grew, as we said. But in the rest of the zone, we were exiting some low-margin business as part of our focus on profit realization, but the China underlying flavor solutions business did grow.","From a gross margin perspective, you asked a question about the share of the gross margin expansion due to RB Foods versus the core business. I would say approximately on a year-to-date basis, approximately half is from RB and half is focused coming from our core business, with really that focus on CCI and moving more toward value-added products.","Alexia Howard","Very helpful. Thank you very much. I will pass it on.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Growe with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.","Chris Growe","I just had a couple of questions for you, if I could. The first one will just be in relation to the gross margin. It was up at a stronger rate and you just gave a little color around the sources of that growth. Freight costs are up. It seems like inflation is in line with expectations. I just feel that initially this quarter, you had a little less pricing coming through as well. So I wonder if you could speak about the pricing overall? And then how the effect that could have on the gross margin, given inflation is still in place for the business?","Mike Smith","Good morning Chris. I will take this. This is Mike. From a gross margin perspective and pricing, yes, the pricing that's going through the first half of this year is really related to pricing actions we took in 2017. And we have talked about this in the script late in the second quarter. We have seen some of the pricing will start coming through late in the second quarter and third and fourth quarter will be fully effective. So you will see in the third and fourth quarter, a little bit more from a pricing perspective. But as we said from the beginning of the year, commodity, cost inflation is low single digits and we are passing that on low single-digit price increases.","From a margin perspective, as I just mentioned about half of the gross margin improvement is from the core business, half from the RB accretion. We talked about CCI. We put in the $400 million target back in 2016 and we are delivering that. We are delivering this year. And that's why we called the full year to up that at least $105 million, really great performance there across the company. And this continued move to reshape our portfolio really a lot on the flavor solutions side with moving more to the flavor and seasonings and you saw a lift this quarter in the Americas zone, for example, savory flavor's up, seasoning's up. So those are the types of things that really help our core business grow gross margin.","Chris Growe","Okay. And related to that just there was a comment on a couple of the divisions where you are exiting low-margin businesses in flavor solutions. Is there at all a quantifiable drag on the topline? And maybe even commensurately, how much of the incremental margin that non-RB Foods gross margin improvement is coming from that activity, if it's big enough to even cite?","Mike Smith","No. It's build into our guidance for the year. So we don't quantify that, but it is helping our gross margin improvement.","Chris Growe","And how much of a sales drag was that? Is that a large amount of sale drag? Did you walk away from some of these contracts?","Mike Smith","We don't really break that out, Chris. But it's not material, but it's within our guidance for the year from a sales perspective.","Chris Growe","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rob Dickerson with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Rob Dickerson","Great. Thank you so much. So yes, I guess I have a question that goes back to gross margin as well, but then also as it relates to EPS for the year. So Q1, you had a strong first quarter. It seems like you have a fairly strong second quarter with part of the EPS performance really being driven by better than the market expected on the gross margin side kind of falling through. And then we see you increased your gross margin guidance for the year by, I think, 25 basis points. But then the EPS isn't increasing. So I am just curious around your comments on FX volatility second half versus first half and the increase in marketing more back-half weighted, can you just provide some color as to like why you would not increase your EPS guidance for the year since the first half has been so strong? I guess, that's one. And then two is just if you are running at like 2.5% organic sales for the first half of the year, but the year implied 3% to 5%, that I am assuming we should still be expecting a decent step-up in the back-half to get us to that 3% to 5%? Thanks.","Mike Smith","Right. There's a lot in there to unpick, Rob, but that's fine.","Rob Dickerson","Sorry about that.","Mike Smith","That's all right. No and you hit on a couple of points that I mentioned. But one thing, gross margins are up and part of that was due to our CCI efforts calling that up by $5 million. But on the SG&A line, where we classify freight unlike a lot of our peers, freight is up versus last year. So we didn't get leverage on our SG&A as we have done in the past due to that freight increases and we will see that continue into the third and fourth quarter. The other thing we mentioned, we are continuing to reinvest in our business and the A&P increase in the second half will be above the rate of sales. So that all plays into our full year guidance. Everything is baked into our range of $485 million to $495 million. And the FX, as you pointed out and I think, on a note, we were very favorable year-to-date and then the rest of the year, it will be somewhat neutral, but that's also impacting the second half growth rate.","Lawrence Kurzius","Right. And I will just add to that, that our year is progressing as we have planned. We did just increase guidance last quarter and we still have our two biggest quarters ahead of us. And so I think we are comfortable with where everybody's models for the year are settled.","Rob Dickerson","Okay. Fair enough. And then just one quick question on the pricing. I am just curious, I think I heard you mention promotional activity in different parts of the world. So I know pricing is coming through in certain categories, I assume in the Americas in the back half. So one is, do you feel like there's potentially a little bit increased promotional activity in the market at this point, one? And then two, was there any volume component that kind of offset some of that pricing this quarter or maybe in Q3? Thanks.","Lawrence Kurzius","Rob, Lawrence here. I don't think that that wasn't what we were trying to message at all. I think what we are messaging is that first of all, the second half of the year seasonally is the strongest part of the year and so our promotional activity is higher overall and that our plans for the year always included an acceleration of marketing activity. As we got into the second half the year, I would say that is particularly true. On the Frank's and French's business, where a year ago we just acquired the business and really hadn't had a chance to impact the consumer marketing program during that high season. So that's all that we are trying to signal there. I think that on pricing, the message is that we have got the pricing that we were intending to take, we got not only negotiated but actually in place towards the end of the second quarter and so we would expect that to be a net benefit in the second half.","Mike Smith","Yes. Other thing, Rob, the promotional activity, we might have been referring to in the script, really we talked about flavor solutions, the customers have different promotion schedules, so that impacts the timing of sales.","Rob Dickerson","Fair enough. Thank you so much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Adam Samuelson","Yes. Thanks. Good morning everyone. Two questions. I guess first, in the flavor solutions business, help me, I mean the margin expansion here has been quite considerable and just again trying to think about how mix between RB Foods and just some of the conscious to mix changes that you have undertaken in your base business have impacted it? And may be a little more color on the growth that you are seeing between the flavors and branded foodservice versus your ingredients businesses? That would be the first question.","Mike Smith","Sure. Adam, this is Mike. Similar to the question that Alexia asked, for the whole company and for the segments, roughly about half of the accretion on gross margins is coming from the base business and half is coming from the RB Foods accretion. So it works out that way. Go ahead.","Adam Samuelson","No, I was going to say and so is the rest more CCI? Or is it conscious mix changes in your own legacy business between branded foodservice flavors and some of the lower margin ingredients that you had before?","Mike Smith","It's really both. I mean, CCI really falls across both segments, but it impacts flavor solutions heavily. But the conscious decisions we are making on the ingredient business also really focusing on flavors and seasonings and branded foodservice, which has also performed very well, both on the core business and then the Frank's and French's business too. So they are all leverage we are pulling to help us.","Adam Samuelson","Okay. And then just more broadly and it's hard to parse given the old reporting and how it's now split. But RB Foods kind of in aggregate on its own, what was its organic growth in the second quarter, if you have that number?","Lawrence Kurzius","I don't think that we are saying that, but the full amount of the sales, of course, is visible because the sales attributable to acquisition are 100% from RB Foods. I will say that RB is tracking uncannily close to our original acquisition model and --","Mike Smith","Which Lawrence said in the first quarter too.","Lawrence Kurzius","Yes, I know it is but it is uncanny how close it is which included some pretty aggressive growth as we go through this year. So we are really pleased with it, but we are not quantifying that. And there's a reason for that and that's because when we get to fourth quarter, it's going to drop into base business. And as we go forward, we are not going to be reporting on it separately. It will fall into the segments. And so it just seems like providing that visibility during this period of time would just be an unnecessary amount of detail. But you can see in the overall sales growth and in margins performance that we are getting good results there.","Adam Samuelson","Okay. And I guess along similar lines, you are not disclosing the actual realized synergies to date on the acquisition?","Lawrence Kurzius","No. But we have said this year, that we are progressing, we are getting higher than we originally thought. We are not quantifying it, but we are progressing well. At some point during the year, we will quantify it, but not yet. This is kind of a broad question, even back to why we aren't calling up our guidance. We are only about 40% through the year from an earnings perspective. Our big two quarters are coming up. So it's something, I think, in the third quarter, we will have more news.","Adam Samuelson","Okay. I appreciate the color. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Feeney with Consumer Edge Research. Please proceed with your question.","Jonathan Feeney","Good morning. Thanks for the question.","Lawrence Kurzius","Good morning.","Jonathan Feeney","Hello. I wanted to ask about, I know you are not going to give us the apples-to-apples sales and volume for Frank's and French's, but you did give us some comments earlier in the call about some impressive distribution gains there and I really wanted to dig into, first of all, if you could comment as to whether those distribution gains on a regional basis and a national basis are an acceleration from what had previously been going on? I would imagine the answer to that question is yes, but please correct me if I am wrong about that. And I wondered what is it that you are doing to drive that? Are there some analytics there that you have that others don't? Or did you approached it in a different way? Like how would you bucket the success you are having with that because I think it applies broadly to what's going on with innovation in your company broadly? Thanks.","Lawrence Kurzius","Hi. Great. Thanks, Jonathan. One of the things that we have got that the previous owner didn't have is that we have got tremendous category management capability. I mean, Reckitt Benckiser, that was a fabulous company. In their core categories, they have got tremendous capability, but this was not one of their core categories. They regarded this as an off-strategy business and so it didn't get the resources that the other brands in that company got. And their category management capabilities were frankly pretty rudimentary. Today's category management exercises require specialized tools, it requires a lot of data and it requires talent, all of which are expensive and require substantial scale to work. And so, their competitor was able to push them around at the shelf pretty handily for the last three years before we bought the business. And we have been able to successfully now push back against that.","As an example, in many customers, French's mustard has the same shelf presence as, let's say, the other brand that's out there, but at three to four times the velocity. I mean, the competing brand doesn't deserve equal presence. Customers have been very responsive to the fact that French's is under-shelved and under-skewed and that the competitor's brands are over-shelved, over-skewed and may not even deserve to be there in the first place. And so that's a selling story that it's a customer-by-customer selling story, but they have been very receptive to it. The data totally supports it and we have been pretty credible.","This is an area that's been historically a strength for McCormick. We have really built a lot of muscle in this capability over the last several years. And so I think we are able to push back pretty effectively. The gain, so far, are really pleasing. We again believe are not at the end of the story. There's a lot more runway still here to improve our shelf presence and share of shelves.","Mike Smith","The other thing we bring to it and Lawrence mentioned this, but in the third quarter, we have anew French's advertising campaign. That would be the first time in several years. So that will help further drive growth.","Lawrence Kurzius","Right. So while we have done a great job on the shelf in the first half of the year, I think as we get through the second half and start introducing the new advertising, we are going to see consumer response be really good.","Jonathan Feeney","Thank you.","Lawrence Kurzius","That French's campaign actually just started this week. So it's in the market now.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Akshay Jagdale with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.","Akshay Jagdale","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for the question and congrats on a solid quarter.","Lawrence Kurzius","Thanks.","Akshay Jagdale","Can you hear me?","Lawrence Kurzius","Yes.","Akshay Jagdale","Okay. So I wanted to ask about the organic growth. So the acceleration that's expected in the second half, is that primarily pricing? Or does that include some of the distribution gains on the base business that we are not aware of?","Lawrence Kurzius","Hi, Akshay, this is Lawrence. And it's not just pricing. Pricing is part of it. But we have a much stronger A&P plan in the second half of the year compared to the first, as Mike mentioned. For the first half of the year, our A&P spending, while it's up, is not up equal to our sales growth, but for the full year, we expect the company spending on A&P growth to be higher than sales growth. So implied in that is pretty strong acceleration of A&P spending in the second half of the year and that is our highest consumption period. And so I think that real consumer offtake driven by our marketing programs is one of the main factors. That and pricing.","And we have distribution gains that we have won that haven't been fully reflected at the shelf in the first half of the year and indeed some of which are still even in the process of being implemented that give us a lot of confidence in the second half of the year, especially going into the fourth quarter. And then in the fourth quarter, remember that Frank's and French's will be part of that core business and we are going to be lapping some of the fourth quarter supply chain issues from last year. So we are expecting a very robust fourth quarter from that really good point.","Akshay Jagdale","Okay. And then just on the category management, obviously it's playing through quite nicely it look likes in the acquired business. But in the base business, my question on category management was the larger customer as you have seen, obviously, some strategic initiatives from them as it relates to private label and planned conversion and some promotion that I think have not been in line with what you would have suggested. So can you give us an update on that? And how that's shaping up? I mean, should we expect that the new shelf resets a different strategy? And the reason I am asking is obviously this has some huge impact from external data. But I am just wondering if you have enough data in that regard?","Lawrence Kurzius","Well, I think, that our category management efforts are reinforcing on a competitive dynamic that we see in the market right now where the leading brand is gaining and private label is gaining. And if you are thinking of herbs, spices and seasonings in particular, this is a category where we make both. And so our category management efforts have been around accelerating the growth of those two and that's put pressure on everything that's in the middle. The numbers there are distorted by a new low by one large customer that we have talked about at some length. I am not going to repeat all that stuff. But if you look at the total grocery trends, our IRI scanner shows that we are pretty close to keeping pace with the category and I think our category management efforts there have been pretty successful.","Akshay Jagdale","And just one last one on the acquired business. Again, it's hard for us to really track the unmeasured data, but from your comment it looks like everything is right on track despite the late start to the grilling season. So can you help me marry those two because I am assuming you didn't foresee a late grilling season, but it sounds like if it weren't for a late grilling season, the numbers would have been even better and it's just a timing issue. Is that a fair way to think about it?","Lawrence Kurzius","Well, I won't say that it's just a timing issue. But certainly, if we hadn't had a later start to the grilling season, I mean, March and April were cold and wet across the East and the South and that's where a lot of our consumption is. That consumption has gone. So that's not going to repeat. But yes, if it weren't for that, I think we would have been even stronger. I don't think that that really manifests itself so much on the French's and Frank's portfolio as much as it does on our core grilling products. Well, actually for French's and Frank's, this is the strongest start to the grilling season that they have had since the competitive product was introduced. This is the first time that those brands have gained volume during that period.","Akshay Jagdale","Okay. I will pass it on. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of Steven Strycula with UBS. Please proceed with your question.","Steven Strycula","Hi. Good morning.","Lawrence Kurzius","Good morning.","Steven Strycula","So I have a strategic question, Lawrence, for you, I wanted to understand for the United States and for France. What have some of the retail learnings been as they have maybe rotated and done a few this labeling change over to private-label. Has category value suffered at all from these decisions? And how do you kind of interpret the recent trend line in that direction? And then I have a quick follow-up. Thank you.","Lawrence Kurzius","Okay. Well, that's an interesting question. For us, the change that happened for our brand, it was already an entry price point item. And so the transition from that entry price point economy brand to a private label really wasn't a category devaluing event. It wasn't a margin devaluing event for us either. The thing that has been category devaluing really within that customer has been some intense promotional activity that they have put against that item that occurred most intensely during, say, through fourth quarter and first quarter of last year. And as we lap that, I think we will see some improvement there. But that's the case for us. I really don't know what the answer to that is more broadly.","Steven Strycula","Okay. That's helpful. And then in the U.K., last year we saw some retailer action to just take net distribution out of the category for general merchandise. Has there been any thought process on to that coming back your way or to the category's way by any means? And then to wrap it up, just wanted to understand, if you guys do a little bit of private-label manufacturing for herbs and spices, is that to say that part of the commercial strategy in condiments might be to do the same for select retailers? Thank you.","Lawrence Kurzius","Okay. So there are two questions. Well, first of all, in the U.K., we are coming up on the lap of that distribution change and so certainly, that won't be the negative impact that it has been. But on the other hand, I don't want to speculate in advance about what the change in distribution we might get with them going forward.","As far as the condiment private label, I think that's something we would have to think long and hard about. That is not a business that we are in right now. We have provided private label in our urban spice category because it's a very complicated category to manage and we have tried to offer the customer a full category solution for the category. It's got hundreds of SKUs and it's very challenging to manage. Condiment is a little bit different than that. So I think we got to think long and hard about that. That's not a business we are in right now.","Steven Strycula","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Kurzius for any closing remarks.","Lawrence Kurzius","Thanks everyone. I would like to thank everyone for your questions and I would like to apologize for those who are still in the queue. We have gone 15 minutes over and we do still have questions in the queue. So my apologies to those that we didn't get to and I would like to thank everyone who participated on today's call.","McCormick is a global leader in flavor and we are differentiated with a broad advantaged portfolio which continues to drive growth.

This is Joyce Brooks, McCormick's Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you for joining today's call to review the company's first quarter financial results and 2013 outlook. We have posted a set of slides to accompany today's call at our website, ir.mccormick.com. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, the conference is being recorded.","With me on today's call are Alan Wilson, Chairman, President and CEO; and Gordon Stetz, Executive Vice President and CFO. Alan is going to begin with comments on first quarter results and a business update, followed by Gordon with a more detailed review of our first quarter financial performance and financial guidance for 2013. After that, we look forward to discussing your questions and some closing remarks from Alan.","As a reminder, today's presentation contains projections and other forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those projected. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements whether as a result of a new information, future events or other factors. As seen on Slide 2, our forward-looking statement also provides information on risk factors that could affect our financial results.","It is now my pleasure to turn the discussion over to Alan.","Alan D. Wilson","Thanks, Joyce. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Our first quarter results included strong growth in our consumer business, earnings per share above our guidance and a great start to cash flow from operations in 2013. We grew sales in our consumer business 7%, driven by innovation and marketing support for our leading brands. While consumers in many of our markets remain under pressure, we believe that we have good momentum for this business segment and expect solid sales and profit performance in 2013. Tough economic conditions had a measurable impact on our industrial business in several markets. We had expected some weakness in the first quarter, particularly in comparison to the strong year-ago sales and profit growth, and we continue to have a conservative 2013 outlook for our industrial business.","For the total business, first quarter operating income was comparable to the year-ago period. A $6 million increase in our consumer business operating income offset a similar decline in the industrial business, a net result that was generally in line with our expectations. During our January call, we had indicated that first quarter profit would be unfavorably impacted by higher material costs, increased retirement benefit expense and a difficult comparison for our Industrial business, which grew sales 13% in the first quarter of 2012. These factors played out as expected and led to the comparable operating income result that we reported. We increased earnings per share from $0.57 -- to $0.57 from $0.55 in the first quarter of 2012 and reported an increase in cash flow, generating $32 million this period, up from $23 million a year ago, mainly due to improvement in our cash conversion cycle. Gordon will go into these financial results in more detail.","What I would like to discuss next is the excellent progress with our initiatives that are driving growth in our consumer business. I'll then comment on the leadership changes we announced 1 month ago. As a third topic, I want to comment on the current operating environment, how this is affecting our outlook and how we are adapting. I plan to specifically discuss industrial business conditions during my prepared remarks and would welcome any follow-up questions that you may have during our question-and-answer session.","So let's start with our key growth initiatives for the consumer business. In the first quarter, these initiatives drove increased volume and product mix, with growth in each of our 3 regions. With this strong start to the year, we believe we have great momentum underway. The first initiative is product innovation on Slide 5. In our January call, we reviewed some of the new products poised for launch in the first half of this year. I'm pleased to report that we're meeting our targets for retailer acceptance for a number of these items. I want to share just a few of our new product success stories unfolding in 2013.","In the U.S., we're extending varieties of our gourmet recipe mixes with flavors such as smoked paprika chicken tacos and Tuscan beef stew. This product line offers consumers a way to make premium, all-natural meals that are full of flavor. Recent retailer data showed that 35% of sales for these products are incremental to the category. While our first quarter is not the height of grilling season, initial acceptance of new Grill Mates items, including sauces, accounted for about half of the 23% increase in unit volume. Also in the U.S., we are more than halfway toward reaching our distribution goal on Big Easy Rice, a product that offers the authentic New Orleans flavor of Zatarain's in a convenient microwavable pouch.","In Europe, the Middle East and Africa, EMEA, our Vahin\u00e9 brand of dessert items is the clear category leader, and our innovation has helped drive 2% unit growth for the category in the latest 52 weeks. In early 2013, we launched another 12 new items that included toppings and cake mixes. Also in EMEA, we are introducing our recipe mixes in 2 new markets, leveraging consumers' affinity for our Ducros brand in France and Kamis brand in Poland. We are achieving great retail acceptance and on-shelf presence for these products.","Moving to the Asia Pacific region. In November, we secured placement of our marinades in a bag with one of the major retailers in Australia. Consumers love the flavors and convenience of these products, and we've already gained the #2 spot in the wet marinade category at this retailer.","Moving to brand marketing support. We're staying agile on our spending. While the brand marketing support we recorded as selling, general and admin expense was $4 million lower in the first quarter, at the net sales line, we had a $3 million increase. This increase was used to fund additional price promotions, helping consumers adjust to past pricing actions, as well as allowances for shelf placement of new items. We continue to analyze and improve the effectiveness of our marketing dollars and are focused on execution.","We have an increase of approximately $5 million in brand marketing support planned for the second quarter of 2013. One example of greater effectiveness was our fully integrated Super Bowl big game mega event. We combined consumer promotion and in-store activity for 3 of our brands: McCormick items, such as recipe mixes for chili and Buffalo wings; the Zatarain's brand to create flavorful dishes like jambalaya; and Grill Mates. The results were excellent. We achieved a 53% increase in feature ads and merchandising display, a record-high sales month for Zatarain's and increased the effectiveness of our digital advertising.","Also in the U.S., to cover even more of our product portfolio and meet consumer interest in flavor and recipes, we relaunched our mccormick.com website. In addition, the new website offers more interactive features and better integration with social channels. In France, we measured a 10% sales gain in response to television advertising for our Ducros version of Perfect Pinch. And in China, we laid the groundwork for growth with revitalized packaging design and an expansion of our advertising to an additional province. This activity, along with great sales execution, is driving strong double-digit sales growth.","Moving beyond the first quarter. In March, we had a significant baking and brunch campaign for Easter that included print, coupons and digital media. And headed into the creak -- the peak grilling season, we'll continue to build upon our Grillerhood platform and launch marketing support for our new steak sauce with the tagline \"better-tasting steak guaranteed.\" This marketing plan includes dedicated Hispanic support for Grill Mates.","Our third avenue of growth is acquisitions. I'm pleased with the progress on the regulatory approval for the purchase of Wuhan Asia-Pacific Condiments. We have a few more steps, and we expect to complete this transaction midyear. We anticipate a rapid and seamless integration of WAPC with our existing business in China. McCormick's strategy includes investing in acquisitions, product development and brand marketing to grow sales and profits, and to fuel these investments with our comprehensive continuous improvement program, CCI. Our long-term goal is to achieve annual savings of at least $45 million with this program, and that remains our guidance for 2013.","I'd like to comment next on some leadership changes which we announced early in March. These changes are an integral part of our ongoing leadership development and succession planning. Mark Timbie, President of Consumer Foods America and Chief Administrative Officer, has announced his retirement for June 2013. During his 17 years with McCormick, Mark has been an important member of our senior leadership team, and he has contributed strongly to our success in the U.S. and in international roles. At this time, Ken Stickevers, President of U.S. Consumer, will report directly to me, and we'll have some additional organizational announcements prior to Mark's retirement.","On the industrial side of our business, Chuck Langmead has been promoted to President, Global Industrial. This new position will help us drive sales growth by aligning our customer intimacy efforts and driving strategy consistently across our industrial businesses worldwide. Chuck has been responsible for our industrial business in the Americas. And another one of our senior leaders, Randy Carper, will assume the role of President of the U.S. Industrial Group, reporting to Chuck. I'm confident that Chuck, Randy and our other business leaders have the ability to manage through the current environment and achieve long-term sales growth and improve profitability for our industrial business.","That provides a good transition to my third topic, the current operating environment, its effect on our outlook and how we are adapting. I'd like to address this topic by segment and begin with our consumer business. As I've stated in our initial remarks, consumers in many of our markets remain under pressure. Our growth initiatives have achieved increased sales of our brands in a number of our top markets, although private label has continued to gain share in certain markets.","We're responding by building our brand equity. This includes differentiating our products through innovation and ensuring that consumers perceive our products as a good value, building our brand equity. Our teams continue to analyze retail price points, working with our customers to tactically adjust price promotions and couponing as appropriate, and for selected items, get to lower every day price. We're also making sure that our brands are well represented across channels, that our products are on the shelf no matter where consumers are shopping. As a result of these actions and initiatives, we believe that McCormick's consumer business is well positioned for growth as consumers strive to achieve a balance between taste, convenience, value and health.","Let's turn to the industrial business and start with a look back to the first quarter of 2012. During that period, we grew sales 13%, with 10% of an increase in volume and product mix. We had won a number new product wins [ph] with both food manufacturers, as well as the food service industry leaders that we serve. In EMEA, through the rest of 2012 and into 2013, sales have remained robust, driven largely by increased sales to quick service restaurants.","In the Asia Pacific region, our activity with limited-time offers has slowed. In the first quarter of 2013, we had a significant decline in China related to the U.S.-based quick service restaurants, which were impacted by well-publicized reports on chicken. Based on their upcoming promotions, new product activity and plans for additional restaurant locations, we expect sales to begin to recover as we move through 2013. In the Americas, sales to food manufacturers have been fairly steady, with a solid stream of product innovation. Our current pipeline includes a number of new seasoning blends for salty snacks, crackers and meal preparation kits.","For the food service industry, we saw slowing demand later in 2012 and into the first quarter of 2013, particularly with quick service restaurants. The economic pressure on consumers that has adversely impacted restaurant traffic has increased in the first quarter of 2013, with higher payroll taxes and fuel costs. The slide on -- the chart on Slide 12 illustrates this point. This trend has led not only to weaker demand, but a heightened focus by our food service customers on every day value and menu prices. These customers are working to lower their costs, including pressure on suppliers for product reformulations.","While our restaurant customers are navigating a tough period, they continue to value our creativity, product development capabilities and technical expertise. As evidence of our effectiveness in this area, our teams have recently been recognized in the U.S. with a Taco Bell innovation reward [ph] , and in Asia with the McDonald's innovation award. Given this backdrop, we anticipated a slow start to 2013, and we have a conservative view of our industrial business for the fiscal year, although we do expect improved results and a return to growth in sales and profit by the second half.","As seen on Slide 14, while we've had some challenges in our industrial business, such as steep material cost increases, we have achieved a 54% increase in operating income in the past 5 years. Based on our outlook for strong consumer business results and a more moderate performance in our industrial business, we reaffirm our 2013 guidance for 3% to 5% sales growth and earnings per share of $3.15 to $3.23.","Before turning it over to Gordon for more details on the quarter and our outlook, I want to thank McCormick employees around the world for all of their dedicated effort to drive success with our growth initiatives and staying agile in a still challenging environment. Flavor remains a great business. McCormick brings passion to flavor, and consumer demand for flavor is growing.","On Slide 15, you can see the latest 52-week increase in consumption data for spices, herbs and seasonings in our top markets. This is our largest consumer business growth platform, and it remains a very attractive category. Our portfolio of products, geographies and customers is broad, and offers us the opportunity to flavor your meal no matter where or what you are enjoying. McCormick is well positioned to achieve long-term profitable growth.","Gordon?","Gordon M. Stetz","Thanks, Alan, and good morning, everyone. As Alan has described, our first quarter financial results for the total business were generally in line with our expectations, with strong consumer business performance offset by some weakness in industrial sales and profit. I'll begin with a closer look at sales and operating income for each segment.","Let's start with the consumer business. As seen on Slide 17, we grew consumer business sales 7%, a result driven largely by volume and product mix, with a lower impact from pricing and foreign exchange rates. In the Americas region, we grew sales 7%, with volume and product mix driving the increase. Sequentially, this followed a 2% decline in volume and product mix in the fourth quarter of 2012 that related to changes in retail trade inventory, as well as some supply chain disruptions related to Hurricane Sandy. When we discussed this decline with you in late January, we indicated that we were already seeing some recovery in first quarter sales. In addition to a favorable carryover effect from a weak fourth quarter, our latest sales in the Americas consumer business are a strong start to the year and reflect the new product and brand marketing activity that Alan described. In fact, we achieved unit growth across most of our brands and product categories.","In Europe, the Middle East and Africa, EMEA, we grew consumer sales 4%, with similar contributions from currency exchange rates, volume and product mix, and pricing actions. Our growth initiatives led to sales increases of Vahin\u00e9 dessert items and Ducros herbs, spices and seasonings in France, Schwartz brand recipe mixes in the U.K. and new distribution for Kamis products in Russia. These gains were offset in part by a modest sales decline in several smaller markets.","Consumer business sales in the Asia Pacific region rose 13%. This builds upon a 20% sales increase in the first quarter of 2012, which excludes the impact of currency and acquisitions. Through our growth initiatives, we are achieving significant sales increases in China, and increased first quarter volume and product mix by 20%. Sales for the Kohinoor brand in India grew 19% in local currency. This was the net impact of significant pricing in response to higher cost for basmati rice, offset in part by reduced volume and product mix.","Operating income for the consumer business was $88 million, an 8% increase from the first quarter of 2012. This increase was largely due to higher sales and CCI cost savings, which were offset in part by increased retirement benefit expenses and material cost inflation. While brand marketing support recorded as selling, general and administrative expense decreased $4 million year-on-year, as Alan indicated, we increased by $3 million the price promotion and slotting [ph]  allowances reported in net sales. By comparison, we increased brand marketing $9 million in the first quarter of 2012 .","Turning to our industrial business, let's start with a review of sales. For this segment, first quarter sales declined 2%, as seen on Slide 22. This was driven by lower volume and product mix, offset in part by pricing actions and a slight favorability in currency rates. While the first quarter 2013 sales result varied by region, we had achieved strong growth rates in the year-ago period, and for comparison, these rates are included on each of the next 3 slides.","In the Americas, on Slide 23, industrial sales declined 3%, with a 6% decrease in volume and product mix. Our sales of branded food service products were flat, sales to food manufacturers were down slightly and sales to our top quick service restaurants declined more significantly. As Alan indicated, the restaurant industry is under pressure from lower sales. We expect this to begin to improve in the next few quarters, as we get better traction with new product activity.","In EMEA, our industrial business achieved another consecutive quarter of strong sales growth. We grew sales 7% in local currency, with a 5% increase in volume and product mix, driven by quick service restaurants. This growth was broad-based, supplied by our facilities in the U.K., Turkey and South Africa.  In the first quarter of 2013, sales in the Asia Pacific region decreased 12%. This decrease was largely from volume and product mix, and was primarily the result of lower consumer demand at quick service restaurants in China related to the issues Alan discussed. We expect the situation there to improve in the next few quarters.","With the lower sales this period, we show on Slide 26 that operating income for the industrial business was $24 million, down from the $31 million in the year-ago period. Operating income was also unfavorably impacted by higher material costs, increased retirement benefit expense and the mix of business, offset in part by our CCI cost savings and a partial recovery of the charge for out-of-specification materials that we discussed in our fourth quarter earnings call. For the total company, as we projected, first quarter operating income of $112 million was comparable to the first quarter of 2012. The favorable impact of higher sales and cost savings from our CCI program were offset by an increase of approximately $5 million in retirement benefit expense, as well as the impact of higher material costs, which we had expected to affect the first part of 2013.","As described in our January call, we are projecting that material cost inflation will moderate from a high-single digit rate of increase in 2012 to a level close to 3% in 2013. The higher increase in material costs early in 2013 affected gross profit margin, as well as operating income. Gross profit margin of 38.7% was down 50 basis points from the first quarter of 2012. As material cost inflation eases heading into the second half of the year, we expect our CCI cost savings and a more favorable mix of business to improve gross profit margin, and for operating income growth to resume.","Moving below operating income. Our tax rate for the first quarter was 28.5% compared to a rate of 30% in the year-ago period. The 28.5% tax rate included a $1.2 million discrete tax item that resulted from the recognition of a 2012 U.S. research tax credit. A new law enacted in 2013 retroactively granted the credit in 2012. For the remaining 3 quarters of 2013, we continue to project a tax rate of approximately 29.5%.","Income from unconsolidated operations had a strong start to the year, rising 17% to $5.4 million. Our joint venture in Mexico grew sales 15%, contributing to this profit result, and we also had improved performance from our Eastern joint venture in India. We reported earnings per share of $0.57. This was a $0.02 increase from $0.55 in the year-ago period and was the result of the favorable tax rate, higher income from unconsolidated operations and a slight reduction in shares outstanding. This EPS result of $0.57 includes an unfavorable impact of approximately $0.03 from higher retirement benefit expense. We will have a similar impact in each quarter throughout 2013, reflecting the $22 million annual increase, and this is included in our guidance.","Let's turn next to our cash flow and quarter end balance sheet on Slide 31. Cash flow from operations was $32 million, up from $23 million year-to-date in 2012. This improvement was led by the change in inventory, which decreased slightly in the first quarter of 2013 compared to the significant increase in the year-ago period. In 2013, we used $60 million of cash to repurchase 900,000 shares. At quarter end, we had $77 million still available on our $400 million authorization. Our balance sheet remains strong. We are at our target debt level and expect to use a combination of cash and short-term debt to fund the purchase of Wuhan Asia-Pacific Condiments. In September 2013, we have $250 million of debt maturing and intend to refinance this with medium-term notes.","As a final topic, I'll review our latest 2013 guidance, and then we'll take your questions. Our guidance continues to exclude any impact from the acquisition of WAPC, which we expect to complete midyear. Turning to Slide 32, we reaffirm our projected sales growth of 3% to 5%. Consumer business sales are more likely to grow at the upper end of this range and industrial business sales at the lower end. We continue to project a 6% to 8% increase in operating income and about a 50-basis-point increase in gross profit margin, with at least $45 million in cost savings from our CCI program.","Keep in mind that retirement benefit expense remains a $22 million headwind to operating income in 2013. At the bottom line, we reaffirm our outlook for $3.15 to $3.23 earnings per share in 2013. This includes an $0.11 unfavorable impact from increased retirement benefit expense. As we pointed out in our January call, excluding this increase and the year-on-year higher tax rate in 2013, we expect an on underlying double-digit increase in earnings per share. As stated previously, we are planning to increase brand marketing support approximately $5 million in the second quarter.","As a result of this higher spending and the impact of increased material costs and retirement benefit expense, we expect second quarter earnings per share to be comparable to $0.60 in the second quarter of 2012. To wrap up our guidance, capital expenditures in 2013 are still expected to be in a range of $120 million to $130 million, and we expect our increased profit and further improvement in working capital to deliver another year of strong cash flow.","Let's turn now to your questions, after which, Alan will provide some closing remarks. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Alexia Howard of Sanford Bernstein.","Alexia Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","I'm kind of popping a couple of quick questions. Are you able to quantify how large the industrial sales are into China? I guess, our look at it has been that it's a fairly small proportion of your total company sales or even the sales of that segment. So I was just curious about that. And if you could give us an idea of how much they were down this quarter, that will be helpful. And then just a second broader question. Do you have views on what's going wrong with the quick service restaurant sector in the U.S.? It seems as though it was in recovery about 1 year, 18 months ago, and now it seems to be dropping off again. And I'm wondering if you just have any high-level thoughts on what might be driving that, because it seems peculiar given recovery that we're seeing elsewhere across this huge space.","Alan D. Wilson","Sure. Our industrial sales in China are between 2% and 3% of our total sales. So it's significant. It's been a good growing business, but it's not an overwhelmingly growing business. I think what's happening with overall restaurant sales and we're seeing a bifurcation, I think, across a lot of categories with how consumers are spending. Consumers that are under stress are certainly experiencing the impact of the increased spike attacks and fuel prices, as well as a whole lot of other stresses, and they're not spending. Consumers at the higher end seem to be, at least so far, continuing to spend. So I think we're seeing a little bit of that play out in our business as well. We would think that would tend to impact the quick service restaurants more than some of the other broad food service channels. It's interesting, if you look at that chart that we showed on restaurant traffic, we were starting to see some sequential recovery, which kind of went away in the first quarter. And we think, over time, that will continue to get back.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Ken Goldman of JP Morgan.","Kenneth Goldman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I just wanted to make sure I understood the guidance for the industrial segment this year. I think you've guided to the low end of the 3% to 5% organic range or toward that end, but you just did minus 3%. Will the second half be enough to get to that plus 3%? Or is my math wrong there?","Gordon M. Stetz","No, that is the guidance. We were saying that the industrial business will be towards the lower end of that 3% to 5% on a sales growth basis. And our expectation is that recovery will start to occur as we progress through the year, weighted more towards the second half of the year.","Kenneth Goldman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then one other question. We're seeing not just you guys but a couple of other food companies, and I realize that you guided to a reversal of this next quarter, and historically, you've done a good job of spending behind your brands. But you did lower your marketing as a percent of your consumer sales this quarter. Other companies, like I said, have done the same. Is there something that we should be looking at that you see across food? I mean, you see so many different food companies out there that would lead to this happening at a particular time, when maybe I didn't perceive that it would happen. I thought some companies would kind of reinvest, drive the volumes a little bit higher, both through promotions and advertising. And we're seeing some companies really cut that ad spending as a percent of sales. Is there something you're aware of that maybe we haven't thought of or I haven't thought of that's driving some companies in the food space to do this right now?","Alan D. Wilson","I can't speak broadly to what everybody's strategy is. But I know, in our thinking, we've had so much pricing over the last couple of years that we believe it's -- we're working on getting the right shelf price. So we -- so as you saw in the quarter, we increased our promotion spend a little bit and didn't increase our advertising spend. Now for us, we're coming off a pretty heavy increase in the first quarter of last year. So for us, it's just kind of rebalancing, and we still expect that our advertising spend for the year will be up, pretty much in line with our sales growth, so kind of in that 3% to 5% range. What I do see a number of companies doing and talking about is, again, getting the shelf price right so that they're capturing volume. I think everybody, like we are, are expecting this year's growth to be driven much more by volume than necessarily pricing, as we've seen some amount of stability in commodity prices.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Akshay Jagdale with KeyBanc.","Akshay S. Jagdale - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","I wanted to ask about just the cadence of commodity or raw material costs and what this might imply for perhaps '14. It seems like your guidance assumes significant improvement in gross margins. I'm getting to around 150 basis points in the back half of the year. Can you help us understand like what are we going to see in terms of commodity prices or raw material costs in the back half of the year? And are you taking any positions for 2014? Is 2014 supposed to be a down year in raw material prices? Or is that too sort of early to even think about that?","Gordon M. Stetz","Starting with 2014, I'm reluctant to go that far out with any forecasting, given the volatile environment we've lived through in the past 5 years. So I don't want to talk too specifically about 2014 or our positions. But to help you with our thinking in the back half of the year on the gross margin improvement, it's going to be a combination of things that we discussed in the call. One is certainly the material cost inflation we see easing as we go into the back half of the year, so we're feeling that 3% guidance more in the front half of the year. The second is the CCI for us occurs throughout the year. So we'll be incurring the CCI benefits as we progress, and that will help offset that as we get into the back half of the year and actually help improve margins. And then lastly, the business mix, both within the portfolio and the total portfolio. If you recall that fourth quarter, which is a large quarter for us, was not as strong as we wanted in the fourth quarter for our U.S. consumer business. And our expectation this year is that business will perform better and that, in fact, will have a very positive impact on gross margin. And within our industrial business, we're looking for the product portfolio itself to improve as we look at the pipeline and the types of items we'll be launching, again skewed towards the back half of the year.","Akshay S. Jagdale - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And just one follow-up on your Indian business. Can you give us more color as to what's happening? I know you once you bought the business, you've had made some changes to the distribution model. If I remember correctly, I think you said sales were up 19% but volumes were down. I was surprised by that. I mean I'm aware that basmati rice costs are up, but I was under the impression volumes for the industry are up significantly as well. So can you just help us understand, broader picture, like what's going on in India, what you perhaps learned since you bought that business?","Alan D. Wilson","Well, we've learned a lot and are continuing to learn every day in that market. What I would say is I think our volumes may have been impacted a little bit by pricing, which the industry is broadly taking. And we feel pretty comfortable with our supply chain and distribution model, that we'll be able to show long-term growth in that business. But as always happens as we integrate a new acquisition, we look at the business model. There's a little bit of structural change going on in our business, but we're pretty encouraged by long-term growth there. And in our other joint ventures as well in India, we've seen some pretty solid growth.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Thilo Wrede of Jefferies & Company.","Thilo Wrede - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Could you talk a little bit more about the expansion of Kamis into Russia. Are you taking legacy Kamis products into Russia? Are you taking McCormick products into Russia now? What is the size of the overall opportunity in eastern Europe? And kind of which inning are you in at this point?","Alan D. Wilson","Yes, we're very early. We have a -- we've continued to expand distribution in Russia, primarily with the Kamis brand out of Poland, and we're encouraged by what we're seeing. And primarily, what we're seeing right now is a growth in distribution. Russia, like a lot of more emerging economies, especially in the spice business, is largely a lower-cost bulk business. But as the economy is growing, there's a real interest in modern trade and in safe, convenient packaged products, and that's what we're selling. So we're encouraged by what we're seeing. Russia has been a very, very fast-growing business in our category, and we believe it's got great opportunity for us to continue to invest and expand.","Thilo Wrede - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then, if I take your $0.60 guidance for the second quarter and look at the seasonality between first half and second half of this year, it seems to me that the year is most skewed towards the second half in at least 3 or 4 years. Is that just coincidence or is your business changing to business that is really more biased towards the second half of the year? Is anything going on that we should be aware of?","Alan D. Wilson","Well, historically, our business has skewed towards the end of the year and specifically in the fourth quarter, so we do continue to see that. I think the dynamics this year are a little bit of the comparisons to last year, where we had a weaker end of year last year than we would have liked and have normally experienced, that we expect to get back to more of a normal pattern.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Robert Moskow of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just a couple of questions. I'm surprised no one has mentioned weather as being the primary reason for tough comparisons in quick serve restaurants in the first quarter. And I wanted to know if you thought that the warm weather last year contributed to your strength in that segment last year and set up the tough comp this year. And then conversely, do you think you got a benefit in your consumer business in first quarter? And then secondly, there's a very early Easter in the first quarter, and I want to know if anything got pulled forward into first quarter for the consumer business from the early Easter. And what does that mean for maybe a slower pace of growth in the second quarter?","Alan D. Wilson","Yes. Certainly, last year's weather, and we didn't rely too much on excuses then, but last year's weather certainly impacted a number of our seasonal items early in the year. And we think that did impact, and this year is more of a normalized pattern. So we think that could have happened. As we look at our business to quick service restaurants, we could point specifically to some new product wins, which launched early last year, that drove a lot of that business. There may have been some underlying weather events that -- good weather that got people out, so there may be some impact of that. We've looked at the impact of early Easter in our U.S. business, and we think there may be some slight impact, but not significant, because it was later in the month and only a little bit more than a week earlier than last year. So we think there may be some slight uptick, but we're encouraged by what we've seen in our U.S. consumer business. We think it was good execution on our Super Bowl event that created a pretty good momentum, as well as some more normal weather patterns.","Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Alan, branded food sales for you in the U.S., like your sales to branded food manufacturers you said was flat, but you said you have a lot in the pipeline coming. Can you talk a little bit about your customers there and how they're looking at innovation this year? My perception is that they're doing a lot more, but then again I was surprised to see first quarter being flat. I thought you'd be a little bit higher.","Alan D. Wilson","Yes, I think what I've seen from the food manufacturers, as you well know, a lot of our customers were going through a number of structural changes last year, as they changed -- as some of the companies were being split, some were going through major restructuring, and I think there was more of a focus on managing costs. What I'm seeing right now is back to a focus on growth, but a focus on fewer, bigger initiatives in innovation. So while I'm comfortable that we have a good pipeline and expect to see that benefit us, as we talked about, through the second half of the year, there wasn't the kind of new product activity that we have historically seen early in the year from a number of our customers. Now remember, we're not necessarily a harbinger of what other -- all the companies are doing because if we are participating in a new product launch, we'll benefit from it. They may be still be launching stuff that we're not participating in.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Jonathan Feeney of Janney Montgomery Scott.","Jonathan P. Feeney - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","I just wanted to clarify, I guess, is the discussion you had with Ken on the marketing spending. Was this the plan to kind of have this shift between Q1 and Q2? And if not like -- I mean, did you plan this coming into the fiscal year or did you respond based on the fact, as you talked about, inter-quarter here and see something that made you think you want to spend more in the second quarter?","Alan D. Wilson","No, it was a plan, and a part of that promotion spend is product allowances to get new stuff on the shelf. So we've had -- we typically, in a number of our businesses, don't pay major allowances. But as we launched things like Big Easy Rice and some of the steak sauces, there is a bit of that impact, and it was a part of our plan to be able to do that. I'm a big supporter of continuing to manage and increase our advertising spend, and I think you'll see -- and you've seen it consistently, we've more than doubled it in my tenure. I think you'll continue to see that we'll invest behind the consumer.","Jonathan P. Feeney - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","And I guess just another follow-up. Is it -- you have every reason to believe that one of your main customers in China will recover eventually, and there's some reason to believe, with the promotions going on there, that you'll see recovery in the second half. I mean, how -- if that were not to materialize, is it fair to say then that recovery on that particular customer, that it would be difficult to make your guidance?","Alan D. Wilson","I would not expect that to be the case. I do know that there is a lot of focus on making sure that -- from our customers, that consumers get back in the stores. I'd also say that because of the impact of that business on our overall company that I would not expect that to be the reason that we'd miss. I mean, certainly, it wouldn't help, but we expect a recovery.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Andrew Lazar of Barclays.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just 2 quick things. First, with respect to gross margin in the first quarter. I know you went through a lot of the puts and takes, Gordon. And maybe I don't appreciate the level of inflation that you did have in input costs in the first quarter, just because, usually, if you get 5% of volume growth and 2% of pricing in your consumer business, normally that drives a pretty awesome amount of sort of margin leverage in the quarter. So I'm just trying to get a sense, was there anything else in there that we should be aware of or am I just not appreciating the level of the skew of input costs to sort of the first part of the year versus the second?","Gordon M. Stetz","I wouldn't suggest there's anything else in there, Andrew. Obviously, the $3 million up spend and some of the pricing and promotion impacts gross margin as well, because that's going to be between the gross and net sales line. But the other impact was clearly the industrial business, which not only had the volume declines, but as we mentioned in the call, had a negative mix as well within that business due to, again, some of the timing of the items that we're expecting to occur later in the year.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then, if I had this right, I think last quarter, Alan, you said the level of activity in terms of potential M&A was maybe not as robust as you'd seen in prior years. And I'm just curious if there's any update to that. Like we're still in this very low interest rate environment, obviously it won't be around forever, and from a seller's perspective, it's hard to imagine a time where it'd be more attractive to think about selling an asset.","Alan D. Wilson","Yes, I mean, we still have a pretty active pipeline. And I don't know what's going to happen through the rest of the industry. But I'd say we have an active pipeline that we feel pretty good about, but we're not seeing a flurry of things coming to market at this point. Now a lot of the stuff that we'd be looking at wouldn't necessarily come to market, but we're not -- so I'd say, from our standpoint, we're seeing an active pipeline, but we're not necessarily ready to pull the trigger on anything right now.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Eric Katzman of Deutsche Bank.","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","A couple of questions. It's been a long time since I've heard McCormick talk about higher allowances. I realize that it doesn't sound like it's a big number, but is that -- like, how should I take that? I mean, what does that mean -- like, what's going on, on the shelf that allowances are moving up?","Alan D. Wilson","Well, I think it was a combination of 2 things. One is the kinds of new products that we launched in the first quarter and then secondly, working on getting the right price promotions. So it's -- again, like we said, it's not a big number. It is -- it impacted what you'd see in net sales in the first quarter.","Gordon M. Stetz","I would just differentiate that, Eric, compared to your historical memory, which may be what you're referencing, which was driven by a lot of competitive activity, where this was a combination of what Alan just described. This was new product placement and some planned promotions to drive volume in the quarter.","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So nowadays, when you guys are referring to allowances, you're really referring more to promotion as opposed to having to pay some retailer for shelf space for whatever, 2 or 3 years which...","Alan D. Wilson","You're absolutely right. That's absolutely right.","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then, second, can you -- maybe kind of on an annual basis, you referenced how big the emerging market is as a percentage of the total. You've been putting more emphasis on that in the last couple of years. How much was, like, let's say, your emerging market business up? Do you look at it that way these days, like in the quarter?","Alan D. Wilson","We do on an annual basis, not in the quarter. Gordon is going to see if he can put his hands on the data. But our emerging market business would be up, and we expect it to be up substantially as we complete this deal with Wuhan in China. But we don't necessarily look at it that way in the quarter.","Gordon M. Stetz","Yes. I'll have to circle back to you, Eric. But I mean, clearly, if you look -- think of the components on the consumer side, it was up in strong-double digit for them, so that's definitely a strong number. Clearly, as we talked about the China industrial side of things, it was weaker. So I'd have to see how that adds up in total for you.","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And I guess the reason why I'm asking is because, for the most part, over the last 10-plus years, you guys have executed very well on pretty much every acquisition, except that one in Holland years ago. But it doesn't sound like Kohinoor is doing that well, and that gives me a little bit of pause. I mean, you know we follow this little company, Amira, and they're growing their India business by -- way in double digits in terms of volume. And you're saying that your -- that business is -- that volume was impacted. So I'm kind of -- is that -- like is this something that we need to watch out for? I mean, I guess, it's not that big but then again, emerging markets is where you're putting a lot of capital.","Joyce L. Brooks","Kohinoor specifically was up around 20% in sales in local currency. But that's -- as we said before, it's a combination of pricing, significant double-digit pricing, upwards of 20%, and a small decline in volume, which we feel compared well to some of the other competitors in India. So that's kind of the dynamic we're facing in this fiscal year.","Gordon M. Stetz","Yes, I mean, our understanding, Eric, is that there is sensitivity to price in the basmati rice market. I know there's companies out there talking about their growth. Some of that is distribution-driven. Kohinoor already has a very strong distribution network at 400,000 points, where I believe some of the other conversations you may be hearing are being driven by distribution. So there is some expectation at the type of pricing that you'll see some basmati rice softness, and that does not, in any way, color our view on the opportunity that India presents, because we continue to use that brand name and that distribution system to launch new products. And that was part of the original acquisition plan, and that's continuing to be what we execute against.","Operator","Our next question is from Erin Lash with Morningstar.","Erin Swanson Lash - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","I wanted to follow up on Andrew's earlier question about the acquisition environment. You commented that maybe, from your perspective, while the pipeline is still there, there's not as many maybe opportunities. And I wondered if you could address whether that reflected the quality of the assets that are potentially up for sale or whether it had to do more with the price that sellers are looking for at this point.","Alan D. Wilson","No, I think it's more structurally what's happened in the industry, as companies are kind of consolidating. They went through a major portfolio shift last year, and as companies are consolidating now, they aren't necessarily paring down their portfolio. So some of those established brands that we may expect to see, just as a matter of routine, aren't coming to market right now. On the other hand, a number of the kinds of assets that we look at are individually owned by entrepreneurs, and so theirs are more -- at some point, it will make sense for them to look for an exit strategy. And we get to know them, and we talk to them and make sure they know of our interest, and that's what we would expect. And we've talked about this in the past when we did the Kamis acquisition. We've known that business and that owner for more than a decade, and at a point, it made sense for him. That tends to be more what we're seeing.","Erin Swanson Lash - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","That's very helpful. And then if I could just ask one follow-up on a different note. And I apologize if I missed this, but I was wondering if you could provide any details in terms of how your distribution or distribution gains are going with regard to some of the more alternative type channels like dollar stores and drugstores?","Alan D. Wilson","Yes, we've continued to grow distribution and brand offerings in those channels, which is really strong. Because what we've seen is those channels have migrated from very low priced, not very high quality products in our category to a lot more branded offerings. And so we're benefiting from that both in dollar, the drug channel somewhat. But we're still seeing opportunity for growth there.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Ann Gurkin of Davenport & Company.","Ann H. Gurkin - Davenport & Company, LLC, Research Division","I have 2 questions. One, if I can get an update on your R&D facility that opened, I believe, in January in China, and how we should think about leveraging your now global R&D capabilities. And then my second question has to do with should we still expect a new product or a new flavor delivery item by the end of the year to be launched?","Alan D. Wilson","First, on the technical center, we're very pleased with the expansion and the new innovation center in China, where we have a space now where we can collaborate with customers. We have a culinary center, very much like the model that we have in Hunt Valley, as we've done this in other parts of the world. So we're pretty enthusiastic about that. And we're operating -- we've made some organizational changes about 2 years ago to align our technical function, our R&D function under a Chief Science Officer with Hamed Faridi. And so we're seeing the benefits of that, and it's allowed us to move people from different markets and get some good overlap in experience and leverage our science from one area to the other. So I think we're pleased with that. We are -- the new technology that you're talking about in flavor, we're expecting to be more -- to impact more 2014 and '15 than we are to impact 2013.","Operator","Our last question comes from the line of Chuck Cerankosky of Northcoast Research.","Charles Edward Cerankosky - Northcoast Research","Just a couple quick data points, Gordon. What was the CCI cost savings during the quarter and what was the contribution from the partial recovery from that supplier that was actually a negative in the previous quarter?","Gordon M. Stetz","The CCI cost savings, they occurred fairly evenly throughout the year. So if you take $45 million and assume about 1\/4 of that, that's a good estimate as to what occurred in the quarter. The partial recovery, we're still in discussions, so it's a bit of a sensitive timing issue as we would talk to all the various parties. I would say it was not material in terms of how much we had. It was not material to the quarter.","Charles Edward Cerankosky - Northcoast Research","Not material, but more to come?","Gordon M. Stetz","That depends on the discussions, quite frankly.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the floor back over for closing comments.","Alan D. Wilson","Thanks for your questions, everyone, and participating in the call. McCormick's leaders and employees all around the world are working to overcome the challenges of today's environment, deliver increased sales and profit and build value for our shareholders. Consumer interest in flavor continues to expand in both developed and emerging markets. McCormick is meeting this demand with our growth initiatives, increased global presence and our passion for flavor.","Joyce L. Brooks","Thanks, Alan.

To accompany our call, we've posted a set of slides at ir.mccormick.com. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following our remarks, we will begin a question-and-answer session.

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. As many of you know, we announced back in early December that effective February 1, I'll be transitioning to the role of Executive Chairman and Lawrence will be promoted to President and CEO. This is the next step in a well-planned succession that we, together with our board, take a lot of pride in at McCormick.","I am pleased to be transitioning from my role as CEO at this time. One of my conditions in stepping down was to have the company in great shape with strong financial performance and forward momentum. With our 2015 results and accomplishments and a bullish outlook for 2016, I am very excited about our prospects. Our success is being driven by a clear strategy for growth, a great board and leadership team, and more than 10,000 highly engaged McCormick employees. I want to recognize and thank our employees around the world for their dedication, efforts and achievements.","On a personal note, I've enjoyed my many interactions with investors and analysts during my time as CEO at conferences and one-on-one meetings and other events. While the main focus of these discussions was your questions about McCormick, I've gotten just as much out of our time together receiving feedback and gaining industry insights that helped to shape our strategy and message. I want to let you know how much I've appreciated your support and perspective.","As I turn it over to Lawrence, I want to assure you that I'm confident in his knowledge, experience and ability to lead McCormick into the next period of growth as we continue to build shareholder value. Lawrence?","Lawrence Kurzius","Thank you, Alan, for those remarks and for your confidence. On behalf of McCormick shareholders and employees, I want to recognize Alan for his outstanding leadership as CEO of this great company. During your time as CEO, we've grown sales by $1 billion to $4.3 billion, completed 11 acquisitions, and expanded our geographic presence taking our percentage of sales in emerging markets to 17% from 7%.","Since 2007, we have doubled our brand marketing expense, invested in R&D and consumer analytics, and created fuel for growth with nearly $450 million in cost savings led by your Comprehensive Continuous Improvement program that you and Gordon established. Cash flow from operations is now nearly $600 million, up from $225 million in 2007. The stock price has more than doubled. And our quarterly dividend is now $0.43 per share, up from $0.20 per share. This is an enviable track record. Congratulations, and we look forward to your continued participation as Executive Chairman.","In other leadership news, effective January 1, Malcolm Swift was named President, Global Industrial Segment and McCormick International, adding responsibility for China to his role. Brendan Foley assumed responsibility for the strategic leadership of our Consumer business from me and is named President, Global Consumer Segment and North America. In these roles reporting to me, Brendan and Malcolm will set the strategic and operational goals for our Consumer and Industrial businesses, respectively, as well as assess performance of the segment leaders in each geographic region against these goals. In addition, Brendan will have geographic responsibility for our North American markets and Malcolm for our international markets.","Let's move next to fourth quarter performance. Financial results for this quarter demonstrated that consumer demand for flavor is strong and on the rise and that McCormick has the strategies and the team to drive growth. We had great performance across both segments, and we're particularly pleased with the progress in our U.S. consumer business. The actions we have under way in 2014 and 2015 have led to improved results, and we have good momentum heading into 2016. For the total company, we reported 2% sales growth. In constant currency, we grew sales 8% with higher volume and product mix in our base business contributing half of this increase. We grew consumer segment sales 6% in constant currency with about half of the increase from our base business and half from our acquisitions of Drogheria & Alimentari and Stubb's.","In the Americas, the constant currency sales increase was 3% with Stubb's adding about a one-third of this growth. We're pleased with our results in this period and the further improvement in our U.S. business. In this market, year-on-year category growth for spices and seasonings remains robust at 5% in the quarter. At 4%, retail takeaway for the McCormick brand was close to the category increase. As seen on slide seven, we have achieved a sequential increase from 2% growth in the third quarter and 1% in the second quarter. We had a number of initiatives driving this performance.","We launched our digital purity campaign this quarter with the message, Pure Tastes Better, to emphasize to consumers the quality of our products, and we continue to help consumers prepare flavorful, healthy meals at www.mccormick.com which is now one of the top 50 most visited food and lifestyle sites. Across all of our U.S. websites, we attracted a record 32 million visitors in 2015, up 19% from 2014.","Within the spice and seasoning category is our premium Gourmet line. Our 2015 relaunch of this line has been a real success. Since the rollout of the packaging innovation and new varieties, retail sales are up 5%. And armed with greater category analytics and insights, we had workshop discussions with our top customers on ways to optimize product assortment, pricing and promotion for the spice and seasoning category.","For customers that have already taken action based on these discussions, we grew our category share of 60 basis points on average during the fourth quarter. At some of these customers, category unit volume was up more than 5%. These are great results for our spice and seasoning business. Our investment in brand equity building, strong innovation, and to this, customer interaction with more robust tools is the way forward for us. As we move into 2016, this work transitions from being a turnaround effort to our everyday approach in building value for our customers and for McCormick.","As for our next largest U.S. category, recipe mixes, November 2015 capped off 26 consecutive months of share gains in this category. We are driving these gains with brand equity building and product innovation like gluten-free items, skillet sauces and slow cooker sauces. Through these efforts, our branded sales accounted for more than 100% of the category growth in both 2014 and 2015.","Our consumer business team in Europe, Middle East and Africa, EMEA, continues to post impressive results led by new distribution in Poland. France also contributed to this increase with higher advertising including new product support. In 2015, we launched a distinctive line of origin-specific pure ground Black Pepper that was just named New Product of the Year by the French Product Society.","In constant currency, we grew sales in China 5% in the fourth quarter with some impact from distributors that held back on purchases in anticipation of Chinese New Year promotions in the first quarter of 2016. For the fiscal year, we grew China consumer sales 12% in constant currency. With nearly two months complete, our China consumer business is off to a strong start. And for the fiscal year, we expect to achieve constant currency sales growth in the high-single-digit to low-double-digit range. We see opportunities for further growth of our consumer business in China, especially with the cross-selling of McCormick brand and WAPC brand products. While we are certainly cautious given the current economic environment, keep in mind that our products are a staple in Chinese cooking. And McCormick has a good penetration in traditional markets and other channels, with modern trade accounting for about 20% of consumer sales in this market.","Turning to the industrial segment, our sales growth was particularly strong in the fourth quarter from the year-ago period, up 11% in constant currency. This increase was broad-based with double-digit growth in each of our three regions. While the addition of Brand Aromatics contributed to this increase with exceptional growth in our base business with sales up 9%. Leading our industrial performance again this quarter with constant currency sales up 14% was our team in EMEA. In this region, the greatest growth is with quick-service restaurants through product expansion, distribution gains and their geographic expansion.","In the Americas region, a double-digit constant currency sales increase included 7% added by our base business. In the U.S., our branded food service business had a good quarter and sales to quick-service restaurants showed some improvement from prior periods. It's nearly one year since we acquired Brand Aromatics, and we're pleased with the early results from this business. Mexico also contributed to the increase in this region with higher sales of snack seasonings.","In Australia, we grew sales of new industrial products that are shipped from this region mainly to quick-service restaurants in the region. In China, we have seen a turnaround from the year ago period for our industrial segment, but are also monitoring the macroeconomic impact on this part of our business heading into 2016. In the fourth quarter of 2015, we had a strong finish to the year with constant currency sales up at a double-digit rate including some wins for limited-time menu items through our quick-service restaurant customers. Across both segments, we expected strong fourth quarter sales growth, and our teams around the world delivered.","Fourth quarter profit results were generally in line with our outlook for the quarter. On a constant currency basis, we grew adjusted operating income 10%, and on a reported basis, operating income margin rose 70 basis points. The margin increase was led by the performance in our industrial segment which reached adjusted operating income margin of 11% this quarter, up 350 basis points from the year ago period. We're making great progress from our work to shift the portfolio to more value-added products largely through innovation and from the addition of Brand Aromatics. Also driving margin improvement are our cost savings efforts and the benefits of greater scale in our operations with higher production volume.","Consumer segment adjusted operating income margin declined slightly from the fourth quarter of 2014. We increased brand marketing for this segment 11% this period to build momentum heading into 2016. This rate of increase was well ahead of our 1% reported sales growth for this segment and more than accounted for the lower margin with a 90-basis-point impact. This segment also benefited from our progress with cost savings. As you saw in this morning's press release and as we guided, adjusted earnings per share was up just slightly from the fourth quarter of 2014 due in part to unfavorable currency rates and a benefit in the year-ago period from favorable discrete tax items. Overall, we're pleased with these fourth quarter results and a strong finish to the year.","I'd like to comment next on fiscal year 2015 in total starting with our top line increase of 6% in constant currency. In our consumer segment, we achieved a turnaround in our base sales in the U.S. and strong performance in international markets. Industrial sales ended the year up 7% in constant currency and excluding acquisitions. In addition, we completed three great bolt-on acquisitions that contributed about 1% to higher sales. China became our number two market with robust sales growth of 11% in constant currency.","New products launched in the last three years comprised 8% of sales this year. As in past years, this contribution from new products supports our long-term sales growth algorithm which is one-third of our top line growth coming from innovation. Health and wellness continues to drive our innovation agenda. In addition to developing winning flavors for our industrial customers, globally, approximately 40% of new product briefs also had some type of wellness attribute.","In mid-2015, the USDA first recommended spices and herbs as a way to reduce sodium in the diet in recommendations to school nutritionists and to adults over 65. And in early January, this recommendation made its way into the new 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans. This is consistent with university research study sponsored by the McCormick Science Institute and great news for McCormick.","We delivered record cost savings of $98 million in 2015, up 42% from 2014. While this provided an important offset to higher material costs, we also increased our investment in brand marketing with a 6% increase. Digital marketing is one of our highest-return investments in brand marketing. And in 2015, we continued our shift of marketing spend in this direction reaching approximately 40% of our advertising spend up from 10% in 2010. We've established a leadership position in digital and e-commerce and this was recently recognized by Amazon, which named McCormick Supplier of the Year for grocery, and by L2 with a number 5 ranking of McCormick brand in its digital IQ Index, number 5 out of 114 U.S. food brands.","While adjusted earnings per share of $3.48 was a 3% increase from $3.37 in 2014, we had an estimated 5% impact from unfavorable currency rates. We also overcame significant profit pressure this year from mid single-digit material cost inflation and higher retirement expense. The profit performance for our industrial segment was particularly impressive. In constant currency, adjusted operating income was up 24% due to 8% higher sales, cost savings, and a shift toward more value-added products including our Brand Aromatics acquisition. Adjusted operating income margin ended the year at 9.5%, up from 8.3% in 2014.","Our joint ventures achieved great results led by another year of strong performance from McCormick de Mexico. Sales in local currency for this business rose 11% in 2015. In total, income from unconsolidated operations rose 25% and accounted for 9% of our net income this year. Cash flow from operations was also a record reaching $590 million, a significant increase from the prior high of $504 million in 2014 and driven mainly by working capital improvements. We had good balance on our uses of cash between investments and capital expenditures, acquisitions, share repurchases, and dividends. In November, McCormick's board approved our 30th consecutive annual increase in the quarterly dividend.","Heading into 2016, we have strong momentum, effective growth initiatives, and a lot of excitement. I'll share our plans and outlook and Gordon will go into more in depth in our financial guidance. We continue to see strong alignment between our business and today's consumers that are seeking bolder flavors, exploring ethnic cuisine, buying more fresh ingredients, focused on wellness, and looking for convenience.","Global category growth for our largest category, spices and seasonings, which accounts for about half of our consumer business sales remained robust at 7% in 2015 and Euromonitor projects annual sales growth of 5% globally through 2020. As the largest player in this category in our major markets, McCormick is on the leading edge of these trends with our Flavor Forecast, our product innovation, and our actions to renovate our core business such as the 2016 rollout of Non-GMO labeling for 70% of our U.S. spices, seasonings and extracts and our transition to 80% organic products within our gourmet line.","We expect another year of 4% to 6% constant-currency sales growth with increases in our base business, incremental sales from new products and a carryover benefit from acquisitions completed in 2015. Our base business will be driven by the category growth of our consumer segment and increased demand for many of the products we flavor for our industrial customers, such as snacks and beverages. We continue to support the regional expansion of these customers as well. As an example, a new facility in Dubai will open later this year to establish a local source of supply in the Middle East.","For our consumer segment, we're planning a further increase in brand marketing, approximately $20 million in support of our business in EMEA, our purity message in the U.S. and globally our digital programs. Our brand marketing will also build awareness and trial of new products.","Early in 2016, we began the national U.S. rollout of the herb grinders we discussed on our October call. We're getting great retail acceptance. Other product introductions in the first half of the year include new Grill Mate (sic) [Grill Mates] (18:40) items including seasoning blends, marinade recipe mixes and a new line of liquid 30-minute marinade. Playing off of our Flavor Forecast, we're launching four new gourmet healthy blends such as citrus, chili, chia. In fact, in 2016, we have a total of 56 new products globally that tie in with the Flavor Forecast trends that we've identified. And in addition to new Zatarain's seasoned rice mix varieties, we're launching convenient portable rice cups.","In international markets, we're rolling out Thai chili sauce in our squeezable pouch in China, new recipe mix varieties across Europe, great new baking decorations for our Vahin\u00e9 brand in France. And in Canada, consumers will be seeing herb grinders and liquid La Grille brand sauces on retail shelves. We're equally encouraged by solid pipeline of innovation for our industrial business, much of it in support of large multinational customers. We're also making inroads through new product wins with some rapidly-expanding restaurant chains.","Going back to the factors affecting 2016 sales growth, I want to also comment on pricing. In 2015, pricing added about 1% to sales. Together with our cost savings, this helped offset a mid-single-digit increase in material costs. In 2016, we project low-single digit material cost inflation and plan on pricing to be a primary offset at a 1% to 2% rate, with the rate varying by operating unit.","For example, in our consumer business in Canada, we executed a high-single-digit percentage increase in October to recover both material cost increases and an unfavorable currency impact. In the U.S. consumer business, we recently announced a 2016 price increase. We leveraged our category management tools with a more data-driven approach to by-item increases. Across this business, the average sales impact is a low-single-digit percentage increase, and we expect minimal volume impact.","Across all of our operations around the world, we believe we have the right actions underway in 2016, innovation, brand-building, pricing, with the right tools and the right team to drive sales growth. Employees throughout McCormick are also working to improve productivity, our fuel for growth. We have targeted another year of significant cost savings in 2016 with a goal to achieve at least $95 million. Work is well underway to deliver this amount which we expect to lead to higher gross profit margin and higher operating income margin for the year.","However, we operate in what is a still challenging environment for many of our customers: food retailers in our consumer business and for our industrial business, packaged food and beverage companies as well as restaurants. Also, we expect some further profit pressure from currency, and as I indicated, material cost inflation. Excluding the unfavorable impact of currency, at the bottom line, we project a 9% to 11% increase in adjusted earnings per share from $3.48 in 2015. Gordon will provide more details on our outlook.","But before I turn it over to him, let me summarize. Our 2015 results, including the improvements in our U.S. consumer business, demonstrates the alignment of our business with today's consumer and the effectiveness of our strategies. We are excited about our plans and potential for even greater growth in 2016, with new products, incremental marketing, distribution expansion opportunities and tools for better retail partnership. Our acquisition pipeline is strong, and we have aggressive cost savings programs underway and a culture of participation and high performance. McCormick's focus on growth, performance and people is driving success.","It's now my pleasure to turn it over to Gordon. Gordon?","Gordon Stetz","Thanks, Lawrence, and good morning, everyone. I want to take a moment with McCormick's analysts and investors on the call to also recognize Alan for his strong leadership, his friendship and his accomplishments as CEO. It's been an honor and a privilege to be CFO during his tenure and to partner with Alan and the entire executive team, steering our strategy and organization and delivering high performance. And Lawrence, I'm looking forward to working with you when you step into this role on February 1, and that's this Monday in case you needed a reminder.","Lawrence shared some initial remarks on our fourth quarter results, and we provided some financial details in this morning's press release and our accompanying slides. Given this background, I'll move through my remarks on the quarter quickly, make a few additional points and then finish with the details of our 2016 outlook.","On a constant currency basis, the underlying growth in sales was a step-up from what we have seen year-to-date with an 8% increase that included 3% added by acquisitions. We had a full impact this quarter from Brand Aromatics and Drogheria & Alimentari and from Stubb's which was completed towards the end of the quarter.","Slide 16 shows that the base business growth for both the consumer and industrial segments was driven mainly by volume, the result of our product innovation, increased brand marketing, expanded distribution, and regional presence and other business-building work with our customers. In the consumer segment, we had 3% constant currency sales growth in the Americas with about a one-third of the increase from Stubb's. Base business sales growth in this region was led by higher U.S. sales of spices and seasonings including Grill Mates and our Lawry's brand, as well as gourmet items and Hispanic products.","We had good retail sell-through as Lawrence described and are encouraged with the trajectory of sales as we head into 2016. In EMEA, we continued to achieve strong sales performance, up 18% in constant currency. This increase was driven by D&A which added 11% to sales growth, expanded distribution in Poland, and our performance in France with new products and brand marketing.","In constant currency, we grew consumer segment sales in China 5% as Lawrence described. And Australia had a high-single-digit sales increase from new distribution and new products in that market. We indicated last quarter that we were exiting some lower-margin product lines in our Kohinoor portfolio in India. In total, the constant currency sales decline in Kohinoor sales lowered our consumer business growth rate in the Asia Pacific region by 3 percentage points, more than accounting for the volume decline shown on slide 19.","For the Consumer segment in total, our fourth quarter adjusted operating income was down 2% from the year-ago period. In constant currency, adjusted operating income rose 1% from the year-ago period with the impact of sales growth and cost savings more than offsetting the unfavorable impact of material costs and benefit expense.","Turning to our Industrial segment, we had excellent results this quarter in both sales and profit even with unfavorable currency rates, and as Lawrence indicated, this business reached an 11% adjusted operating income margin as the result of our CCI program, scale from higher sales and shift to more value-added products, including the addition of Brand Aromatics.","On slide 22, sales of Brand Aromatics contributed 4% to our growth in the Americas. Higher base business volume and product mix this quarter versus the year-ago period was led by U.S. sales of branded food service products as well customized flavor solutions. Mexico also contributed to the increase with sales of seasonings largely for snack products.","Our Industrial business in EMEA capped off an impressive year with constant currency sales up 14% in the fourth quarter. We are a trusted and valued supplier, supporting the growth and geographic expansion of leading quick service restaurants and food manufacturers in this region.","We grew Industrial segment sales in the Asia Pacific region 11% in constant currency. In China, we are benefiting from further recovery in demand from quick service restaurants. And in Australia, our growth includes new products wins with these customers.","Adjusted operating income for the Industrial segment rose 52% from the fourth quarter of 2014. In constant currency, the growth was even greater at 62% with the factors I already mentioned as spelled out on slide 25. Across both segments, adjusted operating income, which excludes special charges, rose 6%. If we also exclude the impact of unfavorable currency, we grew adjusted operating income by 10%.","In a turnaround from the three previous quarters, gross profit margin was up year-on-year in the fourth quarter with a 30 basis-point increase. As we moved into the fourth quarter, we had the full benefit of our cost savings and pricing actions along with the benefit of higher sales and higher throughput in our plants. These factors were offset in part by the significant sales increase this period by our Industrial segment which has a lower gross profit margin than our Consumer segment.","As a percentage of net sales, our selling, general and administrative expense was down 40 basis points as a result of our cost savings activity and leverage with higher sales. This includes a 13% fourth quarter increase in brand marketing from the year-ago period.","Below the operating income line, the tax rate this quarter was 29.9%, a bit above our 29% guidance and a significant increase from 25.9% in the fourth quarter of 2014 when we had the benefit of discrete tax items. For the 2015 fiscal year, our tax rate was impacted by several favorable discrete items and ended the year at 26.5%. As we head into 2016, we anticipate a tax rate of approximately 28%.","Despite an unfavorable currency impact for our joint venture in Mexico, income from unconsolidated operations rose slight this quarter. However, underlying growth remained quite strong with sales for McCormick de Mexico up 10% in local currency.","At the bottom line, fourth quarter 2015 adjusted earnings per share was $1.18, up $0.02 from the year-ago period, mainly due to higher adjusted operating income, partly offset by the higher tax rate. This result included an unfavorable impact from currency on both consolidated and unconsolidated income.","Turning next to slide 30, we've summarized highlights for cash flow and the quarter-end balance sheet. As Lawrence shared, our year-to-date cash flow from operations was a record $590 million compared to $504 million in the year-ago period, mainly due to working capital improvements. In 2015, we returned $351 million of cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. While dividend payments were up 6%, share repurchases were down from 2014 because of our acquisition activity. Our share repurchases in 2015 contributed to a 1.4% reduction in diluted shares, and we have $567 million remaining on our current $600 million authorization.","During the fourth quarter, we completed a previous $400 million share repurchase program authorized in April of 2013. In the absence of any acquisitions in 2016, we expect to lower our share count by approximately 2%.","During the quarter, we were pleased to complete the issuance of $250 million of 10-year notes at a 3.25% rate in anticipation of long-term debt that was maturing. At year end, our debt to adjusted EBITDA was slightly above our target range of 1.5% to 1.8%, following the financing of our three acquisitions completed in 2015. Our balance sheet remains sound. We are generating strong cash flow and we are well-positioned to fund future investments to drive growth.","Building on Lawrence's remarks, I'll wrap up with our outlook for continued momentum in sales and profit growth in fiscal year 2016. We anticipate increases in sales, adjusted operating income, and adjusted earnings per share that are at or above our long-term objectives, excluding the impact of currency exchange rates. Our current projections are based on prevailing rates, and given the level of currency volatility in the market, we will be updating this outlook for you each quarter.","We expect to grow sales 4% to 6% in constant currency. This includes a carryover benefit of 1% to 2% from acquisitions completed in 2015, and higher pricing at 1% to 2%. Based on prevailing rates, we estimate an unfavorable impact from currency of about 4 percentage points, which will lower this range to 0% to 2% on a reported basis.","Excluding the impact of currency, our projected increase in adjusted operating income is 9% to 11% from adjusted operating income of $614 million in 2015. Currency is expected to lower this range by about 4 percentage points to 5% to 7%. We expect to drive this increase from higher sales and at least $95 million in cost savings, savings that include our CCI program and some carryover benefit from previously announced organization and streamlining actions.","Our guidance also includes plans for an increase in brand marketing of at least $20 million and our projection for low-single-digit material cost inflation that we should more than offset with our pricing actions and cost reductions.","Our guidance for adjusted earnings per share is $3.65 to $3.72. Excluding the estimated four-percentage-point impact of unfavorable currency rates, this is an increase of 9% to 11% from adjusted earnings per share of $3.48 in 2015. This growth rate is in line with our long-term objective. Some of the other puts and takes behind this projected growth rate are favorable impacts of higher operating income and further reduction of shares outstanding in the absence of acquisition activity.","Expected offsets include the unfavorable currency impact as well as a higher tax rate. Due to the unfavorable impact of currency rates and material cost inflation for our joint venture in Mexico, our 2016 income from unconsolidated operations is likely to be down slightly from 2015.","For the first quarter of 2016, there are several factors that will have an unfavorable impact on our earnings per share. First, we anticipate an impact from currency in the first quarter that could be above the annual estimate, since we will not have yet lapped the larger increases in 2015. Second, we have plans to kick off 2016 with an up-spend in brand marketing to support our core business as well as new product launches.","In addition, we expect a higher year-on-year tax rate. Recall that in the first quarter of 2015, the tax rate was 24.8% as the result of discrete tax items. As a result, EPS in the first quarter of 2016 is expected to be down slightly from $0.70 of adjusted EPS in the first quarter of 2015.","For the fiscal year 2016, we expect another year of strong cash flow. This will provide funding for share repurchases and a quarterly dividend increase from $0.40 to $0.43 approved by the board in November. We also have plans for an increased level of capital expenditures in 2016 of $150 million to $160 million. This is up slightly from our normal run rate of 3% of sales and includes a larger manufacturing plant in Shanghai where we have outgrown our current facility.","That completes my remarks on our 2016 outlook. So let's open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question is from the line of Alexia Howard with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.","Alexia Howard","Hi, everyone.","Gordon Stetz","Good morning.","Lawrence Kurzius","Good morning.","Alan Wilson","Good morning, Alexia.","Alexia Howard","Hello there. So can I ask on the U.S. Consumer business? It sounds as though it's on a better trajectory in terms of market share. Does that mean that those smaller brands that have been plaguing you for the last 18 months or so are kind of now, I guess, stabilizing or actually going back? I just want to hear about how things are going on a category management front. Thank you.","Alan Wilson","All right. Thank you, Alexia. We think we're making great progress with the improvement actions that we started in the early part of 2014 to build brand equity, accelerate innovation, and to win at retail. We really think that we've gotten a good handle on this. We have worked with our leading customers with our new tools on both category management, assortment management, and pricing management. And we think that we've made a great deal of progress and really have some positive momentum building in this part of our business.","In many of the subcomponents of the category, we're clearly gaining share and with many of the individual customers, we're gaining share as well. So we think we turned the corner on the problem and are in a position to build from a base of strength that's been established by some of the heavy lifting done over the last two years.","Alexia Howard","Great. And then as a quick follow-up, it looked as though you had very good net price realization on your U.S. Consumer business this time. I'm assuming that was a positive mix shift with less pressure from the world markets season brand this time around. And yet the profits were only up modestly and gross margin didn't move too much. Were there other offsets in there that put pressure on the performance this time around? Thank you. And I'll pass it on.","Gordon Stetz","Yes. I mean, there was no pricing again in the U.S. business that we took this year. So part of it was mix, part of it was some of the noise in the data associated with some of the actions we took with the weighting of some of our products. But, generally, we're in a position, as Lawrence said, to be able to execute pricing in that business as we've mentioned in our conference call.","We had some acquisition-related cost in the U.S. Consumer side of things related to Stubb's. So some of the profit realization was impacted by that. And in total, the gross margin improved. We are continuing to spend up against our brand. You saw the increase in brand marketing of $9 million in the quarter. That's pretty substantial. So we think that's important as well to build the business for the future. So that also was impactful on the quarter in terms of profit realization.","Alexia Howard","Great. Thank you very much and congratulations on the CEO transition. Looking forward to working with you, and great working with you in the past, Alan.","Alan Wilson","Thank you.","Lawrence Kurzius","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line Robert Moskow of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead with your question.","Robert Moskow","Hi. Thank you.","Alan Wilson","Good morning, Rob.","Robert Moskow","It's really good to see the progress in North America, but you did say that you're going to initiate some pricing for 2016. I think you said very low single-digit across. Can you give us a little more color on what parts of the business you're going to implement that pricing on? And also talk about \u2013 a lot of grocers, I think, are worried more about deflation and investors are worried about it, too. You seem to still have inflation in your system. How will your base pricing actions be in relation to competition? And then also private label, do you expect your competition in private label to also increase by the same amount? Are they experiencing the same kind of inflation on packaging and materials that you're experiencing? Thanks.","Alan Wilson","Sure, Rob. First of all, we have not taken any pricing action in the U.S. for the last two years while we address some of the fundamental challenges in that part of our business. But as we have worked with the price elasticity tools and have been able to model the category more robustly, we've identified many areas where there are opportunities for us to adjust our pricing. The price increase that we've planned in our U.S. business has really been worked through at quite a granular level on an item-by-item basis. Some items are moving down as well as some items moving up, but the net increase will be in the 1% to 2% range. This has already been taken to our customers, so this is out in the field right now. And we've gotten really no meaningful pushback on it at all.","Our basket of commodities is different than the basket of commodities than most of our peer companies. And there's good cost justification for the increase that we're taking. It's really not around packaging. Packaging is actually kind of in a bit of a deflationary mode. It's more around some of our more iconic raw material. And we believe that the cost pressures around those iconic raw materials, if anything, we're better positioned than our direct competitors on those items due to our global sourcing capability. So our competitors would be feeling that same pressure as well.","Robert Moskow","That's helpful. And...","Michael Smith","Rob, this is Mike Smith. We have seen our competitors take pricing already in some cases, and we do think private label will move also.","Robert Moskow","Very helpful. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Akshay Jagdale with Jefferies. Please go ahead with your question.","Akshay Jagdale","Good morning, and congratulations again, Alan, on the career. And Lawrence, congrats on your appointment. Looking forward to it. So first question is just a follow-up on commodities. Can you specifically talk a little bit about pepper and what your expectation is that's embedded in your overall commodity outlook as far as pepper goes?","Michael Smith","Hi, Akshay. It's Mike Smith again. As you know, the price of pepper has risen over the past five years from about $1 a pound to $5 a pound spot, but we've seen a lot more planning over the last couple years and we see a stabilization in the price of pepper as we continue to work with farmers globally to increase acreage and increase yield. So those assumptions are built into our low-single-digit commodity price increase this year. So we think we've seen the peak. Hopefully, longer term it's a downward trend.","Akshay Jagdale","Perfect. And then just on North America, you mentioned share gains in the customer accounts where they've implemented most of the changes you've suggested. What percentage of your sales did those customers account for roughly? And can you just help us understand sort of the dialog that the pushback perhaps that you're getting there and maybe what your argument is when you do get that pushback? I mean, one of the arguments that we've heard is just generally there's more fragmentation of share across many categories and that's perhaps driven by consumers wanting more choice than more sort of smaller authentic brands, but we'd love to know sort of what your category management analysis is telling you. And then if you could give us some sense of the customers that you are seeing success, how much of your portfolio they represent? That'll be great. Thank you.","Alan Wilson","Sure Akshay. I don't want to speak too specifically about any one customer. I will say that the basket of customers that we have approached now is roughly 50% of our volume and the set of recommendations that we make for those customers are quite extensive. As a group, there's quite a span of adoptions. So, some of those customers have literally taken on our full recommendation or as others have cherry-picked it a bit depending on their strategy. This is going to be an ongoing process. We're working with these customers to get the recommendations that we think are best for the category, which, generally, are also the best recommendation for us and as well accepted. And we continue to work with additional customers. This started as an extraordinary effort. It's really become our main way of working in sales. It's just a more fact-based, analytic-based approach to the customer that the more sophisticated customers, in particular, appreciate. And they tend to be the larger and faster-growing customers as well. You guys want to add anything to that?","Lawrence Kurzius","No. Well done.","Akshay Jagdale","I'll pass it on. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Growe with Stifel. Please go ahead with your questions.","Christopher Growe","Hi. Good morning.","Alan Wilson","Good morning, Chris.","Christopher Growe","I'd like to add my well wishes to you, Alan, and I look forward, as well, Lawrence, talking with you. So, I just had two quick questions. If you look at the quarter \u2013 I'm sorry, for the year, what sort of emerging market growth did you have? If you can give that maybe on an underlying basis, and I was just curious how India and China and maybe perhaps this is more of a fourth quarter question, really influence that growth rate?","Alan Wilson","Well, on a go-forward basis, we're still robust on China. We know there's a lot of discussion around China. We're obviously very aware of the economic discussion going on there but our own business we're anticipating that continues to do well. India, as you know, we've taken actions to focus more on the branded component of that business. So, as we look forward into 2016, we expect India actually to be a drag as we lap the anniversary of our exit of the broken and bulk rice.","So, you'll see noise in the Asia Pacific numbers as we progress through the year where we'll try and help you understand what's going on in the mix of that business. But again, we anticipate China being a good performer and India as we have rebased that business, that will be a negative on the sales line.","Lawrence Kurzius","Chris, I want to just expand on China just a bit because it has grown to be such a large contributor to our total business. We're aware of the macroeconomic pressure around the China market, which does make us cautious, but we're also quite optimistic about our business in China. A great deal of the carnage that's happened around us has been more in the modern trade portion of the business. That part of our business is slow as well but it only accounts for about 20% of our consumer business in China. Much more of our business in particular, thanks to the acquisition that we did a couple of years ago is more directed to the interior, to the smaller cities and through a more traditional trade outlet. So, we have continued to experience quite robust growth of our consumer business in China.","For the year, we were up I think 11% in China in 2015. It was a little bit slower in the fourth quarter, but some of that was some anticipation of the Chinese New Year promotions that were coming beginning in December, which for us is fiscal 2016. I don't want to comment too much on 2016 but the opening of our year in China on the consumer side of our business has been really quite strong. And I focus my remarks on the consumer side because for us China has really become predominantly a consumer business. Years ago, China was more of an industrial business for us, and that's how we got our foothold there. But with the continued growth of our consumer business and with the addition of the acquisition we did a couple of years ago, that business is now more [indiscernible] about two-thirds consumer.","Christopher Growe","Okay. That's very helpful. Maybe along the same lines, I just was curious about...","Lawrence Kurzius","I was just there with the China team last week and met with the management over there. Actually, Alan and I went over as part of our internal transition communication. And so, it gave us an opportunity to meet firsthand with the China team and they continue to be quite optimistic.","Christopher Growe","That's great. Thank you for the color. Just a quick follow-up on the acquisition outlook and just get a sense of like the pipeline and really where you are focused today. Are you seeing any opportunities given some of the macroeconomic uncertainties in emerging markets? Just curious how the pipeline looks here today.","Lawrence Kurzius","I'll say that we always have an active pipeline of acquisition project, and we're always in dialogue with some potential targets. And that is the case today, but I really can't say too much more than that.","Christopher Growe","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Brett Hundley with BB&T. Please go ahead with your questions.","Brett Hundley","Hey. Good morning, gentlemen, and Alan and Lawrence, congratulations to you both. I don't know what they're doing with all that mayonnaise in Mexico, but it's good to see. Gordon, I have a few questions for you around your cost savings program for 2016, your outlook there. So, I'm curious on how the achievement of your cost savings in 2016 fits into your guidance range. Should we just think about that as kind of in the middle of the guidance range? And then, as far as, thinking about the net benefit to earnings, should I be thinking about something like a net $75 million benefit to earnings just from taking the $20 million add-in spend that you might have on the marketing side and then you're going to have pricing mostly covering input cost inflation, is that the right way to think about it?","Gordon Stetz","Well, in terms of the program itself and the realization, I would say, I'd put it this way, in 2016, our anticipation of the use of those benefit is more in line with how we had hoped the program would run, which means we'd have a portion of it read through into reinvestment in the brands, which we indicated we're doing through the up spend of $20 million plus. It will also blend partially some of the pricing, and obviously we have other costs in our system as well as it relates to salary increases, et cetera, that are built into our forecast. So, I'd just say the combination of all those things end up feeding into the total outlook that we have. I prefer not to parse about how much of it's going to go to the bottom line, how much of its used. But the net-net is obviously an improvement in margin structure that we had hoped that this program would generate both on the gross and operating income line.","Brett Hundley","And should we still think about a bigger piece of that pie coming from the gross margin line, or would you see more cost benefits in the future coming from the SG&A line?","Gordon Stetz","We're still more heavily weighted towards the cost of goods sold as a generator of these savings. But, obviously, we continue to look at SG&A and we took actions last year, and we're looking to leverage our SG&A structure as we grow.","Brett Hundley","Okay. And then just a final question for me on the industrial business, really solid growth during the quarter, a really solid margin. And I wanted to ask a question surrounding either driving margins higher or sustaining some of the margin that you saw in Q4 just given the growth profile and potential of the top-line there. If you can somewhat close the gap on your margins relative to your consumer business, I think it can really be a positive for you guys going forward. And I'm curious on how that margin sustainability or even growth from here works, whether it's something that's solely related to mix or if there's some production optimization in there as well.","And I think what I'm really trying to get at here is, when you think about the ingredients industry and the move by a lot of food and beverage companies towards natural, I think it can really help you guys from a volume standpoint as more and more people use spices and herbs, whether it's for coloring, flavoring, et cetera. But if you can move up the value chain, say for maybe a bulk spice and herb towards an extract or something like that, maybe you can benefit on the price side and the margin side as well. And so, I wanted to ask a question about how the growth or sustainability in margin improvement within industrial goes going forward? Thank you.","Lawrence Kurzius","Hey, Brett, this is Lawrence. I'll start and then I'm going to pass this over to Gordon. Some parts of your question, it sounded like you are reading out of some of our internal strategy document. Certainly, improving the product mix and moving towards flavors and more value-added technically differentiated product is part of the margin equation, and the overall trend in our industry towards more natural, less artificial is an important driver of volume for us because this is an area where we think that we got particular expertise.","I think in our remarks, we indicated that about 40% of the briefs that we get from our customers include some wellness aspect and this is an area that is an opportunity for us to get leverage and is part of driving our margins higher. And there are parts of our business that are higher margin than others, and the flavor end and the more technically differentiated end is separately where the best opportunities are.","Gordon, you want to elaborate on that?","Gordon Stetz","I would just add that, obviously, the CCI program for the industrial business is designed both to improve margin and to help us reinvest in R&D to help us drive the mix shift towards a higher margin. So, that's part of the equation as well.","Brett Hundley","And I'm sorry, but I mean just \u2013 Lawrence, is 11% a high watermark in your opinion?","Gordon Stetz","Well, this is Gordon jumping in. We haven't put a boundary on it candidly. For those of you who followed us for quite some time, 8% to 10% has been the goal. And as we went through periods of high inflation that gets interrupted because we have pass-through mechanisms that interrupt that margin improvement or at least mask the optics of it. But we're obviously close to that 10% where we landed years here, so it's not as if we put a ceiling on this. It's something that we continue to evaluate. And we'll look forward to improving that even still. But there hasn't been a specific target or ceiling that we put out on that business.","Brett Hundley","Okay. I'll yield the floor.","Joyce Brooks","Yeah. I think with another call coming up at 8:30, we probably have to end our Q&A there. And, Lawrence, I know you had some remarks to share. I'll turn it over to you.","Lawrence Kurzius","Great. First, I'd like to thank you all for your questions and to everyone who is on the call today, both the questioners and the listeners. Yeah, thank you for participating in today's call. Consumer demand for flavor is on the rise. It's driving growth for McCormick. Our geographic presence and product portfolio are expanding and aligned with the move towards healthier eating, fresh ingredients, ethnic cuisine, and bold taste. This is evident in our 2015 results and along with our strategies, gives us confidence in our 2016 outlook as we grow our business and build value for our shareholders. I hope all of you who are in the snow-impacted areas this weekend cooked a lot of McCormick Chili and a lot of Zatarain's Gumbo. Thank you all for your participation on the call.","Joyce Brooks","Thanks, Lawrence, and to everyone on the call. If anyone has additional questions regarding today's information, please give us a call at 410-771-7244. This concludes this morning's call."],"14244":["McCormick & Company, Inc.

This is Kasey Jenkins, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you for joining today\u2019s call for a discussion of McCormick\u2019s Second Quarter Financial Results and our current outlook for 2017. To accompany this call, we have posted a set of slides at ir.mccormick.com. [Operator Instructions]","With me this morning are Lawrence Kurzius, Chairman, President and CEO and Mike Smith, Executive Vice President and CFO.","During our remarks, we will refer to non-GAAP financial measures. These include adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share that exclude the impact of special charges as well as information in constant currency. Reconciliations to the GAAP results are included in this morning\u2019s press release and slides. As a reminder, today\u2019s presentation contains projections and other forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those projected. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or other factors. As seen on Slide 2, our forward-looking statement, also provide information on risk factors that could affect our financial results.","It is now my pleasure to turn the discussion over to Lawrence.","Lawrence Kurzius","Thank you, Kasey. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. McCormick\u2019s strong second quarter results reflect the effectiveness of our sales and profit growth strategies driven by the engagement of our employees around the world. We delivered growth in sales, operating income and earnings per share. With our year-to-date financial results and momentum heading into the second half of the year, we are well-positioned to deliver our financial outlook for fiscal 2017.","Our strength this quarter was evident in our top line results. In constant currency, we grew sales 7% for the total company with solid performance from both segments. Base business growth, new products and acquisitions are three drivers of long-term sales growth were all contributing factors. Year-to-date, we have grown sales in constant currency 6%. And based on these results, we reaffirmed our fiscal year outlook for a 5% to 7% constant currency sales increase.","In the second quarter, we increased constant currency adjusted operating income 9%, led by the higher sales and savings from our comprehensive continuous improvement program, CCI. Similar to the first quarter, both segments increased operating income. Year-to-date, we have also achieved a 9% constant currency increase, which is within our fiscal year 9% to 11% objective. At the bottom line, second quarter adjusted earnings per share of $0.82 was 9% higher than the year ago period. Our strong growth in adjusted operating income drove this increase as well as our higher income from unconsolidated operations and lower shares outstanding. Keep in mind that this year-to-year comparison of adjusted earnings per share for the second quarter includes the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates. For the fiscal year 2017, we reaffirm our outlook for adjusted earnings per share of $4.05 to $4.13.","I would like to turn next to some business updates with the focus this morning on highlights from our consumer and industrial segments, our great new product lineup for the second half of 2017, and finally, touch on some of our recent announcements. For the consumer segment update, I will start with the Americas, where we grew constant currency sales by 5%, including 2% from our acquisition of Gourmet Gardens. The remaining 3% was driven by higher pricing, volume and product mix. This growth was the sequential improvement from the first quarter, which is impacted by U.S. food industry slowdown. In our March call, we expressed our belief that the slowdown for spices and seasoning categories was short-term attributable to a confluence of likely temporary factors and we would see growth in our second quarter 2017 sales. This has been borne out.","In the U.S., our IRI data indicated strong second quarter category dollar sales for spices and seasonings at 7%. During the same period, scanner sales of McCormick\u2019s U.S. branded spices and seasonings grew 4%. It is important to consider, however, unmeasured channels, including club, e-commerce and Hispanic retail chains. And in doing so, we estimate we grew McCormick\u2019s U.S. retail sales for spices and seasonings another 2 percentage points. Overall, we are seeing good growth in our spice and seasoning brands in the U.S. market and we know we have more room to grow as consumers are increasingly shifting their buying between channels and the industry outlook reflects a greater share of growth coming from e-commerce, club and discount formats, we are pleased with the double-digit sales growth we have experienced in unmeasured channels and expect it to continue.","The shift to unmeasured channels is just one indication that the food industry is operating in a period of rapid and fundamental change in both consumer preferences and in evolving retail landscape. Quarter-to-quarter, our sales growth is going to be impacted by retailer actions and other marketplace factors in this dynamic environment. We are, however, well-positioned to capitalize on these changes through increased and agile consumer marketing investments, a focus on customer intimacy and product innovation. We are staying relevant with the consumer and have a compelling product offering for every retail strategy and channel.","Our outlook for the U.S. sales of spices and seasonings for the balance of the year remains strong and unchanged from our prior projections. We are confident the initiatives we have underway position us to continue our trajectory of long-term growth. This optimism for our Americas consumer business is bolstered by several factors and successes. First, as I have already discussed our strength in continued growth in unmeasured channels. We are excited about the strength in our grilling platform. In May, we released our McCormick 2017 Flavor Forecast Annual Grilling Edition featuring recipes for five sizzling flavors using products from our core spices and seasonings as well as dry and wet recipe mixes. In addition, Grill Mates and Stubb\u2019s barbecue consumption is growing and we are investing in Grill Mates TV advertising in the third quarter.","Additionally, our Canadian business has grown its grilling platform double-digits versus last year through a strong promotional campaign, expanded distribution and growth in Stubb\u2019s. Gourmet Garden continues to build momentum in the U.S., with consumption growth over 20% and household penetration better than expected. During the second quarter of 2017, we have built on the distribution we established in late 2016 and introduced Gourmet Garden lightly dried products in Canada, with strong retail acceptance. Our closer-to-fresh platform is resonating with consumers\u2019 desire for fresh flavor and ingredients.","Our U.S. gourmet product line is growing in dollars and units due to organic trends and new distribution in addition to lapping the disruption we experienced last year from the conversion of the product line to organic. Outside of spices and seasoning, we are growing share in recipe mixes, Asian foods, stock and broth, wet marinades and marinades. Canada has gained share through the success of organic spice bags as well as positive consumer response to our Purity campaign. We have strong retail acceptance of our first half new products and distribution gains, including Grill Mates and Stubb\u2019s marinades, Kitchen Basics Bone Broth, Lawry\u2019s Casero products and Zatarain\u2019s biscuit and cornbread mixes. In a few minutes, I will talk about our exciting new products for the second half of the year. And importantly, our products remain well aligned and on trend with consumer demand for flavorful healthy eating.","Now, turning to outside the Americas, in Europe, Middle East and Africa, EMEA, a difficult environment driven by economic, political and competitive factors has persisted and affected our consumer business. The primary impact is in the UK, where challenging retail environment has hindered our performance driven by large retailers\u2019 reduction of shelf space for food products. Given these conditions, it is particularly important to keep our brands relevant through marketing and new products. We have invested in both marketing with the launch of our Purity campaign in the UK and in new products, which I will speak about further in a few minutes.","In the Asia-Pacific region, China grew sales in the second quarter of 2017 at a double-digit rate in constant currency. China\u2019s growth was broad-based across our different brands and channels, including e-commerce. And we expect this performance to continue throughout 2017. We are also pleased with our performance in India, where sales also grew at a double-digit rate as we have lapped the impact of our prior decision to discontinue certain low margin Kohinoor products. Second quarter sales across the consumer segment were up 4% over the year ago period in constant currency. With the benefit of higher sales and our CCI led cost savings, we grew second quarter adjusted operating income 7% in constant currency.","Turning to the industrial segment, we had excellent performance. Starting at the top line, with 12% constant currency sales growth, in the Americas we continued to benefit from shifting our portfolio to more value added products, expanded distribution, the increasing trend in consumer snacking from our customers moved towards better for you products. A significant part of our volume increase for the quarter was driven by new products. At double digit growth in sales of savory flavor products as well as in snack seasonings, particularly from our Latin American business. We continue to make inroads with additional restaurant chains winning business using a Flavor Cell technology. In our branded food service business we had solid sales growth driven by expanded distribution. And we were recognized as vendor partner of the year by a significant food service customer. Together these successes are driving only our top line growth, but strong profit growth as well.","In EMEA incremental sales from our Giotti acquisition contributed double digit sales growth for the second quarter of 2017. Our integration is progressing well and we are pleased with Giotti\u2019s performance, days sales in the region excluding the impact of Giotti also grew at a double digit rate in constant currency. We continue to win with our customers through new products, expanded distribution and promotional activities with quick service restaurants. Industrial sales in the Asia Pacific region mainly Thailand, China and Australia benefited from new products and promotional activity of quick service restaurants. In addition to the segment\u2019s overall 12% constant currency sales growth, our cost reduction efforts and portfolio shift to more value added products drove a 13% constant currency increase in adjusted operating income.","Now I am delighted to share with you our robust second half plans for new products in our consumer segment. Our new products are important to us to differentiate our brands and drive growth. Our U.S. business as seen on Slide 8 has three robust upcoming new product platforms. First as mentioned during our Investor Day in April, we are thrilled to extend our presence into the breakfast occasion with the McCormick Good Morning. The breakfast occasion offers a tremendous opportunity to leverage our flavor expertise beyond where McCormick is typically found. Consumers are looking for ways to bring great flavors to today\u2019s breakfast tables without all the sugar or artificial ingredients in many of today\u2019s products. We will be launching a range of four product lines with clean labels; Breakfast Toppers, Breakfast Seasonings, Slow Cooker Breakfast and Smoothie Boosts, aligns with one of our great flavor while also delivering benefits like real fruit, flax and chia seeds and boost protein. Consumer research has been outstanding and customer reaction positive.","New products in our liquid portfolio also offer exciting growth opportunities. We are introducing McCormick Simply Better wet gravies in three varieties, made with real ingredients including stock, vegetables and McCormick herbs and spices, these ready to serve gravies will be a hearty addition to holiday and everyday meals this fall, plus there are no artificial flavors, no added MSG, they are gluten free and are in BPA free packaging. Simply Asia brought the noodle new products to capitalize on current trends and ethnic flavors. The Vietnamese Beef Broth and the Japanese Chicken Broth coupled with the introduction of four noodle varieties offers consumers the opportunity to prepare authentic Asian dishes at home. And continuing our strong momentum with Bone Broth we are introducing two new flavors beef bone broth and turmeric and ginger with lemongrass. We are enthusiastic about spices and seasonings with the launch of over 30 new SKUs, significant increase from our product innovation in the category versus previous years. In response to consumers trading up to larger sizes, we are launching a new super deal format that offers a better value and includes new flavors and we are upsizing some of our pure specialty extracts.","Additionally, we are launching a new range of pasta seasoning blends with flavors like white cheddar and sun-dried tomato basil, premium garlic products like black garlic powder and even a Turkey Brine & Rub Kit for the holiday. Our line up for products outside the U.S. is just as exciting. In Canada we are building off the success of organic spice bags and continuing to appeal the millennials with the launch of organic recipe mixes. We are expanding our Club House gravies into the hot chicken and barbaque segment with sweet and spicy dipping sauces and homes style gravies. And following the launch of un-pasteurized honey earlier this year, we are introducing 100% Canadian organic honey. In Central America, we are launching salad dressings in two packaging formats as well as hot sauces in a variety of flavors.","In EMEA we are extending Thai kitchen into France to capitalize on the fast growing ethnic food trends. Responding to consumer health and wellness preferences, we are introducing organic core origin [ph] spices and homemade dessert products in France. And our launch of gluten-free recipe mixes in the UK continues to build momentum. In our Asia Pacific region, Australia is introducing six gourmet garden finishing drizzles to flavor grilled meat. These drizzles are single use pour pouches with refrigerated placement next to the meat department. Drizzles in flavors such as basil pesto, salsa verde and chimichurri offer consumers a closer to brush alternative for flavor their grilling occasions.","Turning to our industrial segment, while we do not get too specific with our product development in this segment, we are executing against the new product pipeline of on-trend and better for you products. Our range of flavor solutions for our industrial customers is one of the broadest in the industry as evidenced by a recent product development that has been a significant driver of our year-to-date industrial segment sales growth as our customers move their portfolios to more natural, better for you and organic, they want to ensure that taste does not compromise. Our distinctive Food First approach, our deep understanding of food and the use of natural ingredients like herbs and spices competitively differentiates us and is valued by our customers.","Now, I would like to recognize some of our recent news, during our Investor Day, we unveiled McCormick\u2019s new vision, mission and five principles as seen on Slide 10. We are very excited about how this positions McCormick for the future. Our vision is to bring the joy of flavor to life. Our new mission is to make every meal and moment better. To support our new vision and mission, we have also evolved our five pillars of success to five key principles that now speak to our purpose competitive advantage and ambition. Three of our principles remain the same passion for flavor, power of people and taste you trust. We introduced two new principles driven to innovate and purpose led performance to reflect our continuous reinvention of our business and our commitment to delivering top tier business results, with responsibility to people, communities and the planet. In May, we announced we were recognized by Diversity Inc. on their 2017 top 50 companies for diversity. This is a highly competitive award which highlights successes and best practices that promote the growth and advancement of underrepresented groups and workplaces. This marks McCormick\u2019s first time on the list. And the recognition demonstrates our power of people principle, our commitment to supporting a global workforce that values and respects diversity.","In May, we were pleased to have Tony Vernon join our Board of Directors. Tony is the former CEO of Kraft Foods and many of you know him from his previous role. Tony brings a deep consumer products industry expertise to our Board and has managed some of the world\u2019s most respected and iconic brands. We believe he will further strengthen the great group of leaders that comprise our Board. Lastly, during Investor Day, we shared that we had embarked on our McCormick Global Enablement initiative MGE to evaluate the processes, capabilities and operating model we will need as a larger scale business. The objective of this initiative is to execute the step change acceleration and working globally and cross functionally to align, simplify and grow. In addition to building the scalable platform for future growth, this initiative will help to lower our costs through expanding end to end processes, building on our current shared services foundation and enabling faster decision making, increased agility and creating capacity within our organization. Through this 3-year initiative, we expect to achieve annual cost savings of approximately $30 million to 40 million once fully implemented. But we are still finalizing the details of our operating model. We expect the cost to implement MGE will be approximately $55 million to $65 million special charges and be recognized over the course of the initiative. Mike will cover the impact to our 2017 reported earnings when he discusses our outlook in a few moments.","Let me summarize by restating that we have achieved strong results in the first half of 2017. We have confidence in our fiscal year outlook with our growth plans for new products across both our consumer and industrial segments, strong marketing programs and our opportunities to expand distribution. We are balancing our resources and efforts to drive sales with our work to lower costs and are on track to deliver at least $100 million in 2017 cost savings led by our CCI program. I want to recognize McCormick employees around the world for their efforts and their engagement.","It\u2019s now my pleasure to turn it over Mike. Mike?","Mike Smith","Thanks Lawrence and good morning everyone. As Lawrence indicated, we are pleased with our second quarter results and have good momentum heading into the second half of 2017. I will provide some additional remarks and insights on our second quarter results followed by the details of our current 2017 financial outlook. On a constant currency basis, we grew sales 7%. Acquisitions, pricing taken in response to higher material costs and higher volume and product mix each contributed to the increase as seen on Slide 14. Both segments grew sales with the industrial segment being especially strong. On Slide 15, consumer segment sales in the Americas rose 5% in constant currency with 3% from pricing actions as well as higher volume and product mix on the base business.","Pricing actions were taken in response to the commodity increases and expected elasticity impacts are reflected in volume and mix on this slide. As Lawrence mentioned earlier additional sales were driven by new products, expanded distribution and the strength in Grill Mates and Gourmet product lines. The acquisition of Gourmet Garden contributed 2% in constant currency growth. In EMEA constant currency sales were down 5% from a year ago. Similar to the first quarter, the primary decrease was in the UK where a challenging retail market continues to adversely impact sales. This included reduction in the number of Schwartz brand products by a large UK retailer, which has been rationalizing its portfolio to gain space for general merchandise.","Consumer sales in the Asia Pacific region were up 15% in constant currency with sales and Gourmet Garden adding 4 percentage points of growth. In China, we grew constant currency sales at a double digit rate, driven by holiday promotions as well as e-commerce growth. Sales growth in India was led by price management, new consumer pack formats and the shift to more consumer oriented distributors. For the consumers segment in total, our second quarter adjusted operating income rose 6% to $91 million. In constant currency adjusted operating income rose 7% from the year ago period. With the impact of sales growth and CCI driven cost savings more than offsetting higher material costs. Our brand marketing was comparable to the year ago period.","Turning to our industrial segment on Slide 19, we had excellent results this quarter in both sales and profit, continuing our momentum from the first quarter. Starting with sales growth, we grew constant currency sales 12% with increases in each of our three regions. Our acquisition of Giotti contributed 4%. We grew industrial sales in Americas 8% in constant currency, led by double digit sales growth in both savory flavors and snack seasonings across the U.S. and Latin America and expanded distribution of U.S. branded food service products. Partially offsetting this growth were lower sales to quick service restaurants. Sales of Giotti contributed 23% of our 33% constant currency growth in EMEA. The remaining growth was driven by higher volume and product mix and pricing in response to rising commodity costs with both quick service restaurants and packaged food companies.","Sales growth was partially offset by the discontinuation of low margin South African business. We grew industrial segment sales in the Asia Pacific region 3% constant currency. The main driver was higher sales with quick service restaurants in the region, benefiting from both new product and promotional activities. Adjusted operating income for the industrial segment ended the quarter, up 8% and $46 million. In constant currency the growth was even greater at 13% driven by higher sales, a shift to more value added products and the impact of our CCI program. We increased marketing for this segment in support of our branded food service business. Across both segments adjusted operating income, which excludes special charges rose 7% in the second quarter from the year ago period. If we also exclude the impact of unfavorable currency, we grew adjusted operating income by 9%. Adjusted operating margin expanded 20 basis points from the second quarter of 2016.","Gross margin was down year-on-year, an 80 basis point decline. As we have previously indicated, there was pressure on our gross margin driven by the unfavorable impact of currency exchange rates and the timing of some pricing actions. Our selling, general and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales was down year-on-year by 100 basis points from the second quarter of 2016. Leverage from sales growth as well as CCI like cost savings during the period drove the decline. Our brand marketing was comparable to the year ago period, as we are timing some of our investments to support our second half new products. We are also getting more value out of each marketing dollar and therefore, we now expect a mid to high single-digit increase in 2017 brand marketing, including currency impact. This increase is at a higher rate than our anticipated sales growth and highlights our commitment to invest in our brands.","Below the operating income line the tax rate on a GAAP basis this quarter was 23% compared to 23.1% in the year ago period. Both periods were favorably impacted by discrete tax items. We continue to expect the full year tax rate to approximate 28%, which considers the change in the accounting for taxes related to equity awards. Keep in mind that in the third quarter of 2016, we had a very low tax rate at 22% due to discrete tax items. Despite unfavorable currency, income from unconsolidated operations rose 9% to $8.4 million. The increase is driven by our Eastern joint venture in India, which is delivering sales and profit growth. The performance of our largest joint venture McCormick de Mexico [ph] has been masked by unfavorable currency impact as it continues to perform well with sales on constant currency up 8% year-to-date. Based on prevailing currency rates, we expected mid to high single-digit decline in 2017 income from unconsolidated operations. At the bottom line, second quarter 2017 adjusted earnings per share was $0.82, up from $0.75 for the year ago period. Mainly due to higher adjusted operating income as well as higher income from unconsolidated operations and lower shares outstanding. This year-to-year comparison includes the unfavorable impact from currency on both consolidated and unconsolidated income.","On Slide 28, we summarized highlights for cash flow and the quarter end balance sheet. For the first half of 2017 cash flow from operations was $177 million compared to $213 million in the year ago period. An increase in net income was offset mainly by the timing of income tax payments and incentive compensation payments related to 2016 financial performance. We have returned $253 million of cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases and used $66 million for capital expenditures. At the end of the second quarter, $191 million remained on the current $600 million share repurchase authorization. Our balance sheet remains sound, we are generating strong cash flow and we are well positioned to fund future investments to drive growth.","Let\u2019s now move to our current financial outlook for 2017 on Slide 29. Our strong outlook for the year is unchanged except for the impact of foreign currency exchange rates on sales and the impact for special charges related to the organization and streamlining actions we have underway. Based on prevailing rates, we now estimate an unfavorable impact to the net sales growth rate up 1%, down from our original estimate of 2%. Our 2017 projection of special charges has increased to approximately $20 million from $11 million, mainly driven by expenses related to our MGE initiatives. At the top line, we reaffirm our plan to grow sales 5% to 7% in constant currency, which includes the incremental impact of approximately 2% from acquisitions completed in fiscal year 2016 and Giotti acquired in December 2016. We anticipate a combination of pricing and higher volume and product mix to contribute 3% to 5% of growth. Including the estimated impact of currency, we project sales growth of 4% to 6% in 2017. On a constant currency basis, we continue to expect to increase adjusted operating income 9% to 11% from adjusted operating income of $657 million in 2016.","Currency is expected to lower this range to 8% to 10%. We plan to drive this increase with higher sales and at least $100 million in CCI led cost savings. With this fuel for growth, we plan to also fund a mid to high single-digit increase in brand marketing. We reaffirm projected adjusted earnings per share of $4.05 to $4.13. Excluding the estimated 2 percentage point impact of unfavorable currency rates, this range remains an increase of 9% to 11% from adjusted earnings per share of $3.78 in 2016. As the final remark on our outlook, we are on track for another year of strong cash flow for fiscal year 2017 with higher adjusted net income and actions underway to improve our working capital.","That completes my remarks. So let\u2019s turn now to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. At this time we will be conducting the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your questions.","Robert Moskow","Hi, thank you.","Lawrence Kurzius","Hey, good morning, Rob.","Robert Moskow","Good morning. Couple of questions. One is if you look at our Nielsen tracking data, the thing that stands out the most is that private label continues to gain share? You folks didn\u2019t mention this trend in your statements today. And I know we have talked about a lot in the quarters past, but do you see anything different emerging here or any greater threats from private label in your outlook? And then secondly just a question about the earnings guidance, make sure I understand. So, the tax rate in this quarter was well below what we thought and that helped your EPS by about $0.03. Is your guidance kind of implying that you are going to take that $0.03 and use that as cushion to help you get to the rest of the year, because of concerns or how should I interpret that?","Lawrence Kurzius","Hey, Rob. I am going to start off with the addressing the private label question and I am going to pass the second question over to Mike Smith. But on private label, we really don\u2019t have anything new to add. We continue to see strong growth in private label. About half of that growth is coming from the conversion of smaller brands to private label by a major retailer. We are approaching the lapping of that, but another retailer is doing the same thing. And so we expect to see continued strong numbers on private label again with half of it coming from the conversion of smaller brands to private label. As you know, we are a supplier of private label. So, as part of our business, we participate in that growth as well. And I will just add that although there is certainly an impact on all brands from the growth of private label, we actually think that the smaller brands are being disproportionately impacted. And if you were to run through the Nielsen data, I think you would see some of the smaller brands that are having an impact as proportionately bigger than us. Mike, do you want to take the second?","Mike Smith","Yes. On the tax question, Rob, we are still calling for 28% tax rate for the year. Year-to-date versus prior year we are around the same tax rate 26% due to those discrete tax items as we mentioned. We have adopted this new accounting for equity awards, which is introducing a lot more variability to timing of that and our underlying tax rate as we talked in the past is 29% to 30% with some of these discrete items for the year driving it down to 28%. But for the remainder of the year, unless there is other discrete tax items we will be in the 29% to 30% range, which would get us back to 28% at year end. The nice thing is having the tax rate year-on-year the same year-to-date. It really gives visibility to the strong growth from adjusted operating profit line and through EPS.","Robert Moskow","Just a quick follow-up on the guidance, I think you maintained guidance for high single-digit marketing investment growth this year, how much conviction do you have that you are going to maintain that level of growth, because I think in years past, you have ended up kind of easing back on that?","Mike Smith","Well, I will take this one, Lawrence.","Lawrence Kurzius","Okay, go ahead.","Mike Smith","I mean, we moved it from high to mid to high. So we broadened the range a little bit. Frankly, as we get into the year, we move things around. We have active CCI program. So, as we get more efficient at our marketing spend or this year we are getting more efficient nonworking capital. So, we are still spending higher than the rate of our sales. So, we still feel like we are investing in the brands to best of our ability. So we are okay with our marketing spend.","Robert Moskow","Okay, thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Ken Goldman with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Ken Goldman","Hi, good morning, everybody.","Lawrence Kurzius","Good morning.","Ken Goldman","At your Investor Day, you commented I think you made a point of this on your strength of your relationship with Amazon, where I think you are servicing them as a top customer even before they necessarily are. I think the opposite is sort of true with Whole Foods. I don\u2019t think you have ever really had a much of a relationship there. And correct me if I am wrong, I am just wondering \u2013 and I am sure it\u2019s way too early to answer the question, but I am just trying to get a sense of how you guys are thinking about it. Do you think that there is an opportunity for you to grow your presence in Whole Foods as a result of the merger or is it still out of the question? I just wanted to kind of pick your brain a little bit on your initial thoughts there?","Lawrence Kurzius","Hey, thanks Ken. That\u2019s a great question. Of course, we are thinking a lot about the impact of Amazon, the Amazon and Whole Foods deal on the industry as a whole, but I am sure as I am sure everybody is. And you do have it exactly right with Amazon we have got a terrific relationship. We have resourced them at a really high level. Actually, there is only one customer that has a larger account team behind it. And a lot of those people have very specific skills for that channel of trade. A year and a half ago we were the grocery supplier of the year. And we think we have a lot of momentum. I am sure somebody will ask it sometime on the call. So, I will just put it out there that our pure e-commerce channel business is growing at a very strong rate. We did not quite hit triple-digits this quarter with our U.S. business, but we are not far off of it, so tremendous growth. But on the flipside of that at Whole Foods, we were very underrepresented. Some of our secondary brands are in distribution at Whole Foods like kind of our regional favorites like OLD BAY, our Asian product is Simply Asia brand and Thai Kitchen brand are well represented. But in the heart of our category, we are pretty light. So, yes, we do think that this probably has more opportunity for us than risk. And we think we are really well positioned based on our relationship with Amazon.","Ken Goldman","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you. And for my follow-up quickly, also at your Investor Day you talked pretty confidently about your desire to pursue some larger acquisitions. You called out condiments as a business that makes sense for you. Could you update us on these comments in anyway? And just a follow-up, because last year I know this was the case on Premier Foods, were there any abnormal charges related to M&A this quarter like you have with Premier Foods. I was trying to get a sense of your thoughts on that matter, if you could?","Lawrence Kurzius","Sure. Well, I will say that we have a robust pipeline of acquisition opportunities, but I really don\u2019t want to say anymore than that at this point. Mike, you want to\u2026","Mike Smith","Yes. From an acquisition cost perspective, we did have some significant cost in last year\u2019s second quarter for Premier Foods. We have an underlying base of acquisition cost that flow through the company. And now as we have developed our game on the M&A side, we also though have had more integration costs in the second quarter compared to last year from Giotti. So, it\u2019s not much of a savings year-on-year.","Ken Goldman","Got it. Thanks so much.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Alexia Howard with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.","Alexia Howard","Good morning, everyone.","Lawrence Kurzius","Good morning, Alexia.","Alexia Howard","Hi. So, can I ask about pricing versus input cost dynamics, particularly in the U.S. We have been hearing that pricing is particularly hard to come by at the moment. A lot of retail is getting sharper on price points. And I know you have a fair amount of input cost inflation this year, particularly in certain areas? How easy is it to take and hang on to the price increases that you need to cover that? And are you the right way up in terms of the gap between the pricing you are able to take and the input cost pressures that you are seeing this year? Thank you.","Lawrence Kurzius","Hi, Alexia. I will start this and talk about the pricing and I will let Mike speak to the input cost half of the question. On pricing, we did take pricing action in the U.S. earlier this year. And so that has been really fully in place for the whole second quarter. We have got a partial benefit from that in the first quarter. It was pretty narrowly focused, but large increases on certain items due to the underlying commodity cost. And so things like vanilla, we took some pretty big increases on. And we also had some larger increases on garlic items in the first part of the year. We are planning another round of increases on vanilla reflecting the continued increase in the cost of that commodity. So, those increases are going into effect now. You didn\u2019t ask about the rest of the world, but I will just tell you that we also took pricing action more globally. And so we did take increases in Europe as well. Those increases really were not effective until well into the second quarter. So I mean the year-to-date we got relatively little impact from those. So as we go forward into the second half of the year, we expect to have those fully in place plus another say a mine around in the U.S. And the pricing environment is as you can imagine difficult. We have got tools that we use to understand what our elasticity impact is and we work collaboratively with our customers on taking those price increases, the discussions around pricing, always have a certain amount of natural commercial tension in them, but we have been successful in getting that all of that pricing away. Mike, do you want to talk about\u2026?","Mike Smith","Yes. And similar to the last quarter, for the year we are seeing cost increases are mid single-digits. And Alexia you asked the question last quarter about the FX impact in the second quarter and as you can see it came through our gross margin putting a little bit pressure there. As we have said last quarter this has been the most difficult quarter and we see easing over the next six months.","Alexia Howard","Great. Thank you very much. I will pass it on.","Operator","For next question turn the line of David Driscoll with Citi. Please proceed with your question.","David Driscoll","Thank you and good morning.","Lawrence Kurzius","Good morning David.","David Driscoll","I wanted to go back to one of the questions about just the guidance in the quarter and may be stated a little bit differently just wanted to be as clear as I can about this, so it seems like you had a nice quarter here and you handily toped your original expectations for the quarter, so you are not the consensus one, you lowered the FX impact on the top line, you lowered your outlook for advertising spending, but there is no change to the full year guidance, so there is obviously \u2013 then there is got to be some kind of balances here to make that full year EPS number not move, can you talk a little bit about it, so far I am not clear apologies if I should be? Thank you.","Mike Smith","I mean our guidance range is 4 or 5 to 4.13, so there is a rather large range and as I said before the A&P spend is broadening out. It\u2019s not \u2013 it might be a couple of million dollars may be $0.01 a share. So it is not \u2013 I don\u2019t think we have really moved FX though we did move on the top line from 2% to 1%, but at the operating profit line and at the EPS line we still kept to our last guidance it\u2019s about a 2% impact bottom line. Remember we have an unconsolidated operation in Mexico, which is driving that with the peso devaluation. So I think we are pretty clear on where we stand.","Lawrence Kurzius","Mike you didn\u2019t mention about the tax benefit that we got in the quarter was the benefit that we anticipated and we talked about this at the beginning of the year. And we just didn\u2019t know the timing of that. So it doesn\u2019t change our outlook for tax on the year. We just didn\u2019t know what quarter that would fall into. So there really isn\u2019t anything incremental. I will echo what Mike said we have pretty wide range still. It is early in our fiscal year, our biggest quarters of the year, our fourth quarter and third quarter. So we are still looking at the biggest part of our year ahead of us. And I think it will be premature for us to change or any kind of guidance on the bottom line at this point with so much of our years still ahead of us.","David Driscoll","That\u2019s fair. That\u2019s really helpful. Can I follow-up with a longer term CCI question, I think this is the first time you guys quantified the MGE program, I think you have mentioned it at the Analyst Day, but I don\u2019t recall the numbers being issued at that point in time, when you bring CCI with the MGE together, do we add this on top of $100 million per year CCI, so presumably I know MGE, it\u2019s episodic program, it\u2019s in year three, it\u2019s $30 million to $40 million, so do we just add it on top of it and it\u2019s \u2013 in addition to the typical $100 million in CCI?","Mike Smith","Maybe the way I would think of it is programs like this, our CCI initiatives, efficiency programs such as whether they are in the plans or other areas, when we set our program at CAGNY last year and remember we are only about 1.5 year into this setting that $400 million target, you don\u2019t have line of sight to every program that you are going to have 3 years, 4 years down the path. So at this point, while we are very happy with the early indications on CCI, we have over delivered last year\u2019s $100 million target and we feel real confident about this year\u2019s. I wouldn\u2019t necessarily say it\u2019s going to be additive at this point, that\u2019s something we get midway into the 4-year cycle. I think we take another hard look at whether things like this could be additive or not, but I would say at this point, because it is such a program that goes through 2019, I consider it part of the $400 million if you are modeling into that right now.","David Driscoll","Thank you so much.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Akshay Jagdale with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.","Akshay Jagdale","Hi, can you hear me? Good morning. Yes, can you hear me now?","Lawrence Kurzius","Yes","Akshay Jagdale","Okay, great. Thanks for taking the question. I just want to follow-up on Ken\u2019s question earlier as it relates to Amazon and their pending acquisition of Whole Foods, you guys are the leaders I would say in the food space and in the e-commerce side I know you have received quite a few awards, I am not sure how much investors appreciate that, but in any event can you \u2013 I don\u2019t know if you mentioned, what you think this \u2013 that the implications of that are for the overall industry, there is obviously this view that prices across the board are going to come down and private label penetration broadly is going to go up and you are seeing coincidentally an increase in private label penetration in your category, so I know you talked about Amazon, we know it\u2019s really solid business for you growing almost triple digits, but can you give us and if I missed it, I am sorry, but just broader implications and talk a little bit about price impact in private label for your categories and how you see that playing out as a result of this?","Lawrence Kurzius","Well, I am just going to go back to say that that we really believe that we are well positioned. When you look at our consumer business, the part that is really impacted is the Americas consumer, that\u2019s about 40% of our total sales as a company is in the Americas consumer part of the business. And again we think we are just \u2013 we ourselves are doing the right things to address this. For the industry as a whole, I mean I think that the trends that we already as an industry acknowledge are if anything either confirmed or maybe even accelerated by this there is a move to e-commerce by the consumer companies that are acting on this. I think you are going to have problems down the road. For us it says \u2013 it\u2019s telling us we are doing the right thing by over resourcing this classic trade and continuing to build a sales channel with the true play e-commerce customers. And to continue to work to market our product directly to the consumer with the great digital, social and mobile marketing programs that we have. We just don\u2019t believe that consumers long-term are going to shop much differently for their foods than they do for other things. And we look at consumer shopping behavior broadly and there is no doubt about it, it involves e-commerce is a big and growing part of it. It probably does put pressure on our retailer customers to consolidate further and work to differentiate themselves to be as competitive as they can be with this channel. Most of the smart traditional retailers have e-commerce programs of their own to try to continue to capture the shopping behavior \u2013 the change in shopping behavior of their consumers with different kinds of click and collect programs and so on. We do participate and support those programs with those retailers. We don\u2019t talk \u2013 we don\u2019t count that when we talk about our e-commerce business. So is that getting at your question Akshay?","Akshay Jagdale","Yes, it\u2019s definitely helpful. If you can maybe touch on the private label piece that would be helpful and I just had \u2013 the second question I had as on MGE, can you give us some sort of real life anecdotal examples of what this will fix in terms of speed to market, maybe you can look back and say well, we did this historically and we now expect X to happen, just some cost saving numbers, we did a great job outlining exactly what those are, but this is really about getting more agile and efficient right. And so can you give us some anecdotal evidence or some examples of what you expect will happen when this is fully in place? Thanks.","Mike Smith","Yes. Actually, this is Mike. I mean, as you think about a company like ours, which has grown up really regionally, so we have three regions. Over time, we put an SAP 15, 17 years ago over time. So, processes have developed at different levels. What we have been trying to do in MGE will be a continuation of building on our shared service foundation that we started in the U.S. about 15 years ago and expanded more into Europe in the last 3 or 4 years. If you can get your processes aligned, you can do things like new product introductions faster. So, I would say things like that. You could have a more unified you\u2019ve got a customer service that\u2019s quicker, because it might be in one region supporting whole region I suppose into five different time zones. So, there is things that as you do things one way you can be more efficient and you can service your customer much more effectively. And as our customers are more global now, we service big industrial customers around the world, it\u2019s important to make sure as they are global, we service them. We have one face to them.","Akshay Jagdale","Perfect. I will pass it on. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rob Dickerson with Deustche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Rob Dickerson","Great. Thanks a lot.","Lawrence Kurzius","Hey, good morning, Rob.","Rob Dickerson","Good morning. Just a couple of hopefully easy questions. So, in the first half of the year, I believe inclusive of currency, I think operating income looks like it\u2019s growing or it\u2019s growing maybe 6%. So, just kind of I am curious what do you see as the core drivers of an accelerating operating profit growth in the back half of the year to get you to the 8% to 10% that\u2019s not changing off of what you put out this morning. And I don\u2019t know if part of that is because of slightly lower like you said like a little bit slightly lower other brand investment or it\u2019s just because this is the peak of the higher cost cycle really in Q2. Would that just ease in the back half? Thanks.","Mike Smith","Yes, Rob, this is Mike. No, you hit the main driver on the head. We did say that the second quarter would be the highpoint of the FX transactional impact. We see that easing into the second half. You heard Lawrence also say some of the additional pricing actions we have globally that will kick in fully in the second half. And as we said on the last call, our CCI this year was somewhat back loaded versus 2016 where it\u2019s a little more front loaded. So, those three positive trends as well as the really strong new product platforms and products that Lawrence mentioned are going to help drive both the top line and the bottom line.","Lawrence Kurzius","Yes. And I will also just mention that the sales growth of course is stronger than the second half than in the first half that\u2019s muted really by the first quarter where there were number of factors that came into play that we thought were temporary in nature. That\u2019s actually proven to be the case. We are sitting here this quarter, with over 7% constant currency sales growth. And that gives us a lot \u2013 that strong top line is performance we expect to continue. And so that gives us a lot of confidence in the second half operating profit.","Rob Dickerson","Okay, great. And then just in terms of pricing, I know a few people have touched on this, this morning and you probably all have touched on this over the past a month or so with respect to just the overall grocery environment of what\u2019s happening in food pricing and arguments throughout an inflation versus deflation, cost versus regional pricing etcetera. So, I am just curious how your experience was with the retailers in general in getting the pricing that\u2019s coming through now namely in the U.S. kind of relative to history? Was it a little bit harder? There was no problem at all. They are happy to take your pricing even though a number of other companies in the space are saying maybe it is a little bit harder now to get that incremental price. We are not getting as much pricing as expected. But for you, it seems like everything is fine.","Lawrence Kurzius","Yes. I am not going to say everything is fine. Getting pricing is not easy. If we were trying to go out there with a blunt-force broad price increase the way people did it in the old days. I would say we have a lot of troubles with getting that through. And with our customers, we have done a lot of work over the last several years around price elasticity and category analytics. And our price increase is really not just this \u2013 not this year, but last year, the broader price increases that we took were really quite well supported by data that involves what we got net price increase as some items went up, some items went down, it did result in a net increase to us and it was a rationale case that could be presented to retailers. This year, our pricing action has really been driven by the underlying commodities, has been fairly narrow and narrowly focused on the items that are big movers. Again, the biggest impact has been vanilla, where there is a well-recognized worldwide shortage of vanilla. Our retailers are experiencing price increases on vanilla, not just from us, but from all suppliers, when suppliers have supply to even offer. And so the situation on vanilla has been relatively unique to that commodity and maybe it makes McCormick a little bit of a special case on this.","Rob Dickerson","Okay, great. And then just one last question in M&A, I think you have pointed to, I don\u2019t know publicly, but I mean, I know you have spoken to number of investors about it. Kind of pointed to bit of sizing a potential acquisition, I don\u2019t know let\u2019s call it 30% kind of max or so of market cap. And correct me if I am wrong, which is essentially in line with some of your larger transactions historically. So kind of one just thoughts around that and then two, you bid on Premier previously, which obviously has a decent amount of UK exposure and then kind of since then we have seen the pressures that are coming through in the UK and kind of how they are hitting results now in this quarter. So, I am just wondering in terms of kind of acquisition focused perspective, is the thought process the same now as it was a year ago or is maybe a little bit \u2013 it shifted a little more back to the U.S. and more emerging market or is Europe still interesting, just any color on that will be great?","Lawrence Kurzius","Sure. Well, I will say that we have a robust pipeline of acquisition opportunities. We always bring a financial discipline to the work that we do in this space. And so as part of that financial discipline, we build a business model and that reflects not just the kind of the modeling elements around financing, but also the prospects for the business and objective attractiveness of the market in which it\u2019s operating. And so all of that would be factored in. We have said that we have a broader and bigger ambition for acquisitions and that is still the case. And as far as size goes, we have said that we would be willing to and we have demonstrated the willingness in the past to stretch to acquire important strategic assets and that would continue to be the case, but I don\u2019t really want to get too specific about anything beyond that right now.","Rob Dickerson","Okay, perfect. Thank you so much.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Chris Growe with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.","Chris Growe","Hi, good morning.","Lawrence Kurzius","Good morning.","Mike Smith","Good morning.","Chris Growe","Hi. So, just a couple of quick follow-ups from earlier questions, I guess I want to make sure I was clear that when I look at the gross margin performance in the quarter, it was a little weaker. We talked about some translation effect. I want to also be clear, is cost inflation about the same. You talked about an increase in another round of pricing coming through in some areas. Is that due to incremental inflation that\u2019s affected your outlook there?","Mike Smith","Yes, this is Mike, Chris. For the full year, we still see the mid single-digits. There are pockets of ups and downs that we are taking care of either trade promotions are taking more pricing of certain commodities as Lawrence mentioned. But for the full year, we still feel good about that mid single-digit range. From a timing perspective, transactional \u2013 you see the translational impact year-to-date, it\u2019s about 2.5% which we call out for constant currency purposes, but underlying transactional, you mean the first half of the year post-Brexit, you saw what the pound, the euro that really makes it a hard year-on-year comparison in that first half of the year as our foreign units are buying in U.S. dollars, these spices and herbs. So, we see that easing a lot in the second half and that\u2019s going to contribute to our gross margin being up on a year-on-year basis in the second 6.","Chris Growe","Okay, great. And then I just want to be clear also on the global enablement program, did I hear that right that you said that \u2013 is that just part of the CCI savings overall, is that the way that falls into that bucket?","Mike Smith","Yes. I would consider at this point we are only 1.5 year into the $400 million program. So, yes, I would consider it at this point within there.","Chris Growe","Okay. And I had just one quick follow-up which would be in relation to marketing. And can you say how much marketing was up year-to-date and we are just trying to understand the kind of tracking along to the mid to high single-digit increase for the year and forgive me if I didn\u2019t hear that properly?","Mike Smith","Yes. I mean, on a reported basis, sales are up actually 3.1% and advertising and promotions up 3.1%. We are at the rate of underlying sales growth.","Chris Growe","So that accelerates in the second half of the year then?","Mike Smith","Yes. And we do have some investments in the grilling program. You might have seen some of our grilling TV already in the U.S.","Chris Growe","Okay, thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. We have time for one additional question this morning which will be coming from the line of Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your questions.","Adam Samuelson","Yes, thanks. Good morning, everyone.","Lawrence Kurzius","Good morning.","Adam Samuelson","A lot of ground has been covered, but maybe a question in the industrial business and really a question kind of the operating leverage there, I mean you had some pretty strong organic sales growth with very nice contribution from volumes, but really no EBIT margin leverage. You also had contribution from Giotti, which I would presume should have a better than average margin structure than your base business given its focus. And I am just trying to think about the operating leverage kind of potential in industrial as you seem to have a good top line cadence here, but I am not seeing that really translate on the operating margin side?","Mike Smith","Adam, this is Mike. I mean, the gross margin impacts really hit industrial hard than we have large European operations \u2013 a lot of manufacturing in the UK, for example. So, in the second quarter, the impact was significant on them.","Adam Samuelson","It wasn\u2019t gross margins, it\u2019s currency transactions.","Mike Smith","Yes, gross margin \u2013 it was the currency transaction, sorry. From a Giotti perspective, we love that business. But as I mentioned before, we have integration costs in the first 6. So that we have said for the year, there should be no impact overall. But for the first 6, we have had to integrate that business. That\u2019s a little bit of a drag on the gross margin and industrial at this point.","Lawrence Kurzius","Yes, I know we have hardly talked about Giotti at all on this call or in our remarks, but I will just add that our experience has been these acquisitions that we have done in the industrial space that have brought new technology into the business and new capabilities, and in particular, new flavors, talent have proven to be really great adds, just Giotti is going to be a tremendous contributor to the growth of our flavor business in Europe and Asia.","Adam Samuelson","And maybe just a little bit of color on the top line, but the volume growth that you talked about, I think you alluded to some new snacking wins in Latin America, but any view on the top line, the ability to sustain that kind of mid to upper single-digit organic growth rate in the business in the balance of the year?","Lawrence Kurzius","Yes. I mean, for the full year, just like we have for the whole business, each of the segments we think are going to be 5% to 7% constant currency growth. You will have ups and downs, especially in industrial of new product launches of our customers ebb and flow, but to have really we have broad-based growth across industrial this quarter with North America, up 8%, Europe was up 10% underlying growth which is great, but again, it is a little bit variable, so you have to be cognizant of that.","Adam Samuelson","Alright. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. I will now turn the floor to Lawrence Kurzius for closing remarks.","Lawrence Kurzius","Great. Thanks, everyone for your questions and for participating in today\u2019s call and my apologies to the callers that we didn\u2019t get to today. Kasey Jenkins will be available to take your questions all day long. She is delighted to as a matter of fact. McCormick is a global leader in flavor, a growing and advantage business platform.

This is Kasey Jenkins, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you for joining today\u2019s call for a discussion of McCormick\u2019s Third Quarter Financial Results and our current outlook for 2017. To accompany this call, we have posted a set of slides at ir.mccormick.com. [Operator Instructions]","With me this morning are Lawrence Kurzius, Chairman, President and CEO; and Mike Smith, Executive Vice President and CFO.","During our remarks, we will refer to non-GAAP financial measures. These include adjusted growth margins, adjusted operating income, and adjusted earnings per share that exclude the impact of transaction and integration expenses related to the Reckitt Benckiser Foods or RB Foods acquisition and special charges, as well as information in constant currency. Reconciliations to the GAAP results are included in this morning\u2019s press release and slides.","As a reminder, today\u2019s presentation contains projections and other forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those projected. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or other factors.","As seen on Slide 2, our forward-looking statements also provide information on risk factors that could affect our financial results.","It is now my pleasure to turn the discussion over to Lawrence.","Lawrence Kurzius","Thank you, Kasey. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us.","Our third quarter performance led by sales growth was incredibly strong with results which continue to differentiate McCormick. We drove double-digit adjusted operating income growth and expanded our adjusted operating income margin that makes seven consecutive quarters of margin expansion. The strengthen in our base business drove adjusted earnings per share growth of 9% versus the third quarter of last year and our results are not the only great news of the quarter.","In the third quarter we had an important and exciting milestone for McCormick. We announced and then subsequently closed on our acquisition of RB Foods on August 17. This is the largest deal in our company's history. The acquisition strengthens our flavor leadership with the addition of iconic French's and Frank's RedHot brands to our portfolio which are now our number two and number three brands respectively.","This flavorful product portfolio with simple high-quality clean ingredients fits perfectly within McCormick as we continue to capitalize on the growing consumer interest in healthy flavorful eating. McCormick now has leading positions in categories to consumers use most when flavoring fresh foods.","Our one-stop shop for condiment, spice and seasoning needs provides our customers and our consumers with an even more diverse and complete flavor product offering. This transaction reinforces our focus on growth, reflects McCormick's commitment to making every meal and moment better, and drives significant shareholder value.","I\u2019ll comment more on RB Foods integration and business in a few moments, and Mike will also address our updated fiscal 2017 outlook which includes the impact of RB Foods. But first speaking of our focus on growth, I'm pleased to further discuss our third quarter results and provide some business updates.","McCormick's strong third quarter results continue our momentum for growth and reflect the effectiveness of our strategies and the engagement of our employees around the world. We're driving both sales growth and significant productivity improvements. We deliver growth in sales and on an adjusted basis, operating income, earnings per share, and operating margin expansion.","With our year-to-date performance and growth momentum heading into the last quarter of fiscal '17, as well as the acquisition of RB Foods, we are well-positioned to deliver excellent financial results in fiscal year '17.","Our strength this quarter like last quarter was evident in our topline results. In constant currency we grew sales 8% for the total company with solid performance from both segments. Base business growth, new products and acquisitions are three drivers of long-term sales growth were all contributing factors. Incremental sales from acquisitions contributed 4%, including 2% from RB Foods subsequent to the transaction closed. Year-to-date we have grown sales in constant currency 6%.","In the third quarter, we increased constant currency adjusted operating income 19% and expanded our adjusted operating income margin by 140 basis points. These results were led by the higher sales and savings from our comprehensive continuous improvement program CCI. Both segments on an adjusted basis achieved an increase in operating income and higher operating income margins. Year-to-date we've achieved 13% constant currency increase in adjusted operating income above the high-end of our guidance and have expanded our adjusted operating income margin 70 basis points.","We're extremely pleased with our third quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.12 which was 9% higher than the year ago period. Our strong growth and adjusted operating income drove this increase partially offset by a higher 2017 tax rate and an increase in interest expense from debt related to the RB Foods acquisition.","Overall, RB Foods adjusted earnings per share impact was neutral as two weeks of operating results offset three weeks of interest expense. Keep in mind that the year-to-date comparison of adjusted earnings per share for the third quarter includes the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates.","I\u2019d like to turn next to some business updates. I will begin with highlights from our consumer and industrial segments and follow with some comments on RB Foods.","In the consumer segment starting with the Americas, we grew constant currency sales by 7% including 3% from our acquisition of RB Foods. Base business growth of 4% was driven by higher pricing volume and product mix. This growth was a sequential improvement from the growth in the first two quarters of the year.","In the U.S., our IRI data indicated strong third quarter category dollar growth for spices and seasonings at 7%. During the same period, McCormick's U.S. branded spices and seasonings grew 5%. As in the past quarters we have continued to have strong growth in unmeasured channels including club, e-commerce and Hispanic retail chains.","Overall, we continue to see good growth in our spice and seasoning brands in the U.S. market. We narrowed the gap on market share loss and we know we have more room to grow. Our products remain well aligned and on trend with consumer demand for flavorful healthy eating. Environment remains dynamic and we're well-positioned to capitalize on these changes through increased brand marketing and commercial resources a greater focus on customer intimacy and greater product innovation. We are staying relevant with the consumer and have compelling product offering for every retail strategy.","Our outlook for the U.S. sales of spices and seasonings for the balance of the year remains strong and unchanged from our prior projections. We remain confident in the initiatives we have underway to position us to continue our trajectory of long-term growth. We have several successes and initiatives in place which drive our optimism for the Americas consumer businesses.","To name a few, we remain excited and are experiencing strong retail acceptance on our significant second half innovation lineup that we outlined on our June earnings call. This includes a new breakfast platform, and ready-to-serve gravies. We're strengthening consumption of spices and seasonings and dollars and units and a broad consumption in other areas as well. Kitchen Basics, Simply Asia, Stubb's, Gourmet Garden and McCormick recipe mixes.","Canada is also growing consumption in spices and seasonings and recipe mixes. We're increasing brand awareness through our brand marketing investments and it is paying off. We made successful investments in Grill Mates and Stubb's. In the fourth quarter, we will be investing in marketing and support of our new products, as well as the holiday season.","We see continued success with our content creation and consumer engagement in the digital space. Just last month we were recognized for the fourth straight year by L2 Research in their digital IQ index. This year we were ranked third among approximately 100 food brands for effectiveness of website, e-commerce, digital and social media. And importantly our products remain well aligned and on trend with consumer demand for flavorful healthy eating.","Now turning outside the Americas, in Europe, Middle East and Africa, EMEA, a difficult retail environment has persisted and affected our consumer business. The primary impact is in the U.K. where a challenging retail environment has hindered our performance driven by a large retailer's reduction of shelf space for food products.","During the third quarter we began to lap this impact versus year ago and saw sequential improvement in that region versus the prior quarter's performance. Additionally, we're building momentum with the new product introductions we mentioned in our June earnings call.","In the Asia-Pacific region, China grew sales with liquid products the most common way of flavoring in China. E-commerce growth continued to be strong and we expect this performance to continue throughout 2017. We're also pleased with our performance in India where sales grew at a double-digit rate. We are also excited about our recent spice mix launch in India.","Third quarter sales across the consumer segment were up 5% over the year ago period in constant currency. With the benefit of higher sales and our CCI led cost savings, we grew third quarter adjusted operating income 9% in constant currency and expanded our consumer adjusted operating income margin by 80 basis points.","Turning to the industrial segment. We had exceptional performance starting at the topline with 14% constant currency sales growth. All three of our regions contributed double-digit constant currency sales growth this quarter.","In the Americas, we have broad-based sales growth across the entire portfolio. We continue to benefit from shifting our portfolio to more value-added products, expanded distribution, increasing trend in consumer snacking and from our customers moving forward with better for you products.","A significant part of our volume increase for the quarter was driven by new products. We had successes with new customers and are making inroads with additional restaurant chains. In our branded food service business we had double-digit sales growth driven by expanded distribution. Together these successes are driving not only topline growth but strong profit growth as well.","In EMEA, incremental sales from our Giotti acquisition contributed to double-digit sales growth in the third quarter of 2017. Our integration is progressing well and nearing completion and we\u2019re delighted with Giotti sales and profit performance. Base sales in the region continue to benefit from winning with our customers to new product, expanded distribution and promotional activities with quick service restaurants. Industrial sales in Asia Pacific region mainly China benefited from new products and promotional activities of quick service restaurants.","We continue to see positive results from our margin improvement strategy in this segment with the migration of our portfolio to more technically insulated and value-added categories, flavors and branded food service. This portfolio shift including the addition of Giotti, strong brand growth in branded foodservice and growth in flavors such as savory flavors from brand aromatics has been a significant driver of the increase in adjusted operating income margin in our 2017 results.","In the addition of Frank's RedHot and French's in our branded foodservice business will further shift the portfolio and favorably impact margins. The segment is overall 40% constant currency sales growth portfolio shift and our cost reduction efforts drove a 44% constant currency increase in adjusted operating income. We expanded our industrial segment adjusted operating margin 270 basis points from the third quarter of 2016.","Concluding my business updates I'm excited to discuss RB Foods further. First, the RB Foods employees have built a great business and we were pleased to welcome them to McCormick. We've begun to collectively integrate the business and drive plans to capitalize on the growth and synergy opportunities. Integration activities are well underway. We have a dedicated team in place executing against our plan to transition RB Foods into our business.","Customer response to the acquisition has been favorable as we offer broader portfolio to meet their needs. Our alignment of the commercial organizations is underway to create a stronger focused team to deliver on opportunities quickly and aggressively drive growth.","As we gain a deeper understanding of the business, we become even more excited and confident that we will deliver our acquisition plan and meet our performance expectations. This confidence has also bolstered by our strong history of successfully integrating and delivering performance on our recent deals. Brand Aromatics, Gourmet Garden, Kitchen Basics, Stubb's and Wuhan Asia-Pacific Condiments. We've created value, achieved synergy and our obtaining results for our plans. Our strong year-to-date 2017 results include significant contributions from these recent acquisitions.","We were pleased with RB Foods approximately two weeks contribution to our third quarter results. Like McCormick space, the RB Foods business is a seasonal one for sales being waited heavier and operating profit even more so in the fourth quarter. Based on the plan the RB Foods team already have in place, we expect a strong holiday season.","As you may know, French's crispy vegetables are holiday tradition. The commercial organizations quickly connected to ensure strong fourth quarter execution. We're excited to have just begun the most profitable quarter for our entire portfolio and look forward to delivering excellent fiscal year 2017 results.","Our enthusiasm for this acquisition and our confidence that the combination of our powerful flavor brands will drive significant shareholder value continues to grow. We are well-positioned to capitalize on the opportunities for growth and cost savings. We reaffirm that we expect the transaction to be accretive to McCormick's adjusted earnings per share in its first 12 months with an increase of approximately 5% excluding the transaction and integration expenses, as well as our ongoing RB Foods amortization expense. This expectation increases to approximately 10%, one synergies or fully realized.","Now let me summarize by restating that we have achieved strong results to the first three quarters of 2017. Our base business results continue to differentiate McCormick and we're excited by our momentum even more so now with the incremental contribution from RB Foods. We have confidence in our growth plans for the new products across both our consumer and industrial segments, strong brand marketing programs, and are opportunities to expand distribution. We're balancing our resources and efforts to drive sales growth with our work to lower costs.","Our expected sales growth and focus on profit realization will drive excellent 2017 results as indicated in our updated outlook which Mike will review detail in a few moments. I want to recognize McCormick employees around the world including those recently added with the RB Foods acquisition for their focus on growth, driving high performance and engaging in our success.","It is now my pleasure to turn it over to Mike. Mike?","Mike Smith","Thanks Lawrence and good morning everyone. I\u2019ll provide some additional remarks and insights on our third quarter results, provide an update on our RB Foods financing activities and conclude with the details of our updated 2017 financial outlook.","As a reminder, our third quarter results reflect two weeks of the RB Foods operations, and three weeks of acquisition related financing costs. Overall, the RB Foods impact to the adjusted EPS was neutral in the third quarter.","As Lawrence mentioned, we're very pleased with our strong third quarter results and have good momentum heading into our last quarter of 2017. On a constant currency basis, we grew sales 8%, acquisitions pricing taken in response to higher material costs, and higher volume and product mix each contributed to the increase as seen on Slide 11. Both segments grew sales with the industrial segment being particularly strong.","The consumer segment grew sales 5% which is a sequential improvement from the first and second quarter growth. On Slide 12, consumer segment sales in the Americas rose 7% at constant currency with 3% from pricing actions, as well as higher volume and product mix on the base business.","Pricing actions were taken in response to commodity increases and the expected elasticity impacts were reflected at volume and mix on this slide. Additional sales were driven by new products, expanded distribution and increases in base unit consumption.","Drivers of the sales growth include McCormick and Lawry's brand spices and seasonings, Gourmet Garden and Stubb's products, and McCormick brand recipe mixes. Partially offsetting this growth was sales weaknesses in Zatarain's products. The acquisition of RB Foods contributed 3% in constant currency growth.","In EMEA, constant currency sales were down 2% from a year ago. Similar to the first half of the year, the primary decrease was in the U.K. where a challenging retail market continues to adversely impact sales. This included a reduction in the number of Schwartz brand products by a large U.K. retailer which has been rationalizing its portfolio to gain space for general merchandise. As Lawrence mentioned, we started to lap this impact during our third quarter.","Consumer sales in the Asia-Pacific region were up 3% in constant currency. In China, sales increases were driven by liquid products including sauces and cooking wines partially offset by the timing following a strong second quarter. Sales growth in India was led by new consumer pack formats, price management, and a launch of spice mixes.","For the consumer segment in total, our third quarter adjusted operating income rose 10% to $140 million. In constant currency, adjusted operating income rose 9% from the year ago period. The impact of sales growth, CCI led cost savings, and favorable selling, general and administrative costs more than offset higher material costs and higher brand marketing.","Turning to our industrial segment and Slide 16, we had had excellent results this quarter in both sales and profit continuing our momentum from the first half of the year. Starting with sales growth, we grew constant currency sales 14% with increases in each of our three regions. Our acquisitions of Giotti, and RB Foods contributed 7% of the sales growth.","As shown on Slide 17, we grew industrial sales in Americas 10% in constant currency with RB Foods contributing 4%. The remaining growth was broad-based and led by pricing actions, as well as continued momentum in branded foodservice. Base business growth and new products drove sales increases to both packaged food companies and quick service restaurants.","Sales of Giotti contributed 25% of our 31% constant currency growth in EMEA. The remaining growth was driven by higher volume and product mix and pricing in response to rising commodity costs with both quick service restaurants and packaged food companies. Sales growth was partially offset by the discontinuation of low margin South African business.","We grew industrial segment sales in the Asia-Pacific region 17% in constant currency. The main driver was strong sales to quick service restaurants in the region benefiting from both new products and promotional activities.","As shown on Slide 20, adjusted operating income for the industrial segment ended the quarter up 43% as $64 million. In constant currency, the growth was even greater at 44% driven by higher sales, a shift to more value-added products, the impact of our CCI program, and lower selling, general and administrative costs. We increased marketing for this segment in support of our branded foodservice business.","Across both segments, adjusted operating income which excludes the transaction and integration costs related to RB Foods and the special charges rose 18% in the third quarter from the year ago period. In constant currency, adjusted operating income grew by 19%. Adjusted operating margin expanded 140 basis points from the third quarter of 2016.","Adjusted gross margin which excludes transaction costs related to RB Foods was down year-on-year, a 20 basis point decline. This decline was driven by a stronger mix of industrial sales in the third quarter of 2017 than the year ago period.","Our selling, general and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales was down year-on-year by 160 basis points from the third quarter of 2016. Leverage from sales growth, as well as CCI led cost savings, and favorable employee related costs during the period drove the decline.","We realized this leverage while also increasing our brand marketing $8 million driven by the U.S. Below the operating income line, interest expense increased $7 million in the third quarter of 2017 from the year ago period primarily driven by the debt secured on August 11 for the RB Foods financing.","Turning to income taxes on Slide 22, the tax rate on a GAAP basis this quarter was 24.8% compared to 22.3% in the year ago period. Both periods were favorably impacted by discrete tax items. We continue to expect the rate for the full year to approximate 28% which considers the change in accounting for taxes related to equity awards.","Despite unfavorable currency, income from unconsolidated operations was comparable to the year ago period. The performance of our largest joint venture McCormick de Mexico has been masked by the unfavorable currency impact as it continues to perform well with sales on constant currency up 9% year-to-date. Based on prevailing currency rates, we continue to expect a mid to high single-digit decline in 2017 income from unconsolidated operations.","At the bottom line as shown on Slide 24, third quarter 2017 adjusted earnings per share was $1.12 up 9% from $1.03 for the year ago period mainly due to the higher adjusted operating income offset partially by higher tax rate and an increase in interest expense. This year-to-year comparison includes the unfavorable impact from currency on both consolidated and unconsolidated income.","We've summarized highlights for cash flow in the quarter and balance sheet on Slide 25. To the first three quarters of 2017, cash flow from operations was $303 million compared to $322 million in the year ago period. This decline is driven by the timing of income tax payments and incentive compensation payments related to 2016's financial performance, as well as payments related to the RB Foods transaction expenses. We returned $312 million of cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases and used $108 million for capital expenditures.","In regards to the RB Foods acquisition, Slide 26 shows an update on our financing activities, as well as refined estimates related to one-time cost and amortization expense. First, in August prior to the closing, we completed an equity issuance, secured financing of new debt including prepayable term loans and senior notes, and kept an investment-grade rating. We expect to deleverage to approximately three times debt-to-EBITDA by the end of fiscal 2020.","By curtailing our share repurchase program and M&A activities, and utilizing the expected strong cash flow from the combined businesses, we will pay down prepayable debt. We're committed to returning to our historic credit profile over time. We have paid a dividend for 90 consecutive years with annual increases in the past 31 consecutive years. We are dividend aristocrat and plan to maintain that status.","Related to our financing activities, our interest expense is estimated to be favorable versus our original expectations driven by lower interest rates. The shares issued were approximately 6.4 million which was higher than originally estimated. It is important to note that the impact of the share issuance will be different in the third and fourth quarters versus a full year due to the calculation of average shares outstanding.","For fiscal year 2017, we now expect our shares outstanding to be comparable to fiscal year 2016, which is a change from our previous expectation of reducing shares outstanding 2% in 2017. Our current outlook reflects the net impact of the shares repurchased through the first half of 2017, the average impact of the shares issuance in August, and the subsequent curtailment of the repurchases.","Our increased annual amortization expense was previously estimated in the $20 million to $25 million range. We now expect this range to be $8 million to $10 million based upon a preliminary evaluation of the acquired assets.","And finally as stated in our acquisition announcement, we expected to incur approximately $140 million of transaction and integration expenses with the majority to be incurred in 2017. These expenses include non-cash related charges related to purchase accounting reflected in cost of goods sold, as well as other debt costs reflected below operating income. We now estimate these total expenses will be approximately $100 million.","And in the third quarter of 2017, we have realized $46 million which are excluded from our adjusted results. These expenses are included in our non-GAAP to GAAP reconciliations, included on Page 30 of the deck.","Let\u2019s move now to our current financial outlook for 2017 on Slide 27. We expect strong growth for the fiscal year 2017 and are updating our projections to reflect our year-to-date performance and growth momentum, as well as the RB Foods acquisition. At the top line for the year, we expect to grow sales approximately 9% to 10% on a reported basis and approximately 10% to 11% in constant currency. This implies a fourth quarter increase of 19% to 23%.","We expect to grow fiscal 2017's adjusted operating income approximately 20% to 21% from 657 million in 2016. In constant currency, our estimated rate of growth is 21% to 22%. This implies the fourth quarter increase of 37% to 40%.","We are increasing our guidance for gross margin from comparable to 50 basis points higher to 25 to 75 basis points higher than 2016 on an adjusted basis. We expect brand marketing to increase at a high single-digit rate versus previously in mid to high single-digit rate and we are raising our cost savings target to at least $105 million from our previous estimate of at least $100 million.","Reflecting the changes above, we are increasing our guidance range for adjusted earnings per share to $4.20 to $4.24. Excluding an estimated 1% percentage point impact of unfavorable currency rates, this range is an increase of 12% to 13% from adjusted earnings per share of $3.78 in 2016.","Based on this fiscal year 2017 range, and considering the shares issued in August, this implies an adjusted earnings per share for the fourth quarter of $1.49 to $1.53. This is an increase of 17% to 20% from adjusted earnings per share of $1.27 in the fourth quarter of 2016.","Our 2017 constant currency outlook for adjusted results, sales operating profit and earnings per share growth is above each of our long-term targets. Our 2017 projection of the transition and integration expenses related to RB Foods acquisitions is approximately $77 million. Our 2017 projection of special charges has increased to approximately $22 million from $20 million mentioned in our June earnings call.","In conclusion, we are pleased with our strong third quarter results and our updated outlook reflects both the strength of our base business, and our confidence in the incremental impact of RB Foods.","That completes my remarks. So let's turn now to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from the line of Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Robert Moskow","It's great to see a guidance raise of this size definitely but I have a couple of questions about RB Foods and how it's going in the first couple of weeks. We're looking at Nielsen data that shows at least in measured channels that the growth rate this year was a lot lower than its normal run rate. It looks like pretty low single-digit. So I want to know if you had noticed the same thing or if maybe there is some alternative channels that it's not capturing and whether that had any influence on the two week contribution?","And then also on gross margin, there's a lot of scrutiny last quarter on your gross margin and I think a lot of us thought that it would pick up quite a bit in third quarter. Can you help us break out to the extent that RB Foods helped your gross margin in the quarter or was it no impact because I would've thought that would have been very accretive maybe you could help us with those elements? Thanks.","Lawrence Kurzius","I'm going to start - I\u2019ll talk about the RB sales trends. Then I'll pass it to Mike to talk about the margin question that you've got. First of all this is really early days for us. We have owned the business now, I believe we\u2019re in the fifth week and so we\u2019re really just getting into it.","The scanner data that's being reported is in line with the trend that we saw in the business going forward and it reflects the operations of the business before we took ownership of it. We\u2019re really more focused on what we\u2019re going to do with the business in the rest of this year and going forward.","So far the integration is going really well. We're making tremendous progress as you know this is something that we\u2019ve done a lot with other deals. And we are increasingly confident about what we\u2019re finding at RB mainly because we\u2019re not finding any surprises. Our understanding of the business is that we thought we had before the deal close is being confirmed through our ownership of it.","We're pleased with the strength of the fourth quarter plans that they had already put in place. We got our commercial teams together is really one of the very first things that we did and we continue to be a positive about the business which is what\u2019s reflected in the outlook. Mike you want to talk about gross margin.","Mike Smith ","Yes, maybe step back talk about RB Foods impact on the quarter and as we talked about really from an EPS perspective there was no impact. The two weeks of operating results we had in there from an operating profit perspective were offset by the three weeks of the debt financing cost.","So it didn't have much of an impact on most of the lines from the P&L. It was slightly positive on gross margins but not a whole lot. Our guidance for the year that we raised our gross margin target from 0 to 50 basis points to 25 to 75 basis points so that\u2019s where you see - especially in the fourth quarter that will be coming through.","For the base business gross margin, in the second quarter we were down 80 basis points and if you remember we talked about the FX transactional impact hitting us hardest in the second quarter that has eased in the third and you'll see it ease even more in the fourth as FX rates continue to go away.","If you look at the gross margin in the third quarter we actually only down 20 basis points. We had sequential improvement and that was really driven by some of the segment mix where industrial - constant currency sales were up 14%.","Consumer still strong up almost 5%, but you had some negative segment mix there but overall fourth quarter for the base business we think they\u2019re really strong plans from a CCI perspective which we raised on this call. Our pricing is fully impacted in the fourth quarter and continued FX favorability will help us.","Robert Moskow","Maybe just one follow-up, is your gross margin in the consumer business from a core standpoint, is that kind of flattish because and therefore if we\u2019re seeing dilution in gross margin it's really just mix or its gross margin and consumer weak as well?","Mike Smith ","We really only talk about at the adjusted operating profit level Rob, and you can see from our disclosures both consumer and industrial were up nicely this quarter. Our CCI efforts go against both cost of goods sold and SG&A too. So, and as you know we have some components that other companies have in cost of goods sold and SG&A like for in distribution which makes it little bit messy but both segments saw strong operating margin improvement this quarter.","Lawrence Kurzius","Want to say something else about margins and that is that when we spoke on our second quarter call we talked about there's still some pricing action to come and to response - raw material cost increases. All of that pricing action was taken in the third quarter and is fully in place, so we got full impact of cost in the third quarter but only a partial impact from the pricing which like I said is now fully in place for our strongest quarter of the year.","Operator","Our next is from the line of Alexia Howard with AllianceBernstein. Please proceed with your question.","Alexia Howard","So I guess a couple of quick questions, firstly on the industrial business. It seems as though there was a big surge in profitability this time around, I guess partly because of the operating leverage and the cost cutting and maybe better mix. Is that something - have you just taken the business to a whole new level and we can expect this to be the new sort of base going forward so that\u2019s first question.","And then on the e-commerce side, it sounded from your comments I guess recently and so e-commerce is growing phenomenally well for you at the moment. How concerned are you with the Amazon acquisition of the 364 Whole Foods and hence the 365 brand. How do you expect that to play out over time, how confident are you that your market share online and your profitability online is going to be at least as good in the base business? Thank you very much and I\u2019ll pass it on.","Lawrence Kurzius","So we\u2019ve been talking for the last two years about the work that we\u2019re doing on the industrial business to shift the portfolio towards more value-added and technically insulated into the portfolio which would include flavor, seasonings and also branded foodservice. And we\u2019ve made a number of investments there and some of them are quite visible externally like buying Brand Aromatics and Giotti flavors, others may be less visible on the outside but are quite significant on the inside.","We\u2019ve had important customer wins on the flavor side of the business. And so that has been an area of focus that is - we believe is going to drive a long-term improvement in the margin. I know we talked about that like the Investor conference and on other calls.","I will say it is lumpy and so - the industrial business does not come in a straight line sometimes it comes in chunks, but that would be I think when you think about the trend in that business this is representative of the level that we\u2019re trying to take the business to.","And Mike if you want to comment on that further I\u2019ll let you chime in. On e-commerce you were right that is an area that is a growing tremendously. We had over resourced e-commerce for the last several years because we just believe that it's inevitable that\u2019s going to be an important part of the consumer buying behavior. And we just don't believe that consumers long-term are going to buy groceries any differently than they buy other products.","So we leaned in pretty hard on e-commerce and we got some external recognition about it. You mentioned a particular customer. We are trying to get away from talking about that particular \u2013 whose name I\u2019m not even saying, that particular customer specifically on the call that has been our policy not to talk about specific customers in the last several quarters just because of the focus on e-commerce, a very large e-commerce customer keeps coming up by name and so I\u2019m going to try and get away from that.","But I will say that we\u2019re really positive about the trend line in our e-commerce business, the fact that we got in there early with important e-commerce customers that's given us a great partnership. If you try out some of these home devices for ordering and ask about ordering spices, you\u2019re going to find out that that McCormick items come up at the top. And so we see more opportunity than risk frankly.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Ken Goldman with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your questions.","Ken Goldman","One quick one for me and then a broader one. I just wanted to make sure I had my arms around all the special charges in particular there\u2019s that 15.4 million of transaction and integration expenses included in other debt costs that I think we\u2019re excluding. Is all of that debt issuance is there anything else in there I\u2019m just trying to get a sense of what's being excluded because I know there is a lot of different moving pieces?","Mike Smith","This is Mike. That was the cost setting up the bridge. We didn\u2019t have to fund the bridge which is one of the - we got our debt financing in place that\u2019s one of the reasons that number wasn\u2019t higher but that is exclusively related to setting up the bridge.","Ken Goldman","And then it doesn\u2019t seem in the numbers that the answer is yes, but have you had any difficulty at all passing along some of your cost inflation to some of your retail customers. I know the business you\u2019re in is quite different I know you have tremendous brands and so again the proof would suggest that the answer is no. But some of your competitors or peers rather in the Food group have suggested that they have had more pricing pressure lately or difficulty passing it on. So just kind of wanted to ask you or take on that if you seen any increased challenges along those lines in the last few months?","Lawrence Kurzius","There is always a healthy commercial tension and discussions about pricing with customers. And so I\u2019m not going to say that it is easy but I will say that we've really got all over the place. And largely on schedule, we did have a real cost basis for taking the actions that we did. It was very clear to the customer in particular all their alternatives frankly - either had to go up as well, or not able to supply.","So we were able to get all of the pricing away and really you know it's actually a rearview mirror thing at this point because the pricing actions that we intended to take were executed in the third quarter.","Mike Smith","And there were primarily as you remember we had two large commodity shocks of vanilla and garlic. So those are very well known shortages of supply. Other suppliers couldn't supply vanilla for example. So in those cases very well documented. It wasn't an across-the-board price increase which in this environment is really difficult.","Lawrence Kurzius","I\u2019ll also say that we have taken several moves on vanilla as the cost of vanilla beans has moved from single digits per pound to well over $200 a pound and that's been well understood in the industry and so their price increases have been accepted.","We also modeled a considerable amount of consumer elasticity, and you know some of the increases we took last year we saw less this year might have been a bit higher than we thought as consumers got used to the higher levels of pricing but right now we're actually seeing less elasticity than we've modeled.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Brett Hundley with Vertical Group. Please proceed with your questions.","Brandon Groeger","This is actually Brandon Groeger on for Brett Hundley. The press release noted the industrial business benefited from new products, it expanded the distribution customer intimacy. I was curious where the company is on the computation of creativity program for its industrial business. It\u2019s been said earlier in the year that commercial application might be ready by the end of the year, I was wondering if that was still the case and what the biggest value of the program is, is it more to engage companies in becoming partners at the core maker or is it more related to innovation timing and competitive rate success?","Lawrence Kurzius","I've got to say this is the first question on this topic that we've got and that\u2019s fantastic. You know this is a game changer that we are very proud of. I think at our Investor Day we talked about this externally for the first time at any depth and we said we would be putting into use. We are actually - we actually do have the system up and running with one particular customer right now.","I don't want to say too much about it just yet other than that is very exciting. We intend to talk quite a bit more about this next year at one of the major investor conferences.","Brandon Groeger","And then quickly if you could, can you put any more parameters around the revenue and synergy opportunities related to RB Foods. I'm thinking about flanks, what does it take to get that five share globally or 10 share globally. What's realistic and can you leverage your experience and how long it might take to actually start seeing some material sales growth abroad. We see real opportunities related to this, just kind of looking for some more color on how it all comes together?","Lawrence Kurzius","I\u2019ll talk about the cost side, then we\u2019ll talk about revenue, synergy in a second. Obviously the cost side we laid out the synergy level with $50 million which we feel comfortable with based on our historical performance with our acquisitions and our CCI program and in the cost of goods sold areas like procurement obviously or an SG&A across the business.","On the revenue synergy side you're reading from our playbook, we did see a lot of \u2013 one of the challenges for RB Foods in the U.S. was growing internationally. They really couldn't utilize the resources globally. So we have a global infrastructure with over 40% of sales outside the U.S.","So, we do see a runway for growth there that - already in U.K. and Latin America but China other areas of APZ, bringing those products both on a foodservice and a consumer side.","Mike Smith","I\u2019ll just add to that that our financial model was not dependent on growth in the international business. We did model growth in the international business and we saw there is an opportunity but the bulk of the financial return that - has to come from performance in the Americas and to our growth internationally is really upside to that model to justify the deal on the first place. We see the opportunity to make Frank's RedHot the number one hot sauce in the world as a real goal.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of David Driscoll with Citi. Please proceed with your question.","David Driscoll","Wanted to ask you guys just one big picture question if you could just simply state what is the different pieces that have gone into the guidance change today. Since I\u2019m getting a lot of questions about the impact of the acquisition and the real improvements that we\u2019ve seen in industrial and the gross margin changes. But just like to hear from you how do you guys think about this increase in guidance for topline and bottom line and really just what are the factors driving the increase today?","Mike Smith","And really - like I said before the RB business didn't have much impact on the third quarter. It is going to have a nice impact on the fourth quarter but what we\u2019re really excited about is our core business. Through the three quarters you can see that the numbers on a net sales adjusted operating profit and EPS very strong. Our guidance for an EPS is 4.5 to 4.13 this is when the time of the year we normally narrow the range. And given the fact that we\u2019re at or above our net sales targets and guidance our \u2013 adjusted operating income guidance for the year were above that and at the high-end of our EPS range. The core business we would have brought that up at the top of the range.","So you can model that at 4.12 to 4.14. You can then do the math at the remainder of the call up due to the RB Foods business impact in the fourth quarter. The key point of RB Foods it's very seasonal business. 30% of the sales are in the fourth quarter, high margins in the fourth quarter just like our businesses at McCormick. There is a lot of holiday items have a higher margin which is good for us.","So there is a nice impact in the fourth quarter for us. The interest expense as you know happens on a quarterly basis 25, 25, 25 so that accentuates the RB impact in the fourth quarter this year. On top of that too, we issued shares for this as you know 6.5 million shares based on average shares outstanding calculations only about a quarter of that gets into this year the whole impact is into next year.","So what you see is while we\u2019re still saying it\u2019s a 5% cash accretive over a 12 month first year basis, that\u2019s pulling some of that into the fourth quarter. So its little lumpy but we\u2019re really pleased I hope I gave you kind of the color behind why the fourth quarter - what our full year call up is but I want to also emphasize the core underlying business is doing very well.","David Driscoll","And just one detailed follow-up, I believe you said in the script that the amortization expense for the RB Foods transaction was reduced by, I think more than half. Can you just say what happened there caused that revision of that magnitude?","Mike Smith","No, there were couple of things obviously - when an acquisition is big you use a lot of external people to help value things. A couple things we had initially when we thought there probably be a value on a non-compete with the previous owner. But based on analysis and the understanding we didn't have to put an intangible value on that. Also I think some of the other assumptions on the values of some of the brand intangibles or customer relationships and things like that moved around based on some of the modeling we did.","So we\u2019re a little conservative I think overall on that, but we wanted to make sure we corrected that as we learn more, more about the business to and Lawrence we only owned now for six weeks. And that is a preliminary valuation to as my controller is thinking right now. So I want to make sure of it, but $8 million to $10 million range is a good estimate for now.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your questions.","Adam Samuelson","So maybe following up on David's question on kind of the base business and I appreciate the kind of commentary that you would had your based guidance kind of moving like a 412 to 414 range or so based on the year-to-date performance for the organic. Would your base business sales expectations have actually changed or have they changed it\u2019s somewhat unclear based on the revised guidance's?","Lawrence Kurzius","They\u2019ll be at the high-end of the range.","Adam Samuelson","Okay.","Lawrence Kurzius","They'll be at the high-end of the range on the base business and then if you do the math they have seem to have a really good fourth quarter and strong fourth quarter really and we talked in the past - back half of the year we\u2019re going to have a strong new product sales, lot of launches in the U.S. market with liquid gravies and our breakfast platform.","You look at industrial last year was a little weak we\u2019re expecting a strong fourth quarter there and we\u2019re laughing EMEA consumer some of that challenge we had earlier in the year. So we feel strong sales on the core business.","Mike Smith","I wouldn't underestimate the sequential improvement that you\u2019re seeing in our sales also because these are - not up against soft comparisons, these are up against strong comparisons from a year ago.","Adam Samuelson","And that was the kind of the follow-up that was the understanding there is a mix between the different business. And so is it both consumer and industrial or is the confidence in some of the new product launches and momentum into the holidays on the consumer side specifically in the U.S. and maybe the comps on EMEA?","Mike Smith","It\u2019s confidence on both of our segments - it\u2019s broad-based.","Adam Samuelson","And then in the industrial business on the margin side clearly some very sizable year-on-year margin gains that drove a lot of the corporate EBIT growth. Can you almost think about \u2013 some of the more drivers \u2013 the Giotti mix and then \u2013 just the customer acquisition raw materials I mean just help us think about a little more of the variances there \u2013 it\u2019s a sizable increase of that business?","Mike Smith","I mean it\u2019s all the above - we talked about I mean Giotti as we talk about strategy moving up the value chain higher end flavors do help us, strength of our branded foodservice business which is higher margin business again we talked about strength in North America for that so that that helps us, combination of CCI initiatives across those businesses help.","So it seems like a big number but it's all those above and they seem to be firing on all cylinders now. It is lumpy as Lawrence said you got to be little careful to project forward all these great results but they had a good couple quarters now, we\u2019re still confident with the visibility to new product pipeline and the margin increasing activities will continue.","Lawrence Kurzius","I want to be clear that big driver especially over the taking the quarter out of a \u2013 but thinking long-term is the portfolio shift. There are different categories more value added then others we\u2019ve really focused on the more value-added areas that have technology as an element or our branding as an element to create value.","Operator","Our final question is a follow-up from the line of Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your questions.","Robert Moskow","Actually for Mike, I think you were trying to be very clear that the fourth quarter for RB Foods will provide a lot of that first year accretion. It\u2019s about $0.11 is the implication. And I think if you go by this 5% kind of accretion guide, I think that's about $0.20.","So can I assume that the difference there this extra $0.09 would help your normal algorithm for 2018 kind of something a little extra to your normal algorithm for 2018, I know you don\u2019t want to give 2018 guidance but can't blame you.","Mike Smith","No I don\u2019t want to give - you\u2019re correct Rob. And I\u2019ll be a little careful I mean that right to the 11 number if you do the math it's actually 7 to 11, you can range the RB impact based on what I said. But as similar to ours, it does have seasonality the first quarter just like our business is the smallest of the year but you're right we\u2019re going to get to that 5% which you have to model in is getting - we\u2019re going to have 133 million shares outstanding all of next year. The math the way it works this year is like 128.5 million or so.","So you're getting that a little bit headwind in those first three quarters and actually the whole year from this. So just remember that.","Lawrence Kurzius","Yes but I do want to lose the threat we talked about 5% accretion as we've gotten it we see no reason that we\u2019re going to miss that 5% accretion and that was 5% accretion over the first 12 months not of fiscal 2018. So with this quarter and the first three quarters of 2018 this is as much guidance as I guess we\u2019re going to give on 2018 at this point, but those things - that time period - is what we said we we\u2019re going to get 5% accretion and we still believe we\u2019re going to do so.","Robert Moskow","Just mathematically though it's got to help.","Lawrence Kurzius","The CEO should not be talking about accretion I\u2019ll give it back to Mike.","Robert Moskow","But mathematically it's got to help you in 2018 just in terms of the numbers.","Mike Smith","Definitely. There is no question, it's incremental to our base business.","Lawrence Kurzius","It plays a little bit with the percentage growth rates and then remember when these more shares are coming through - this 6.5 million shares full impact does create a little bit of headwind on a percentage growth base just from bottom line.","Operator","Thank you. At this time, I will turn the floor back to Lawrence Kurzius for closing remarks.","Lawrence Kurzius","Well, thanks everyone for your questions and for participating in today's call. McCormick is a global leader in flavor, a growing and advantaged business platform which is now even broader with the addition of RB Foods.

This is Kasey Jenkins, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you for joining today\u2019s call for a discussion of McCormick\u2019s First Quarter Financial Results and our current outlook for 2017. To accompany our call, we\u2019ve posted a set of slides at ir.mccormick.com.","We will begin with remarks from Lawrence Kurzius, Chairman, President and CEO; and Mike Smith, Executive Vice President and CFO, and then open the line for questions. [Operator Instructions]. We also have Joyce Brooks of McCormick Investor Relations on the call.","During our remarks, we will refer to non-GAAP financial measures. These include adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share that exclude the impact of special charges as well as information in constant currency. Reconciliations to the GAAP results are included in this morning\u2019s press release and slides.","As a reminder, today\u2019s presentation contains projections and other forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those projected. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or other factors. As seen on Slide 2, our forward-looking statement also provides information on risk factors that could affect our financial results.","It is now my pleasure to turn the discussion over to Lawrence.","Lawrence Kurzius","Thank you, Kasey. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. McCormick\u2019s first quarter results were a solid start to the year delivering operating income and earnings per share growth, margin improvement and higher sales. We executed against strategies which will drive strong results as we go through the year.","Starting with our top line for the first quarter, we grew sales 4% in constant currency from the year-ago period. Sales from our acquisitions of Gourmet Garden, Cajun Injector and Giotti added 3 percentage points of the increase.","The remaining 1% constant currency sales growth was led by our industrial business this period which delivered solid sales growth from our food service brands and customized flavors in the Americas and quick service restaurants in the Asia-Pacific region.","Consumer segment sales, excluding acquisitions, were comparable to the year-ago period. We had strong sales momentum in China offset by the impact of weak U.S. food industry trends during the period and a challenging retail environment in the UK.","We increased our gross profit margin 30 basis points year-on-year. This improvement was the result of cost savings from our comprehensive continuous improvement program CCI and shifts in our portfolio to more value-added products.","We grew first quarter adjusted operating income 8% from the year-ago period on a constant currency basis led by the higher sales, increased gross profit margin and a reduction in our selling, general and administrative expenses, despite increased brand marketing.","Both segments achieved an increase in operating income and higher operating income margins. At the bottom line, adjusted earnings per share of $0.76 was an increase of 3% from the $0.74 in the first quarter of 2016. This includes the unfavorable impact of currency.","For fiscal 2017, we reaffirm our plans to deliver constant currency growth of 5% to 7% for sales, 9% to 11% for adjusted operating income and 9% to 11% for adjusted earnings per share. Each of these growth rates is at or above our long-term constant currency objectives.","I\u2019d like to turn now to a business update. Let\u2019s begin with the consumer segment and start with our observations about market conditions in the U.S. As has been widely recognized by food analysts and investors, U.S. consumer purchases for center-of-store food were soft in the first quarter, especially in February. This is based on retail consumption reports for the period which showed a measurable year-on-year deceleration across many categories.","While retail sales growth of spices and seasonings exceeded the performance of most center-of-store categories, continuing to display its relative strength, our category was impacted by the industry slowdown as well. We believe that this short-term slowdown can be attributed to a confluence of factors, including unseasonable weather, a late Easter and the timing of income tax refund payments, which are likely temporary.","In fact, a few weeks into our second quarter we have seen an uptick in our sales of U.S. consumer products. Our outlook for U.S. sales of spices and seasonings for the balance of the year remains strong and unchanged from our prior projections.","Taking a closer look at the first quarter, our customized IRI consumption data indicated strong category dollar growth for spices and seasonings at 6%. During the same period, retail sales of McCormick branded spices and seasonings grew 4%.","The IRI data showed pricing was 4% for both the category and McCormick with underlying volume growth of 2% for the category and flat for McCormick. Both of these growth rates for McCormick and the category were lower than at past quarters and coincide with the general weakness in center-of-store food categories.","Within our spice and seasoning sales in the first quarter, we experienced particular weakness in Hispanic items and we attribute this in part for the timing impact of a late Easter in 2017.","In this same period, we had areas of strength and the most notable was our exceptional sales growth of Gourmet Garden products. This product line continues to build momentum in the U.S. with first quarter consumption growth up over 25% from the year-ago period.","In measured channels, McCormick U.S. branded share declined 90 basis points this quarter. This overstates our share loss as we continue to achieve strong growth in unmeasured channels. These are retail channels not captured in Nielsen or IRI data and not in the IRI consumption data I shared.","In the first quarter, we had double-digit sales growth with club and e-commerce. We estimate that these unmeasured channels added another approximately 1.5 percentage points to our retail sales growth for spices and seasonings.","Looking ahead to the balance of the year, we expect our strong performance from unmeasured channels to continue. We also expect to benefit from the reversal of the timing issues I mentioned.","For our consumer business in the Americas, we\u2019re confident in our outlook for a number of other reasons. First, we have had strong retail acceptance on new products including Lawry's brand products and the expanded distribution for our Gourmet organic line.","Beyond spices and seasonings, we\u2019re gaining distributions with new Zatarain\u2019s items and Kitchen Basics organic and bone broth. We expect continued strength with the sales of Gourmet Garden products. We have strong marketing plans.","We successfully executed against our pricing initiatives during the first quarter and importantly, our products remain well aligned and on trend with consumer demand for flavorful healthy eating. We look forward to sharing more about our growth plans at next week\u2019s Investor Day at McCormick.","As we look outside of the Americas, we are experiencing various retail conditions across our top markets. We grew sales in China at a double-digit rate in constant currency. The growth was broad based across our different brands and channels, including e-commerce, and we expect this performance to continue throughout 2017.","In the UK, a challenging retail environment has persisted and we\u2019ve been impacted by a large retailer\u2019s reduction of shelf space for food products. Given these conditions, it is particularly important to keep our brands relevant through marketing and innovation.","We\u2019ve invested in marketing with the launch of our purity campaign in the UK. Our latest new product launches in Europe include a gluten-free line of recipe mixes in the UK and the introduction of Thai Kitchen products in France.","Sales across the consumer segment were up 2% over the year-ago period in constant currency with the benefit of higher sales and our CCI-led cost savings, we grew first quarter adjusted operating income 5% in constant currency. Adjusted operating margin for this segment expanded 45 basis points from the first quarter of 2016.","Turning to our industrial segment, we had excellent performance starting at the top line with 6% constant currency sales growth. In the Americas, we grew sales of our branded food service business at a double-digit rate with the benefit from expanded distribution as well as pricing.","We are also seeing continued momentum and double-digit growth in sales of savory flavor products from our 2015 Brand Aromatics acquisition. Across our broad industrial portfolio in the Americas, we are executing against a new product pipeline of on-trend and better-for-you products. We are particularly excited about the increased customer demand for organic seasoning blends for snacks.","In Europe, Middle East and Africa, EMEA, incremental sales from our Giotti acquisition contributed double-digit sales growth for the first quarter of 2017. Our integration of Giotti is progressing well. This increase in sales was offset in part by the impact of our decision in late 2016 to exit a low margin business from our South African operation.","We drove sales in the Asia-Pacific region, mainly in China and Australia, with new products and promotional activities of quick service restaurants. In addition to the industrial segment\u2019s overall 6% constant currency sales growth, our cost reduction efforts and our portfolio shift to more value-added products drove an 18% constant currency increase in adjusted operating income.","Adjusted operating margin for this segment expanded 67 basis points from the first quarter of 2016. We are continuing to shift our product portfolio for the industrial segment to more value-added products through innovation and acquisitions.","Let me summarize by restating that our first quarter financial results across both our consumer and industrial segments were a solid start to 2017. We have confidence in our fiscal year outlook for our growth plans for brand marketing, innovation across both our consumer and industrial segments and opportunities to expand distribution.","We\u2019re balancing our resources and efforts to drive sales with our work to lower costs and are on track to achieve approximately $100 million in 2017 cost savings led by our CCI program. Around the world, McCormick employees are driving momentum and I thank them for their effort and their engagement.","It is now my pleasure to turn it over to Mike.","Michael Smith","Thanks, Lawrence, and good morning, everyone. I\u2019m going to discuss our first quarter results followed by comments on our current 2017 financial outlook. We started the year with an increase in adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share that was in line with our expectations and a more modest increase in sales as we had indicated in our first quarter outlook.","Let\u2019s turn right to our top line results as seen on Slide 11. On a constant currency basis, we grew sales 4%. The incremental impact of acquisitions completed in 2016 and in early 2017 was 3%. The other 1% was driven by the pricing actions we took in response to higher material costs, offset partially by lower volume in the consumer segment.","On Slide 12, consumer segment sales in the Americas rose 2% in constant currency with Gourmet Garden and Cajun Injector contributing 3%. During this period, as Lawrence commented, we were impacted by weaknesses across the U.S. food industry in many center-of-store categories.","In particular, Hispanic sales were weak partially due to timing issues such as a late Easter. As we had previously indicated, our planned pricing actions in the U.S. were successfully implemented midway through the quarter.","In EMEA, constant currency sales were down 5% from a year ago. The largest decrease was in the UK where a challenging retail market continues to adversely impact sales. This included a reduction in the number of Schwartz brand products by a large UK retailer which has been rationalizing its portfolio to gain space for general merchandize.","In France, our sales of Vahine homemade dessert products were also impacted by the late Easter. We grew consumer sales in the Asia-Pacific region by 13% in constant currency. Sales from Gourmet Garden added 4 percentage points of this increase.","In China, we grew constant currency sales at a double-digit rate driven by holiday promotions as well as e-commerce growth which offset a sales decline in India. The India decline results from our prior decision to discontinue certain low margin Kohinoor products and the associated sell-off of that discontinued inventory in the first quarter of 2016.","For the consumer segment in total, our first quarter adjusted operating income rose 4% to $98 million. In constant currency, adjusted operating income rose 5% from the year-ago period with the impact of sales growth and lower expenses, including CCI-driven cost savings more than offsetting higher material costs and an increase in brand marketing in this period.","Turning to our industrial segment, we had excellent results in this quarter in both sales and profit. Starting with sales growth in constant currency, we grew sales 6% with increases in each of the three regions. Adjusted operating income was up 18% in constant currency driven by higher sales, a shift in more value-added products and the impact of our CCI program.","On Slide 17, we grew Americas sales 3% in constant currency led by pricing actions as well as double-digit sales growth of savory flavors and branded food service products which was partially offset by lower sales to quick service restaurants.","Sales of Giotti contributed 14% to our 13% constant currency growth in EMEA. Discontinuation of a lower margin business was partially offset by solid pricing-led sales growth with packaged food companies.","We grew industrial segment sales in the Asia-Pacific region 10% in constant currency, as Lawrence indicated, both our China and Australia operations at higher sales to quick service restaurants in the region benefitting from new products and promotional activities.","Adjusted operating income for the industrial segment ended the quarter up 10% at $40 million. In constant currency, the growth was even greater at 18% with the factors I already mentioned and as spelled out on Slide 20. We also increased marketing for this segment in support of our branded food service business.","Those of you who follow us closely know that the industrial segment tends to have some quarter-to-quarter profit volatility, largely attributable to customer activity including new product launches, limited time offers and other promotions.","Following an exceptionally strong first quarter, we are projecting adjusted operating income growth for this segment to slow in the second quarter. For the fiscal year, we expect both an increase in adjusted operating income and improved margins versus 2016.","Across both segments, adjusted operating income, which excludes special charges, rose 5% in the first quarter from the year-ago period. If we also exclude the impact of unfavorable currency, we grew adjusted operating income by 8% even with an increase in brand marketing.","Gross profit margin was up year-on-year as well with a 30 basis point increase. This improvement was the result of CCI-led cost savings and favorable mix. As a percentage of net sales, selling, general and administrative expense was down 20 basis points including a $3 million increase in brand marketing. Excluding this increase, we had lower expenses during the period which included CCI-led cost savings.","Below the operating income line, the tax rate this quarter was 27.8% compared to 26.9% in the year-ago period. We continue to expect the rate for the full year to approximate 28%. As a result of unfavorable currency, income from unconsolidated operations declined 17% to $7 million. This currency impact masked a strong underlying sales performance led by our joint venture in Mexico, which grew sales at a double-digit rate in local currency.","We also pleased with the performance of our Eastern joint venture in India which is delivering growth in sales and profit. Based on prevailing currency rates, we now expect a mid to high-single digit decline in 2017 income from unconsolidated operations.","At the bottom line, first quarter 2017 adjusted earnings per share was $0.76, up from $0.74 for the year-ago period, mainly due to higher adjusted operating income. This result included the unfavorable impact from currency on both consolidated and unconsolidated income.","On Slide 25, we\u2019ve summarized highlights for cash flow in the quarter and balance sheet. During the first quarter, cash flow from operations was $44 million compared to $79 million in the year-ago period. A slight increase in net income was offset mainly by the timing of income tax payments and incentive compensation payments related to 2016\u2019s financial performance.","We returned $142 million of cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases and used $30 million for capital expenditures this period. At the end of the first quarter, $244 million remained on the current $600 million share repurchase authorization. Our balance sheet remains strong. We are generating strong cash flow and we are well positioned to fund future investments to drive growth.","Let\u2019s move now to our current financial outlook for 2017 on Slide 26. Our strong outlook for the year is unchanged except for the impact from special charges related to the organization and streamlining actions we have underway. Our 2017 projection of special charges has increased to approximately $11 million from $4 million.","At the top line, we reaffirm our plan to grow sales 5% to 7% in constant currency which includes the incremental impact of approximately 2% from acquisitions completed in fiscal year 2016 and Giotti acquired in December 2016. We anticipate a combination of pricing and higher volume and product mix to contribute 3% to 5% of growth. Including the estimated impact of currency, we project sales growth of 3% to 5% in 2017.","On a constant currency basis, we continue to expect to increase adjusted operating income 9% to 11% from adjusted operating income of $675 million in 2016. Currency is expected to lower this range to 8% to 10%. We plan to drive this increase with higher sales and at least $100 million in CCI-led cost savings. With this fuel for growth, we plan to also fund a high-single digit increase in brand marketing.","We reaffirm projected adjusted earnings per share of $4.05 to $4.13. Excluding the estimated 2 percentage point impact of unfavorable currency rates, this range remains an increase of 9% to 11% from adjusted earnings per share of $3.78 in 2016.","In the second quarter of 2017, we expect adjusted earnings per share to be comparable to $0.75 from adjusted earnings per share in the second quarter of 2016. Keep in mind that we had a very low tax rate in the second quarter of 2016, at 23% which is below our outlook of 28% for fiscal year 2017.","In addition, the impact of unfavorable currency exchange rates is particularly high in the second quarter of 2017. This impact is not only translation but also transactional which places pressure on our gross margin in the second quarter. We are also planning additional investments in our brand marketing.","As a final remark on our outlook, we are on track for another year of strong cash flow for fiscal year 2017 with higher adjusted net income and actions underway to improve our working capital.","That completes my remarks. So let\u2019s turn now to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. At this time, we\u2019ll be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is from the line of Alexia Howard with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.","Alexia Howard","Good morning, everyone.","Lawrence Kurzius","Good morning, Alexia.","Alexia Howard","Hi. So a couple of questions. First of all, on the share losses in measured channels, is that still share losses to smaller brands in other parts of the store or is it private label and is it likely to get any better? Thank you.","Lawrence Kurzius","Alexia, we lost through measured channels about nine-tenths of a share point. And as we mentioned on the call, we think that that overstates our actual loss because of the strength that we experienced in the unmeasured channels. But regarding the measured channels in particular, we think that we actually have been quite effective in our responses to the smaller competitors. We made our brands more relevant. We\u2019ve bought the most successful of them frankly, the Gourmet Garden business. And so we think that we\u2019ve done a pretty good job of dealing with the smaller competitors. I don\u2019t want to leave out Hispanic brands also where we\u2019ve had quite a strong response with our branded products with the launch of items like Lawry's Casero range and the continued expansion of our El Guapo in the truly heavily Hispanic-targeted stores. I\u2019d say that right now private label is the bigger issue particularly on a dollar share basis. Part of it is something that we\u2019ve created ourselves. A great deal of our category management effort has been directed towards changing the price structure of the category and encouraging retailers to take higher pricing on private label, and you\u2019re seeing that coming through in the data where private label dollar growth is very strong over and above unit growth. I don\u2019t want to lose track of the fact that about half of the reported private label growth is actually not through growth but it\u2019s a conversion of a controlled brand by one of the major retailers from a branded item to their private label and a reclassification of sales in the data.","Alexia Howard","Great. Thank you. Can I just have a quick follow up on the transactional effects of FX? Could you just describe where those are happening just so that we can understand from which region to which region are some of these things being shipped and sold?","Michael Smith","Sure. This is Mike, Alexia. Obviously last year with Brexit happening in June, we saw a large decrease in the euro and the pound and actually a lot of currencies like the peso after that. So if you go back to last year, remember the first six months of last year we had margin expansion between 70 and 130 basis points. It became a little more challenging in the second six last year as some of this currency rates went against us. You\u2019re seeing that really the biggest impact for us in the first half of this year is in the second quarter and if you look at the currency charge, you can see that very clearly. We see that trend building for us in the second six of this year, so you\u2019re seeing really a timing issue between the two years.","Alexia Howard","Great. Thank you very much. I\u2019ll pass it on.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your questions.","Robert Moskow","Hi. Good morning.","Lawrence Kurzius","Good morning, Robert.","Robert Moskow","Good morning. I agree with your comments that first quarter had probably some transitory issues related to center-of-store slowdown. But when I compared the retail growth rate that you cited for your category in first quarter at 6% and I think it was only 5% in fourth quarter. And then for your McCormick products, I think it was 4% in both when you brought it all in together, including Hispanic and club. So is the consumer slowing down in the category in first quarter compared to fourth or not? Because I think the numbers you provide indicate that it really wasn\u2019t quite so bad.","Lawrence Kurzius","Well, I think that you\u2019re referring to dollar growth and there\u2019s a bit more pricing in the first quarter than it was in the fourth quarter. And so I\u2019m going to go to the second part of your question, which is do we see a consumer slowdown in the first quarter. And absolutely yes and it\u2019s across a whole center of the store. Everybody has published on this and the Nielsen data that is out there shows that the center-of-store had quite a strong slowdown especially going into February. That impacted the spice category. Relative strength was still good compared to other categories, but there was certainly an impact on the off-take. Look, we expect that our Q1 sales growth to be the lowest sales growth quarter for us in 2017. We only had a partial quarter of the pricing, so that impacted our dollar sales. Most of our distribution wins come on stream later in the year and we had some known losses last year that we knew were going to flow into this year, like the UK distribution loss, I know that\u2019s not U.S. but I\u2019m talking at the total company level right now. We didn\u2019t talk about it on the call and it was factored into our expectations for the quarter but we even had one day less because last year was leap year. And although that\u2019s a small thing, it\u2019s still 1 percentage point. What we didn\u2019t anticipate was the slower industry sales in the U.S., which as we\u2019ve discussed on the call we think are really due to transitory factors. We don\u2019t see anything in our data going into March. I know we\u2019re getting into second quarter here, but we don\u2019t see anything in our data going into March to suggest the slowness that we saw in January and February as continuing. And for the reasons that we gave on the call, we think that it is transitory and the timing of tax payments. I think Lent had a big impact on us. Our business has a very high index to Hispanic consumers who are more catholic. The later Easter made all of Lent fall outside of the quarter and we\u2019re certainly seeing the reversal of that in March. And then the weather that was out of sync with the season where it was just very warm and that discourages consumption of the cold weather items that normally we sell a lot of during that time of year, chili, gravy and all of the things that go along with that.","Robert Moskow","Okay. And maybe a question for Mike. When I look at your back half implied EPS guidance now, I think it implies some pretty strong double-digit earnings growth off of what was a pretty tough third quarter anyway. So what\u2019s driving that strong earnings growth? Is it going to be the full impact of the pricing? Is there an incremental benefit in terms of restructuring savings, because of these new special charges, is that helping also?","Michael Smith","Yes. Well, I think what you\u2019re seeing \u2013 the main thing is back to the transactional, the timing of the first six versus the second six. We really got hit in the second quarter pretty hard compared to last year and that was the biggest gross margin increase last year to 130 basis points. We\u2019re also seeing CCI really is more back loaded this year than in the past. We\u2019ve got a lot of great projects to get to our 100 million and actually hope to exceed that. We\u2019ve expanded this program globally. So we will see additional savings in the latter part of the year. Plus pricing; we\u2019ve talked about the U.S. a lot but also some of our European operations do price in the second quarter range, so we get the full impact in the second six there too.","Robert Moskow","Okay. Thank you.","Lawrence Kurzius","Thanks, Rob.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of David Driscoll with Citigroup. Please proceed with your questions.","Cornell Burnette","Good morning, everyone. This is Cornell Burnette in with a few questions for David.","Lawrence Kurzius","Good morning.","Cornell Burnette","Great. Just wanted to know if you could impact perhaps what the timing of the Easter shift meant to the top line in the first quarter and then what would that imply for 2Q?","Lawrence Kurzius","I don\u2019t want to try to quantify that but there\u2019s no doubt that there was an impact on our business as a result of that. On our core McCormick business we index strongly to the Hispanic consumer or Lawry's brand index very strongly to the Hispanic consumer. And a portion of our Lawry's range is actually specifically targeted to them. Hispanics tend to be more catholic than general population and have the Lent in timing as a vigor impact on us as a result; also our Zatarain's product which are also heavily influenced by the Lent in timing were impacted in this period as well. It\u2019s just unfortunate that Lent literally started on the first day of March and so it completely fell out of our quarter and that does have an impact in both shifting consumption and in shifting retailer purchases in anticipation of that consumption. I\u2019m not ready to quantify it but we believe that it was pretty real.","Michael Smith","I\u2019d go to our yearly guidance of 5% to 7% and assume the rest of the quarter should be around that range. First quarter, we came 4% slightly below that 5%. So you can assume the second would be in that range.","Cornell Burnette","Okay, very good. And then can you just talk a little bit, it seems like the Asia-Pacific segment in consumer did some really nice things here. I think China was particularly strong for you. I\u2019m just wondering if you can describe what\u2019s going on in that market and kind of how \u2013 what driving some of the strength there and how sustainable that is going forward?","Lawrence Kurzius","Well, in particular for us China\u2019s growth was strong and broad based and this continues really a long-term trend there. There\u2019s not any particular news about it. We have had a long run of high-single digit, low-double digit growth in China that has continued to this day. And we could see a long runway of growth in that market. Our brands are gaining share in all of the categories that we compete in, in China. We\u2019ve got continued strong growth of new placements and distribution. And on top of that, e-commerce is developing as a strong growth channel for us in China. Last year, our e-commerce business in China was up over 100% and it is also up over 100% year-to-date this year.","Cornell Burnette","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Please proceed with your questions.","Andrew Lazar","Good morning, everybody.","Lawrence Kurzius","Good morning, Andrew.","Andrew Lazar","I guess with all the variables that you\u2019ve highlighted that impacted volume in the Americas consumer segment in the quarter, I\u2019m just trying to get a better sense of whether you can parse out volume elasticity and whether that was more or less in line with your expectations given the recent pricing actions, because it\u2019s obviously hard to tell from our perspective given all the impacts that hit volume in the quarter?","Lawrence Kurzius","Andrew, we just took that pricing in January and so it\u2019s really too soon to read that through with the consumer. We don\u2019t have any reason to believe that what we model and expected is any different than what we were actually realizing in terms of elasticity. Remember, most of the price increase that we took was directed towards vanilla which was commodity driven. We\u2019ve certainly gone up but so has everyone else. Whether branded or private label, vanilla beans are over $200 a pound and everybody\u2019s got a price accordingly. So the elasticity would really be whether people stop using vanilla at all. I think we\u2019ll have a better read on that in a few months particularly as we get past the Easter baking season, we\u2019ll have a better sense of that. Right now, the demand for vanilla is pretty much what we expected it to be.","Andrew Lazar","Got it.","Lawrence Kurzius","And we did expect an elasticity impact due to the size of the increase that we took.","Andrew Lazar","That\u2019s helpful. I appreciate that. And then your comments about obviously just what you\u2019re seeing at least thus far in March in terms of center-of-store for your category on consumption is certainly encouraging given some of the broader industry concerns that we saw earlier in the year. Is your sense, Lawrence, that the broader center-of-store you\u2019ve kind of seen maybe some of that sort of relative rebound from January and February consumption as well, or is your sense that maybe something in your core spices and seasonings category is a little bit different and more favorable to the rest of the store?","Lawrence Kurzius","Well, certainly we\u2019re seeing it in our products and in our category. And I\u2019ve really taken a bit of a guess here but I would guess that the same is true for other categories as well to the extent that whether lent, tax refunding timing impacted the center-of-store and that\u2019s kind of the underlying reason for the slowdown in our area. I would think that the reversal of that that we\u2019re experiencing would hold true for others. I\u2019d also say that in our industrial business the demand for flavors from our consumer packaged goods customers is really strong and so I would say that bodes well as well.","Andrew Lazar","Great. Thank you. See you next week.","Lawrence Kurzius","Looking forward to it, yes.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Evan Morris with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead with your questions.","Evan Morris","Good morning, everyone.","Lawrence Kurzius","Good morning, Evan.","Evan Morris","When I look at how 1Q played out \u2013 when you gave guidance, you said that EPS was going to be kind of flattish year-over-year and one of the variables was a planned increase in marketing expense. We didn\u2019t I guess really see any sort of follow through of benefit on the top line given some of the factors that you talked about. So if we think about 2Q and the guide for flat again, is there a need now to have to raise or spend more on marketing than initially planned because you didn\u2019t get any kind of lift or real return in 1Q, or is that 2Q guide flat EPS really all gross margin and tax rate related?","Lawrence Kurzius","I\u2019ll start this and then I\u2019ll pass it over to Mike. But we did have a modest increase in marketing spend in first quarter and we expect \u2013 actually we expect a greater increase in marketing spend in the second quarter of the year. And I wouldn\u2019t characterize as not giving it a lift. It does not \u2013 the A&P spend and the sales don\u2019t happen simultaneously. I think we feel pretty good about the return that we get on our investment from marketing spend. We have an expectation about strong growth and we\u2019re leaning into that growth with our spending and I think we\u2019ll continue to do so as we go through the year. We plan a pretty good increase in our investment behind our brands for the year as a whole and we believe that\u2019s part of what drives our growth. Mike, do you want to --?","Michael Smith","Yes, I think the thing to consider too is second quarter where Easter is now, the investment spent in the A&P is up a bit. It\u2019s on our full year guidance but it\u2019s really focused. We have a big increase in working media as we activate media, digital against Easter. So that\u2019s where you\u2019ll see a lot of focus in Q2.","Evan Morris","Okay. And then just on the UK, some of the weakness there and you talked about one of the retailers taking away some shelf space. Is that going to continue to be a headwind? Is that now done and behind and what\u2019s sort of your outlook or expectation for the UK consumer business for the balance of the year?","Lawrence Kurzius","That is really the story in the UK, Evan, is that one retailer \u2013 it\u2019s a very concentrated market, so the customers are larger and they all matter and has a big impact not just on our UK business but it\u2019s big enough that it impacts our EMEA business as a whole. The change in shelf space and items in distribution with that retailer really occurred during the fourth quarter of last year. And so that\u2019s an unfavorable comparison that we\u2019re going to carry for that region for the whole year. I will also say that that\u2019s really baked into our thinking that 5% to 7% constant currency. We\u2019ve got a great story in other markets and other markets in that market. We continue to invest in marketing in the UK even with this change because it\u2019s important to show both that customer and the other customers in the market and frankly the consumer the relevance and importance of our brands. And we\u2019re leaning in there with A&P and also with new product launches, like the gluten-free recipe mixes that we\u2019re launching in the UK. Mike, you want to add anything else?","Michael Smith","No, you covered it.","Evan Morris","Thanks. I\u2019ll pass it along.","Lawrence Kurzius","Sure.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Rob Dickerson with Deustche Bank. Please proceed with your questions.","Rob Dickerson","Thank you. Good morning.","Lawrence Kurzius","Good morning.","Rob Dickerson","Just a couple of questions; the first one is just on acquisitions. It seems like with the 3% growth year-over-year in net sales I guess that\u2019s approximately let\u2019s call it a $30 billion contribution to the top line. Is there any way to give me incremental color on what the operating profit contribution was?","Lawrence Kurzius","Generally we say in the first year of an acquisition between integration costs, deal cost, things like that, they\u2019re pretty flat from an operating profit perspective. So Giotti for example, we bought that in mid-December, so you won\u2019t see much impact from that. One of the things you\u2019ll see in the first two quarters is a lot of integration costs and that does speak to the second half strengthening too as another factor. Gourmet Garden, we\u2019re very happy with that business and we don\u2019t disclose separately the impact there but it definitely is positive.","Rob Dickerson","Okay, thank you. And then just on the unconsolidated line I think it used to be comparable for the year, now you\u2019re down a bit. Is that just noise essentially, is that FX related or is there something else we should be aware of?","Lawrence Kurzius","Yes, definitely it\u2019s FX related, Rob, on the peso which is very volatile as you know, has gone against us actually the last two years. But our underlying results from a sales perspective on our Mexican joint venture are excellent.","Rob Dickerson","Okay, cool. And then in capital allocation, obviously the leverage is still low. You like to do acquisitions. But just in terms of buyback, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a target for the year. Is expectation as cash flow build throughout the year that we should be baking in some type of buyback and we\u2019re just considering, I don\u2019t know, let\u2019s call it the cash five year or four years and spending about $200 million a year, is that probably about the same for this year?","Lawrence Kurzius","At the rate we\u2019re buying, you\u2019re right. The hope is obviously our first use of cash is really to go after acquisitions when our pipeline is robust. But in lack of acquisitions we would look at doing other buyback or some sort mid to late year.","Rob Dickerson","Okay, great. See you next week.","Lawrence Kurzius","See you, Rob.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ken Goldman with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your questions.","Tom Palmer","Good morning. It\u2019s Tom Palmer on for Ken.","Lawrence Kurzius","Good morning, Tom.","Tom Palmer","Just had a quick question on the consumer Americas side. When you look at the sales headwinds in the first quarter compared to the robust sales trends we saw late last year, do you think selling ahead of the price increase might have pulled volume just looking in arrears or because it was a mid-quarter increase, do not really think that was a factor?","Lawrence Kurzius","I don\u2019t think that it was a factor. I think you\u2019re exactly right that we took the pricing mid-quarter precisely to make sure that to the extent there was any kind of pre-purchases by customers that it would wash itself out. But importantly we also had \u2013 the primary item that we took the increases on in the U.S. were vanilla and we put vanilla on allocation to our customers, partly to manage any kind of forward buy we did not want to \u2013 in the face of a strongly rising commodity, we did not want to sell out our inventory at a below market price. So I think we managed that pretty well. I don\u2019t think that that is what happened. I think that what we really saw was slow consumption in January and February that washed through.","Tom Palmer","Okay, thanks. And just a quick one. I know we\u2019ve asked about this in past quarters but just wanted to circle back. We still see in Nielsen scanner data weaker sales trends on the gourmet side. Is that still something that on your end you\u2019re seeing more robust sales trends there or was there a bit of a slowdown here in the first quarter there?","Lawrence Kurzius","During the transition to organic we did have some disruption at the shelf which we have worked through. And on the tail end of that we had a lot of heavy promotion by a couple of retailers of their organic private labels. That really related not so much to their desire to be competitive in the spice category but more to a total store promotion on natural and organic items to be competitive with the natural food channel. And there was some irrationally low pricing on organic items through the December and January period in particular. We\u2019ve seen that go back to normal and we\u2019re optimistic that we\u2019re going to see better trends on our gourmet business. In addition, we had a lot of new placements and expanded distribution on gourmet that really comes on a little bit later in the year as the retailers go through their self-reset cycles. So our outlook for gourmet particularly as we lap that transition period from a year ago is actually quite positive. And we believe the conversion to organic was absolutely the right thing to do.","Tom Palmer","Okay. Thank you. See you next week.","Lawrence Kurzius","See you next week.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Jonathan Feeney with Consumer Edge Research. Please proceed with your questions.","Jonathan Feeney","Good morning. Thanks very much. I guess first to follow up and then a bigger question. My first question is a follow up on Evan\u2019s question. I don\u2019t think brand marketing was up double digit this quarter. I think you told us it was up 3 or something that gets to like mid-single digit. Can you kind of correct me on what\u2019s going on with brand marketing and how that worked in this quarter? And secondly on Easter, back in 2014 it was almost the exact same Easter spilt. Ash Wednesday I think \u2013 there was four less days but it was almost the same thing. Ash Wednesday I think was March 5 in 2014 versus it having been \u2013 like February 10 the year before. You didn\u2019t talk about Easter shift in that call. It was asked in the Q&A. And I\u2019m just wondering maybe some of these new acquisitions give them a more impact of Easter. But any color you can give us \u2013 I know you didn\u2019t want to specifically quantify it, but any color you can give us on maybe there\u2019s innovation around fish boils or something like that that\u2019s made our business a little bit more Lent and Easter heavy for future modeling purposes? Thanks.","Michael Smith","Hi, Jonathan. This is Mike. On your first question, we didn\u2019t say brand marketing was up double digits. It was up $3 million as you alluded to in the first quarter.","Jonathan Feeney","I\u2019m sorry. I meant in the \u2013 that was going to kind of be the plan, wasn\u2019t it, from the guidance?","Michael Smith","Yes, we were hopeful. We did really hit the UK hard, as Lawrence mentioned, with purity. But some of the timing, as we said around Easter, we made some decisions there to focus it on where it could be most effective.","Jonathan Feeney","Got you. Thank you very much for that.","Lawrence Kurzius","On the impact of Easter and Lent, we\u2019re talking about it in the context of one of the factors that influenced the slowness in January and February, not just for us but for the industry as a whole. The timing of Lent versus last year we believe is one factor but I\u2019m certainly not saying that it\u2019s the only factor. And I think we\u2019re all looking for the reasons why that period was slow. It does seem that there were some events that would have created a shift versus prior year, the timing of Easter being one; weather being yet another. And I don\u2019t want to underestimate the impact that the change in U.S. income tax refund policy has had pushing those refunds later, especially for consumers at the lower end of the economic spectrum who tend to spend those refunds. Often that\u2019s their earned income coming back to them, those go into regular household consumption and I think it has the same kind of impact as a change in SNAP payments.","Jonathan Feeney","Thank you very much. Look forward to seeing you next week.","Michael Smith","See you, Jonathan.","Lawrence Kurzius","See you then.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Brett Hundley with Vertical Group. Please proceed with your questions.","Brett Hundley","Thank you. Good morning, guys.","Lawrence Kurzius","Good morning, Brett.","Brett Hundley","Just two questions for you, the first on raw materials. You guys are reiterating an expectation of mid-single digit increase in raws for 2017 and I know we\u2019ve all seen headlines on vanilla and garlic. I think you guys have made comment in the past that you would expect to see vanilla and garlic cycle off as the year progresses and I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s still the case. And so when you reiterate a mid-single digit increase, are you may be seeing things go from a plus 4% to a plus 5% or a plus 4% to a plus 6%, or do you see things staying relatively stable still at this point? And if things are shifting a little bit within that mid-single digit increase, is there any incremental pricing that would be required or would you just hope to drive more cost saves as I think you mentioned, Mike? Any color there would be helpful.","Lawrence Kurzius","Hi, Brett. This is Lawrence. I\u2019m going to start and I\u2019m going to pass it to Mike. But we are not indicating any cycling off in the second half for vanilla. Now garlic is an annual crop and so there will be a new crop midyear and we\u2019re hopeful that that\u2019s going to take some of the pressure off of garlic and we may see that one cycle down a bit. But outlook for vanilla which is the major impact item is for it to be strong. We had actually hoped for some relief from the new crop you may or may not have seen in the news. There was a large tropical cyclone in Madagascar that struck the vanilla growing areas at a very inopportunity time. Madagascar produces about 85% of the world\u2019s vanilla crop. The estimates right now are that 20% to 30% of the crop was lost as a result of the cyclone. So we see this high vanilla pricing continuing certainly well into 2018. So I just wanted to address that part of it.","Michael Smith","Vanilla is growing over a two to three year cycle, so it doesn\u2019t have a quick bounce back like garlic which is an annual crop. I\u2019d just kind of say to your range question, I\u2019d still stick with the mid-single digit range. We\u2019re buying crops from 80 different countries. There\u2019s always something up or something down and cinnamon might be going up and pepper might be going down, but generally mid-single digits is still where we stand for the whole commodity base.","Brett Hundley","Okay. I appreciate the clarity there. And then my last question is just it\u2019s on the U.S. consumer set and I know that the issue that\u2019s affecting you in the UK is completely different from what I\u2019m about to ask. But I think that the issue in the UK really stems from Aldis and the Lidls of the world. And what I wanted to ask you about the U.S. is as you see the greater proliferation of Aldi and then Lidl coming onto the U.S. market I think summer time here, especially on the East Coast looks like is where they\u2019re targeting which is obviously a highly populous area. Do you have expectations of existing grocers here in the U.S. trying to beef up private label or become tougher on pricing in order to compete with the potential proliferation of additional discounters here? And can you talk about how you position yourselves in that environment and also just the growing importance of brand marketing as something like that happens as well?","Lawrence Kurzius","Sure, Brett. That\u2019s a very broad set of questions but I will start by saying that the discounters you name are important customers of ours in Europe that we are engaged with and do business with. Aldi has been in the U.S. for many years and has some several thousand stores here and is a customer as well, and we would expect with the entry of Lidl to this market and our existing relationship with them that they will be a customer as well. I certainly think that all of the traditional retailers and mass merchants have their attention quite firmly focused on the entry of these competitors into the market and they\u2019re all preparing their response to them. And I think this will continue to add to the competitive robustness of the U.S. market. I think that frankly as much as the traditional retailers are challenged, I think this is a huge challenge to the dollar channel which has been in existence for many years and for U.S. consumers, it\u2019s filled a similar niche.","Michael Smith","Brett, to your point too it would be important for branded food companies to really focus on effective media spending but also innovation and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve been driving over the last couple of years to really drive innovation on our brands across the whole business.","Brett Hundley","Thank you very much.","Lawrence Kurzius","Thank you.","Operator","Our last question today comes from the line of Akshay Jagdale with Jefferies. Please proceed with your questions.","Lubi Kutua","Hi. Good morning. This is Lubi filling in for Akshay. Most of my questions have been asked already but maybe I can get your thoughts on M&A. So I know you\u2019ve recently completed a few smaller deals but can you just comment on how we should think about your appetite for additional deals going forward, and maybe how you would characterize the current pipeline and valuations?","Lawrence Kurzius","Well, I\u2019ll say a few words about this. First of all, as part of our growth algorithm that a third of our growth comes from base business, a third comes from innovation and a third from acquisitions. And so we will continue \u2013 you should expect to see a continued \u2013 lumpy stream because there has to be a willing seller but continued stream of bolt-on acquisitions. As we have said over the last couple of years, we have broadened our lens to include both consumer flavor businesses and industrial flavor businesses. And so over the last \u2013 both last year and really already this year to [indiscernible] Giotti was a 2017 deal. We\u2019ve acquired an industrial flavor business in addition to some consumer businesses. I think we\u2019ll look forward to the same. We also are considering larger assets. Those are going to come at an even less regular interval, but we continue to consider larger assets as well.","Lubi Kutua","Thank you. And then just in terms of \u2013 so in the industrial segment, I think you mentioned in your prepared remarks that you saw double-digit growth in the branded portfolio. Can you maybe just expand a little bit on what drove that and then how you see those trends sort of playing out for the balance of the year? Thank you.","Lawrence Kurzius","Specifically in the U.S. food service business, we have had some strong distribution gains. We have a strategic partnership and category captaincy with one of the major food service distributors and that\u2019s driving a lot of sales growth for us.","Lubi Kutua","Thanks. I\u2019ll pass it on.","Operator","Thank you. At this time, I\u2019ll turn the floor back to Lawrence Kurzius for his closing remarks.","Lawrence Kurzius","Great. Thanks everyone for your questions and for participating on today\u2019s call. As I said, we expected Q1 sales growth to be the lowest quarter for us in 2017 for the reasons that we discussed. For the rest of the year, particularly in our Americas consumer business, we expect strong sales growth for the reasons we gave in the prepared remarks.","We had strong acceptance of new items, expanded distribution on our gourmet range, plus we\u2019re lapping the transition on that range from last year, continued strength on Gourmet Garden, the pricing actions and this is true for the whole company not just for the U.S. business have been completed. Our marketing plans are strong and importantly our products remain well aligned with what consumers choose to eat.","Taste continues to rank number one in what consumers use in making their decisions about their food purchases. We\u2019re aligned with today\u2019s move towards more healthy flavorful food. We\u2019re confident in our growth plans. With our steadfast focus on growth, performance and people, we\u2019re well positioned to deliver strong financial results and shareholder value in 2017.","Kasey Jenkins","Thank you, Lawrence, and thanks to all for joining us today.

Our first quarter results included solid sales growth and a strong cash flow, as well as earnings per share that was ahead of our initial outlook. These results were driven by progress with our growth strategies and the dedicated efforts of McCormick employees around the world.","We grew sales 8% in local currencies. The incremental impact of WAPC, acquired mid-2013, accounted for about half this increase. Product innovation, distribution expansion, brand marketing support, and pricing also drove sales growth in each of our two segments.","Gross profit margin rose 70 basis points, due in part to a favorable business mix and our comprehensive continuous improvement program, CCI, which is generating cost savings throughout the company.","Increased sales, higher gross margin, and our diligent expense management led to an 11% increase in operating income, which included additional brand marketing support. The operating income result was ahead of our expectations for the first quarter and drove a 9% increase in earnings per share, even with a higher tax rate.","Quarterly, we are off to a good start in 2014, and have greater confidence in our ability to achieve our financial objectives for the year. As Gordon will discuss in more detail, we are reaffirming our 2014 outlook for sales growth and earnings per share.","As we look to the rest of 2014 and beyond, we\u2019re encouraged by the increasing consumer demand for flavor. Spices, herbs, and seasonings are on trend and a healthy way to add taste, and not for a lot of cost. Our meals are typically just a fraction of the cost of a meal, to deliver most of the flavor.","The outlook by Euromonitor shows growth in spices and herbs and in recipe mixes, in both developed and emerging markets. For herbs, spices, and seasonings, the largest part of our consumer business, you can see our category share information on slide five, along with attractive category growth rates in our top markets.","In developed markets, the majority of Millennials say they love to cook, and the percentage of all consumers that prefer hot or spicy sauces, dips, and condiments is up 8 points in the last two years.","The exploration of new flavors is evidenced by the popularity of ethnic fare. In emerging markets, an increase in the middle class and in working women are driving the transition from spices in bulk to spices as a branded, packaged food product that offers greater quality, safety, and convenience.","Demand for flavor is on the rise, whether consumers are preparing meals at home, eating out, or enjoying a snack. As a flavor leader, it\u2019s our job to accelerate this growth and build our share. We position our consumer business to flavor meals at home. Our growth strategies include brand building, scalable innovation, and expanding our geographic footprint.","In the first quarter of 2014, each of these avenues of growth contributed to an overall 9% increase in consumer business sales in local currencies. The addition of WAPC accounted for 7 percentage points of this increase. I\u2019m pleased to report that this acquisition continues to outpace our forecast for sales and profit growth.","At the operating income line, we achieved an 8% increase in the first quarter for our consumer business, including the impact of a double digit increase in brand marketing support. Staying in China, in addition to the benefit of WAPC, we grew consumer sales of our base business 20% this period, with increases in both herbs and spices and in condiments.","In Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, EMEA, we grew sales 4% in local currency, led by strong increases in France and in several smaller markets. Across this region, we increased brand marketing support by 38% in the quarter, with our holiday TV advertising in France, a brand quality message in Poland, and support for our Flavor Shot launch in the U.K.","In the Americas, sales in local currency were about even with the year ago period. The competitive pressure in the U.S. that we noted in the fourth quarter of 2013 is being addressed with actions to strengthen our brand equity with the consumer and to win at retail.","The first is to increase our investment in marketing. In the first quarter, nearly half of the incremental brand marketing was directed toward the U.S. market to drive sales of core products. These additional funds were applied to an everyday cooking message, with an emphasis on healthy eating, and a closer to fresh message with an emphasis on our gourmet line. During this period, we also continued to develop our digital marketing programs, connected to the consumer in a personalized way.","As for insight-based innovation, I\u2019ll comment in a minute on the new items at retail across our markets. In the U.S. specifically, we have development underway for new product concepts for launch in the second half of 2014. These products align with our consumer insights, addressing demand for convenience, flavor, and quality. We\u2019re excited about their sales potential, and you\u2019ll hear more about these in our next earnings call in June.","To win at retail, we\u2019ve realigned our sales organization to boost our resources in underdeveloped markets, where our category share of our brands is below the national average. Using insights and analytics, we\u2019re setting a gold standard for addressing the retail spice set, one that better addresses how consumers shop our categories.","This is fostering a more strategic dialog with our customers, as we work with them on category management, with the goal to optimize sales and income in this highly profitable section of their store. Our consumer business group in the U.S. is energized by the actions underway to drive better results, and I share their enthusiasm. We\u2019re encouraged by early signs of traction, based on consumption of core spices and seasoning seen and in recipe mixes.","As I wrap up my remarks on our consumer business, I want to comment on innovation across our three regions. We have some great new products now in the market. These were developed based on our consumer segmentation research and more in-depth insights, and include items designed to appeal to value minded consumers as well as involve cooks seeking more premium products.","Of the items shown on slide nine, I\u2019m particularly excited about the potential for Flavor Shots in the U.K., our 13-spice blend in China, and in the U.S., Grill Mates burger mixes for the 2014 grilling season and gluten-free recipe mixes.","Innovation is also a key driver for our industrial business. We supply flavors to the top food service restaurant chains and the top food and beverage companies. These industry leaders look to McCormick as a partner to develop flavors in their next market-leading products.","In the first quarter, we\u2019re very pleased with our industrial business results. In the Americas region, we\u2019ve won the supply of new products to food and beverage companies and grown sales of branded food service products. These gains more than offset continued weak demand from quick service restaurants.","2013 was an excellent year for our industrial business in EMEA, and the success continues in 2014, with the 12% local currency sales growth in the first quarter. We\u2019re driving sales through expanded distribution of new products, particularly in this market with quick service restaurants.","The improvement in industrial sales in China continued this quarter with a 20% increase in local currencies. This growth rate compares to weak demand from quick service restaurants in the first quarter of 2013 that related to concerns about avian flu in poultry menu items.","In total, for our industrial business, we grew first quarter 2014 sales 6% in local currency, largely through higher volume and product mix, with minimal pricing impact. This growth rate, together with a more favorable business mix, our CCI cost savings, and comparison to weaker results in the first quarter of 2013, led to a 24% increase in operating income and an operating income margin of 8%. We expect further improvement in the upcoming quarters.","To summarize, for the majority of markets across our two segments, we achieved good first quarter financial results and have momentum. In the U.S. consumer business, we have actions underway to improve our market performance and we expect to see a positive financial impact as we progress through the next few quarters.","In a dynamic market, we believe that there are several factors that create an advantage for our business: our leading positions in growing markets, our breadth of product from value-priced to premium, flavors for all types of eating occasions, market-leading customers, and an expanding geographic presence.","Across the company, we\u2019re bringing focus, setting priorities, and directing our resources based on McCormick\u2019s strategic imperatives: ready talent, fully engaged, winning share with a global focus and performance, superior results, consistently delivered. Together, we believe these imperatives will drive our success and lead to greater value for McCormick\u2019s shareholders.","Gordon?","Gordon Stetz","Thanks, Alan, and good morning everyone. As Alan has described, we had solid first quarter financial results that included strong sales growth in many parts of the business; greater than expected earnings per share driven by our growth strategies, CCI program, and share repurchase activity; and excellent cash flow. I\u2019ll begin with a closer look at sales and operating income for each segment. Let\u2019s start with the consumer business.","As seen on slide 14, we grew consumer business sales 9% in local currency. This builds on a 7% sales increase in the first quarter of 2013 that was largely volume and product mix driven, and had no impact from acquisitions.","In the first quarter of 2014, sales from WAPC accounted for 7 percentage points of the increase, and higher pricing contributed 2 percentage points. In the Americas region, sales were about even with the year ago period in local currency. A 2% increase in pricing following a late 2013 pricing action was offset by lower volume and product mix.","In comparison, consumer sales in this region rose 7% year on year in the first quarter of 2013, from the first quarter of 2012, and the increase is mainly attributable to higher volume and product mix.","As Alan described, our U.S. consumer business has actions underway to drive performance, and we have early indications of improvement. We are also pleased to see that category growth remains healthy for spices and seasonings, and the recipe mix is based on the latest retail sales.","In Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, EMEA, we grew consumer sales 4% in local currency. The increase was largely volume and product mix driven, evidence of the growth strategies underway for brand building and scalable innovation. We increased brand marketing support 38% and introduced a number of new items.","The sales increase this period was particularly strong in France and in several smaller markets. In local currency, consumer business sales in the Asia Pacific region rose 73%. The addition of WAPC, which will also have an incremental benefit in the second quarter of 2014, accounted for 64 percentage points of the growth.","We grew sales in the base business 9%, building upon a 15% year over year increase in sales in the first quarter of 2013. China led this base business growth with a 20% sales increase, mainly from new products and expanded distribution. For the Kohinoor brand in India, sales rose slightly in local currency, with significantly higher pricing offset by lower volume and product mix in the first quarter.","Operating income for the consumer business rose 8% to $94 million from the first quarter of 2013. This increase was primarily due to higher sales, a favorable business mix, and CCI cost savings, which more than offset a $6 million increase in brand marketing support.","Turning to our industrial business, we grew first quarter sales by 6% in local currency, led by favorable volume and product mix, as seen on slide 19. As Alan noted, we had increases in each of our three regions.","In the Americas, industrial sales rose 3% in local currency, with strong demand from food manufacturers in the U.S. and in Mexico. We have won the supply of a number of seasoning and flavor products for snack chips, crackers, breakfast foods, and yogurt. We also grew sales of branded food service products.","Demand from quick service restaurants remained weak in this market through the first quarter. We continue to work with our customers to draw restaurant traffic by developing flavors for new menu items.","In EMEA, our industrial business achieved another quarter of strong sales growth with a 12% increase in local currency. This follows a strong sales increase in the first quarter of 2013, compared to the first quarter of 2012. The first quarter increase in 2014 reflects continued success with product innovation and distribution gains, largely with quick service restaurants and the impact of higher pricing in response to material cost increases.","In the first quarter of 2014, we grew industrial business sales in the Asia Pacific region by 10% in local currency. Volume and product mix is improving in China, as this market recovers from the sharp year ago decline as Alan described. Based on our current outlook, we expect this improvement to continue through the next few quarters.","Operating income for the industrial business rose 24% to $30 million. Across all three regions, higher sales, together with CCI cost savings and the favorable business mix, drove this performance.","These first quarter 2014 results for our industrial business, with sales up 4% and profit up 24%, are a reversal of declines in the first quarter of 2013, which included a year over year operating income decrease of 22%. Across most parts of this business, we are pleased with our progress and the strong financial results driven by our growth strategies.","For the total company, operating income rose 11% as a result of higher sales, a more favorable business mix, and our CCI cost savings. These same factors also improved gross profit margin by 70 basis points, and during the quarter, we funded additional brand marketing programs, with more investment planned in the upcoming quarters.","As projected, the tax rate this period rose to 31.1% from 28.5% in the year ago period. This increase was due to the discontinuation of the R&D tax credit, a tax law change in France, and the mix of income across tax jurisdictions. For the fiscal year, we continue to expect the tax rate to exceed 2013 and for 2014, to be in a 30% to 31% range.","Income from unconsolidated operations was down slightly from last year. Cost to relocate our joint venture in Mexico to a more efficient and higher capacity facility began to impact our results towards the end of 2013, continued into the first quarter of 2014, and are expected to extend into the second quarter. Once we get past this, in the back half of the year, we expect a strong year over year increase in the income from unconsolidated operations.","We reported earnings per share of $0.62. This was a 9% increase from $0.57 in the year ago period and driven by higher operating income and lower shares outstanding, which were offset in part by unfavorable tax rate.","Let\u2019s turn next to some highlights for cash flow and quarter end balance sheet as summarized on slide 28. Cash flow from operations was $77 million, up significantly from $32 million in the first quarter of 2013. This improvement was led by lower pension contributions in 2014.","During this period, we used $57 million of cash to repurchase 0.9 million shares. At quarter end, we had $303 million still available on our $400 million authorization. Our balance sheet remains sound. We are close to our target debt level and well-positioned to fund investments to drive growth, including future acquisitions.","Turning to our 2014 outlook, we continue to expect momentum from increased consumer demand for flavor and the effectiveness of our growth strategies and are reaffirming our projected sales and profit growth for 2014.","At the top line, we reaffirm a 3-5% projected increase in sales on a currency neutral basis, with higher volume, the effect of increased pricing, and in the first half of the year, the incremental impact of WAPC. In addition, we expect currencies to reduce sales by approximately 1 percentage points in 2014, based on prevailing exchange rates.","We continue to project a 6% to 8% increase in operating income from $591 million of adjusted operating income in 2013. This projection includes the benefit of CCI cost savings that are expected to reach at least $45 million for 2014.","Our earnings per share outlook remains $3.22 to $3.29. This is a year over year increase of 3% to 5% from adjusted 2013 EPS of $3.13. As we discussed in January, we expect the impact of higher operating income to be offset in part by an increased tax rate. As shown on slide 30, our projection for a higher tax rate and a $0.01 in special charges are expected to have an unfavorable impact of 5% to 6% on the 2014 EPS growth rate.","In the second quarter of 2014, we are projecting only a slight increase in earnings per share, from $0.59 that we reported in the second quarter of 2013. This outlook is based on our plans for higher brand marketing support and continued weakness in demand from quick service restaurants in the U.S., as well as additional costs related to the facility relocation in our Mexican joint venture.","With our first quarter results, we are on our way toward another year of strong cash flow. As many of you know, we adhere to a balanced use of cash and are committed to returning a significant portion to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. In 2014, we expect to use nearly $200 million of cash for dividends and through share repurchases to reduce our shares outstanding by 1% to 2% this year.","As I conclude my comments, we are confident in our ability to deliver on our 2014 financial objectives and look forward to reporting on our progress in the upcoming quarters. So now let\u2019s turn to your questions, after which Alan will provide some closing remarks. Operator, we\u2019re ready for the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions.] Your first question comes from the line of Thilo Wrede from Jefferies.","Thilo Wrede - Jefferies ","Could you provide us with a little bit more insight on how this quarter was so much better than what you initially expected? Where was the upside surprise?","Alan Wilson ","It\u2019s in a few areas. It would be stronger growth in pretty much all of our businesses outside the U.S. and within the gross margin, it was stronger gross margin based on the mix that we experienced within the quarter. So I would say those two factors are primary ones that outdelivered relative to our initial expectations.","Thilo Wrede - Jefferies ","Is the stronger growth outside of the US driven by one-time factors because based on what I\u2019m hearing about the world outside the U.S., it\u2019s not looking necessarily that much better from a macro perspective.","Alan Wilson ","Well, there\u2019s nothing one-time in nature within the quarter. I mean, it was all driven by the brand marketing support, innovation, and on the industrial side, the strength of our customer relationships. So I can\u2019t say that there was an anomaly within it. Certainly we see the world that we operate in, and understand it\u2019s a difficult environment, and that continues to give us caution as well.","Gordon Stetz ","I\u2019d say one thing where we\u2019re a little counter to some of the rest of what we\u2019re reading, is our business in China is continuing to show strong growth, and we\u2019re gaining distribution of our core business, and then the acquisition of WAPC has outperformed what we expected it to.","Thilo Wrede - Jefferies ","And then on Kohinoor, you called out high price increases due to higher input costs, again, and the impact on volume. What we\u2019re hearing from other basmati rice companies in India, they seem to be faring much better with these price increases and might have a different input cost profile than you do. Can you provide a little bit more background there, what the level of input cost increase is, and why the impact on volume is so meaningful?","Alan Wilson ","We\u2019re seeing about a 20-plus percent increase in the cost of rice, and are passing that through, and are dealing with that with volume. We may have a bit of a different supply chain model than some of our competitors there because we are more -- remember, our strategy in India is to use the access to the supply chain and the customer base to expand into different areas. So while Basmati rice is the business today, that\u2019s not our long term intention. So we have a little bit different objective and a different profile than some of our competitors there.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse.","Rachel Nabatian - Credit Suisse","My question is on the Europe business, which is strong, and it sounds like there\u2019s a lot of support put behind it. From what we\u2019ve seen, that region can be rather volatile, and recently we\u2019ve only heard negative commentary on grocery there. So what we\u2019d like to know is, what gives you the confidence that what you\u2019re seeing here is sustainable growth?","Alan Wilson ","I\u2019d never say it\u2019s ever not going to be a bit volatile, but what we\u2019re doing is driving our new product innovation, supporting it with pretty strong advertising, both in our core spice and seasoning business and the recipe mix business that we have in France, and we\u2019re seeing the response from that. That doesn\u2019t say Europe\u2019s not a tough place to operate and is not highly competitive, but we\u2019re gaining traction from the programs that we have.","Rachel Nabatian - Credit Suisse","And then just as a follow up, on the value side, the plan to turn around the U.S. consumer business, according to our scanner data, it looks like private label continues to take share, and you had mentioned kind of innovation ranging from the value to the premium side, so I guess I wanted to know how you plan to combat the private label competition specifically.","Alan Wilson ","We offer a broad range of products across all the price points, and to remind you, we do produce private label, so that\u2019s a part of what\u2019s in our portfolio as well. What we\u2019re doing is, one, making sure we\u2019ve got the right promoted price at the right times of the year, when consumers are buying.","The second thing is building the equity behind our brand, and then driving product innovation in the category. I think the spice and seasonings business, it\u2019s still going to take some time. We\u2019re encouraged by what we\u2019re seeing in our core business, our core products, early on, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re supporting with advertising. We\u2019re also driving the category and gaining share in our recipe mix business. So we\u2019ve got early signs of traction. We\u2019re not calling the turnaround yet, but we are encouraged by what we\u2019re seeing.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Driscoll from Citi.","David Driscoll - Citigroup ","Wanted to ask about the industrial operating margin. When I look over a multiquarter period of time, really in 2013, every quarter seem to get sequentially better, although clearly on a year over year basis, a number of those quarters in fiscal \u201913 were down from fiscal \u201912. The simple question here is, you had nice improvement year on year in the first quarter industrial margins. Do you expect that to continue and is the pattern of sequential improvement throughout \u201913 indicative as to what\u2019s happening within the business?","Alan Wilson ","It\u2019s a fair observation. And certainly we are building upon the improvement that we saw in the fourth quarter, which was very strong margin for that business, and we\u2019re pleased with the performance we saw in Q1. We certainly look for better performance on the industrial business.","The absolute margin is a function of promotional activity and mix of the business within the quarter, so I\u2019m a little cautious about saying that each quarter will get sequentially better, but I\u2019d say overall we certainly are looking for an industrial margin improvement. And it\u2019s a function of the recovery that we\u2019re seeing in some of those markets like China a slightly more benign inflationary environment and good CCI performance. But I\u2019m encouraged by the performance, but we\u2019re still a bit cautious on predicting it quarter by quarter.","David Driscoll - Citigroup ","Can you just say what are the factors that are causing that fiscal second quarter to be flattish year on year? It seems like when we just look at the first quarter results, a lot of the things that happened in the first quarter repeat in the second quarter, yet you\u2019re expecting a worse result versus the growth that we saw in Q1. So what\u2019s happening in Q2?","Alan Wilson ","Well, we\u2019re going to lean into our business again, so the brand marketing support that you saw in Q1, we\u2019re repeating that again in Q2 and perhaps even a little more. As we mentioned, the unconsolidated income line will continue to be impacted by some of these relocation costs that we saw in Q1 from our unconsolidated venture in Mexico. You heard us talk about some of our caution on the QSR side of things in the U.S., and we\u2019re still encouraged by the early signs of the U.S. consumer business, but we are up against some strong comparisons in the second quarter of last year, where we great volume quite strongly. So that\u2019s part of our caution as well.","David Driscoll - Citigroup ","I hear you on all of those comments. I would only say that from the outside, it looks like those are consistent with the same forces that impacted Q1. So it\u2019s not immediately obvious why Q2 would be flat, but I\u2019ll leave it there.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Eric Katzman of Deutsche Bank.","Eric Katzman - Deutsche Bank ","Just to touch on the global industrial for a second, and the strength there, I think Thilo might have asked this question in another way, but with the Heinz 3G Burger King connection, they made some strides with McDonald\u2019s, did you pick up some McDonald\u2019s business? And has that been a help to that side of the company?","Alan Wilson ","Well, as you know, that is a significant customer for us, and we supply them around the world. So there has been some realignment in the supply chain there, and we\u2019ve been growing our business with that customer in Europe and in China. Just where we picked it up from is tougher to say.","Eric Katzman - Deutsche Bank ","And then the second question, on the U.S. consumer business, Alan, I asked you last quarter, was the weakness that you had reported in the fourth quarter really just a function of core spice and seasonings, or was it broader based into things like Zatarain\u2019s and some of the grilling items, etc.? Can you go into a little bit more detail? It sounds like this core spice and seasonings business was still pretty weak, but is that true with some of the other products as well? Or did you make improvement there?","Alan Wilson ","We\u2019re seeing improvement, actually, in our core spices and our recipe mixes. We\u2019re still seeing some weakness in some of those other brands, and some of it\u2019s driven by our promotion plans from last year. We were pretty heavy early in the year. Is there going to be more spread this year?","Secondly, a little bit of a lighter Mardi Gras, and I never want to use weather as an excuse, but we\u2019re seeing in Zatarain\u2019s, for instance, the cost of crawfish pretty high right now. We\u2019d expect this to be coming into pretty heavy crawfish season, the weather has made that a little later. But fundamentally, what we\u2019re doing is driving behind our core business, which is our most profitable business, and then over time we\u2019re addressing the other businesses.","Eric Katzman - Deutsche Bank ","I\u2019m going to have to keep better track of my crawfish pricing index.","Alan Wilson ","Yeah, right now it\u2019s about $5, and in the middle of the season, it should be about $3.50. You\u2019re wondering why I know that.","Eric Katzman - Deutsche Bank ","And then just as a quick follow up, and then I\u2019ll pass it on, I think you mentioned that you had put more money behind the gourmet line. And I guess that\u2019s your highest price point in the core spices business? Did I hear that correctly? And is that kind of the response to some of the other spice products being available in other aisles of the store, and that\u2019s kind of at least initially how you intend to combat the new competitors in various outlets?","Alan Wilson ","Well, we segment the consumer in a couple of different ways. One is by price point, the other is by how involved they are in cooking. And gourmet is the involved cook who wants the best product, and so we are supporting and differentiating our product based on our freshness and unique sourcing of those products. So that is one part and one segment that we\u2019re going after. The other part of that is the more core and value price consumer. We have some other programs to try to impress that. And then later in the year, we have a relaunch of our gourmet products that we\u2019re expecting to roll out.","Operator","The next question comes from Akshay Jagdale with KeyBanc.","Akshay Jagdale - KeyBanc ","I wanted to ask about the comment you made on the U.S. consumer segment. You said you were seeing early signs of some improvement, I believe. Can you give us some color on that? What is it exactly that you\u2019re seeing that makes you feel that way.","Alan Wilson ","We\u2019re seeing our share gap closing with our core spices. We\u2019re seeing growth and actually share gains in our recipe mixes. And we are seeing a flattening of share from some of those fragmented competitors that we talked about. Private label continues to gain, but the regional and smaller competitors are flattening out a bit.","Akshay Jagdale - KeyBanc ","And in terms of your decision to continue to spend heavily behind that, can you give us some sense of, you already had a pretty dominant share of [voice] in that segment or category. Can you talk about the returns you\u2019re seeing on the incremental dollars you\u2019re spending? Are they still pretty high return, and better than the industry average, for every incremental dollar that you\u2019re spending on advertising?","Alan Wilson ","We\u2019re still continuing to see pretty strong ROIs based on the spending that we have, and in fact, advertising and our digital programs have much higher ROIs than the promotional spends that we were doing. We got a little heavy, I think, over the last year, in promotional spend, and not all of those were great paybacks and didn\u2019t build equity. So we\u2019ve adjusted our spending away from promotions. But we\u2019ve adjusted our spending to more focus on equity building.","Akshay Jagdale - KeyBanc ","And last one, on the Kohinoor acquisition, if you just take a step back, can you summarize how that acquisition has performed since you bought it? There\u2019s been some puts and takes. And then just give us a sense of where you are, really. Are you in the first or second inning of your strategy to introduce new products through that distribution chain? So perhaps what may have happened that\u2019s worse than your expectations so far, and then sort of where are we now relative to your broader, longer term plan in India?","Alan Wilson ","I think we\u2019re in the early stages of our plan in India. The things that we have done over the last year, we didn\u2019t acquire the full supply chain for that business in India, because what we wanted was the retail presence and the ability to drive other products through that chain.","What we\u2019ve done over the last year has been to beef up our own supply chain to improve our service levels and to get better control of our inventory. We\u2019re focused on continuing to build our capabilities there, and to start to introduce those new products. We have those products in place now, and we\u2019re starting to roll those out. We\u2019ve got our distribution chain in place.","We expect to continue to see it grow, but again, to remind you of our strategy in emerging markets, we have a tendency to pay as we go. So we\u2019re not going to get out over the tips of our skis and invest and lose a lot of money in a market until we\u2019re sure we have the infrastructure to support it, and then we\u2019ll expand as we go. That\u2019s exactly what we did in China, that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing in India.","You asked how it\u2019s performing, it\u2019s performing below our expectations at this point, but we feel like we\u2019ve got the right plans to address it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Growe from Stifel.","Chris Growe - Stifel ","The first one, if I could ask, is a bit of a follow on to Dave Driscoll\u2019s question, about Q2. I guess I also had been planning on a bit of an Easter shift into Q2 as well. Is that occurring? Can you give us a better sense of how it helped Q2?","Alan Wilson ","That\u2019s a difficult one to predict, quite honestly. And we haven\u2019t talked about that, and certainly our internal forecast that is guiding us toward the direction we\u2019re giving you now has accounted for that. But I couldn\u2019t quantify that for sure for you right now. There is some shift in timing, and it could have an impact, but our current outlook is exactly what Gordon says.","Chris Growe - Stifel ","Could you cite how much emerging market growth you had this quarter? What sort of dollar sales growth did you see in those markets? Was that a significant contributor to the first quarter?","Alan Wilson ","Well, certainly the Wuhan acquisition is emerging markets, so we broke that out for you separately, and we talked about China being up 20% also on the consumer side, and then double digit on the industrial side. So we\u2019re talking double digit type increases on the emerging market side. So it was a big help, and that was one of the outperformers on the quarter relative to our expectations.","Gordon Stetz ","It drove a lot of the consumer growth rate.","Chris Growe - Stifel ","If I could maybe squeeze in one more, which is in relation to the marketing, did more of the marketing this quarter go towards Europe? And it looks like you had a pretty significant increase there, and maybe you\u2019ll spread it more towards the U.S. in the second quarter? Just curious how the phasing will go in between divisions.","Alan Wilson ","No, Europe was up about 38%, but half the marketing increased spend was in the U.S.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Goldman with JPMorgan.","Ken Goldman - JPMorgan ","First, as you look into the summer, and you see much higher meat costs approaching, just curious how that affects your marketing plan in any way, for grilling. And second, it looks like Cerberus will be on track to buy Safeway here. If that deal goes through, do you expect it will affect your distribution in any way? I\u2019m just curious if you\u2019re stronger with either of those customers.","Alan Wilson ","In terms of meat costs, because our grilling portfolio has a wide range of products that are good for a wide range of meat, even if the consumer starts trading from filets to cheaper cuts of meat, or even to burgers, a lot of our innovation actually is actually the burger mixes.","So what we think will impact us more is the return to more normal weather. We\u2019re really hoping for some better weather as we head into the Memorial Day weekend. But our products will span across the broad range, whether it\u2019s pork or chicken or hamburger, obviously our Montreal steak is great on steaks, and we hope the consumers are continuing to buy. But we think we\u2019re well-positioned, no matter what\u2019s happening across the broad portfolio.","In terms of the Safeway Albertson\u2019s acquisition\/merger, we have a good position with both those customers, and so we\u2019re not anticipating this to have a significant impact on our business. We do have a strong relationship with both of them. As long as they\u2019re driving to win in the marketplace, we think that\u2019s good for us.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Lazar from Barclays.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays ","Two questions from me. The first one, obviously you talked about seeing some of the early signs, and I guess I was under the impression, it\u2019s probably still the case, that this kind of turnaround in the U.S. consumer is still going to take some time. But I guess things are reacting maybe positively a little more quickly than maybe I had thought. Is it fair to say that the brand equity building part is what\u2019s currently driving some of those early signs, and the winning at retail piece is going to take more time? Or is that not the right way to look at it?","Alan Wilson ","I think that\u2019s kind of the right way to look at it. I don\u2019t want to get over-optimistic, because we know it is going to take some time, but we are doing exactly what we said we were going to do. We\u2019re out selling our message with retailers. That is a customer by customer and in some cases region by region approach that is going to take some time. And frankly, it\u2019s never done, because when we present something that works for us, the competitors in there are presenting something else as well. So that\u2019s going to be a longer slog, but we immediately changed our focus into building consumer equity, and we\u2019re starting to see some of the benefits of that.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays ","In terms of the winning at retail piece, even though it\u2019s very early, are there any anecdotal thoughts you can share with maybe how some of those conversations have gone? Are you seeing traction where you\u2019ve had some conversations in sort of communicating to retailers where this makes sense and where some of their actions don\u2019t make as much sense for them?","Alan Wilson ","Yeah, we are seeing certainly varying degrees of acceptance and action in the store from that, but what we\u2019re really showing them is the best way to grow their sales and profits in this category, and we\u2019re benefitting from the fact that the best way for them to grow their sales and profits is the same thing that works for us, which is to sell more higher-turning McCormick SKUs as opposed to lower-turning, cheaper alternative products.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays ","And then last quarter on the call, we talked a little bit about how you were looking at potentially some different options in order to address the consumer trends, both at the value end and the premium end, and potentially could include thinking about a different line for sort of evaluating, let\u2019s say. Maybe it\u2019s under the McCormick name, maybe it\u2019s under a different name, or somehow related. But I didn\u2019t know if there were any conclusions you came to with respect to how to address that, and if there were going to be some other new items there along those lines that we just haven\u2019t seen yet.","Alan Wilson ","Yeah, we are working on some premium solutions as well as some more value solutions. We already have a number of the offerings in the value range, and our strategy with those is to meet a customer need. Because those don\u2019t necessarily drive traffic, and they don\u2019t necessarily drive profitability for the retailer or for us, but they\u2019re there to meet a customer need. We have a number of those offerings, and we\u2019re continuing to evaluate what the right value offerings are. The premium, we\u2019ve got some very concrete plans.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Philip Terpolilli with Longbow Research.","Philip Terpolilli - Longbow Research","Just two quick questions, and maybe one last one on China. The quarter was quite strong. Do you feel like you\u2019re starting to get more of a mass there now in terms of maybe distribution wins getting a little bit easier than 12 months earlier? And then just maybe building on that, are there more M&A opportunities that could further accelerate things there?","Alan Wilson ","We certainly feel good that we\u2019re building scale in our consumer business in China. Our core business has continued to grow pretty strongly, and then Wuhan WAPC is an accelerator to that, because it gets us access to a much bigger sales force in a different part of the country than where we\u2019ve been. So that\u2019s why we made the acquisition. We see other opportunities for acquisition, not just in that market, but in a number of the markets that we\u2019ve targeted, so we have a pretty good outlook, and a pretty good pipeline for those kinds of acquisitions.","Philip Terpolilli - Longbow Research ","Is the pipeline pretty similar to what you\u2019ve seen the last 12 or 18 months? Or kind of getting better or worse?","Alan Wilson ","I would say the pipeline itself is pretty similar. And whether it comes to closure is another question, but the pipeline is pretty similar, is what we\u2019ve seen.","Philip Terpolilli - Longbow Research ","And then just one quick question, if I could, on the input cost front. Any update on what you\u2019re seeing? I saw the low single digit guidance in the slide deck, but I know your bucket\u2019s a little bit different than some of the other CPG group and can be a little bit more volatile at times. So any additional color on things maybe to watch out for this year that you\u2019re seeing right now?","Alan Wilson ","The things that we see that are starting to move up are, as you\u2019ve probably seen, corn and wheat and soybeans and dairy are starting to move up a bit. So those impact us more on the industrial side of our business. I wouldn\u2019t say that we have any significant changes on the consumer side.","Operator","There are no questions at this time. I would like to turn the conference back to Alan Wilson for any closing remarks.","Alan Wilson ","I\u2019d like to thank you for your questions, and for participating today. McCormick\u2019s 2014 fiscal year is off to a good start. Our strategic imperatives around people, growth, and performance are driving sales, delivering CCI cost savings, which is our fuel for growth, and generating higher profits and strong cash flow. At McCormick, we bring the joy of flavor to every day. Our 125-year heritage of innovation, collaboration, and commitment to this business is at the foundation of our global leadership in flavor and has us well-positioned for the future.","Thank you.","Joyce Brooks","Thanks, Alan.

To accompany this call, we posted a set of slides at ir.mccormick.com. Now, all participants are in listen-only mode. Following our remarks, we will begin a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. We\u2019ll begin with remarks from Lawrence Kurzius, Chairman, President and CEO; and Mike Smith, Executive Vice President and CFO.","During our remarks, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. These include adjusted gross profit, adjusted gross profit margin, adjusted operating income, adjusted income tax rate and adjusted earnings per share that excludes the impact of transaction and integration expenses related to the Reckitt Benckiser Foods or RB Foods acquisition, special charges and income taxes excluding certain non-recurring impacts associated with the recently enacted U.S. tax reform, which we refer to as the U.S. Tax Act as well as information in constant currency.

As seen on Slide 2, our forward-looking statements also provide information on Risk Factors that could affect our financial results.","It is now my pleasure to turn the discussion over to Lawrence.","Lawrence Kurzius","Thank you, Kasey. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. Our third quarter results continued the strong performance we delivered in the first-half of 2018, and we\u2019re well-positioned to deliver strong full-year results. We\u2019ve driven strong double-digit sales, operating profit and EPS growth, as well as significant operating margin expansion in both the third quarter and year-to-date. These results reflect the effectiveness of our sales and profit growth strategies, driven by the engagement of our employees around the world.","Starting on Slide 4, we have a broad and advantaged global flavor portfolio, which we are continuing to grow. Among the third quarter highlights across our portfolio, in our Consumer segment\u2019s underlying business, we drove growth in the Americas, particularly in recipe mixes and spice and seasonings, and we continued our momentum in China.","In our Flavor Solutions segment, we continued winning with customers, driving base business and new product growth in both the Americas and EMEA. We also continue to make progress on expanding our portfolio with additional growth and more flavors, while pruning some low-margin business. The reshaping of our Flavor Solutions portfolio is a significant driver of operating margin expansion.","In addition to the solid growth in our core business, we\u2019re pleased with Frank\u2019s and French\u2019s performance and their positive impact on our portfolio of condiments and sauces and branded foodservice. Overall, we are confident that the breadth and reach of our portfolio continues to position us to fully meet the demand for flavor around the world and grow our business.","Now let me go into more detail on our third quarter performance on Slide 5, as well as provide some business comments before turning it over to Mike, who\u2019ll go in more depth on the quarter-end results and discuss our updated 2018 financial guidance.","Starting with our top line for the third quarter, we grew sales 14% for the total company with minimal impact from currency. This was driven by strong results from both segments, led by the Americas. Base business growth, new products and acquisitions are three drivers of long-term sales growth are all contributing factors.","Our base business and new product growth accelerated from our first-half sales growth, as we said we would in our June call. Incremental sales from our acquired Frank\u2019s and French\u2019s brands contributed 10%.","In our Consumer segment, we grew sales 14% with minimal impact from currency, and in the Flavor Solutions segment, we grew 14% in constant currency. The growth in both segments was led by incremental Frank\u2019s and French\u2019s sales, which contributed 10% to our Consumer segment and 9% to our Flavor Solutions segment.","In addition to our top line growth, our focus on profit realization drove additional adjusted operating income growth and adjusted operating margin expansion. With our higher sales, cost savings, led by our Comprehensive Continuous Improvement program, or CCI, and our portfolio shift to more value-added products, including the addition of Frank\u2019s and French\u2019s, we grew the third quarter\u2019s adjusted operating income 20% in constant currency, with both segments contributing double-digit growth. And we expanded our adjusted operating margin 80 basis points, while making significant investments in brand marketing.","We are achieving the margin accretion we expected from the Frank\u2019s and French\u2019s portfolio. And equally as important, we are driving significant margin expansion in our core business, led by CCI, as well as the shift in our portfolio to more value-added products.","At the bottom line, our third quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.28 was 14% higher than $1.12 in the third quarter of 2017. Our strong growth and adjusted operating income and more favorable tax rate drove this increase, partially offset by higher interest expense from debt related to the RB Foods acquisition, as well as higher shares outstanding. The 14% earnings per share growth includes an unfavorable impact from currency.","Our third quarter results were in line with our expectations and are a continuation of the results we achieved in the first-half of 2018. With one quarter remaining in the fiscal year, we\u2019ve increased our adjusted earnings per share guidance from $4.95 to $5 from our previous guidance of $4.85 to $4.95.","Our updated guidance reflects the 16% to 17% growth rate and importantly, includes continued investments to drive growth. We\u2019re confident in our updated 2018 outlook, which Mike will provide more details on in a few minutes.","I\u2019d like to turn now to some business updates. I\u2019ll begin with highlights from our Consumer and Flavor Solutions segments, and follow with a look at our Frank\u2019s and French\u2019s portfolio.","In the Consumer segment, as seen on Slide 6, we grew sales 14% with minimal impact from currency, with incremental sales from Frank\u2019s and French\u2019s contributing 10%, and our base business and new product growth contributing 4%, driven by the U.S. and China.","In the Americas, growth was particularly strong, driven by the large impact of Frank\u2019s and French\u2019s, which contributed 14% incremental growth. Our underlying Americas business grew 4%, which was a significant sequential improvement from the growth in the first-half of the year.","Our third quarter growth was driven by higher volume and mix, primarily attributable to distribution gains, growing strength and the effectiveness of our brand marketing, as well as pricing.","In U.S., spices and seasonings, our IRI data indicates scanner sales through multi-outlets grew for the category at 3% and McCormick branded at 1%. Our growth continues to be impacted by a large retailer\u2019s decision to convert a control label to private label, along with related promotional and merchandising actions, which we\u2019ve discussed on previous earnings calls.","While this decision hurt our branded spices and seasoning share performance, it drove growth in our private label sales. Additionally, we again have strong growth in unmeasured channels, including club, e-commerce, and Hispanic retail chains. Overall, we continue to see good growth in our spice and seasoning brands in the U.S. market. We\u2019ve narrowed the gap on market share loss and we know we have more room to grow.","During the third quarter, we also had strong growth in other parts of our portfolio. For instance, in grilling items, which I\u2019ll comment on further when discussing Frank\u2019s and French\u2019s, as well as in our Simply Asia products, Kitchen Basic stocks and broths and McCormick branded dry recipe mixes. Our recipe mixes are appealing to consumers as they offer real value in terms of convenient flavor solutions.","During the third quarter, dry recipe mix IRI indicates the category grew at 4% and McCormick branded at 6%. We continue to grow both our dollar sales and market share with brand marketing and promotional activities heavily impacting our third quarter performance. As we indicated in our June earnings call, our plans included a significant amount of brand marketing investment in the second-half of the year.","During the third quarter, we made substantial investments behind our brands across all regions, which proved to be effective. The increase, which was $21 million versus last year was primarily driven by the Americas. A portion of this increase related to Frank\u2019s and French\u2019s, which I\u2019ll discuss further in a few minutes.","For the underlying consumer business, our Americas investments included increased spending related to our superiority campaign, primarily in television advertising with additional support through digital banner advertising and social media activity. The campaign highlights our commitment to quality and the great lengths we go to in care of our products, spices and seasonings and recipe mixes.","There\u2019s further development of our rapidly growing YouTube content series, Flavor Makers, with additional how-to videos with hosts that appeal to millennials using products across our portfolio in all trend and convenience-focused recipes.","With digital media investments delivering video messages across social media and other platforms that our Stubb\u2019s barbecue sauce is made with premium, clean ingredients for authentic flavor, the real barbecue sauce. We were the top -performing barbecue brand in the third quarter with double-digit consumption growth.","We increased spending against our Grill Mates brand with a combination of television advertising and digital focus aimed at helping grillers elevate their game. This included a partnership with the Food Network and one of their grill masters to use our Grill Mates products in various recipes, including in a significantly viewed video on social media. In the third quarter, we grew Grill Mates bottle blends high single digits.","The effectiveness of our investments is evident in both our third quarter consumption and sales growth and will continue to drive strong momentum behind our brand growth. And in addition to our digital marketing driving top line results, during the third quarter, we learned we were again ranked in the top five food brands for Digital IQ. by L2, the fifth year in a row.","Turning to Europe, Middle East, and Africa, the EMEA region, growth was tempered by unusually warm weather in Europe, which unfavorably impacted consumption. We\u2019re continuing to keep our brands relevant through marketing and new products. Organic range expansions are progressing well and our first choice brand renovation initiative is rolling out across Europe. We\u2019re also planning on an increased level of brand marketing and support of this initiative over the balance of the year.","In the Asia Pacific region, our strong sales in China led Consumer segment growth, driven by strong performance on core products, as well as e-commerce growth. China\u2019s direct-to-consumer storefront on Tmall continues to gain momentum since its launch earlier this year, particularly with innovation launched specific to this channel and targeted to millennials.","Turning now to the Flavor Solutions segment, we grew sales 14% in constant currency in the third quarter, with incremental sales from the Frank\u2019s and French\u2019s portfolio contributing 9% and the remaining 5% driven by base business and new product growth.","In the Americas, constant currency sales growth of 19% was led by 14% from Frank\u2019s and French\u2019s. Broad-based growth across the portfolio contributed 5%. Our momentum in flavor sales has continued, particularly in on-trend savory flavors. We\u2019re growing with quick-service restaurants, due in part to the timing of our customers\u2019 promotional activities. And in branded foodservice, we\u2019ve continued to expand distribution. Overall, across the portfolio, we are continuing to win with existing business, as well as with new products and customers.","EMEA\u2019s third quarter sales performance was driven by growth in flavors. In both our EMEA and Asia Pacific regions, we continue to win with our customers through new products and their promotional activities. We\u2019re continuing to refine and optimize our portfolio, increasing our sales of higher-margin flavor business and exiting lower-margin business. Across our Flavor Solutions segment, the migration of our portfolio to more technically insulated and value-added categories has continued in 2018.","Our year-to-date flavor sales are up double digits in the Americas, driving further realization against this strategy. Beyond our strategy to drive sales growth, we\u2019ll continue to focus on profit realization as continues to be evident in our results.","Now, let\u2019s move from our strong core business results and on to an update on Frank\u2019s and French\u2019s starting on Slide 8. Just a few weeks ago, we celebrated the one-year anniversary of the Frank\u2019s and French\u2019s brands joining our global flavor portfolio and are thrilled with the impact we\u2019ve had of these brands. We\u2019ve created value, achieved synergies and are obtaining results according to our acquisition plan.","Importantly, we have achieved our year one sales and earnings per share accretion expectations. Mike will provide further comments about our delivery against the acquisition plan in a few moments. We continue to be excited about the momentum of this business and the growth plans we are successfully executing against.","Like our third quarter sequential sales growth improvement in our U.S. consumer\u2019s underlying business, growth in the Frank\u2019s and French\u2019s portfolio also accelerated during the third quarter, as our efforts begin to gain business traction.","Now, I\u2019d like to share some updates on our progress against these plans. Starting with our North America consumer business on Slide 8. We\u2019re successfully growing Frank\u2019s and French\u2019s through strengthening distribution, category management, effective brand marketing investments and innovation.","Starting with Frank\u2019s. As of the end of August, we increased our U.S. total distribution points of original and Buffalo sauces by double digits. Our Fix the Mix initiative focused on having the right assortment on shelf continues to be a key driver of this growth.","By increasing our array of bottle sizes offering on the shelf, we have sizes for all consumers, a small size perfect for consumers new to the category to drive further household penetration to a larger bottle for the most passionate of fans.","Importantly, the growth of these sizes has been incremental to the brand, which is also growing distribution points through our category management efforts. From a regional perspective, we continue to increase our distribution points, where Frank\u2019s is not the market leader with double-digit growth in the third quarter.","Turning to French\u2019s mustard, we\u2019re continuing to convince retailers to remove duplicative secondary brands, as they work to maximize the efficiency of their shelf space and more of our recommendations are being implemented eliminating lower ranking yellow mustard brand and expanding the share of shelf of French\u2019s and store brands. These efforts combined with our merchandising and promotion, as well as our new mustard marketing campaign, have driven significant sequential improvement from past quarters.","Consumption in the third quarter significantly improved from the past several quarters\u2019 experience. As we\u2019ve said before, mustard will take a while to turnaround, but we\u2019re pleased with our progress thus far.","As I just mentioned, our promotion and merchandising activities are driving results. Our first opportunity to leverage increased promotional scale is with grilling. As we said in our June earnings call, our U.S. grilling season was delayed because of cold and wet weather in broad parts of the country. However, the grilling season soon heated up, with both Frank\u2019s and French\u2019s mustard achieving strong consumption wins in key U.S. grilling periods.","During the July fourth-week, total dollar consumption for Frank\u2019s and French\u2019s mustard grew significantly versus the year-ago period, with mustard consumption driven by displays and promotions up substantially.","During Labor Day week, total consumption growth accelerated, driven by our displays and promotions. Our grilling wins were not limited to Frank\u2019s and French\u2019s, the solid consumption growth across our entire grilling portfolio, Stubb\u2019s, Grill Mates blends and Lawry\u2019s.","In addition to the brand marketing investments, I mentioned earlier, we also increased marketing support against French\u2019s in the third quarter and are excited about our continued plans moving into the fourth quarter.","Our new U.S. not from France campaign, a humorous take on the French\u2019s brand name, and our dedicated digital mustard campaign, has contributed to the improved trends, I mentioned, as well as improvement in household penetration levels. The influence we\u2019ve been able to apply through category management, as well as brand marketing is beginning to have an impact, as you can see in the most recent scanner data.","Moving into the fourth quarter for Frank\u2019s, we\u2019re currently running a U.S. national TV ad for the first time in seven years. In addition to this, we\u2019ll be launching our tailgate 2018 campaign, featuring Frank\u2019s and Stubb\u2019s, which are both perfect for the tailgating experience. This interactive program will allow consumers to decide, which flavor profile tops their tailgate. Is it the heat with Frank\u2019s or is it the sweet with Stubb\u2019s.","And finally, turning to innovation. Our third quarter Frank\u2019s seasoning and dip mix launches are on shelf at many major retailers, and we\u2019re pleased with the initial acceptance. As I previously mentioned, there is a longer-term pipeline for new concepts developing, and I look forward to sharing the details on innovation news, as we launch new products.","Building on our Zatarain\u2019s frozen food business and capabilities, I\u2019m very pleased to announce the launch of our latest new product line, which is again going beyond liquid flavor, Frank\u2019s RedHot frozen wings. Frank\u2019s RedHot was the secret ingredient used in the original Buffalo wings created in Buffalo New York in 1964, and owned the title of original Buffalo sauce.","These new items are delicious and convenient products that offer the perfect blend of flavor and heat. The launch includes three top restaurant flavors, Frank\u2019s RedHot Original, Buffalo and barbecue. The fully cooked antibiotic-free chicken is flavored with a custom blend of McCormick seasonings and marinades made with Frank\u2019s RedHot.","Consumer testing has been positive, retail acceptance is strong. We\u2019re not only excited about this new product line, but also the speed at which it was developed from concept to market since we acquired the brand. This is an example of how we\u2019ve been able to leverage our consumer insights, scale and culinary capabilities to drive growth.","Wrapping up North America consumer for Frank\u2019s and French\u2019s, we\u2019re very pleased with our progress, particularly with the accelerated growth in our plan, our plans are now driving. We\u2019re confident in our initiatives and are enthusiastic about the growth plans we\u2019re executing against.","Next, I\u2019m excited to share some Frank\u2019s and French\u2019s updates related to our North American Flavor Solution business on Slide 9. We\u2019re driving penetration of our full portfolio across the full spectrum of the foodservice industry, including high-volume national and regional chain accounts. We\u2019re very pleased with our progress and executing against our growth plans and continue to have successes in key areas.","During the third quarter, we had incremental sales to approximately 2,000 new restaurant locations, including national, regional and local accounts. This brings our penetration through August to over 21,000 new restaurant locations, and we continue to deepen our penetration with existing locations.","Broadening and deepening our penetration in foodservice includes highly visible menu mentions and front of house product placement. Our successes on menu items, which include products across our full portfolio continued in the third quarter. For example, during the quarter, we secured a new partnership with a leading U.S. pizza chain to launch menu items that feature our Frank\u2019s products. These wins have also included menu mentions with both restaurant print and television media campaigns to build brand awareness beyond foodservice.","Our efforts in the front of the house, which is not only limited to restaurants, but also includes the broader foodservice industry, such as business cafeterias, sports venues and lodging, have also continued in the third quarter, with double-digit growth in French\u2019s ketchup and mustard dispenser placements and the portfolio of our tabletop items.","Additionally, we continue to successfully cross-sell our culinary line, McCormick For Chefs, alongside our Frank\u2019s and French\u2019s foodservice items into restaurants. We\u2019ve accelerated momentum in driving penetration and still have a long runway ahead. The momentum of our foodservice promotional activity is also driving results.","Wings and sports have been an inseparable combination since Frank\u2019s earned the title of the original Buffalo sauce. We\u2019re excited about capitalizing on the start of football season in the U.S. with new promotional activity to drive further awareness, including increased tailgating events and offering the King of Wings program for the first time in the fall. I\u2019m excited about our foodservice progress with Frank\u2019s and French\u2019s and the growth we will continue to realize in this part of our portfolio.","Turning to the international markets on Slide 10. We are progressing on integrating the Frank\u2019s and French\u2019s portfolio into our global network. We\u2019re continuing to apply discipline to establish the proper foundation to manage the brands globally and enable stronger growth.","During our June earnings call, we shared we had also added new distributors in 14 countries, giving us greater international presence. During the third quarter, we added another six countries to increase our total presence to 20 new countries. We\u2019re also actively converting to McCormick\u2019s direct infrastructure, where we have scale.","For example, in India, we\u2019ve converted from using several distributors and began selling Frank\u2019s and French\u2019s directly to our retail customers at the beginning of August and are currently on shelf in three major cities with a wider assortment and Frank\u2019s in particular is creating interest.","Moving forward, we\u2019re excited to build on the consumers\u2019 growing passion for Frank\u2019s and French\u2019s and remain confident we will continue to deliver our acquisition plan, meet performance expectations and drive significant shareholder value. I\u2019d also like to thank the many employees who\u2019ve made year one a strong foundation for future success.","Mike is now going to provide more details on the financial results for the quarter and on our updated financial guidance. Before I turn it over to him, let me provide a few final comments on Slide 11. Let me summarize that we have achieved strong results through the first three quarters of 2018, both on our underlying core business and against our Frank\u2019s and French\u2019s plans.","We delivered our third quarter results according to our plans and are excited by our momentum. We have confidence in our growth plans for new products across both of our segments, strong brand marketing programs and our opportunities to expand distribution.","At the foundation of our sales growth is the rising consumer demand for flavor. We\u2019re in line with the consumers\u2019 increased interest in bolder flavors, demand for convenience and focus on fresh natural ingredients, as well as with emerging purchase drivers, such as greater transparency around the sourcing and quality of food.","With this increased interest, flavor continues to be an advantaged global category, which combined with our execution against effective strategies, will continue to drive strong results. For balancing our resources and efforts to drive sales with the work to lower cost to build fuel for growth and higher margins.","We\u2019re differentiated by our growth platform and the results we\u2019ve achieved. We have confidence in our updated 2018 outlook and are well-positioned to deliver another strong and differentiated year in 2018. Our success is the work of all the McCormick employees around the world, and I want to recognize them for driving our momentum and thank them for their efforts and their engagement.","Thank you for your attention. And it\u2019s now my pleasure to turn it over to Mike. Mike?","Mike Smith","Thanks, Lawrence, and good morning, everyone. Before I begin my remarks specifically on our third quarter performance, I would like to build upon Lawrence\u2019s comments on Frank\u2019s and French\u2019s and provide further insights about the delivery against our acquisition plan now that we\u2019ve completed the first year.","Starting on Slide 13, as Lawrence already shared, we have created value by driving growth through expanded distribution, new products and more effective marketing, and we supplemented our core McCormick margin improvement with meaningful enhancement from the Frank\u2019s and French\u2019s portfolio.","We are delivering against our synergy and one-time cost estimates, in fact, doing better than our acquisition plan. Starting with our original synergy target, we continue to be on track to achieve $50 million of cost synergies. And as we\u2019ve previously shared, our 2018 synergies are pacing ahead of expectations. Consequently, we now expect to fully realize the $50 million target by the end of 2020 earlier than our original 2021 estimate.","Our transaction costs and integration one-time costs are also projected to be favorable to our acquisition plan, as we shared late last year. We are well-positioned to achieve our targeted debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of three times by the end of 2020.","During the third quarter, we prepaid another $180 million on our term loans secured as part of acquisition financing, bringing our total prepayments to $280 million in this fiscal year and $530 million since the acquisition. We have now paid down over one-third of a term loan secured as part of the acquisition financing.","We executed our year one acquisition plan in line with and in some areas better than our model. As a reminder, we expected the first 12 months of the acquisition to be accretive to McCormick\u2019s adjusted earnings per share, with an increase of approximately 5%, excluding transaction and integration expenses, as well as ongoing amortization expense, we have achieved this expectation. With the successful completion of our first year, we remain confident we will continue to deliver our acquisition plan and meet performance expectations.","Now moving on to our overall financial results. As Lawrence already mentioned, we delivered strong growth in the third quarter. I\u2019ll begin with a discussion of our results and then follow with details on our updated full-year 2018 financial outlook.","As you know, on Slide 14, we grew sales 14% with minimal impact from currency. Acquisitions, higher volume and product mix and pricing, each contributed to the increase. Both our Consumer and Flavor Solutions segment delivered strong top line growth, driven primarily by the Americas.","In addition, we have delivered significant increases in adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share. We also delivered adjusted operating margin expansion, while increasing our brand marketing significantly during the quarter.","The Consumer segment grew sales 14% with minimal impact from currency. Our acquisition of the Frank\u2019s and French\u2019s portfolio contributed 10% of the sales growth. The remaining 4% growth was driven by base business and new product growth, primarily in the Americas and Asia Pacific regions.","On Slide 15, Consumer segment sales in the Americas rose 18% in constant currency versus the third quarter of 2017, with 14% of the increase from Frank\u2019s and French\u2019s incremental sales. The remaining 4% increase was driven by growth from volume and pricing in the U.S. across several product lines, including recipe mixes, spices and seasonings, Asian foods, stocks and broths and grilling items. And as Lawrence mentioned, the underlying business growth rate was a significant sequential improvement from the first-half of year.","In EMEA, constant currency consumer sales were down 1% from a year-ago period, including 1% growth from sales of Frank\u2019s and French\u2019s. As Lawrence already mentioned, the unusually warm weather impacted sales growth in Europe. We grew consumer sales in Asia Pacific region 9% in constant currency, led by China-based business growth, with strength in, ketchup, sauces, recipe mixes and chicken bouillon.","For the consumer segment in total, we grew adjusted operating income 10% to $154 million. The impact of sales growth and cost savings more than offset increases of freight costs and brand marketing. We increased our brand marketing 44%, or $21 million in the third quarter versus the year-ago period. The increase of brand marketing, partially offset by the favorable impacts of CCI and product mix, driven adjusted operating margin declines of 50 basis points compared to the third quarter of last year.","Turning to our Flavor Solutions segment in slide 19, starting with sales growth. We grew constant currency sales 14% with minimal impact of currency. Our acquisition of the Frank\u2019s and French\u2019s portfolios contributed 9% of the sales growth. The remaining 5% growth was driven by both the base business and new products, primarily in the Americas and EMEA regions, partially offset by the elimination of some low-margin business.","In the Americas, third quarter constant currency flavor solution sales increased 19%, including a 14% contribution from Frank\u2019s and French\u2019s and a 5% increase from base business and new products. This base and new product increase was led by double-digit growth of custom condiments and coatings to quick-service restaurants, as well as strong flavor and branded foodservice sales growth. Partially offsetting these increases were declining ingredient sales, attributable to both pricing and the elimination of some low-margin business, as well as the global realignment of a major customer sales from the Americas to EMEA.","We grew Flavor Solutions sales in EMEA 7% in constant currency, with Frank\u2019s and French\u2019s contributing 1%. The remaining sales growth was driven primarily by volume growth in flavors, as well as a favorable impact from the global realignment of a major customer sales from the Americas to EMEA, as previously mentioned.","In the Asia Pacific region, Flavor Solutions sales were down 1% in constant currency. This was driven by the exit of low-margin business in the region, lower sales to quick-service restaurants due to the timing of the promotional activities and the pass-through of certain commodity cost declines.","As shown on Slide 23, adjusted operating income for the Flavor Solutions segment ended the quarter up 37% at $88 million, with a 3% unfavorable impact from currency. The increase was driven by the favorable impact of higher sales, a shift to more value-added products and the impact of our CCI program. These impacts led to a 270 basis point expansion of adjusted operating margin compared to last year.","Across both segments, adjusted operating income, which excludes the integration costs related to RB Foods and special charges, rose 20% in constant currency, which excluded a 1% unfavorable impact of the currency. This adjusted operating income growth includes the impact of increasing our marketing in the third quarter versus the year-ago period. As Lawrence mentioned, our focus on profit realization and the reshaping of our portfolio has continued to drive margin expansion even with increased investments.","As seen on Slide 25, in the third quarter, we increased adjusted gross profit margin 280 basis points year-on-year. While this expansion includes an accretion impact from the addition of the Frank\u2019s and French\u2019s portfolio, the core business was also a significant driver of the margin growth. Our portfolio shift to more value-added products and CCI-led cost savings continue to drive gross profit expansion across both our segments.","Our selling, general and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales increased by 200 basis points from the third quarter of 2017. Leverage from sales growth, as well as CCI-led cost savings were more than offset by significant increases in both brand marketing and distribution expense, driven by freight.","The net impact of the gross margin expansion and the SG&A increase resulted in an adjusted operating margin expansion of 80 basis points from the third quarter of 2017, which includes a 36%, or $21 million brand marketing increase versus a year ago. Below the operating income line, interest expense increased $23 million in the third quarter from the year-ago period, primarily driven by the debt secured for the RB Foods financing.","Turning to income taxes on Slide 26. Our third quarter adjusted effective tax rate was 18.8%, which reflected the favorable impact from a lower U.S. corporate tax rate as compared to 26.8% in the year-ago period.","Our third quarter adjusted rate was lower than anticipated due to the favorable impact of discrete items, principally a higher level of stock option exercises. Because of this favorability, we now expect that our adjusted effective tax rate for the full-year will approximate 21%. There can be volatility in that rate quarter-to-quarter due to the impact of discrete items, such as the impact of stock option exercises and changes to our forecasted mix of earnings.","Income from unconsolidated operations was $8 million in the third quarter of 2018, which was comparable to the year-ago period. Our previous 2018 income from unconsolidated operations guidance was to be comparable to 2017. We now expect our 2018 income from unconsolidated operations to decline by low single digits versus 2017, driven by unfavorable impact from currency.","At the bottom line, as shows on Slide 28, third quarter 2018 adjusted earnings per share was $1.28, a 14% from $1.12 for the year-ago period, mainly due to higher adjusted operating income and the more favorable adjusted income tax rate, partially offset by higher interest expense and shares outstanding. This increase included an unfavorable impact from currency.","On Slide 29, we summarized highlights for cash flow and the quarter-end balance sheet. Our cash flow provided from operations was $389 million through the third quarter of 2018, compared to $303 million from the third quarter of 2017. This change was driven by the increase in our net income.","We also continue to see improvements in our cash conversion cycle, finishing the third quarter at 59 days, down 17 days versus our fiscal year-end, primarily driven by our extended payment terms and inventory programs. We\u2019ve returned $205 million of cash to shareholders through dividends and used $113 million for capital expenditures through the third quarter of 2018.","We expect 2018 to be another year of strong cash flow, and our priority is to continue to have a balanced use of cash, making investments to drive growth, returning a significant portion to our shareholders through dividends and to pay down debt. Year-to-date, we have prepaid $280 million in our term loans secured as part of the RB Foods acquisition financing.","Let\u2019s now move to our current financial outlook for 2018 on Slide 30. As Lawrence mentioned, we continue to expect strong growth for the fiscal year 2018, and are updating our projections to reflect the strength of our year-to-date performance and the momentum we have heading into the fourth quarter.","Additionally, our updated projections include a lower favorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates, the lower adjusted income tax rate and a higher net favorable non-recurring impact of the U.S. Tax Act.","Based on prevailing rates, we now estimate a favorable impact of net sales growth rate of 1%, down from our previous estimate of 2%, and minimal currency impact on adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share, down from our previous 1% favorable impact.","As I previously mentioned, we also expect our income from unconsolidated operations to decline low single digits because of our unfavorable currency impact. Year-to-date, currency has been favorable with an unfavorable impact in the third quarter. We expect the remainder of the year to also be unfavorable. And as I mentioned earlier, we now estimate that our adjusted effective tax rate for the full-year will approximate 21%.","And finally, related to our GAAP earnings per share, the net impact of two non-recurring items required by the U.S. Tax Act, the favorable non-cash impact of the revaluation of our U.S. net deferred tax liabilities less the unfavorable impact of the transition tax. This net impact is now expected to be a tax benefit in 2018 of approximately $308 million.","Our previous sales growth guidance of 13% to 15% included an 8% incremental impact of the acquisition of the Frank\u2019s and French\u2019s portfolios, underlying base business and new product growth of 3% to 5% from higher volume, product mix and pricing, as well as a 2 percentage points favorable impact due to currency.","We now expect to grow sales 12% to 14%, including our updated estimate of only a 1 percentage point favorable impact from currency rates. We are reaffirming our constant currency expected sales growth of 11% to 13%. We expect a low single-digit cost inflation, which combined with CCI and strategy execution on shifting to a more value-added portfolio leads to a 2018 adjusted gross profit margin that is projected to be 175 to 225 basis points higher than 2017.","Our previous adjusted operating income growth guidance of 23% to 25% included a 1 percentage point favorable impact from currency rates. We now expect to increase adjusted operating income 22% to 23% from $786 million in 2017, with minimal impact from currency rates. This updated guidance reflects continued increased investments to drive growth.","Our cost savings target is, at least, $105 million and we are planning to increase brand marketing at a rate above our sales growth. Our recent guidance for 2018 adjusted earnings per share was $4.85 to $4.95, an increase of 14% to 16% versus our $4.26 adjusted earnings per share in 2017. This range of growth included an estimated 1 percentage point impact from favorable currency rates.","Based on the revisions I have just mentioned, we are now increasing our adjusted earnings per share estimate to $4.95 to $5, an increase of 16% to 17% versus 2017, which now includes minimal impact from currency. For the fiscal year, we expect our higher profit and working capital initiatives to lead to another year of strong cash flow.","In summary, we are projecting excellent growth in our 2018 constant currency outlook for sales, adjusted operating profit and adjusted earnings per share, following the record double-digit performance across each objective in 2017.","Our 2018 GAAP earnings per share range is now projected to be $7.03 to $7.08, which is an increase in our previous estimate of $6.85 to $6.95. There are several projected 2018 adjustments, which are expected to drive our GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation.","First, approximately $23 million for integration expenses related to RB Foods, which is in line with our previous estimate; second, approximately $18 million of special charges; and finally, the net impact of two non-recurring items required by the U.S. Tax Act is currently expected to be a tax benefit in 2018 of approximately $308 million.","This increase from our previous estimate of $298 million is attributable to deferred tax liability adjustments, driven by the finalization of both our RB Foods purchase accounting and the impact of cash repatriation. The total net impact of these adjustments is anticipated to be a $2.08 favorable impact to our GAAP earnings per share for fiscal 2018.","Finally, before we move to your questions, let me recap the key takeaways from our remarks this morning. Our momentum has continued into the third quarter and our core business sales growth has accelerated as planned. With our excellent year-to-date results, the strength of both our core business and our Frank\u2019s and French\u2019s portfolio is evident.","We are delivering against our plans for both sales and profit realization and are confident in the effectiveness of our strategies. In light of continued strength in our business, we are confident in our ability to achieve our updated 2018 financial outlook.","Now let\u2019s turn to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from the line of Alexia Howard with AllianceBernstein.","Alexia Howard","Good morning, everyone.","Lawrence Kurzius","Hi, Alexia.","Mike Smith","Good morning.","Alexia Howard","Hi there. So if I\u2019m sticking with my one question, can I ask about pricing? I think, last quarter, you had 0.2% pricing come through, but you were talking about strengthening of the pricing in the back-half based on the agreements or the pricing increases that you pushed through. It was up 0.5% this quarter overall. Was that a little lower than expected? Should we expect the pricing to strengthen from here on out, or are you finding that you are having to maybe dial it back a little bit more than you expected in terms of promotional spending? Just curious about that. Thank you, and I\u2019ll pass it on.","Mike Smith","Hi, Alexia, it\u2019s Mike. I\u2019ll answer this one. We\u2019ve launched our pricing. We talked about it in the second quarter how \u2013 particularly in the U.S. how pricing is out. If you really look at Consumer versus Flavor Solutions, on the Flavor Solutions side due to some commodity decreases, there was negative \u2013 a small negative pricing. But if you look at the Consumer side, we did see an acceleration on the pricing line, particularly in Americas up 1.3% in the third quarter. So the pricing has gone through.","Alexia Howard","Great. Thank you very much. I\u2019ll pass it on.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from the line of David Driscoll with Citi. Please go ahead with your question.","David Driscoll","Great. Thank you. I had a just a quick follow-up here and then a real question. The follow-up is just on gross margins. Is the fourth quarter gross margin going to expand?","Mike Smith","Well, we\u2019ve seen really great performance in the first three quarters and we\u2019ve attributed about half of that 290 basis point expansion due to RB Foods and approximately the other half due to the underlying base business. Our guidance for the year of 175 basis points to 225 basis points would suggest that the underlying business would improve in the fourth quarter.","David Driscoll","All right. And then the real question here is on Frank\u2019s. And apologies, you guys did a lot of color on here. Did I miss it? Did you say what the organic revenue growth was in the quarter for Frank\u2019s? And then I\u2019d just love to hear a little bit more about Frank\u2019s international potential and when is this going to deliver something meaningful in terms of OI dollars?","Lawrence Kurzius","Great. So I\u2019ll start and I\u2019ll let Mike follow-up. I don\u2019t think that we said what the total organic growth was on Frank\u2019s. We broke out the acquisition lap as sales from acquisition and then subsequently for the period that would be organic growth, which, by the way, was only two weeks. That goes into our base growth.","And then going forward, we\u2019re not, Dave, we\u2019re not going to be breaking up Frank\u2019s and French\u2019s organic growth separately. As we\u2019ve lapped the acquisition, all of that is going to go into our base growth and it\u2019s going to be treated as base.","As we\u2019ve said, our whole and expectation with Frank\u2019s is that, it gives us a step change in size and performance, but going forward, we continue with the growth algorithm that we\u2019ve had out there, which is 4% to 6% top line growth in Frank\u2019s, and French\u2019s would be supportive of that. If there was another part to that question, I missed it.","Mike Smith","I want to go and talk about that. I think, the other thing to think about, we did talk about how, under our ownership in the third quarter, there has been an acceleration of sales versus the previous owner, and year-to-date, we\u2019ve had a mid single-digit increase for the same period compared to last year.","Lawrence Kurzius","That\u2019s a good point. I\u2019ll say that Frank\u2019s and French\u2019s and I don\u2019t want to leave Cattleman\u2019s out of the mix as well. But that portfolio of brands that we bought from RB Foods has really performed according to our plans. I mean, it\u2019s been uncannily close. The sales growth that we expected to get, we\u2019ve gotten. The EPS accretion that we expected to get, we\u2019ve gotten. Mike, you want to add?","Mike Smith","And I think that your, Dave, your question was about when are we going to get significant international growth.","David Driscoll","Yes, thanks.","Mike Smith","Right. So, for international, we\u2019ve \u2013 I think, we touched on those in our prepared remarks. We\u2019ve converted all the distributors over to us. We\u2019ve added new distributors in 20 countries, where the brands were not represented previously, and where we have infrastructure, we\u2019re taking the business actually away from the distributor and converting it to our direct distribution and management. We highlighted India in this call, because it was new and we\u2019ve really just gone on the shelf with our sales organization in India.","And in the last call, we mentioned, in Mexico, through our JV, we have a very substantial presence at retail, a strong sales force. We didn\u2019t include it in our prepared remarks. But I\u2019ll say here that we\u2019ve gained some significant retail distribution on Frank\u2019s in particular in Mexico.","French\u2019s had pretty good distribution; Frank\u2019s did not. And we\u2019ve had some significant distribution gains there. And then, over in the UK, we have a very strong sales organization. We actually merchandised the stores Frank\u2019s already had some good presence in the market, and we\u2019ve converted that to our sales organization, where we\u2019re going to be able \u2013 where we\u2019re continuing to be able to drive it.","David Driscoll","That\u2019s helpful color. Thank you guys so much.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse.","Robert Moskow","Hi. I was hoping to zero in a little more on the change in the operating income guidance. You took down the high-end of the guide when we exclude the currency. And I think, you mentioned higher investment in branded marketing, but I didn\u2019t hear any numbers. Did you raise the investment that you\u2019re expecting for the year, or are you really just continuing to invest at the same rate that you were going to spend at originally?","Lawrence Kurzius","Yes, I mean, Rob, you saw we had a 36% increase in the third quarter, it\u2019s pretty significant. Our guidance has been we\u2019re going to grow our A&P above our net sales growth. We haven\u2019t given a particular how far above that will be, but we\u2019ve taken the opportunity and now we\u2019re at 23% A&P growth versus a sales growth of 17%.","So we\u2019ve taken the opportunity to really drive in the third quarter into the fourth some of these investments to really build \u2013 and these are brand-building advertising. It\u2019s not promotions, things like that between gross and net. So, these are things we\u2019re going to build into next year and really get us on a good footing.","Mike Smith","And I will comment, Rob, that our underlying business is really performing according to plan. The changes that we made in guidance were really dropping through the tax and the FX changes that we\u2019re offsetting and we\u2019ve dropped the full amount of those through to the EPS line. We\u2019re not giving quarterly guidance and there may be some timing issues that exist between market expectations and our own plans that we are letting roll.","We\u2019re really confident in the guidance that we have given and the level of A&P increase that we\u2019ve planned may not fully appreciate it as we continue to invest in our business to drive growth. I\u2019ll also point out that in raising the guidance, we\u2019ve also narrowed the range and taken it to the high-end even with that A&P investment.","Robert Moskow","Yes, but Lawrence, it\u2019s related to a tax benefit that I don\u2019t think that repeats next year. In fact, originally, the tax rate was supposed to go up sequentially in 2019. Is that still the expectation?","Lawrence Kurzius","Well, I don\u2019t think that we\u2019re going to give any guidance for 2019 until we get to our next earnings call, when we talk about the end of the year, and we\u2019ll give updated guidance for \u2013 well, I should say, we\u2019ll give our first guidance for 2019 then.","Robert Moskow","Okay. I\u2019m going to sneak one more, if I could. I think the sales guide requires a pretty big step-up in organic sales growth now that you have RB in the core. It looks like RB grew double digits in the third quarter, probably does it again in fourth. Is that right, that organic sales will have to be like up around 7% in fourth quarter for the sales guide for the year?","Lawrence Kurzius","I think that your math is good and I\u2019m not signing up for 7%, but that would be within the range. So we have a pretty wide range on sales growth still. Our fourth quarter is still the strongest quarter of our year. We have a strong seasonality in our business, particularly in the Americas. And so we that\u2019s \u2013 we typically have a \u2013 maybe a wider range around sales growth outlook going into the last quarter of the year than many companies do, just because it\u2019s still such a large proportion of our total annual sales. Mike?","Mike Smith","And, Rob, I mean, there was some concern, I think, going into that second-half of the year that we were lapping a strong second-half last year. And I think, we\u2019ve shown with a base business growth \u2013 the sales growth of 4% in the third quarter that we were able to lap the strength. So we feel good about the fourth quarter or the full-year guidance of 11% to 13% constant currency.","Robert Moskow","Got it. Okay, thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Ken Goldman with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Tom Palmer","Good morning. It\u2019s Tom Palmer on for Ken. Thanks for taking my question.","Lawrence Kurzius","Hi, Tom, go ahead.","Tom Palmer","Thanks. I just wanted to ask on the consumer side. I know a lot of the margin decline was attributable to the marketing spend. But it seems like it was down on kind of a run rate relative to the last few quarters a bit more than just based on marketing. Are there some other items that you could highlight that maybe hit during the quarter? And then maybe comment on their persistence as we look towards the fourth quarter and potentially beyond, if you want to address it.?","Lawrence Kurzius","Yes, I think you\u2019re talking about op margin, not gross margin. I think you\u2026","Tom Palmer","Yes, yes, op margin.","Lawrence Kurzius","I think, you\u2019ll see in the results that gross margin continues to expand and OP was down. I\u2019d say that the \u2013 that there was an offset to the gross margin expansion due to A&P increase and some freight distribution costs, but we\u2019re not\u2026","Mike Smith","A little bit of FX, too, Tom.","Tom Palmer","Right. Thanks. But the vast majority was due to the increase in the Frank\u2019s marketing to your point.","Tom Palmer","And so as we look towards the fourth quarter, I mean, could it be down year-over-year again on the op margin line for consumer, or do synergies and other items start to offset that?","Lawrence Kurzius","We don\u2019t give quarterly guidance, especially by segment. So I think if you just look at the full-year and you can make some assumptions there.","Tom Palmer","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Rob Dickerson with Deutsche Bank. Proceed with your question.","Rob Dickerson","Great. Thank you so much. So, yes, I think I\u2019m going to ask the last question just in a different way. There did seem to be a little bit of margin pressure in the Consumer segment in the quarter, despite very impressive top line organic sales growth. But if you just look at the year-over-year in dollars in operating profit, I think, it\u2019s up around $14 million. And if we think about what that RB contribution likely would have been off of a 9% year-over-year on the top line, it sort of, I think, implies that the base would maybe have been flat to down in Consumer, despite the top line up. So I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m thinking about that in the right way. Can you just provide some color around base operating profit in Consumer?","Mike Smith","The base was definitely up ex RB. It might even get a little messy because of the two weeks last year and the full impact of RB this year is causing some of the math, I think, in your mind. But operating profit for the base business was definitely up relative to the margin.","Lawrence Kurzius","Yes, and I\u2019ll say that your question really is around is there margin pressure on that part of the business, and I\u2019m going to have to say no. We\u2019ve gotten the pricing through that we expected to get really in the second quarter. So, you\u2019re seeing that come through in the third quarter results, and so that\u2019s not a pressure point. And I think that the freight cost \u2013 freight distribution cost pressure that we\u2019ve had this quarter is really not a significant change from the prior, and our outlook forward isn\u2019t any \u2013 there\u2019s not pretty meaningful change there either.","So I\u2019ll just say that we\u2019re not feeling any margin pressure in that part of the business other than kind of I\u2019ll say, the normal commercial tension that exists between the supplier and the customer. But there\u2019s not a \u2013 I would not characterize that as being under margin pressure.","Rob Dickerson","Okay.","Lawrence Kurzius","And we\u2019ve made some decisions around spending and investing behind our brands that are different than decisions that have been made by some other CPG companies. So we\u2019ve leaned into a brand marketing investment that\u2019s very consumer-directed to drive the continued growth of our business. We\u2019re confident that that spending has a strong ROI.","Our holiday advertising or digital advertising are some of our highest-return items, and those are areas where we\u2019ve leaned in. We\u2019re able to start holiday relatively early. We\u2019re able to up our digital spending going into the quarter, and so like going through the quarter. And, of course, we\u2019ve \u2013 as we\u2019ve said all year that we would, we\u2019re going to introduce marketing campaigns behind French\u2019s and Frank\u2019s, and that\u2019s what you\u2019re seeing coming through.","Rob Dickerson","Fair enough. Thank you so much.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Steven Strycula with UBS. Please proceed with your questions.","Steven Strycula","Hi, good morning.","Lawrence Kurzius","Good morning.","Steven Strycula","So it\u2019s good to see a food company investing in brand equity advertising, so congratulations there.","Lawrence Kurzius","Thank you for that.","Steven Strycula","One \u2013 I\u2019m curious, Lawrence, what is your view when you speak, especially with bringing in new brands such as French\u2019s and Frank\u2019s? What is the temperament from a lot of the retailers right now as to whether they want to see you guys investing in your business and partnering with them between the gross to net sales line, which you were touching on in the last question versus necessarily the brand equity advertising that you appear to be signaling and how you were spending in third quarter and fourth quarter? Any type of context would be helpful, and then I have a follow-up?","Lawrence Kurzius","Yes, I\u2019m going to say a comment just I\u2019m going to \u2013 we\u2019ve asked everyone to limit themselves to one question, but I\u2019m going to give you a three-part answer to it, so sorry for those of you on the call, just roll with me. We may go a minute over here. But first of all, the initial response was terrific to us buying these brands, because retailers expect that we\u2019re going to make brand-building investments.","And some of the incumbent players in these categories who are more focused on, I will say, rev management, taking profitability out of the category, and we\u2019re not as focused on building our brands. I\u2019m not going to name any names, but you can probably imagine who I\u2019m talking about. So that\u2019s the first thing.","The second thing is that as we have introduced the different brand-building ideas and our category management ideas, they\u2019ve been strongly embraced by retailers. So the demeanor there has been very positive. I\u2019ll say that\u2019s true on both the retail side of the business and the food service side of the business.","And then the third thing is that the retailers \u2013 it\u2019s not really an A&P question, but it\u2019s an innovation point. They are appreciating some of the innovation that we\u2019re bringing to these brands, and in particular, the launch of the frozen wings, which we\u2019ve for the first time mentioned on this call that\u2019s \u2013 I\u2019ve said that we had a long pipeline of terrific innovation ideas. This is one of them coming to market. That has really been embraced pretty well by the retailers as well.","Steven Strycula","All right. Thank you.","Lawrence Kurzius","Okay.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Akshay Jagdale with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.","Akshay Jagdale","Hi, can you hear me? Thanks for taking the questions.","Lawrence Kurzius","Yes, can you hear us?","Akshay Jagdale","Yes, I can hear you.","Lawrence Kurzius","We\u2019re using a new sound system here, Akshay, by the way, so we\u2019ve had a couple of little sound hiccups.","Akshay Jagdale","Well, I guess, somehow I knew that telepathically. But anyway, the \u2013 I just want to clarify one clarification, which is regarding the EBIT guidance.","Lawrence Kurzius","Yes.","Akshay Jagdale","It sounds like to me and I know you don\u2019t want to be specific for competitive reasons. It sounds like to me, the main \u2013 the FX neutral EBIT guidance is same. So FX is one of the primary drivers of the adjusted EBIT being down. But the other one, which might be a similar amount or close to that is your brand investments, right? I mean, it\u2019s a pretty significant increase that you\u2019re planning and it looks like you\u2019re taking the opportunity to really step on the gas on that.","So I feel what you\u2019re trying to tell us is that the underlying trends are good and base momentum. So you\u2019re investing back in the business more than you previously expected, right? That\u2019s what I\u2019m hearing. Is that a fair sort of characterization of what you\u2019re trying to communicate?","Mike Smith","Akshay, this is Mike. I\u2019d characterize them kind of leaning into the brand building activities towards the end of the year. For those of you who follow us a long time, if we over-deliver on CCI a lot of times, we\u2019ll push it in the brand marketing. So it\u2019s kind of a similar thing we\u2019re leaning in and really setting ourselves up great for the fourth quarter next year.","Akshay Jagdale","Got it. And then just one last one on, just one follow-up on the U.S. business. Obviously, the really strong organic sales growth there and good momentum. But if you take a step back and think about sort of the market share issues, et cetera, where are we over like a three-year period? I mean, how much closer are we to being, at least, share neutral all the noise aside? I mean, are we \u2013 how do you feel about that?","Lawrence Kurzius","Well, I think that you guys \u2013 I want to first of all say that our \u2013 yes, I think the market share you\u2019re referring to specifically in the herbs and spices category were \u2013 while there\u2019s still some share erosion, we have closed the gap, I would say that on unmeasured channels we\u2019re doing. We continue to do well and we\u2019re confident that we\u2019re on the right track there.","In other categories like a recipe mix category, we are definitely gaining share. And particularly, if you look at the traction that we\u2019re gaining on the acquired brands in the most recent \u2013 I think the most recent data is beginning to show the distribution gains that we\u2019ve gotten, you\u2019re seeing some of the best trends of the year.","We talked all year that we expect to have sequential improvement, as we went through the year on our consumer business and in particularly \u2013 particular in the Americas. You\u2019ve \u2013 and that\u2019s what you\u2019ve seen, and I think we feel really good about the guidance that we\u2019ve got for the year or just for the strong finish to the year and continued strong growth.","Akshay Jagdale","Thank you. I\u2019ll pass it on.","Operator","Thank you. I\u2019ll now turn the call back to Lawrence Kurzius for closing remarks.","Lawrence Kurzius","Great. Thanks, everyone, for your questions and for participating on today\u2019s call. McCormick is a global leader in flavor and we\u2019re differentiated by a broad and advantaged portfolio, which continues to drive our growth. We\u2019re responding readily to changes in the industry with new ideas, innovation and purpose with a keen focus on growth performance and people we continue to perform strong globally and build shareholder value.","I\u2019m pleased with our strong year-to-date results. I\u2019m confident in our continued momentum in the last quarter 2018 to drive even further growth, and I look forward to reporting to you on the shareholder value we will continue to create.","Kasey Jenkins","Thank you, Lawrence, and thanks to all for joining today\u2019s call.

To accompany our call, we\u2019ve posted a set of slides at ir.mccormick.com. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following our remarks, we will begin a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. With me this morning are Lawrence Kurzius, President and CEO, Gordon Stetz, Executive Vice President and CFO, and Mike Smith Senior Vice President, Corporate Finance.","During our remarks, we will refer to non-GAAP financial measures. These include adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share that exclude the impact of special charges as well as information in constant currency. Reconciliations to the GAAP results are included in this morning's press release and slides. As a reminder, today\u2019s presentation contains protections and other forward-looking statements.

As seen on slide 2, our forward-looking statement also provides information on risk factors that could affect our financial results.","It\u2019s now my pleasure to turn the discussion over to Lawrence.","Lawrence Kurzius","Thank you Joyce, good morning everyone, thanks for joining us. McCormick's first-quarter results were a great start to the year. We created momentum with our growth strategies throughout 2015 and are building on this strength in 2016. This strength was evident in our topline growth, we grew constant currency sales 6% for our Consumer segment and 7% for our Industrial segment with increased base business, new products and acquisitions, our three drivers of long-term sales growth. We are improving gross profit margin and achieved a 70 basis point increase this period. This was a sequential increase from 30 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2015 and ahead of our expectations due in part to favorable product mix. A big driver of the year-to-year improvement is cost savings from our Comprehensive Continuous Improvement program, CCI and our organization and streamlining action. Employees throughout the Company are improving productivity and we have greater confidence in our goal to achieve at least $95 million of cost savings this year.","Under Mike's leadership, efforts are underway toward delivering the four year $400 million cost reduction target that we announced in February. We grew first quarter adjusted operating income 12% from the year ago period on a constant currency basis led by the higher sales and increased gross profit margin. We\u2019d initially planned a year-on-year increase in brand marketing this period but shifted this timing to second quarter to better coincide with some of our new product launches. At the bottom line, adjusted earnings per share of $0.74 was up 6% from $0.70 in the first quarter of 2015. This includes the unfavorable impact to foreign exchange rates and the underlying increase was quite strong. These first-quarter results give us increased confidence in our ability to deliver our plans for constant currency growth of 4% to 6% for sales, 9% to 11% for adjusted operating income and 9% to 11% for adjusted EPS. Each of these growth rates is at or above our long-term objectives.","I'd like to comment next on the recent news about our proposal to acquire Premier Foods. Premier Foods is just one idea in McCormick\u2019s robust acquisition pipeline, one that would be a great addition to our business. This acquisition would be consistent with our growth strategy, adding iconic brands that complement our product portfolio, increasing our current scale and presence in the UK market and creating potential to drive growth through innovation, marketing and expanded international distribution. We believe our offer is highly attractive for Premier Foods\u2019 shareholders and an opportunity to build value for McCormick shareholders. At this stage, given UK regulatory restrictions, we\u2019re limited in what we can say beyond our recent announcement. Consistent with our acquisition strategy, we will be disciplined about returns and value creation for McCormick shareholders.","Now let's turn to our business update. Consumer demand for flavor are strong and on the rise. Across generations, flavor remains the number one driver of food decisions especially among millennials. Slide 6 shows the information we shared at the CAGNY conference and we were pleased to see similar survey results shared by other food companies, many of them customers of our Industrial segment. While taste has remained a constant theme, the food industry is also seeing some significant changes in consumer eating habit, particularly in the US. For these trends, McCormick is well positioned to drive growth. There are changes in how we eat, consumers increasingly want to eat healthy, and spices and herbs, the core of our business, are a healthy way to add flavor. We announced in January that the new 2015-2020 dietary guidelines for Americans point to herbs and spices as a way to reduce sodium in the diet and we were pleased to see in February a new MyPlate for older adults co-sponsored by AARP showing herbs and spices as one of seven recommended food and beverage groups.","We\u2019re changing what we eat; fresh ingredients are on the rise. Consumers who are buying more fresh vegetables, seafood and meat are looking for both flavor and convenience. We\u2019re meeting this need with current products like Grill Mates, Recipe Mixes and Lawry's and our latest innovation of liquid sauces and herb grinders. Consumers are changing why they choose certain brands and product, demanding greater transparency. We are addressing this demand with our message that pure tastes better and consumer information about McCormick\u2019s high-quality sourcing and manufacturing standard. As a next step in the US, we are in the process of labeling over 70% of McCormick brand spices, herbs and extracts as non-GMO and transitioning 80% of our gourmet line to organic this year. We\u2019re even changing when we eat. Snacking occasions have suppressed breakfast and lunch and now rival dinner. Here is where our industrial segment steps in as a major supplier to packaged food companies, the largest being PepsiCo that are focused on building this part of their product portfolio.","Our restaurant customers are also developing menu items to meet this demand. Clearly McCormick is in a great position for the portfolio of leading brands and industrial flavor solutions that are aligned with today's consumer and developing the insight to adapt to tomorrow's consumer. ","I want to turn next to some specific remarks about the growth strategies underway and performance for each of our two segments. Let's start with the consumer segment and our US business. Category growth for spices and seasonings continues to be strong. In the most recent quarter, retail sales of McCormick brands spices and seasonings continued to grow reaching a 5% increase. Within this broader category, we grew our core McCormick brand spices and herbs at the category growth rate and we continue to see strong growth for our gourmet products with retail sales up 6% since our 2015 relaunch. Across our entire US product portfolio, we have increased advertising 20% in the last two years and are achieving investment returns on our brand marketing that are ahead of industry benchmark. Digital marketing has particularly high ROI. In the fourth quarter, we launched our Purity campaign which is gaining traction. The video has now been viewed more than 33 million times at a cost of just $0.03 per view. Our video completion rate is 25% exceeding the industry and our own historical average and is attracting traffic to our website with 43% of traffic coming from millennials. This campaign will continue in 2016.","In the second quarter, we will also have incremental marketing to build awareness and trial of our new Herb Grinders. Following the busy holiday period and Super Bowl event, we\u2019ve reached critical mass with shelf placement at retail and are now ready to launch our marketing support for this innovative and differentiated product. The latest product launches that we\u2019re rolling out include our first line of organic recipe mixes, liquid Grill Mates marinades, Zatarain's microwavable rice cups, Kitchen Basics organic stocks, food colors with no artificial dyes and an extension of our skillet sauces to a line of oven baked variety. McCormick brand liquid sauces have really taken off with 4 percentage points of category share gain in the first quarter. Consumption results have also been excellent for Stubb's which we have now owned for six months. Total Stubb's brand retail sales rose 14% in the latest quarter year-on-year with barbecue sauce sales up even higher at 18%.","In Europe, Middle East and Africa, EMEA, we've been building our brand equity with increased marketing support; a double-digit increase in 2015 will be followed by additional support in 2016 for our grilling campaign, Vahine dessert items and core spices and seasonings. Our products introduction this year includes seasoning blends to create authentic Spanish dishes in the UK and new recipe mix varieties in Poland, premium grinders in France, Poland and Russia, and dessert decorating items [in France] [ph]. As a further growth driver in our EMEA region, we continued to benefit from distribution gains in Poland and Russia and have some incremental benefit in the first half of this year from our May 2015 acquisition of Drogheria & Alimentari in Italy. We returned to double-digit sales growth in our China consumer business this quarter in constant currency. This followed a 5% constant currency increase in the fourth quarter when we had some impacts from distributors that held back on purchases in anticipation of Chinese New Year promotion. Our holiday promotions were very successful and we achieved double-digit growth in herbs and spices, condiments and our bouillon product.","We remain bullish about our prospects for consumer segment growth in this market, and in 2016 expect to achieve constant currency sales growth in a high-single digit to low-double digit rate. In other parts of our Asia Pacific region, our decision to discontinue lower margin product in India is impacting financial results in 2016 with an estimated reduction of about 0.5 percentage point on total company sales. Excluding this impact, we had a solid first-quarter sales performance for our Kohinoor business in India. Adjusted operating income for our consumer segment was up 7% in constant currency in the first quarter setting the stage for better profit growth this year than in 2015. Factors affecting this improved profit performance include higher sales including better growth in our US business and lower material cost inflation.","Turning to the industrial segment, we had excellent sales and profit growth in 2015 and this is continued through the first quarter of 2016. Gordon will provide more details but for the total segment in constant currency, we grew sales 7% and adjusted operating income 27%. This margin improvement stems from our cost reductions, the scale advantage of higher volume and a more favorable mix including the acquisition of Brand Aromatics in March 2015 as well as innovation with more value added flavor. Leading our industrial performance again this quarter was another double-digit sales increase in constant currency was our team in the EMEA. In this region, the greatest growth is with quick service restaurants through product innovation, distribution gains and their geographic expansion. This geographic expansion includes Eastern Europe and the Middle East and construction of the new plans in Dubai that we have mentioned before is on schedule to be complete in mid-2016.","Our willingness to support and supply our customers locally is a good example of our strategy to excel at customer intimacy and is part of the reason we were most recently named global flavor supplier of three top food and beverage companies. In the Americas region it is almost one year since we acquired the Brand Aromatics business and we are pleased to report that it is exceeding our profit expectations and providing other benefits such as helping to launch organic Kitchen Basics stocks for our consumer segment. For the base business in this region, we are encouraged by our current innovation pipeline with customized flavors for food manufacturers, flavors for snacks seasonings, beverages, soups and cereals. Sales of snack seasonings were a key driver of our topline growth in the first quarter, especially in Latin America. In the foodservice industry, we're supporting recent new products and promotion activity by several current restaurant customers and through our branded foodservice business expanding with some new restaurant chains.","Turning to the Asia-Pacific region, we continue to grow industrial sales for our operation in Australia with distribution gains to quick service restaurants in the region. In China, we are a bit cautious due to the effects of the macroeconomic situation as well as the impact of certain headwinds faced by quick service restaurants in recent years. On the positive side, these customers are continuing to invest in this market with innovation, new locations and marketing. Let me summarize by restating that our first quarter financial results across both our consumer and industrial segments are a strong start to 2016. And we\u2019ve increased confidence in our fiscal year outlook. Consumer demand for flavor is growing globally. At McCormick, we are well positioned to meet this demand with effective growth strategy, an on trend product portfolio, experienced business leaders and engaged employees.","It\u2019s now my pleasure to turn it over to Gordon.","Gordon Stetz","Thanks Lawrence and good morning everybody. I'm going to discuss our first-quarter results followed by comments on our current 2016 financial outlook. We started the year with strong sales growth and higher adjusted earnings per share. Our adjusted earnings per share result was ahead of our first-quarter guidance due to a timing shift for brand marketing and discrete tax benefits. Let's turn to our topline results as seen on slide 16. On a constant currency basis, we grew sales 7%. The incremental impact of the acquisitions completed in 2015 was 3%. We drove the other 4% with higher volume and product mix and to a lesser extend from pricing actions that we took in response to higher material cost. Constant currency sales growth for each of our two segments was in a 6% to 7% range and driven by contributions from these same three factors; volume and product mix, acquisitions and pricing.","On slide 17, consumer segment sales in the Americas rose 4% in constant currency with about a third of the increase from Stubb's. Base business sales growth in this region was led by higher US sales of core spices and herbs, Lawry's brand, Hispanic items and simply Asia products. These increases were offset in part this period by lower sales of certain economy products in the US. Also volume and mix declined in Canada as consumers adjust to some significant price increases related in part to currency pressure. In EMEA, we continued to achieve strong sales performance, up 14% in constant currency. This increase was driven by D&A which added 10% to sales growth as well as expanded distribution in Poland and our performance in France with new products and brand marketing.","Consumer sales in the Asia-Pacific region rose 5% in constant currency. We grew constant currency sales in China 12% with a broad base increase across a number of product categories in both our McCormick brand and brands added with the acquisition of Wuhan Asia-Pacific Condiments in 2013. Sales this period were unfavorably impacted by our decision to discontinue certain low margin Kohinoor products in India as Lawrence described. The reduced sales from our business in India lowered our growth rate in this region by 4 percentage points this quarter. For the consumer segment in total, our first-quarter adjusted operating income rose 3% to $94 million. In constant currency, adjusted operating income rose 7% from the year-ago period, with the impact of sales growth and cost savings more than offsetting higher material costs and employee benefit expense this period.","Turning to our industrial segment, we had excellent results this quarter in both sales and profit even with the impact of unfavorable currency rates and adjusted operating income margin rose to 9.2% from 7.8% in the first quarter of 2015. The result of our CCI programs, scale from higher sales, and a shift to more value-added products including the addition of Brand Aromatics. On slide 22, sales of Brand Aromatics contributed 3% to our growth in the Americas. Higher base business volume and product mix this quarter versus the year-ago period was led by sales of snack seasonings with particularly strong growth in the Latin American market from our operation based in Mexico. The excellent performance of our industrial business in EMEA continued into the first quarter with constant currency sales up 11%. As Lawrence described, we are benefiting from our strong customer relationships with leading quick service restaurants and food manufacturers supporting their growth and geographic expansion in this region.","We grew industrial segment sales in the Asia Pacific region 3% in constant currency. We drove higher sales to quick service restaurants in the region from our operations in both China and Australia. Adjusted operating income for the industrial segment ended the quarter up 19% at $36 million. In constant currency, the growth was even greater at 27% with the factors I already mentioned and as spelled out on slide 25. Our expectation for the fiscal year is to increase adjusted operating income for the industrial segment in line with our guidance for the total company. Clearly the first-quarter result came in ahead of this outlook and we expect further quarter-to-quarter fluctuation as a result of customer demand patterns and other factors. Across both segments adjusted operating income which excludes special charges rose 7% in the first quarter from the year ago period. If we also exclude the impact of unfavorable currency, we grew adjusted operating income by 12% which is just above our 2016 guidance range.","Gross profit margin was up year-on-year as well with a 70 basis points increase. This improvement was the result of cost savings from our CCI and organization and streamlining actions, favorable mix, scale benefits from higher sales and pricing actions taken to offset moderate cost inflation. As a percentage of net sales, selling, general and administrative expense was comparable to the first quarter of 2015. During this period we had a favorable impact from several factors that included our cost savings activity. This was offset by the impact of unfavorable factors that included increases in certain employee benefit expense and a $1 million increase in brand marketing. ","Below the operating income line, the tax rate on a GAAP basis this quarter was 26.9% compared to 24.8% in the year ago period. This first quarter 2016 tax rate was below our guidance for the year of approximately 28% due to discrete tax benefits. We continue to expect the full year rate to approximate 28%. Note that excluding the impact of special charges, the tax rate for the first quarter 2016 and first quarter 2015 were more comparable.","As the result of unfavorable currency, income from unconsolidated operations declined 15% to $8 dollars. This currency impact masked the strong underlying performance led by our joint venture in Mexico which had a mid single-digit increase in both sales and net income, excluding the impact of currency.","At the bottom line, first quarter 2016 adjusted earnings per share was $0.74 up $0.04 from the year ago period mainly due to higher adjusted operating income. This result included the unfavorable impact from currency on both consolidated and unconsolidated income.","On slide 30, we've summarized highlights for cash flow and the quarter end balance sheet. Through the first quarter, cash flow from operations was $78 million compared to $96 million in the year ago period. An increase in net income was offset mainly by the timing of payments for raw material purchases.","We returned $102 million of cash to shareholders through dividend and share repurchases and use $22 million for capital expenditures this period. At the end of the first quarter $522 million remained on the current $600 million share repurchase authorization. Our balance sheet remains sound. We are generating strong cash flow and we are well-positioned to fund future investments to drive growth.","Let\u2019s move now to our current financial outlook for 2016. Our strong outlook for the year is unchanged except for the impact of foreign currency exchange rates. Based on prevailing rates, we now estimate an impact to the growth rate for sales, adjusted operating income and earnings per share of 3%, down from our initial estimate of 4%.","At the top line, we reaffirm our plan to grow sales 4% to 6% in constant currency which includes a carryover benefit of 1% to 2% from acquisitions completed in 2015 and higher pricing of 1% to 2%. Including the impact of currency, the projected sales growth is 1% to 3%.","On a constant currency basis, we continue to expect to an increase adjusted operating income 9% to 11% from adjusted operating income of $614 million in 2015. Currency is expected to lower this range to 6% to 8%. We plan to drive this increase with higher sales and at least $95 million in cost savings, savings that include our CCI program and some carryover benefit from previously announced organization and streamlining actions. With this fuel for growth, we plan to increase brand marketing at least $20 million.","Due to the lower impact from currency, our guidance range for adjusted earnings per share has increased by $0.03 to $ 3.68 to $3.75. Excluding the estimated 3 percentage point impact of unfavorable currency rates, this range remains an increase of 9% to 11% from adjusted earnings per share of $3.48 in 2015.","In the second quarter of 2016, we expect adjusted earnings per share to be slightly below $0.75 of adjusted earnings per share in the year ago period. This is due to the unfavorable impact of currency rates, increased brand marketing and a higher tax rate. Keep in mind that we had a particularly low tax rate in the second quarter of 2015 at 16% on a GAAP basis and a bit higher on a non-GAAP basis, but still below our outlook of approximately 28% for the fiscal year 2016.","As a final remark on our outlook, we are on track for another year of strong cash flow for fiscal year 2016 with higher adjusted net income and actions underway to improve our working capital. ","That completes my remarks, so let\u2019s now turn it over for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Alexia Howard with Bernstein. Please proceed with your questions.","Alexia Howard","Good morning, everyone.","Lawrence Kurzius","Good morning, Alexia.","Alexia Howard","Can I do two questions? I know you comment on the Premier Foods specifically, or not very much, but just philosophically about your plans for acquisitions from here on out. You said there are other possible deals in the pipeline. What strikes me as different here is that it's quite big, which is a break from the bolt-on acquisitions you've done in the past. It is based in the UK which, frankly, even though I'm from there, doesn't strike me as a particularly attractive market. And it's moving out of your core spices and seasonings into more regular smaller growth categories. So maybe if you could just comment on if not this, are these the kind of criteria that you are focused on? And then as a really short follow-up, a number of other companies have announced that they will be labeling products that are containing GMOs in addition to obviously what you are doing which is labeling the products that are not containing GMOs or GMO free. In advance of the Vermont labeling legislation kicking in in the middle of the year, how are you planning to deal with that? Thank you and I will pass it on. ","Lawrence Kurzius","Alexia, this is Lawrence here and first of all, as we look at the Premier business, there is \u2013 we are pretty limited on what we can say. But I can tell you that what\u2019s attractive to us about this business is that it is still predominantly a flavor business with some terrific iconic flavor brands that are much loved in the UK. I am sure that you are very familiar with these brands yourself. Gordon, and Mike and I have lived in the UK ourselves and know that brands like Bisto, Oxo, Saxa, Sharwood, these are fantastic brands that are much loved by UK consumers and are widely consumed and we see them as flavor businesses.","Our flavor portfolio on the consumer side is not just herbs, spices and seasonings, we have sauces in many parts of the world. We are launching cooking sauces in North America, we have over the last few years, so we see brands in the Premier portfolio as being a very complementary to the flavor business that we have and are building globally. With the brands that are very close and we are looking at a whole company. So there are some brands that are not on their face core to our business, but I would remind you that we have strong dessert business on the continent with homemade dessert products through the Vahine brand and a fairly good part of our US business is based on cooking and baking products anyway as well.","So we feel pretty good about the fit. It is bigger than the bolt-on acquisitions that we have done so many of, and I think we have been signaling really for several months now that we were going to look at some bigger opportunities in addition to the bolt-on opportunity. This would use a fair bit of our financial capacity, but it wouldn\u2019t take us out of the market to do the kind of strategically important bolt-ons that we might still \u2013 that we might have done otherwise. ","And as far as the UK markets goes, one of the things that we are interested in as part of our acquisition program is adding scale where we already have strong business presence. And certainly the UK is a market where we have good presence with our Schwartz brand and have for many years and have strong relationships with our customers there. It\u2019s also the home of our EMEA business, our EMEA regional headquarters is in the UK and so we have substantial infrastructure and resources there to handle an asset like this. ","Your second question was about GMO labeling and we announced that we were going to label our product for non-GMO. We are taking credit for what we have to a great extent. The vast majority of our products, our herbs and spice products in particular, are not genetically modified in anyway and consumers are interested in transparency and that\u2019s what led to that initiative and we are certainly well aware of the Vermont law. We don\u2019t have any kind of particular public stance that we want to take on that other than that we are going to comply with the law. So where there are genetically modified materials in some of our products, we will either find a way to remove them or label them as is appropriate in order to put us into compliance with that law.","Alexia Howard","Great. Thank you very much. I'll pass it on.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of David Driscoll with Citigroup. Please proceed with your questions.","David Driscoll","Great. Thank you so much and good morning, everyone.","Lawrence Kurzius","Good morning, David.","David Driscoll","I just had two questions. I think on the last conference call you had indicated that you expected brand marketing to increase in the first quarter and I think it was flat. So, I'm just curious about the thoughts on how marketing lays out in the year and I believe you reiterated the $20 million increase number. So I think the pattern shifted a bit, but I'd kind of like you to comment on that. And then I just have a quick follow-up.","Lawrence Kurzius","Great. I will start and then may let Gordon pick up right behind me. But we did signal that we would have the brand marketing increase in the first quarter largely related to some new product launches. And I think in our prepared remarks, we indicated that we push that advertising into mostly in the second quarter just related to the timing of the distribution build on the new product. There is really nothing dramatic here. It\u2019s just around the actual retail execution predominantly on our herb grinders as we work through the holiday season and the Super Bowl season, the on-shelf placement of those products is a little bit slower than we anticipated at the very beginning of the year and so we\u2019ve shifted the spend out on a bit further to coincide with the retail distribution. Our particular problem is just the timing of it, so we still believe that we will deliver on that brand marketing increase that we talked about in our initial guidance for the year. Gordon, you want to elaborate on that?","Gordon Stetz","No, absolutely right. I mean, a lot of it is - the decisions are made as we progress through the quarter and determine when the best timing of it is as it relates to the rollout, so this purely a decision to make sure it\u2019s spent at the appropriate time to support the business.","David Driscoll","And then just a quick follow-up on your pricing in the United States and what are you seeing on price and volume elasticities?","Lawrence Kurzius","Price increase has just really been implemented at retail. Our expectation based on the analytical work that we did is that we will have minimal impact on volume and our price elasticity was an important consideration in developing this increase. Particularly in the US, the increase is quite surgical and item-specific. It\u2019s not a broad-based flat increase. It\u2019s, what I would call a very smart analytically based set of increases. Some items \u2013 it wasn\u2019t all an increase, some items went down as well. We took this as an opportunity to adjust our prices across the portfolio and the net was about 1% to 2% increase.","David Driscoll","Smart increases are my favorite kind. I appreciate it.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Brett Hundley with BB&T Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your questions.","Brett Hundley","Yeah. Good morning, gentlemen.","Lawrence Kurzius","Good morning, Brett.","Brett Hundley","Just wanted to stay on that topic with pricing and maybe a little bit as it relates to your cost savings program as well. But I wanted to revisit raw material inflation, Gordon, and maybe get a sense of whether you're still looking for a low-single-digit increase. And just your comfort with being able to use pricing or additional cost savings as needed if raws were to rise on you further. I hear about the garlic market and how that's just moving higher and maybe poor weather in India. So I just wanted to revisit that with you and get an update from you. ","Gordon Stetz","Yeah, our outlook on the raw material increases this year has not changed, so we are still in the low single-digit. I really don\u2019t want to speculate too much in terms of how we would deal with certain issues. As you know, they are automatically dealt with in the industrial side up or down based on those movements. In the retail side, all I would say is we lean on these tools and the techniques that we\u2019ve developed. We will look at the elasticities and the thresholds. Back to Lawrence\u2018s earlier comments, I\u2019ve been with this company a long time and I would say that the level of sophistication around the price increase just executed was the highest I\u2019ve seen. So I have confidence in our team to go back, use their analytics to make whatever decision is necessary to deal with whatever cost issues may pop up.","CCI, we will always lean on CCI. We talked about that as part of our strategy over time, that\u2019s where we look first in any type of an environment as to generate cost savings through our CCI. And under Mike\u2019s leadership, as you\u2019ve heard, we\u2019ve upped our resources there which has give us confidence to raise our target. So that will always be the first place we look.","Brett Hundley","Okay, and then just as a follow-up question -- this is a little bit of an oddball question, but I'm curious. The US protein industry has spent a lot of time year-to-date talking about how they are really going to focus on pushing hot dogs this growing season. I am just curious if that actually negatively impacts your US retail business at all if your see a switch as what goes on the grill or if you business is diverse enough of course that you really don\u2019t see any impact based upon what US protein producers try and decide to push.","Lawrence Kurzius ","I will say that while hot dog seasoning is not \u2013 I am not aware that we\u2019ve got a specific hot dog seasoning in our portfolio. I\u2019ll bet Montreal steak seasoning tastes great on a hot dog. But anything that promotes more grilling is going to be good for us during the grilling season. I am sure that Stubb\u2019s barbeque sauce is fantastic on a hot dog.","Gordon Stetz","And Zatarain's Creole mustard.","Brett Hundley","All right, great, guys. I appreciate it.","Operator","Our next question is from the Ken Goldman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question.","Tom Palmer","Good morning, it is Tom Palmer on for Ken. Thank you for taking my questions.","Lawrence Kurzius","Good morning, Tom.","Tom Palmer","We have started to see organic and non-GMO products on shelves in food retailers. I realize it's still a bit early, but how is the adoption progressing? Have you gained incremental placements at retailers? Can you comment on the rate of customer adoption? Thanks.","Lawrence Kurzius","I\u2019d tell you that the plans for the roll out of our conversions is organic on our gourmet line and the non-GMO labeling on the bulk of our herbs and spices is very much on track. We expect to have the rollout fully implemented by the end of the year. And we are pretty pleased with the results so far. We\u2019ve got great acceptance by retailers. I know we have a specific case to cite here, but I know we have gained additional distribution particularly as a result of the organic conversion. And we are optimistic about it. I think you may have heard in our prepared remarks that we are seeing a great lift on our gourmet line with that conversion as well.","Tom Palmer","Great, thanks. And just a quick follow-up. Gross margin expansion was the strongest in a couple years. Should we look for this degree of expansion to recur again this year or in subsequent quarters or was some of the increase perhaps a rebound off of an abnormally light figure in the first quarter of \u201815?","Gordon Stetz","We\u2019ve indicated gross margin improvement for the year in the 50 to 100 basis point range and this is squarely in the middle of that. So we\u2019ve dialed that into our thinking.","Tom Palmer","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Max Lewis with JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question.","Max Lewis","Hi, guys. Congratulations on the good results. I think my question is just more to do with the Premier Foods deal. Obviously aware there's a limit to what you can say there. But I think the very first thing that I'd be interested just to hear is the potential impact of this transaction on your credit rating. I mean, if we look at Premier Foods right now, I mean, in US dollar terms for a second, excluding the pension deficit, I may get about $930 million of net debt coupled with a pension deficit of GBP416 million is roughly $600 million resulting in the total additional net debt of almost $1.5 billion. I think because of that, even assuming an all stock deal, this is a deal which could almost double the net debt of the group. I think what I'd be interested to get your kind of guidance on is firstly whether or not you feel you can preserve your investment-grade credit rating if your net debt were to increase that materially. And secondly, whether or not it would make sense after acquiring Premier Foods, the Premier Foods legal entity to still issue its own bond and to sit outside the restrict group that currently contains all the assets that are referenceable into the McCormick bond restricted group in order to preserve the investment-grade rating of those bonds.","Gordon Stetz","In terms of the second question, we\u2019re getting into a level of detail that a speculation and I can't really comment on right now. In terms of your first question, I'll just point to our historical track record around, when we have done large acquisitions and the debt capacity that we have. We pride ourselves in our investment-grade rating and our full intention is to maintain our investment-grade rating and we believe we can achieve that through this transaction. While it is significantly large, if you go back in our history and you look at Ducros back in 2000, and you look at Lawry's as recently as 2008, on a percentage of our market cap and the size of the company, it's really not quite different from those sized transactions. So our intention, as we did in those two previous transactions, would be to lever up. Obviously, it will take our debt-to-EBITDA about where it is now, but it wouldn't be at a level that would be unlike where we were with Lawry\u2019s and Ducros at the time. And as we did in the past, we would curtail our share buyback program to pay down our debt and return to our investment-grade ratings. So that is how we would finance this acquisition and again, it would be very much in line with previous deal.","Max Lewis","I think one thing that I just struggle to understand there is whether or not you would expect to maintain your investment-grade rating immediately after the deal completed. Because obviously whilst I can understand that right now, you may not be willing to give all the information out, even if you give some guidance as to when you'll be able to give this information out regarding the potential impact this could have on your credit rating that would be important. So I think currently the credit market is quite concerned about a deal which, even on an all stock basis, could quite easily more than double the net debt of the group. And if it were to take place on an all cash basis, that's very significant to net debt to EBITDA for the group.","Gordon Stetz","Well, again, I can't speak specifically to what the rating agencies will or will not do, but all I would suggest is we are currently an A rating and we\u2019d have a ways to go before we get below investment grade and again the debt-to-EBITDA parameters would not be unlike where we were previously on other deals where we were able to maintain our investment-grade rating.","Max Lewis","Okay, I think second question I would throw off was more about the EPS impact of the deal and the potential of this deal to be accretive maybe in the future. Whilst I suppose kind of given the material discrepancy in terms of your P\/E ratio versus Premier Foods' P\/E ratio that could imply the deal could be quite accretive. I suppose some concerns that many of your investors have right now is firstly the impact of the pension deficit. And I've got the Premier Foods' legal entity pension deficit of GBP416 million, which in US dollar terms gets me to a little bit under $600 million. Premier Foods' management team announced that even though in 2015 they had a partial holiday for making the addition -- deficit contribution, the total cash outflow due to servicing the pension deficit will increase $14 million to $16 million this year and go up to almost $60 million, that's 60 million in 2016 and '17. I suppose how concerned are you about the EPS impact of one, the material payment the group will need to make moving forward to service its very large pension deficit? Secondly, the impact of the UK minimum wage on the large fixed cost base of the group given the fact that there are a large number of UK employees due to see their wage increases? ","Gordon Stetz","Max, Can I just interrupt you for just a minute?","Max Lewis","And just thirdly if I may, just about the competitive landscape in the UK where we've seen a number of the large [indiscernible] markets, the big [indiscernible] markets in the UK?","Gordon Stetz","I appreciate it, Max, but these are all questions that we're not going to be able to answer. If I could just interrupt, these are all matters that we're not going to be able to address and so I don't want to tie up. We've got a lot of other questioners and so, I don't mean to be rude, but I'm just saying, we're not going to be able to address any of those points. Obviously, we would expect that this transaction were to occur, would be beneficial to the Premier shareholders and the other stakeholders in the business, by providing greater security than they perhaps have in this highly levered situation that they find themselves in today and we would also expect it to be value creating for McCormick shareholders as well. The degree to which it is accretive is something that we can't even speculate on, no deal has been agreed at this point and so the return would be -- any discussion of the return would be highly speculative other than we've been good stewards of shareholder value for McCormick shareholders and we're going to continue to keep our financial discipline and any deal that we undertake is going to be favorable through both accretion lens and through an EDA lens.","Max Lewis","I suppose at the very least can you give the market some kind of indication as to when we might start to get some kind of firm statement from management as to the financial impact of this deal.","Joyce Brooks","Max, we've got several people in the queue and we want to move forward. So any other questions you have, we can take them offline, you can call me after the call. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Chris Growe with Stifel. Please go ahead with your question.","Chris Growe","Hi, thank you, good morning. Hi. We'll get back on track here. I had a question for you if I could please. In relation to the US business, you showed a chart early on in the slides where the US spices and seasonings category accelerated a bit in Q1. So I was curious about that sequentially even from Q4, but the gap between McCormick's performance and the category was a little wider. But I think I heard you say that your branded performance was in line with the category. So I wanted to understand those two comments or those really two questions there if you will. Then I had a second question, just a quick follow-up.","Lawrence Kurzius","Yes. We are continuing to see sequential improvement in our US business and spices and seasonings. And so you\u2019re right when you say you are seeing that acceleration, I think that that remark that you were referencing earlier refer to our A-Z spices. Within the different sub segments of that broad category, we have portions of that that are gaining share and our branded -- McCormick branded A-Z spices are certainly one of those segments that's gaining share. I think overall, we're still, someone correct me if I\u2019m wrong here, 60 basis points down in share for the quarter, but we continue to see sequential improvement. We\u2019re really pleased with the growth in our US business I have to say overall and we believe we've got the right momentum to get to continue to grow and to get the share gain.","Chris Growe","Okay. And just if I could, a quick follow-up question in relation to the CCI savings. Are the phasing of those cost savings this year more backend loaded? And then I believe they were more backend loaded in 2015. So is that what's really helping drive the stronger gross margin performance here early in the year?","Mike Smith","Hey, Chris. This is Mike Smith. They are more evenly weighted this year. Last year, they were really back loaded because as the year built, we identified more savings opportunities. We also had the North American effectiveness initiative, which really hit in the second half of last year, but you will see a more balanced deal this year.","Chris Growe","So, with those savings being more backend loaded last year, this should help support a stronger gross margin at least early in the year it would seem.","Mike Smith","Yeah. Our gross margin should be consistently up in that 50 to 100 basis point range for the year.","Chris Growe","Okay, that's very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Rob Dickerson with Consumer Edge Research. Please go ahead with your question.","Rob Dickerson","Thanks a lot. I just have one question and two quick clarifications. The first one is for free cash flow for the year, I don't believe you've given a target and, if not, can you? That's one. And then just any commentary around the cadence of free cash flow build throughout the year given the increase in your inventory policy.","Gordon Stetz","We have not given a target. Obviously, we have some aggressive programs that we spoke about earlier under Lawrence's leadership, he has certainly elevated internally with targets that we\u2019re cascading internally, but I would say that we are expectation wise in line with the net income growth that we\u2019re forecasting and projecting with benefits coming through various levers that we\u2019re focused on in the working capital side. So I know that's not as specific as you would like, but we certainly have a focus on increasing our cash flow, year-over-year this year.","Rob Dickerson","Okay, fair enough. And then two quick ones. On income from unconsolidated, I think at year-end, you said that was down slightly and now it's about flat year-over-year, is that just from currency or is there something else there. And then also just, I want to make sure I heard correctly, you said the operating income year-over-year growth for the industrial segment should be in line with total company, which is 60%, including FX. Just want to make sure that that's right.","Lawrence Kurzius","Hey, Rob. I'll take the unconsolidated and I'll pass it to Gordon for the industrial question, but income from unconsolidated operations is definitely an FX matter. The underlying businesses in local currencies are all doing very well.","Gordon Stetz","As it relates to the industrial business, we\u2019re very, very pleased with the start, but as I said in my remarks, we expect the full year number to be in line with the total year guidance for the total company and that's primarily a function of customer order patterns and mix that can vary quarter-to-quarter. So we're just giving people a heads-up that while we are very, very pleased with the start that at times that can change based on timing of promotions and things by our customers. ","Rob Dickerson","Okay, great. Thanks, guys.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Eric Katzman with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead with your question","Eric Katzman","Hi, good morning. I guess the first little more specific question on the fiscal second quarter, if the new product introductions were deferred to the second quarter and you are going to have some offset due to A&P spending, I guess all else equal, should sales be a bit stronger in the second quarter with those launches?","Gordon Stetz","I'd say Eric, we haven't given specific sales growth guidance, but it wouldn't be out of line with say the full-year guidance, I would say.","Eric Katzman","Okay. And then just maybe a bigger picture question on the Industrial. You've been doing better there with the margins for a while now. And I guess having followed the company for a long time; you've talked a lot about improving the mix and the technical capabilities and winning new contracts on the back of the Industrial segment. And it seems to me that maybe the best way to judge that is the margins because the more technically advanced the products are, the more likely you are to get a better margin for them. And so, is there a percentage margin that you are looking at for that segment that will suggest let's say that you're closer to some of your competitors like an IFF and others who seem to generate a higher margin in that business? And I'll pass it on. Thanks.","Gordon Stetz","Hi, Eric. This is Gordon. You obviously have followed us a long time so you know there was a time period where we had put out a specific margin target for that business, 8% to 10%. We didn't talk about that as much during rising commodity costs, because the pass-through mechanisms on that side of the business mask what was really good underlying performance at the time, to the tune of almost 200 basis points. We haven't put out a specific target, but I can say the progress that we've made in the margin story there is very, very pleasing to us. So it just demonstrates to us that strategy that we have in place with the portfolio of products that we\u2019re focusing on, the acquisition of Brand Aromatics are all the types of things that we have always worked towards in our strategy. So we hope to just continue that journey and I can't tell you there is a specific endpoint at this stage. ","Eric Katzman","Okay. If I can just follow up on one thing. Just remind me, Gordon, your pension here -- or I guess globally I should say -- your pension is -- is that overfunded or I mean I know it's always been very conservative, but -- and your accounting on it is pretty conservative. But where is your pension today relative to its funding needs?","Gordon Stetz","On an ABO basis, which is the accumulative benefit obligation, it's pretty much fully funded. We have minimal contributions to make to that plan in the US this year. So it's very much within our guidelines and we expect minimal pension contributions this year.","Eric Katzman","Okay, thought so. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Robert Moskow","Hi, thanks. I guess just one last question about margins on the consumer side. Historically, your margins in consumer were around 19%. And I guess the way I would tell the story is over the last couple of years, you've made a bigger investment in your consumer business to become more competitive with maybe lower price competition and now the margins in the mid-17% at least it was last year. When you think about what's possible going forward now that you've raised your CCI targets, do you think about maybe those margins getting up towards 19% again? Or do you really not think about it on a quantitative basis, it's really just a matter of driving the top line and then as your competitive position improves just the profit grows? Just wanted to know how you thought about it.","Lawrence Kurzius","Well, Rob, this is Lawrence. I will -- and good morning, by the way. Part of the -- we haven't set a target for the margins on that business that we communicated externally, but we certainly believe that there is upside to those margins for two reasons. First, in a more benign commodity environment, our CCI efforts are better able to drop to the bottom line. Our goal on CCI is to provide fuel for growth, but a portion of the CCI is always expected to support bottom-line growth and so that would go straight to your margin question. ","Second is as our US consumer business returns to growth that of course is one of the highest margin businesses and largest businesses in our portfolio and with return to growth, it mixes up the whole consumer business.","Robert Moskow","Very good, okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. I would now like to turn the floor back to Lawrence Kurzius for closing remarks.","Lawrence Kurzius","Well, thanks everyone for your questions and for participating on today's call. We are excited about our growth strategies and plans underway in 2016 to build on our base business, accelerate innovation, expand availability and footprint of our business and excel in customer intimacy and consumer insights. Our acquisition pipeline is robust and we have aggressive cost savings programs underway, all driven by McCormick\u2019s experienced leaders and engaged employees. Thanks for your attention this morning.","Joyce Brooks","Thanks, Lawrence and thanks to everyone for joining us today. If you have any questions regarding today's information, please give us a call at 410-771-7244. That concludes this morning's conference."],"14310":["McCormick & Company, Inc. (NYSE:MKC) Q2 2014 Earnings Conference Call June 26, 2014  8:00 AM ET","Executives","Joyce Brooks - VP, IR","Alan D. Wilson - Chairman, President and CEO","Gordon M.

This is Joyce Brooks, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you for joining today's call for a discussion of McCormick's Second Quarter Financial Results and 2014 Outlook. We've posted a set of slides to accompany our call at ir.mccormick.com. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. (Operator Instructions). As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. ","With me this morning are Alan Wilson, Chairman, President and CEO who will begin with comments on the latest financial performance and a business update; and Gordon Stetz, Executive Vice President and CFO, who will provide a more detailed review of second quarter results and our latest financial guidance for 2014.","As a reminder today's presentation contains projections and other forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those projected. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or other factors. As seen on slide two our forward-looking statement also provides information on risk factors that could affect our financial results. ","It is now my pleasure to turn the discussion over to Alan.","Alan D. Wilson","Thank you, Joyce. Good morning everyone and thanks for joining us. Our second quarter results included solid sales growth and strong cash flow, as well as earnings per share that exceeded the outlook that we shared with you in March. While the results varied by region, the overall performance demonstrated progress with McCormick's growth strategies and gives us increased confidence in our ability to deliver our 2014 financial outlook.","We grew sales 3% in local currency. Both our consumer and industrial businesses contributed to this increase. Growth in our international markets was particularly strong, including incremental sales from WAPC, an acquisition that we completed in May of 2013. We also drove international sales with pricing actions and with higher volume and product mix driven by product innovation, distribution expansion, and brand marketing support.","In our Americas consumer business, sales declined this quarter due to competitive pressure that began to impact our U.S. results in 2013. Also we are comparing to robust year-on-year sales growth of 5% in the second quarter of 2013 for our Americas consumer business. We are addressing the competitive environment in this market, and I'll provide an update later in my remarks. ","We improved gross profit margin in the second quarter by 60 basis points with our comprehensive continuous improvement program, CCI, which is generating cost savings throughout the company.","In addition, our industrial business team increased margins in the product portfolio this period. Sales growth, higher gross margin, and our diligent expense management led to a mid-single digit increase in operating income. While the increase in operating income was in line with our expectations for the quarter, we exceeded our earnings per share projection. This was a result of a lower tax rate and our share repurchase activity. ","The reduction in shares outstanding through the first half is tracking at the upper end of our 1% to 2% target for 2014, and we maintained strong cash flow this quarter with the year-to-date amount of nearly $50 million from year ago period. Through the first half, we\u2019ve returned $223 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases, a 22% increase from the first half of 2013. As Gordon will discuss in more detail, we are reaffirming our fiscal year 2014 outlook to grow sales 3% to 5% and deliver earnings per share in the $3.22 to $3.29 range. ","Let\u2019s turn to a business update for each of our two segments, consumer and industrial. Our consumer segment is meeting the increased demand for flavor when preparing meals at home, and category growth for our two primary categories; spices and seasonings and recipe mixes remained strong. The latest Euromonitor 52-week data shows global sales of spices and herbs, up 5.2% and recipe mixes up 3.3%. ","For McCormick\u2019s consumer business, we grew sales 4% in the second quarter and 6% year-to-date. This builds upon our year-on-year sales increase of 5% in the first half of 2013. However, the performance across our various regions was mixed with the international businesses leading the increase in this most recent quarter. I\u2019ll comment first on our top contributor, the Asia Pacific region and follow with comments on growth in Europe, Middle East, and Africa region, EMEA and then discuss progress with our actions to improve results in the Americas region. ","In the Asia Pacific region, the incremental impact of WAPC drove much of the growth along with the underlying increases in China. For WAPC, it's been one year since we completed this acquisition, and we are extremely pleased with the results. The integration has been smooth and both sales and profits are exceeding our targets for this business. We are just in the early innings of gaining sales synergies between our WAPC bouillon products in Central China and McCormick branded products along the coastal regions. ","Our base consumer business in China also achieved double-digit growth this period continuing the momentum from previous quarters. We\u2019ve achieved great distribution and consumer acceptance for our new 13 spice blend and our squeeze pouch ketchup. Ketchup is a leading retail item for us in China, and sales of the squeeze pouch are outpacing sales of our bottled ketchup and largely incremental to the category. With this rate of growth and strong performance, China is on track to be our second largest country this year in terms of annual sales when both consumer and industrial businesses are included. ","Our sales performance in EMEA was a positive with a 7% increase. In local currency, sales rose 2% driven by pricing actions. Our volume and product mix were down this period with some initial reaction of the price increase. We are also operating in some difficult retail environments such as United Kingdom. In these markets, our brand support and product innovation are vital to driving sales. We launched a number of new products in the first half and are supporting these with incremental brand marketing, driving awareness and trial. We are encouraged by the initial response to a number of these items including flavor shots. ","Looking ahead to the second half, our team in EMEA has additional products poised for launch that include Vahine dessert items, Kamis Seasonings and Ducros recipe mixes. ","On slide six, we show two Schwartz brand items that we\u2019ll introduce to UK consumers; a no mess grinder refill pouch and a line of Freshlock herbs. This Freshlock range extends to the UK a proven product in France that answers the consumer demand for freshness with a vacuum-sealed package. ","Let\u2019s turn next to our consumer business in the Americas. In local currency, second quarter sales in this region declined 4%. This decline compared to a strong year-on-year sales increase in local currency of 6% in the second quarter of 2013. As we\u2019ve discussed, we are addressing some competitive inroads which began to impact our U.S. business in 2013. In this latest period, we had continued pressure from some smaller brands in the market place largely focused on certain product groups within our spices and seasoning category, and while our category share was down, the percentage decline was less than it was in late 2013. ","We're taking aggressive actions to strengthen our brand equity and to win at retail. These actions are building as we progress through 2014, and we recognize it will take more than one or two quarters before these actions gain traction and help return to growth in this market. But we would like to see more rapid results. We're making steady progress in building brand equity. We introduced a number of new products in the first half that included Grill Mates Steakhouse burger seasonings, value-sized grinders, and Lawry's Oven Fry Mixes. ","Distribution targets have been met and we're pleased with the initial consumption data. We increased brand marketing support in the first half with spice superiority and product quality messages and completed the redesign of our Grill Mates website for this summer's grilling season. Our latest ROI metric saw positive returns in TV, print, PR and digital. This gives us confidence in the efficacy of additional investments that we're making in 2014 to build brand equity. Our new products and brand marketing have led to recent share gains in the recipe mix category.","We also had good growth with our Hispanic items and Kitchen Basics brand this quarter. As for winning at retail we've completed the realignment of our sales organization. We\u2019re using insights and analytics to set a gold standard for organizing the retail spice set. And we're having a more strategic dialogue with our customers on category management. Spice and seasonings is one of the most profitable categories for the retailer and these customers want to get it right. We're being aggressive, not only sharing our category management story but demonstrating our superior quality.","Through the first half these conversations have led to some early wins that include better alignment of retail pricing between private label, McCormick brand and competitive brands. In addition we've gained new distribution for Lawry\u2019s and Simply Asia food brands and won a supply of private label from a competitor.","So with the progress underway what should you expect from our Americas consumer business in the second half. First, greater brand support; in the U.S. we're planning an increase of at least $10 million in 2014. Through the first half the increase has only been $3 million. In second half we plan to direct our incremental support toward everyday cooking, new holiday advertising, superiority and quality messages and the launch of FlavorPrint, our personalized recipe engine. ","We have a number of new products entering the marketplace. Our greatest emphasis will be on two of these. The first is gluten-free recipe mixes which had an accelerated launch this past April. And second McCormick's skillet sauces and flavors like [Tahita] with roasted chili, garlic and lime. These flavors leverage mainstream family favorites with a bit of a twist. Both the Gluten free items and skillet sauces are designed to build upon our momentum in the recipe mix category. We're already gaining good retail acceptance of these new products and anticipate strong consumer trial and repeat purchases.","Again improved results for our consumer business in the Americas are going to take some time but we've had initial progress with the actions that we have underway. ","I will turn next to an update on our industrial business. We're pleased with our second quarter results for the industrial business, particularly the significant increase in operating income and operating income margin. We recognize that this performance compares to a year-on-year profit decline in the second quarter of 2013. However, if we look back two years to the second quarter of 2013 industrial operating income is up 10% and the operating income margin at 8.6% in the latest quarter is up 70 basis points from two years ago; as with the consumer business the performance varied by region. ","In the Americas we grew sales of branded food service products while sales to other food manufacturers were stable and sales weakness continued with quick service restaurants. The net income was a decline of 1% in local currency. Heading into the second half we're encouraged by our innovation pipeline which is more robust than a year ago. Customers continue to place an emphasis on health and wellness in their innovation with our foundation in herbs and spices we believe McCormick is well positioned. 2014 is on track to be another excellent year for our industrial business in EMEA, excluding any currency impact with a strong 4% sales growth this quarter driven by expanded distribution, new products, particularly with quick service restaurants. ","The improvement in industrial sales in China continued this quarter with an 18% increase in local currency. This growth rate compares to weak demand from quick service restaurants in the first quarter of 2013 that related to concerns about avian flu and poultry menu items. Across all three regions we're encouraged by our industrial business outlook for the second half and believe that we will deliver strong sales and profit growth in 2014. To summarize across all of our businesses, our financial results through the first half have us well on our way toward meeting our 2014 objectives. ","We've increased confidence in our financial outlook for the year and we're encouraged by the longer term prospects for growth at McCormick. We believe that we are well positioned with leading positions in growing markets, a breadth products, value priced to premium, flavors for all types of eating occasions, market leading customers and an expanding geographic presence.","We are increasingly focused on the alignment of our corporate social responsibility efforts with our business objectives and strategy, recognizing that these efforts are tied to our business success. In the latest Newsweek green ranking McCormick was listed in the top 10 along the 500 U.S. companies included in this assessment of corporate sustainability and environmental performance. We're proud of this recognition and are pursuing opportunities for further improvement. ","Across the company we're bringing focus, setting priorities and directing our resources based on McCormick's strategic imperatives with a focus on people, growth and performance. Together we believe that these imperatives will drive our success and lead to greater value for McCormick shareholders. Gordon? ","Gordon M. Stetz","","Thanks Alan and good morning everyone. As Alan has described our second quarter financial results included solid sales growth in many parts of the business, greater than expected earnings per share driven by our growth strategies along with a favorable tax rate and share repurchases activity and excellent cash flow. I'll begin with a closer look at sales and operating income for each segment. ","Let\u2019s start with the consumer business. As seen on slide 12 we grew consumer business sales 4% in local currency. In the second quarter of 2014 sales from WAPC accounted for six percentage points of the increase and higher pricing contributed three percentage points. These were offset in part by a 5% decline in volume and product mix. In local currency this compares to a 5% year-on-year increase in the second quarter of 2013 which had no impact from acquisitions. In the Americas region sales were down 4% from the year-ago period in local currency, a 2% increase in pricing, following a late 2013 pricing action was offset by lower volume and product mix.","In comparison consumer sales in this region rose 5% year-over-year in the second quarter of 2013 from the second quarter of 2012, an increase mainly attributable to higher volume as product mix. As Alan described competitive inroads have affected our U.S. consumer business and we have actions underway to drive performance.","Along with early indications of improvement the category growth remains healthy for spices and seasonings and recipe mixes based on the latest consumption data. To a lesser extent we had some second quarter impact from a later start to the grilling season and the timing of our trade promotion activity which will be more skewed toward the second half. ","In Europe, the Middle East and Africa, EMEA we grew consumer sales 2% in local currency as a result of higher pricing. Volume and product mix declined this quarter due in part to the pricing actions and the difficult retail environment in markets like the UK. In the preceding quarters we had better results from this region and have continued to invest in brand marketing and product innovation to drive sales of our brands.","We expect to see improved performance with these initiatives and as consumers adjust to higher pricing. In local currency consumer business sales in the Asia Pacific region rose 76%. The addition of WAPC accounted for 70 percentage points of growth. We grew sales of the base business 6% and China led this growth with a 23% sales increase mainly from new products and expanded distribution. ","For the Kohinoor brand in India sales rose slightly in local currency with significantly higher pricing offset by lower volume and product mix in the second quarter. Operating income was $86 million for the consumer business down 3% year on year. Higher brand marketing support and an unfavorable business mix reduced operating income this period, offset in part by the favorable impact of higher sales and CCI cost savings. We also had a favorable comparison in the year-ago period, the $4 million of transaction costs related to the acquisition of WAPC that were reported in the second quarter of 2013. ","Turning to our industrial business, we grew second quarter sales by 3% in local currency due to both pricing and higher volume and product mix as seen on slide 17. In the Americas region industrial sales declined 1% in local currency. Demand from quick service restaurants remained weak in this market through the second quarter. We continue to work with our customers to draw restaurant traffic by developing flavors for new menu items. For the second quarter branded food service sales rose and sales to food manufacturers were relatively even with the year ago period. ","In EMEA our industrial business achieved another quarter of strong sales growth with a 12% increase in local currency. This follows a similar growth rate in the first quarter of 2014, reflecting continued success with product innovation and distribution gains, largely with quick service restaurants as well as higher pricing in response to material cost increases.","In the second quarter of 2014 we grew industrial business sales in the Asia Pacific region by 10% in local currency. This is also the same rate of growth we had in the first quarter of 2014. Volume and product mix in China continues to improve as this market recovers from the sharp year ago decline as Alan described. Operating income for the industrial business rose 26% to $36 million resulting from higher sales, increased margins within the product portfolio and CCI cost savings. While we had difficult results in the year-ago period and a bit of an easy comparison this year we are pleased with our profit growth and the margin expansion driven by our growth strategy.","For the total company operating income rose 5% as a result of higher sales, improved industrial business product margins and our CCI cost savings. These same factors also improved gross profit margin by 60 basis points. And during the quarter we funded additional brand marketing programs with more investments plans in the upcoming quarters. ","The tax rate this period was favorable at 28.5% compared to 29.6% in the year ago period. The tax rate that we now expect for the fiscal year is approximately 29.5%. This is below our initial estimate for 2014 of 30% to 31% and reflects our latest projections for a mix of business across tax jurisdictions for the fiscal year.","Income from unconsolidated operations was up slightly with strong performance from our joint venture in Mexico. We reported earnings per share of $0.64. This was an 8% increase from $0.59 in the year ago period and driven by higher operating income, the lower tax rate and lower shares outstanding. ","Let\u2019s turn next to some highlights for cash flow and the quarter-end balance sheet as summarized on slide 26. Cash flow from operations was a $182 million through the first half, up $49 million from the first half of 2013. This improvement included a lower pension contribution in 2014. During this period we used a $126 million of cash to repurchase one million shares and at quarter end we had $234 million still available on our $400 million authorization. Our balance sheet remains sound and we are close to your target debt level and well positioned to fund investments to drive growth including future acquisitions. ","Turning to our 2014 outlook we are reaffirming our projections for sales growth, operating income and earnings per share. At the top line we still expect to deliver 3% to 5% sales growth on a currency neutral basis, driven by increased volume, higher pricing and in the first half the incremental impact of WAPC. As we have indicated we reached our first year anniversary for this acquisition at the end of May. We continue to expect currency to reduce sales by approximately one percentage point in 2014 based on prevailing exchange rates.","We reaffirm our outlook for growth of 6% to 8% in operating income when compared to $591 million of adjusted operating income in 2013. This projection includes the benefit of CCI cost savings that are expected to reach at least $45 million for 2014, and an increase in brand marketing support of at least $25 million. And we are reaffirming our earnings per share projection of $3.22 to $3.29. With the reduction in our tax rate projection to approximately 29.5% we have greater confidence in reaching the upper end of this range in 2014. Even at 29.5% the expected 2014 rate is still an increase from the 2013 rate of 26.75%.","On slide 28 we show the impact of this tax rate variance and $0.01 in special charges on our EPS growth rate. Together these variances have an unfavorable impact of four percentage points on the 2014 projected EPS growth rate. ","With our first half results we are on our way towards another year of strong cash flow. As many of you know we adhere to a balanced use of cash and are committed to returning a significant portion to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. In 2014 we expect to use nearly $200 million of cash for dividend and through share repurchases to reduce our shares outstanding by 1% to 2% this year.","As I conclude my comments we are confident in our ability to deliver on our 2014 financial objectives and look forward to reporting on our progress in the upcoming quarters. And now let's turn to your questions after which Alan will provide some closing remarks. Operator, we are ready for the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions). Thank you. Our first question is from the line of Ken Goldman with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Ken Goldman - JPMorgan","Hi, thanks for the question. Alan your Nielsen numbers, they showed a decline but not to the degree you reported domestically. So I guess I am curious if you could help us understand that disparity a bit. Gordon touched on a later grilling season, so I am curious if it was a shipment timing issue or may be channel issue or non-measured, maybe doing a little bit less impressively than measured, I am just trying to, I guess, understand that dynamic a bit better?","Alan D. Wilson","It's pretty hard to calibrate all the different sources of information. We use IRI and we have a custom database, so from our outlook I'll talk more generally without trying to get into specifics of the data as to what's happening. From our view, what we saw was less of a decline in share than we saw in the fourth quarter of last year.","Partly, we think that some of our efforts at retail are starting to have an impact. It's going to be -- it's going to take some time, and we expect that we will win. But in terms of getting to the data specifics, it's really hard for us to get. There was a later start to the grilling season. The weather was not favorable for grilling. We're expecting a pretty good grilling season as we go through the summer, and we're planning to extend it through the third quarter and even through Labor Day and to tailgate season, so we're pretty encouraged.","Most of our new products are going to hit in the second half of the year, and we're pretty excited about those as well. ","Ken Goldman - JPMorgan","Thank you. And then if I can ask one more, Gordon we're seeing a good number of packaged food companies thinking about rationalizing production and overhead in the U.S., even mills right, which has an ongoing cost savings program just like yours, I think is going this route. So curious if you guy are considering going down this road or if are you comfortable with your cost structure I guess at the moment?","Gordon M. Stetz","Well, you always need to challenge yourself to be competitive, and that\u2019s the whole nature of the CCI environment, and the idea behind the program, as you know Ken, when we developed it a few years ago was to keep looking at those opportunities on a go forward basis, and you can never stop. I will calibrate it a bit though in that if you recall a few years ago in the North American businesses in particular, we did some significant rationalization, particularly in the consumer side where we did reduce a number of plants , and so therefore our footprint is pretty consolidated here at the U.S. in our consumer business.","In the industrial side, our plants tend to be more specialized for customer service needs, and having said that, we constantly look at our network and the best way to organize ourselves. So we still look for these opportunities all the time. ","Alan D. Wilson","And we have adjusted our SG&A and headcount for the volumes that we\u2019ve seen in -- both in manufacturing as well as in our headquarters. ","Ken Goldman - JPMorgan","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Alexia Howard of Sanford Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.","Alexia Howard - Sanford Bernstein","","Good morning everyone. Can I just ask for a little bit more granularity on the share losses? Could you remind us, is it concentrated in a particular region with a particular type of retailer? Is it private label you are losing shares to or value brands or premium brands? And do you know which consumer segments you are losing share to, is it a Hispanic group, is it millennial consumers, or older consumers? Just a little bit more detail on how you are seeing the development of about share changes? Thank you.","Alan D. Wilson","Yeah, it has changed a bit in the more recent periods. Private label is more flat. Most of the -- we have one larger branded competitor and that competitor is relatively flat. And so what we are seeing is very small inroads from a number of small and regional competitors that are gaining one-tenth of a share point or two-tenths of a share point. Their overall share base is still less than 1% or 2%, I think as I looked at the most recent period, and of the ten brands that gained share, no one other than McCormick, by the way, our core A to Z actually gained a slight bit in the most recent period, but nobody had more than 2% share in all that. ","So it's pretty -- what\u2019s happening is the consumer and the retailers are pretty fragmented and some of that\u2019s from the value end, some of that\u2019s from the premium end. We compete across both of those segments. And so we\u2019ve got different tactics that we are using to compete with the super-premium, and in some cases even bag spices that are finding their way into measured markets, and then on the premium end with what we are doing with our innovation. ","Alexia Howard - Sanford Bernstein","Great, thank you very much. I\u2019ll pass it on. ","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Robert Moskow of Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. ","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse","Hi, thank you. Hey Gordon, I was trying to reconcile the guidance with the operating income being up 6% to 8%, the tax rate down, share count down, we are getting a number that seems to go beyond the high end of your range for EPS at $3.29. I just want to make sure I am doing this right. So is the 6% to 8%, is there -- are we supposed to reduce that for currency or is that 6% to 8% absorbing the currency?","Gordon M. Stetz","It's getting pressure from currency, I\u2019d say that. But I don\u2019t want to be more specific than that. Obviously currency is going to put some pressure on that number. The other thing on the operating income line, as you heard Allen talk about is, we are supporting our business in the back half of the year. We\u2019ve spent year-to-date $11 million in advertising promotion, and we\u2019ve said at least $25 million in the back half. So that\u2019s going to be a factor impacting those numbers as well. ","And then just to help calibrate the tax rate, that tax rate un-favorability as you know is very much weighted towards the back half of the year. So that\u2019s also -- something else needs to be factored in, because that all starts to occur, I think our last year\u2019s rate for the second half was a little north of 25%, and at 29.5% that\u2019s quite a drag on the EPS in the back half of the year.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse","Okay, Gordon I get that, but just to be more clear, your sales guidance is in constant currency. So I know what to do with that and you have a 1% hit for ForEx on the top line. Is it also a 1% hit on the operating income line, does is it flow through and is it 6% to 8% ex-currency or not?","Gordon M. Stetz","The 6% to 8% is not ex-currency, that's all in. So it would reflect whatever pressure that currency drops through to the bottom line. And generally it's not a one for one relationship but there is certainly a negative hit on that 6% to 8% from currency.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse","All right, I got it now. So last question, in fourth quarter that's your biggest quarter, especially in the U.S. for seasonal reasons. Are your market share -- do you expect your market share to be down again in fourth quarter in the U.S. Alan or are you going to have lapsed those market share losses by that time, and if we can expect kind of a normal growth pattern for fourth quarter?","Gordon M. Stetz","We expect to stabilize and start to grow our share but certainly in the fourth quarter we think we will lapped the impact in share from last year. ","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse","Okay. So you expect like a pretty good seasonal time period this year. Have gotten initial sell-in already for how much inventory your customers are looking at for the seasons?","Gordon M. Stetz","Yeah we're selling in right now. The display programs are the easy things for us to track. The turn orders are a little more difficult but we're encouraged by what we're seeing with our holiday sale-in at this point. ","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse","Great, thank you. ","Operator","Our next question is from the line of David Driscoll of Citigroup. Please proceed with your question. ","David Driscoll - Citigroup ","Great, thank you and good morning. ","Gordon M. Stetz","Good morning Dave.","David Driscoll - Citigroup ","Want to go back to the question that Rob was asking a moment ago about the guidance. I am going to try it differently though. So if all the numbers are unchanged, except we have a nice lower tax rate, 100 basis points of tax if I go from the midpoint of what the prior range was to the new one, that\u2019s worth like a nickel. ","So the other observation is that the segment results are coming in especially this quarter weaker than what we had modeled. So is it fair to say that within this range of operating income of 6% to 8% that you are now towards the lower end of this and then the tax comes in to give you the confidence to reiterate the range. Is that a correct way to look at these pieces of guidance? ","Gordon M. Stetz","It's certainly from the operating results from the quarter we had puts and takes. We had the strong growth in the international markets and then we had obviously the U.S. consumer results that you saw as we reported. It's too early for us to be that specific. I think all we are saying at this stage is really that we acknowledge that the tax rate is more favorable so that gives us more confidence in the upper end of the range. ","As we progress through the year, I think our statements around that operating income range we firm those up as we see the traction in the U.S. consumer business and how the programs are playing out as we progress through the year.","David Driscoll - Citigroup ","All right. I guess I was hoping that you might give me confidence that you actually can hit the upper end of that operating income because of course the second quarter numbers would may be give most people the opposite impression given the declining consumer, I mean which is obviously very concerning. ","Gordon M. Stetz","While we certainly are encouraged as you heard in Alan's comments, by all the programs and activities that we have lined up for the back half of the year. So I don't want to convey that we don't believe we're able to certainly return to a growth mode in that business. But at the same time as you know the third and fourth quarter start to be the biggest parts of our year.","So we just have to see how it plays out for the rest of the year.","David Driscoll - Citigroup ","Okay. Last question just on the tax rate. This is a little specific so apologies for it but it's important, the lower tax rate is it a function of specific discrete benefits or would you describe this as more of a mix issue because obviously when you have the U.S. business under performing it fundamentally has a mix effect on the tax rate. But I would like to understand the difference between the discrete benefits and the mix issue? ","Gordon M. Stetz","Yeah there is some minor discrete benefits and by the vast majority of the adjustments reflects the mix of the geographies across tax jurisdictions. ","David Driscoll - Citigroup ","Okay, thank you. ","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Jonathan Feeney with Athlos Research. Please proceed with your question. ","Jonathan Feeney - Athlos Research","Good morning, thank you very much. ","Gordon M. Stetz","Good morning Jon, how are you? ","Jonathan Feeney - Athlos Research","A couple of questions. First on WAPC benefits, as you lap the closing the transaction, May 31, do you anticipate still getting kind of desk distribution benefits and then as we go forward will that be reported -- won\u2019t be reported separately but is that going to lift the same store results, I guess of the business? Is WAPC growing on a same-store basis right now?","Alan D. Wilson","Yeah WAPC is growing on a same-store basis and we do expect that to continue. It's continuing to expand both geographically and in penetration. And the other thing that we are working and starting to do is to develop some synergies between our core selling force from the coastal region where they sell more of the WAPC items, and the WAPC sales force which will sell more of the McCormick items in the central region. So we are encouraged by the growth rate there and pretty bullish on that business. ","Jonathan Feeney - Athlos Research","Thanks Alan. And one other thing I want to follow up on you had a comment in your prepared remarks about being pleased with the ROI you are getting on the ad spending and media spending you are doing in the, I think that was a U.S. market you are referring to. Could you give us more clarity on how you measure that? And if you are getting positive ROIs does that mean we\u2019ll see more of spending in the U.S. market to sort of turn things around second half of the year?","Alan D. Wilson","Yeah, and that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019ve said as well. The way we measure that is with the classic marketing mix and we are looking at the impact on that marketing in the short term. Where we are spending our money is about half in TV half in digital and PR and so we are encouraged by what we are seeing. What you\u2019ll see in the back half is additional support for our big programs like holiday, fall cooking and also some digital initiatives that will help to drive some of our new product sales. ","Jonathan Feeney - Athlos Research","Great, thank you very much. ","Alan D. Wilson","Thanks, Jon.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. ","Andrew Lazar - Barclays","Good morning everyone. Thanks for the question. Alan you talked about the market share losses in the quarter, spice and seasoning business not being as significant as they were compared to the fourth quarter. And how did they compare I guess sequentially versus the first quarter? Because I think as of the last conference call you certainly sound relatively optimistic tone at least from an early days preliminary perspective on the reaction to some of the things you are trying to do in the market place. And in this call obviously suggesting making progress but of course still have a ways to go. So I am trying to get a sense of anything has changed from the first quarter? And if so what led to that?","Alan D. Wilson","No, I wouldn\u2019t say that anything has changed from the first quarter this year. Results are pretty similar. I will say if there is anything there is a little bit of optimism because we grew share in recipe mixes and have started to see some growth there. But I wouldn\u2019t say that there is a dramatic change from the first quarter.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays","Okay, and then in terms of seasonal selling and such, I guess the last year or two I may have it wrong, you sort of pushed forward or pulled forward the time frame in which you will sell in a lot of seasonable displays because you found that the sooner those kind of get in store the more folks are charged up around the seasons and end up coming back and such. Is that a program that you are staying with around the timing and for those reasons, or has it already changed based on last year or so?","Alan D. Wilson","Yeah we still have the holiday program which we\u2019ve had for, I think about eight or nine years now which is to get the specific displays in the store it is early as possible. Obviously year-on-year we have a lot of fluctuation based on the timing that some specific large customers take their holiday shipments. Sometimes they will be in the third quarter sometimes they\u2019ll be in the fourth, last year because it was also combined with the price increase we had a fairly heavy buy in on that and saw the impact in the third quarter and then the resulting hang over in the fourth. ","But we're still offering that program. We don\u2019t think it will be as significant this year as it were last year when we are having a price increase.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays","Got it, right in terms of the shift between quarters.","Alan D. Wilson","Yeah. We expected to be and this year actually does look like more of a normalized pattern and we are seeing some of that with our shipments in the second quarter versus the third that are going to be close into consumption. ","Andrew Lazar - Barclays","Thanks and very last thing. This updated sort of ideal shelf set, gold standard shelf set, are there certain -- what are the certain timeframes in which your sales team is able to sort of get this sold in and more importantly that those shells would get reset, either there are certain one or two time frames through the course of your fiscal year where you can really expect once they are sold in for them to start actually happening in store? ","Alan D. Wilson","Yeah most customers have their own timing. So it's not a there is not a specific time across the country where that happens. Some customers reset generally most customers who want to reset prior to the fall specifically in our category. But we're cutting in new items in January and we're cutting in new items in June. So it's hard to say that this is specific time for that. But where we are, and we're seeing progress in helping customers understand that this is a very, very profitable category for them that our interests are really aligned and the more they sell premium branded products the higher the level of their profit. And we bring consumers to be the shelf and that's the thing that we are working with them on it. ","Andrew Lazar - Barclays","Thanks very much. ","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Eric Katzman of Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. ","Eric Katzman - Deutsche Bank","Hi, good morning. ","Alan D. Wilson","Good morning Eric. ","Eric Katzman - Deutsche Bank","I have two questions first top line related to focus on EMEA for a second, is it -- I mean it sounds like the industrial side of things continues to go well there but it almost sounds like from your comments around the UK which is such an important market for you that things have gotten a little bit worse? Is that accurate and if so kind of what are the plans to try to improve the UK? ","Alan D. Wilson","Yeah the UK market is specifically tough market. There has been a lot of press on the large customers there and some of their challenge is specific to what we're doing in our business. It's very similar to what we're doing in the U.S. with new products and with supporting our brands with advertising.","In the short term what we saw was a fair amount of competitive activity and a recipe mix category in the UK we're responding pretty aggressively with our own promotional plans. ","Eric Katzman - Deutsche Bank","All right and then to kind of switch over, I think you've been calling for somewhat inflationary trends in your -- input cost base for a bit but can you update us on that, is there any more concern? It seems like there is just generally a little more inflation than everybody expected. And then related to that you took the price increase last fall I think in retrospect you said may be it wasn't the right thing to do or the right time. And given all the competition even with input cost pressure are you unlikely to take pricing on the consumer side going into '15?","Alan D. Wilson","Yeah we're not anticipating any near term pricing, any new near term pricing in our consumer business at this point. We may have some adjustments in our industrial business to reflect changes in commodity costs but we're not anticipating near term that we will be doing that. There is some upward cost inflation specifically in commodities like pepper and vanilla and we're working with our CCI programs to help to try to offset those. Obviously if it gets excessive then we'll readjust our thinking. But certainly we're not anticipating anything before the end of 2014. ","Eric Katzman - Deutsche Bank","Okay and Gordon just remind me what inflation level are you assuming for the year again? ","Gordon M. Stetz","We said it was in the low single digits, 2% to 3%. ","Eric Katzman - Deutsche Bank","Okay. I'll pass on, thank you.","Alan D. Wilson","Thanks Eric. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Akshay Jagdale with KeyBanc. Please proceed with your question.","Akshay Jagdale - KeyBanc","Good morning. ","Alan D. Wilson","Good morning Akshay. ","Akshay Jagdale - KeyBanc","So couple of questions just on the end demand and what you see as it relates to your consumer business, because I think you get some good read through on what's happening with packaged food customers and then QSR. So the first question in the U.S. could you talk a little bit about the innovation pipeline for your packaged food customers as you see it? I think a little bit ago you had said that you\u2019re pretty optimistic about that high price and it doesn\u2019t seem to have played through. So perhaps you could just give us your perspective on what\u2019s happened there with the little bit of history as to why it hasn\u2019t played through if I am correct about that. ","And then the second question is on the state of demand or state of things in the QSR segment in China if you can help us to understand from your perspective where we are relative to all the issues that have taken place from a food security perspective. So those are my two questions. Thank you. ","Alan D. Wilson","Yeah, sure. On U.S. foods we are seeing a bit of a mix with our customer base. Our snack customers are continuing to do pretty well and continuing to innovate and we\u2019re seeing that reflected. Our packaged food customers are struggling with core volume and part of the way that they are trying to overcome that is with new product innovation that we are working with them on. Now so what we have was packaged foods or with our consumer food manufacturer customers so far in the U.S. at least is relatively flat; snack are -- co-processed foods, kind of down a little bit and new product not quite offsetting those. ","We have a stronger innovation pipeline this year than we had at this time last year. So we continue to have a good outlook on that obviously as customers adjust their thinking and focus more on promotional spending or on driving different core products, they may change that. Our innovation pipeline is stronger this year than last year in our U.S. business. ","In China what we are seeing is a recovery in QSR, driven I think a lot by our customers having an increased frequency promotions and limited time offers to bring consumers back to the stores. They\u2019ve historically been pretty resilient and they are obviously up again some weaker comparisons from last year.","But we are encouraged by what we are seeing with both new product activity in China as well as the increased food traffic that they are getting to the stores and we are seeing a renewed confidence in new store openings there as well. So we are optimistic on the outlook there. ","Akshay Jagdale - KeyBanc","And just on India if I can. So can you I know it a smallish percentage of your overall business but it\u2019s one of those rare things where you acquire business and it doesn\u2019t grow as well as you plan. So can you just give us a sense of where we are in that process? And if and when the distribution gains will again start to take effect because the way I understand what\u2019s going on is - you have bought the business, there\u2019s has been some obviously commodity related inflation that you are passing on and you don\u2019t have -- or your distribution gains have sort of paused for now and then you\u2019re also recalibrating your product mix right. I mean the whole idea there is to do recipe mixes and other things such as that under the McCormick brand using this distribution. ","So just give us a longer term sort of where are we in the journey with this acquisition and your expectations there?","Alan D. Wilson","Yeah we think India is certainly a longer term play. We\u2019ve made good progress in stabilizing our supply chain and continuing to drive distribution, obviously the significant inflation we\u2019ve seen in the price of Basmati rice has impacted our volumes there. We\u2019ve again taken the philosophy that we generally take in a market like this that we pay as we go. So as the business earns its ability to invest then we\u2019ll make the investment. So we are focused now on driving profitability in the business and we\u2019ll -- and we are also introducing new products but more on driving the profitability of the business. We still believe as India develops in modern trade, as the infrastructure develops so that would be a very good market for us. It\u2019s taken a little more time than we anticipated as we went into it. ","Akshay Jagdale - KeyBanc","Perfect, thank you. I\u2019ll pass it on. ","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions). Our next question comes from the line of Chuck Cerankosky with Northcoast Research. Please go ahead with your question. ","Chuck Cerankosky - Northcoast Research","Good morning everyone.","Alan D. Wilson","Good morning. ","Chuck Cerankosky - Northcoast Research","In looking at your guidance you are talking about an incremental brand marketing spend of at least $25 million. Gordon did I hear you say $11 million of that increase was in the first half already? ","Gordon M. Stetz","That's correct.","Chuck Cerankosky - Northcoast Research","Okay, now does that $25 million include consumer promotion activity or is it strictly more what we would call advertising?","Gordon M. Stetz","The bulk of it is weighted more towards consumer facing advertising. Any traditional promotional around price et cetera would be between gross and net. So that's primarily that is -- that's not primarily -- that is consumer facing increases.","Chuck Cerankosky - Northcoast Research","So promotion expenditures would be in addition to it?"," ","Gordon M. Stetz","Yes, that would be in addition. ","Chuck Cerankosky - Northcoast Research","And how do you expect that to track this year, the promotion? ","Gordon M. Stetz","From a year-over-year basis not too differently but as you heard in my remarks and some of Alan's remarks some of it is weighted a bit more towards the back half of the year.","Chuck Cerankosky - Northcoast Research","All right, thank you. ","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Ken Goldman of JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question. ","Ken Goldman - JPMorgan","Hey, thanks for the follow up. I don\u2019t think anyone had asked this yet so forgive me if they had. But Alan you talked a little bit about working with customers to get price gap right between branded and private label. I am just curious whether this gap had grown to an unusually wide level and you are just sort of getting back to normal or whether the gap that historically existed may be didn't function as effectively as it used to right? So curious if it's going to narrow to a range that\u2019s smaller than usual or just sort of get back to normal and maybe I am not [inaudible], just curious how you think about that? ","Alan D. Wilson","That\u2019s actually a really good question. The gap itself hasn't changed that much. I mean it does over periods where we tend to lead with pricing and private label takes a little bit longer to catch up and as do our competitors. So we tend to see a three to six months gap in that.","The impact that we're dealing with right now is more where some customers have chosen to take price threshold movement, not necessarily a percentage gap but more price threshold. So for instance they may have crossed from 297 to 309 which is a more significant impact for customers. So we're working to also get price points right so that we maximize the volume and the profit for the customers. ","The percentage gaps haven't changed that much over the last seven years. They do from time to time but not -- it's not anymore significant. In fact what we've seen in the most recent periods is a little more aggressive pricing on private labels than we've seen on the brand. So by aggressive I mean the price gaps had narrowed a little more. ","Ken Goldman - JPMorgan","Great, thanks very much. ","Alan D. Wilson","Thanks, Ken. ","Operator","Thank you. I will now turn the call back to Alan Wilson for closing remarks. ","Alan D. Wilson","All right. Thank everyone for your questions and for participating in today's call.

This is Joyce Brooks, McCormick's Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you for joining today's call to review our company's first quarter financial results and 2012 outlook. We have posted a set of slides to accompany today's call at our website, ir.mccormick.com. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, the conference is being recorded. ","Joining us for today's call are Alan Wilson, Chairman, President and CEO; Gordon Stetz, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Mike Smith, Vice President, Treasury and Investor Relations. Alan is going to share some highlights from the first quarter of 2012 and how we are effectively adapting to the current business environment. Gordon will provide a review of our first quarter financial performance and discuss our 2012 financial guidance. After that, we look forward to discussing your questions and some closing remarks from Alan.

","As a reminder, today's presentation contains projections and other forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those projected. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or other factors. As seen on Slide 2, our forward-looking statement also provides information on risk factors that could affect our financial results.","It's now my pleasure to turn the discussion over to Alan.","Alan D. Wilson","Thanks, Joyce. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. McCormick's financial results for the first quarter demonstrated the effectiveness of our strategy and growth initiatives. We grew net sales 16% with double-digit increases in both our consumer and industrial businesses. Over half of the increase was driven by very strong underlying sales growth, augmented by sales from acquisitions completed in 2011. We are particularly pleased with this performance given the current environment where consumers are confronted with a tough economy and higher prices.","Our portfolio of businesses, united by our Passion for Flavor, is a real advantage in this environment. Across our consumer and industrial business, we're delivering flavor, regardless of whether consumers are cooking at home or eating out. For consumers eating at home, we're meeting demand for great flavor, convenience and healthy eating with product innovation, meal ideas and brand marketing support. In our industrial business, our growth with quick service restaurants was a key driver of first quarter results. These customers are expanding globally and, in this economy, are seeing increased demand based on their competitively priced menu. ","A further balance exists across our 3 regions and with our leading shares in a number of developed markets, along with an increased percentage of sales in emerging markets. We have illustrated on Slide 4 the distribution of our first quarter sales across a number of emerging markets, where we are participating in strong sales growth. Including acquisitions, our sales in emerging markets were up 73% in the first quarter versus the year ago period. As a reminder, we also participate in emerging markets through our unconsolidated operations around the world.","The rate of sales growth in the first quarter was ahead of our expectations, which led to an earnings per share result at $0.55 that was just above the guidance range we provided in our January earnings call. However, this bottom line result was below earnings per share of $0.57 that we achieved in the first quarter of 2011. As you recall, we anticipated a significant impact from year-over-year material cost inflation in the first quarter, which is expected to gradually improve in the next 3 quarters. Likewise, we expected income from unconsolidated operations to get off to a slow start due to unfavorable currency exchange rates and higher material costs and then improve as we progressed through the year. As we look ahead to the next 3 quarters, we are reaffirming the guidance provided in January, 9% to 11% sales growth in local currency and earnings per share of $3.01 to $3.06. ","While we will discuss our growth initiatives in more detail at our April Investor Conference, I want to provide a few updates today with a focus on our consumer business. But first, let me just comment that our industrial business had consistently strong results around the world this quarter. In local currency, we grew industrial sales in each region at a double-digit rate, and this is all organic growth without any acquisitions. Our profit growth was even more impressive, up more than 30% on top of a 12% increase in the first quarter of 2011. ","Let's turn now to our consumer business in the Americas. During the first quarter, sales in the U.S. have been an area of investor interest in the food industry due to weak December and January consumption data in many food categories for branded products and, in some cases, private label. McCormick was not completely immune from this weakness and our Americas consumer business was the one region that had a decline in volume and product mix in the first quarter due to lower sales of branded core items in the U.S. However, a number of our other product lines, Zatarain\u2019s, Hispanic items, economy products and our consumer business in Canada had solid sales growth this period.","While several factors may have adversely affected sales of our U.S. branded core items, we believe a leading factor was the initial consumer reaction to pricing taken during the preceding 12 months. The cumulative impact of these increases can be seen in our first quarter sales result for the consumer Americas business, which rose 7% from pricing. We also believe that a milder winter was another factor affecting sales of our core items this period, with reduced sales of recipe mixes for cold weather meals, things like chili and stews. In addition, the mild weather allowed people to get out to restaurants, and we saw the benefit of this in our industrial sales to the food service channel, which did pick up this period. ","While we regard the effects of weather as rather onetime in nature, we're taking steps to reinforce the value of our products with consumers mainly through the redirection of our promotional funds. As an example, we're partnering with retailers to generate incremental volume using a portion of trade promotion funds to reach attractive everyday price points on shelf for key items, such as Grinders and vanilla extract. Recognizing that consumers are shopping in more stores and across channels to get the best prices, we continue to expand our presence in the dollar channel. We recently increased the number of brand and private label spices and seasonings that we supply to one of the leading chains. ","The weak December and January have been followed by gradual improvement in sales of core items in February and March. This is a pattern that we've seen following past price actions, an initial reduction then gradual improvement. We're working to accelerate this improvement with our initiatives behind our marketing and promotional initiatives and further distribution gains across retail channels.","Moving to our consumer business in portions of Western Europe. We operate in a challenging retail environment with large sophisticated retailers. In addition, many consumers in this region face high unemployment rates and, as in the U.S., are confronted with food cost inflation. For a number of quarters in the past 3 years, we've reported a decline in volume and product mix for sales in the Europe, Middle East and Africa region, EMEA, largely due to weakness in the U.K. and smaller markets in Western Europe. However, in the second half of 2011, we began to get some traction from accelerated product innovation and incremental marketing programs. ","Our first quarter result with 3% growth is our third consecutive quarter with an increase in volume and product mix. In our 2 largest EMEA markets, the U.S. -- U.K. and France, 52-week consumption data for spices and seasonings shows unit sales of our brands outperformed private label. In the latest quarter, we achieved good consumer offtake due to new products and incremental brand marketing. In addition, we were able to convert the smallest store formats for our U.K. retailer to brand from private label, and we increased our focus on a range of value products now available in France. Our team in EMEA has been very effective, driving sales in Western Europe while working on the integration of Kamis and supporting the launch of our packaged spice and seasoning brands in Turkey.","Let's transition over to our consumer business in some key emerging markets before I turn it over to Gordon. The integration of Kamis has progressed well, and we're making plans for an SAP upgrade and a factory expansion in 2013. As I indicated last quarter, we've begun to partner with retailers to optimize the Kamis product assortment and merchandising. Increased advertising in the period, running up to Christmas, has led to record category share for the brand, and we're benefiting from new distribution in Russia. ","Moving to Turkey. Our McCormick-Yildiz joint venture first introduced a line of spices and seasonings co-branded Ulker and Ducros in July of 2011. The business ran its first flight of TV beginning in late December, along with outdoor advertising and a digital program on Facebook. As an aside, Turkey is the fourth largest country by Facebook membership. In less than 12 months, we've achieved a 10% unit share of the category in this market. ","In Asia, our consumer business in China had an outstanding quarter during this holiday period, the Chinese New Year, boosted by incremental brand marketing. Our marketing plan has generated strong growth and share gains in the urban spice category. In the second half of last year, we began to shift our emphasis to brand building in China and the early results are very positive. ","And in India, our Kohinoor business had a good quarter during a seasonally strong period tied to the new rice crop. We're implementing our innovation plan and expect to have new products ready to be launched through Kohinoor's extensive distribution network by the end of 2012. ","To summarize, we're operating in markets with a variety of challenges and opportunities. Regardless of the market, developed or emerging, consumers want flavor and McCormick is meeting that demand. Across our consumer and industrial business, we're bringing passion to flavor at home or eating out. In closing, I want to recognize our leadership team and employees throughout the company who are behind our success in driving results. ","Gordon is now going to discuss our first quarter financial results and latest 2012 guidance. Gordon?","Gordon M. Stetz","Thanks, Alan, and good morning, everyone. McCormick's first quarter results at the top and bottom line compared favorably to our initial outlook. The sales performance of our base business and acquisitions exceeded our expectations. And due to the leverage of higher sales and operating expenses, operating income was also ahead of our outlook for the quarter. ","Let's take a closer look at each of our 2 segments starting with our consumer business. As seen on Slide 11, we grew consumer business sales 18%. In a period of increased pricing, our volumes held up well, and we had a strong contribution from acquisition activity in the first quarter of 2012. ","In the Americas region, we grew consumer business sales 7%. As seen on Slide 12, sales from Kitchen Basics added 2% to growth, and the effect of currency was minimal. Pricing was up 7% this period with some incremental impact from a December 2010 price increase, as well as the pricing actions that went into effect in the fourth quarter of 2011.","As a reminder, we estimated the December 2010 pricing increase shifted about $10 million of sales from the first quarter of 2011 into the fourth quarter of 2010. In addition, we had the benefit of new product introductions, distribution gains and incremental brand marketing support. ","While we grew sales in Zatarain\u2019s, Hispanic items, economy products and our clubhouse brand in Canada, as Alan discussed, we believe higher pricing impacted sales of our core items in the U.S. In total, volume and product mix was down 1% compared to the year ago period.","In Europe, the Middle East and Africa, EMEA, we grew consumer sales 25% with a 26% increase in local currency. Our Kamis acquisition added 22% to sales this quarter. Against a weak year ago result, the sales increase in EMEA-based business was 4% in local currency and mainly due to favorable volume and product mix. ","We are pleased to see our initiatives behind new products and incremental advertising gaining traction this quarter, particularly in France where we grew unit sales of both our Ducros brand of spices and seasonings and Vahin\u00e9 home-made dessert items. We also achieved growth this period in smaller markets, including Spain, Portugal and the Netherlands, as well as through export into the Middle East and Africa. While sales in the U.K. were down in the first quarter, we are encouraged by improved consumption data for our Schwartz brand in the latest 12-week period. ","Consumer business sales in the Asia Pacific region more than doubled, and in local currency, were up 104% with Kohinoor in India contributing 83%. Excluding this impact, we grew first quarter sales 21% in local currency with increases in both pricing and volume and product mix. ","If you recall, this sequentially followed a sales decline in the Asia Pacific region-based business in the fourth quarter of 2011. This rebound was led by a 29% local currency sales increase in China, which, as Alan indicated, was driven by incremental brand marketing and strong sales during the Chinese New Year and in response to our brand marketing. Sales in Australia also improved this period, due in part to the growth of our Aeroplane brand, which has exceeded an 80% share of the gelatin category in that market.","As expected, first quarter operating income for our consumer business declined, ending the quarter at $81 million compared to $87 million in the year ago period. While we achieved strong sales growth and had the benefit of CCI cost savings, profit was unfavorably affected by significant year-over-year material cost increases. ","In addition, operating income reflected incremental marketing investments behind our brands. For the consumer business, brand marketing support was up $10 million in the first quarter, with increases in Zatarain\u2019s advertising, Hispanic holiday ads, support for new product launches like Recipe Inspirations in the U.K. and our brand building in China.","Let's turn to our Industrial business and start with a review of our sales performance. For this segment, we also grew sales at a double-digit rate. In local currency, the increase was an impressive 15%. About 2\/3 of the increase was in volume and product mix, followed by 1\/3 from pricing. In markets around the world, we are having particular success with new product wins and increased demand from leading quick service restaurants. ","On Slide 17, industrial sales in the Americas grew 15% in local currency, with 9% of the increase from volume and product mix and 6% from pricing. In this region, both the food service industry and food manufacturers contributed equally to top line growth. ","Within the food service industry, sales of customized products to quick-service restaurants continued to be strong, and we saw improved sales of our branded food service products sold mainly to broad line distributors. This was an indication of more people eating out during December and early in 2012. ","The increase in sales to food manufacturers was driven mainly by a number of new product wins, including seasoning blends for snack foods. During this period, we noted some weakness in demand for our products that flavor some core items of other food manufacturers.","Our first quarter industrial sales in EMEA continued a track record of strong growth. We grew sales 10% in local currency with an 8% increase in volume and product mix. Demand from quick-service restaurants remains robust, and we are meeting this demand with product supplied from our operations in the U.K., Turkey and South Africa. We also gained acceptance for some new branded food service items in the U.K., which begin to ship in the second quarter. ","In the Asia Pacific region, industrial business sales rose 27%, and in local currency, we grew sales 22%. Against a weak year ago result, the majority of growth was driven by a 19% increase in volume and product mix. This performance was broad-based, with higher sales in our largest market, China, as well as Australia and our industrial operations based in Singapore and Thailand. ","Our multinational customers continue to expand in this region. While our quarter-to-quarter sales growth tends to vary, over the long term we are benefiting not only from this expansion but from our success with innovation that in 2012 includes syrups, beverage flavors and sandwich sauces. ","Operating income for the industrial business rose 31% to $31 million as a result of excellent sales growth and CCI cost savings. Also, following a year ago program tied to our rollout of McCormick for Chefs in the U.S., marketing support for our branded food service items decreased $1 million. These factors led to improved operating income margin, which rose to 8.3% from 7.2% in the year ago period. ","For the total business, first quarter operating income rose 2% to $113 million. As indicated in our January call and guidance and depicted on Slide 22, we anticipated that the phasing of our 2012 year-over-year material cost inflation would have a greater impact in our first quarter then begin to improve in the second quarter. While we were able to offset higher costs with pricing and CCI cost savings in the first quarter, gross profit margin declined 270 basis points, which, in turn, limited our operating income growth.","The first quarter 2012 operating income result also reflected our $9 million increase in brand marketing support, although in total, selling, general and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales was down 100 basis points from the first quarter of 2011. With the debt related to our acquisitions, interest expense was up $1.3 million from a year ago and the tax rate came in at 30%, in line with both our 2012 guidance and the tax rate in the first quarter of 2011.","Sales of our unconsolidated operations rose 8% in the first quarter. However, as anticipated in our January outlook, income from unconsolidated operations was below the year ago period, lowering earnings per share by $0.02. The primary reason for this decrease was the impact of higher soybean oil costs and a weak Mexican peso on our joint venture in Mexico where mayonnaise is the leading product. We anticipate the phasing of year-over-year material cost inflation to ease for the McCormick de Mexico business in the second half of 2012, and for the full year, we continue to expect income from unconsolidated operations to decline slightly from 2011. ","At the bottom line, as shown on Slide 24, earnings per share was $0.55 compared to $0.57 in the prior year period. A $0.01 increase from operating income was offset by a $0.02 reduction in income from unconsolidated operations and a $0.01 reduction from higher interest expense. ","Let's turn next to our cash flow and February 29 balance sheet. As a reminder, cash flow is strongest in the second half of our fiscal year due to seasonality of the business. In the first quarter of 2012, cash flow from operations was a positive $23 million compared to a negative $23 million in the first quarter of 2011. The improvement was mainly due to a lower increase in inventory in the most recent quarter. It also included the unfavorable impact of a $21 million increase in pension plan contributions in the first quarter of 2012. ","During the first quarter, we resumed our share repurchase activity and used $42 million of cash to repurchase 835,000 shares. At quarter end, we had $227 million left on our $400 million authorization. ","Our balance sheet remains solid although our inventory levels continue to be elevated. As in the preceding quarters, this higher inventory related to several factors. The majority of the increase was attributed about evenly to higher material costs and strategic positions that we've taken for certain spices and herbs. The remaining increase related to our acquisitions. ","While we anticipate further material cost inflation this year, we expect inventory to level off and begin to decline as we work down a portion of our strategic inventory. In addition, we have made some initial progress with our new inventory management processes in North America, which will eventually be expanded to other regions. ","Let's turn to our 2012 guidance on Slide 26. Based on our latest outlook, we reaffirm our top line projection of 9% to 11% sales growth in local currency. Based on prevailing foreign currency rates, we estimate an unfavorable currency impact of 2% for the year. ","We had very strong sales growth in the first quarter and nearly half of the increase came from our 2011 acquisitions. We expect incremental sales of 5% to 6% from these acquisitions in the next 2 quarters, and for the full year, we expect acquisitions to contribute about 4% to our sales growth. Excluding acquisitions, we anticipate sales will grow 5% to 7% in local currency with a similar increase in the consumer and industrial segments. ","We continue to expect our pricing actions to be a large driver of this 5% to 7% increase, with volume and product mix flat to up slightly. While we grew volume and product mix 4% in the first quarter, we recognize that we are operating in a challenging environment and that some of the factors behind this increase were unique to this period.","We are also reaffirming a 9% to 11% increase in operating income and high-single digit cost inflation. As Alan stated, we now expect at least $45 million in CCI cost savings. ","Our objective is -- to achieve earnings per share of $3.01 to $3.06 remains intact. Keep in mind that the year-over-year earnings per share growth should increase as we progress through the year, with the highest increase anticipated in the fourth quarter since acquisition-related transaction costs lowered earnings per share by $0.05 in the fourth quarter of 2011.","To summarize, our guidance remains 9% to 11% sales growth in local currency, a 9% to 11% increase in operating income and a solid EPS result. We are committed to delivering high performance, achieving our financial objectives and building shareholder value in 2012. ","Alan has a few closing remarks, but let's turn next to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Akshay Jagdale with KeyBanc.","Akshay S. Jagdale - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","I have 2 questions. First one is regarding sales growth and your expectations for the remainder of the year. You're really the first company to actually come out and say -- at least in the food space, to come out and say that there's a shift in consumer spending towards away from home, which is interesting. And I just wanted to isolate, as part of your better performance that you admitted in terms of sales growth, how much of it was related to that shift and weather? And the reason I'm asking is if sales growth was better than you expected, which you said, I'm just wondering why you don't have the confidence I guess to raise your sales growth guidance. So if you can give me a little bit of perspective on that, that'd be helpful. And my second question is regarding branding. And you increased brand marketing by, I believe, $9 million this quarter, which was well ahead of your guidance. But for the full year, you still kept the guidance the same. So I'm wondering if there's flexibility on that or if you're committed to not spending much more for the remainder of the year.","Alan D. Wilson","Yes, a couple of things. It's pretty hard to actually quantify the impact of weather, but we did see some impact in our consumer business, at least in the U.S., where a lot of the real cold weather items were dramatically lower than they were a year ago, things like chili and beef stew seasoning and things like that. The reason that we're a bit cautious is as we've seen fuel prices start to rise, that tends to have a fairly significant impact on people as they spend their dollars going out or staying home. So we're a bit cautious on that, and so it's pretty hard to quantify. On the second question on advertising spend, we're committed to continue to invest in our brands. You\u2019ll recall, we spent up pretty heavily in the fourth quarter of last year. And our pattern is if we see the opportunity to do that because we have pretty good returns on our advertising investment, we'll do that. But at this point, early in the year, with a small quarter, it's not the appropriate time to change our guidance.","Akshay S. Jagdale - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","And just one follow-up. So you are spending more, it seems like, on your consumer business, which makes sense. Can you just talk about sort of -- in terms of the outperformance this quarter relative to your own expectation, would the business have outperformed even if there wasn't a shift to QSRs, for example? Like what -- was your consumer business sales growth in line or below your expectations? And how much of that do you think is because of a shift towards QSRs?","Alan D. Wilson","I would say that the consumer business was probably slightly ahead of our expectations, given some of the volume trends we saw early in the quarter when we were providing some guidance. So as we progressed, we saw stabilization and some strengthening. And it was pretty broad based. You saw the strong numbers in EMEA, as well as China and Canada and the U.S. stabilization. So I'd say, really, in terms of the outperformance, the consumer business was probably slightly ahead. I will say the Industrial business was very robust as well. Just to also highlight some of the things we're cautious about, if you recall in the prior year, we did have some weak comparisons in markets like China on the industrial side. So the strong performance in the first quarter, while we're very pleased with, it was against a weak year ago period.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Thilo Wrede with Jefferies & Company.","Thilo Wrede - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","You've now had 4 quarters of 5% to 6% price increases across the business, yet the gross margin decline you've had this quarter was the biggest since this inflation really started in second quarter last year. Shouldn't 4 quarters of good pricing give you a little bit more power to have less of a margin decline on the gross margin level?","Gordon M. Stetz","No. If you recall, and going back to the chart that where we've tried to illustrate this, is in the first quarter of last year, we were not yet experiencing the material cost inflation pressures. It was largely building up in inventory and also yet to be realized on the P&L. So as you recall, as we progressed through last year, the third quarter was down over 100 basis points and -- I mean, the second quarter, then the third quarter and fourth quarter were similar. So it really is a function of the timing of when these material cost increases started to hit us, and it started to accelerate as we progressed through the year. So we're looking at almost an opposite phenomena this year, where the majority of the increase really we start to experience in the first part of the year and then it starts to moderate as we progress through the year. And that's really what's causing the gross margin issue.","Thilo Wrede - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And was there any margin impact from that shift from food at home to more of the industrial business?","Alan D. Wilson","Well, there certainly will be because, obviously, it's a lower margin structure business relative to the consumer business. But as you saw, the industrial margins themselves were up over the prior year so that was helpful to the overall company margin structure as well.","Thilo Wrede - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then a few weeks ago, you put out a press release that you hired Dr. Cardellina as a scientist. I think the press release called out that he had experience with supplements and areas of the, I would say, food business that's not necessarily your core business. Is that signaling anything that maybe McCormick will move more into a supplement role, or is it just part of his resume but that's not the reason why you hired him?","Alan D. Wilson","No. That's part of his background. He's a very talented scientist, and he's going to help us tremendously in our flavor business. But there's no -- nothing to read in from his background.","Operator","Our next question is from Chris Growe with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I wanted to ask just to kind of come back to that cost inflation comments that you've made today, I guess, Gordon. Obviously, the peak being here in Q1, has it stepped down pretty meaningfully going forward or is it a gradual decline? I'm just trying to get a little bit of sense of the gross margin as we trend through the year.","Gordon M. Stetz","I'd say it's a gradual stabilization based on the way I just described how it played out last year.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then I was just curious, the QSR performance in the quarter. Is there any way to look at -- if you look at sort of the category trend, if you want to call it that, kind of how the QSRs broadly performed in the quarter, it was meaningfully better in Q1 than, say, Q4. Was that the majority of the growth that occurred for you? But I know you've also cited new product wins and distribution gains, that kind of thing. So I'm just trying to understand what was really driving the main piece of the growth in the QSR performance this quarter.","Alan D. Wilson","Well, the bigger turnaround in the first quarter was our food service business, and it was a combination of our distributor business and our QSR business. But that was a lot of what was happening in the U.S. industrial business. Around the world, it's a heavier QSR blend of customers.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. Again, that category trend picked up a lot in the quarter. Was that an important -- the most important part of the growth in the quarter then?","Alan D. Wilson","For the industrial business, it certainly was. Obviously, we talk about acquisitions and pricing as part of our growth algorithm in the quarter as well on the consumer side.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Sure, I was looking at the organic -- got you. okay. And then I have just one more follow-up if I could. And that was just in relation to price realization in the EMEA consumer division, I'm just trying to understand there, I'm sure you've taken pricing there in relation to cost inflation. Was there incremental promotional spending that may have reduced what the actual price realization that came through in the quarter?","Alan D. Wilson","We took minor pricing, and we took it in 2010 and early \u201911. So there was very little pricing in the EMEA business, and we did have a fairly heavy marketing and advertising spend.","Operator","Our next question is from Robert Dickerson of Consumer Edge Research.","Robert Dickerson - Consumer Edge Research, LLC","I just want to step back a little bit and kind of talk big picture. Because I know last year at CAGNY, you had a fairly extensive slide presentation. And it seemed like the larger strategy for McCormick on average was just by 2013, you could reach the 16% to 17% operating margin, and you had 20% margin in 2010. In consumer, you had 8%. In industrial, the goal was to get industrial to 9% to 10%. And then inherent within the plan, excuse me, was a continued shift to the consumer business on the top line. But I guess if I'm looking in the quarter and I realize that there is a little bit of a shift year-over-year because of the compare volume pulling into -- I mean, pulling to Q4 for last fiscal year. But in general, I guess -- so the question is, are we still on path to do that? Or could we see a scenario play out such that on an operating profit basis, there actually could be a little bit of not negative margin mix going forward but maybe not as positive as you thought considering commodities are still high? You're carrying kind of high inventories. And even though you have this outsized growth in the top line driven by acquisitions, frankly, consumer profits are still down 6%, which -- that's the second year in a row that your consumer division is down. So if I think about what's happening in consumer now and what's happening in the segment business mix now relative to longer-term plan I heard over a year ago, it just -- it seems a little off. So I'm wondering if you could just kind of provide some color on that.","Alan D. Wilson","I wouldn't read too much into an anomaly on one quarter. But what I would say is our strategies are exactly as we laid out last year. Now we've seen an awful lot of volatility in costs as we went through last year. Our costs were certainly a lot higher that we -- than we had anticipated in February last year. I'd say we're still experiencing that. You'll also recall in that discussion that the pricing is a very, very small part of our algorithm. But what happened in the quarter and in the time since then is that pricing has been much more a factor as we try to recover the margin. Our strategies are still the same. The acquisitions that we made last year were, by and large, consumer acquisitions. Doesn't mean we won't make industrial acquisitions going forward. But our strategy is still to grow our consumer business faster and drive the margin of our industrial business.","Robert Dickerson - Consumer Edge Research, LLC","Okay. So then if I think about the rest of this year even into next year, if we do actually see the input cost pressures ease a bit as we go through the year, I mean, is it fair to assume that you could see a little bit more of a margin benefit on the consumer side relative to what you get on the industrial side?","Gordon M. Stetz","Well. Certainly, as we progress through this year because of the volatility of cost, it may be tough within the consumer business. But on a go-forward basis, to Alan's point, the basic fundamental algorithm around faster consumer growth, improved industrial margin leads to an enhanced overall margin structure for the company. That has not changed. But again, back to Alan's point, these long-term goals can get interrupted for periods of cost volatility, which is what we're experiencing right now.","Operator","Our next question is from Anna Gurkin (sic) [Ann Gurkin] of Davenport & Company.","Ann H. Gurkin - Davenport & Company, LLC, Research Division","I want to return to the step-up in marketing spend. Are you getting the return? And I guess I was looking for $5 million, and it looks like it was $10 million this quarter. So can you walk me through that a little bit?","Alan D. Wilson","Yes, we believe that we are. We had -- we were supporting new product activity in the U.S., as well as in the U.K. We spent a tremendous amount in the first quarter launching Recipe Inspirations in the U.K. and in France, and we've seen the sales results from that and we feel pretty good about it. But as you're well aware, we continue. We have a pretty disciplined process to monitor what's working and adapt our model to spend behind the initiatives that are working. This year, we're beefing up our spending in digital and mobile marketing. We think there's a great return there. We also have started to invest in China behind brand building to deepen our business there as opposed to just look for new distribution. So it's an overall mix that we think is going to pay out. But as you're well aware, we'll go back and adapt it to what's working from a return standpoint and put the emphasis where we think it's going to generate the best returns.","Ann H. Gurkin - Davenport & Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay, perfect. And then how does the acquisition pipeline look right now?","Alan D. Wilson","It's still active. I wouldn't say that there's nothing we can announce this morning, but it's still active.","Ann H. Gurkin - Davenport & Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then third, if you could just comment on Zatarain\u2019s frozen entr\u00e9es. How are those performing, that's been a tough category, and how is that doing?","Alan D. Wilson","Well, for us, it's been a very good category. It's pretty well all incremental growth. We just introduced meals for 2 and they're starting to roll out now. And so we're seeing pretty good traction from things like Jambalaya and Blackened Chicken Alfredo. So it's -- that's kind of an area that we're excited. Remember, we're niche on -- in frozen. We don't think the world needs another frozen lasagna, and we're not trying to compete there. But the products that we have for Zatarain\u2019s and even for Thai Kitchen are pretty exciting to us.","Operator","Our next question is from Mitch Pinheiro with Janney Montgomery Scott.","Mitchell B. Pinheiro - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","In the industrial segment, obviously the QSR was strong. What part of this is sort of sustainable on your -- and driven by sort of internal efforts, like the innovation you've talked about and that sort of -- the process of getting these new products into the QSR segment, and how much is just maybe economic-related? And then also, how did your broad line distributor business do in the quarter?","Alan D. Wilson","Sure. We've executed better, I'll say that. Now recall, this is one quarter after a number of quarters of a fairly weak performance in the food service channel. But that -- so we're feeling good about the result. We're cautious going forward again because of the impact to gas prices, but it's been driven by our new product wins, as well as some good performance by a number of our customers. Our broad line branded business in food service also did very well in the quarter, and it's kind of nice to see positive volume trends in that area as well.","Mitchell B. Pinheiro - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Okay. One last question is how are you progressing on gaining share within your largest strategic customers?","Alan D. Wilson","In the industrial business, we've continued to gain share. It's always a kind of a tactical battle because we do that by winning new product innovation, and that's where we've tended to win more than our share of briefs. There's some offsets to that as people are looking to reduce cost in our ingredient business, and that's less of an innovation trend. But we've continued to gain share with most of our strategic customers.","Operator","Our next question is from Robert Moskow of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse Group.","Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I was just looking at the -- how the quarters are supposed to progress for the rest of the year. And are you forecasting, like what my model shows, that you can continue to get 100 basis points of leverage on the SGA line for the rest of the year?","Gordon M. Stetz","That'll vary, obviously, by the timing of A&P spend. Obviously, it would have been even more this quarter without the A&P spend. So -- but certainly, we're looking for leverage on the SG&A line because of, obviously, the price execution on the top line and the leveraging of the acquisitions against the SG&A base.","Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then one follow-up. I can see, Gordon, how the gross margin comparisons are going to get easier for the rest of the year. But you're not really forecasting, from what I can tell, any gross margin expansion. Is it really just a catch-up as the year progresses? Is that correct?","Gordon M. Stetz","I'd characterize it as more of a catch-up as the year progresses. Things can impact that obviously in terms of the product portfolio and the segment portfolio so that's what can vary and cause it to go up or down in any given quarter. But I would suggest it's more of a catch-up. Our price increases take a full year outlook and look to try and recover after even we look at CCI, the cost increases.","Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And your volume comparisons for second and third quarter, your currency comparisons for second and third quarter are going to get, actually, a lot tougher as well. Does that flow through at all to a tougher comparison in terms of operating profit growth? Or it seems like what you're saying is it really isn't a concern.","Gordon M. Stetz","Well, FX, as we've indicated, will be a negative to the top line, 2% on the year, and you're correct in that Q2 will start to be a tougher comparison. It's not the same impact on the operating income line as it is on the sales line. We have hedging activities. We also have cross-border flow of goods that we try to make natural hedges out of. But then obviously, we'll ultimately have a negative impact on the operating income line as well, just not as much as it is on the top line.","Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. So third quarter will be a much easier comparison than second quarter?","Gordon M. Stetz","Yes. Second quarter -- well, again, it's -- at current rates -- and rates, as you know, are volatile as well these days, but at current rates, second quarter is a tougher one.","Operator","Our next question is from Eric Katzman of Deutsche Bank.","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Couple of questions. I guess, I think, Alan, you alluded to the U.S. food manufacturers that you supply as still kind of being weak as the quarter progressed. Could you just detail that aspect? Because obviously the other food manufacturers have been pretty negative and have not indicated any kind of recovery whatsoever.","Alan D. Wilson","What we see is a little bit of a lag behind their volume trends on core items. So I wouldn't necessarily read into our results what's going to happen with all the other food manufacturers. If we're supplying core items and the core items are weak, our sales are going to be weak. To the extent that we have new product innovation wins, even when their trends may be a little weaker, our trends may be a little bit better. I will say I do think everybody is concerned with the consumer reaction to pricing and trying to put programs in place to make sure that we can protect volume. You've seen a lot of announcements on increased advertising spending, and we're seeing some amount of new product activity that we think will help us, as well as help our customers.","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then maybe you're going to go into this in more detail at the Analyst Day in a couple of weeks. But it seems to me on the consumer side that China is -- there's like some quarters where it's really great and then other quarters where it stumbles a bit. On the industrial side, it's been strong for a long time. But would you say now that China is -- maybe emerging markets are more of a focus, but China is better positioned to be more of a consistent growth area for you on the consumer side?","Alan D. Wilson","Yes. We certainly expect that it would. Now remember, China has a similar dynamic that the American market has except it's a quarter different. Our Thanksgiving-Christmas holiday is a heavy boost to sales for the U.S. In China, it's the first quarter because of Chinese New Year. So we do see some seasonality in that pattern as well. But we do think we're building a sustainable business in China and are really favorable on our brand building as we build consumer loyalty.","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then last question, maybe more on the industrial side of things. I was just -- I was on a flight the other day and I randomly sat next to this guy who works for another food ingredient supplier, and he indicated that the manufacturers, the branded companies that he serves were really pressuring everything in terms of cost. And I guess that's not surprising given all the inflation. But to the point where the food manufacturers were really like wanted, to the extent feasible, to keep the taste profile the same. They were actually looking for lower quality ingredients to the extent again that the cost versus taste balance would -- could sustain it. So are you seeing that, and kind of how does that work into the improvement on the industrial side?","Alan D. Wilson","I would say every customer that we have has a fairly aggressive productivity initiative. And the way we try to deal with that is by offering alternatives that protect the flavor, and also because in a lot of cases, we can help them both reduce costs and improve their product. And so that's a lot of the effort that we have going. But I'd say every manufacturer and we're -- we, us included, have productivity efforts to try to offset these increased costs, because we recognize it's a combination of high cost and high prices and lower volumes are not a sustainable mix. And so we're all working on try to do that. But for the most part, and I'd say across the board, we\u2019ve benefited from that but it does present some challenges for us.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Chuck Cerankosky of Northcoast Research.","Charles Edward Cerankosky - Northcoast Research","If we're looking at this process of higher raws sort of decelerating and the -- still the flow of price increases going through, how do you see it as affecting private label as both part of your sales mix and private label produced by competitors?","Alan D. Wilson","Well, what we've seen is private label pricing has gone up higher than brand pricing over the last 6 months or so, on a percentage basis. On the other hand, what we're seeing is consumers are very conscious of the prices they're paying, as we always do when prices go up and are making some trade-offs. So at least in the U.S., and I'll speak to the U.S., in our spice and seasonings business, we've seen private label gain some share, both in terms of dollars and in terms of units. In dry seasoning mixes, we've actually gained share. And then in our other major markets, Canada, the U.K. and France, we've gained share. So what we are seeing is private label manufacturers and us among them, passing through higher prices. And those higher prices are getting reflected on the shelf, but the consumers looking at an absolute price point on the shelf that they're making a decision on. And so I think we're in a bit of a questionable period from an elasticity standpoint. So we're very conscious of that and are implementing programs to help offset that.","Charles Edward Cerankosky - Northcoast Research","How about just looking internally, how has -- what's the shift like between your branded product and private label products in the consumer segment?","Alan D. Wilson","We've seen some shift, not necessarily to private label but some shift in volume to some of our economy brands. Our private label business has grown, but it's also because we won some new customers with that. So I wouldn't say it's been a dramatic shift in our mix of products from brand to private label. There's a little bit more from within our brands to our more economy brands.","Operator","Our final question this morning is for a follow-up from Robert Moskow of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse Group.","Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I think Eric sat next to the same guy on the plane that I sat next to because I had the same question. So I cancel my question.","Operator","I'd like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Wilson for closing comments.","Alan D. Wilson","Great, thanks. Thank you all for your time and attention.

Wilson","Thanks, Joyce. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us.","Our fourth quarter results enabled us to meet our 2012 objectives to grow sales 9% to 11% in local currency and deliver earnings of $3.03 to $3.08 per share. For fiscal year 2012, we grew sales 9% to reach $4 billion for the first time. This is double our sales of a decade ago. For the past 5 years, we've delivered a 6% compounded annual growth rate in sales at the top end of our long-term objectives.","Including the impact of our 2011 acquisitions, we increased sales in emerging markets, 47%, to reach 14% of 2012 sales. This is up from 10% of sales in 2011 and has moved us forward towards our goal of 20% of sales by 2015.","We continued to invest in product innovation. We expanded our facilities and capabilities in the U.K., Mexico, U.S., South Africa and early in January, celebrated the grand opening of our new state-of-the-art R&D facility in China. Our investment in product development led to the launch of more than 250 new branded products in 2012.","On the industrial side of the business, a move toward healthier products directed a significant portion of our development work with more than 30% of new product briefs globally having some wellness aspect.","We invested nearly $200 million in brand marketing support, twice what we spent in 2005. Globally, digital marketing was 12% of our total spending, up from 5% in 2010.","Slide 5 features some of our successes in this area beginning with a double-digit increase in our U.S. online traffic. We have similar progress underway in Europe as we align our digital presence to a common global framework.","Employees in our operations around the world achieved $56 million of CCI cost savings. This was a key step in our ability to manage through a period of high material cost inflation. And we generated significant cash in 2012.","Cash flow from operations reached a record $455 million. We returned $297 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, a 25% increase from $238 million in 2011. In November, McCormick's board approved a 27th consecutive dividend increase, ensuring our place among approximately 60 companies in the S&P dividend aristocrats. We achieved these results as we continue to navigate a challenging environment and adapt to the pressures faced by today's consumers.","Clearly, employees throughout McCormick are driving our strategy to grow sales and profit by investing in the business and fueling that investment with our CCI program. I want to thank them for all their efforts and recognize their achievements.","In the fourth quarter, we had a mixed performance with strong results in some areas of the business and other parts that did not meet expectations. We're extremely pleased with our results in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, EMEA, with strong top line growth of 10% in local currency, including a 6% increase in volume and product mix. As 2012 progressed, our Consumer business team in EMEA gained traction with new product introductions and brand marketing support.","In addition, our merchandising effectiveness was recently recognized by a leading U.K. retailer that awarded McCormick top supplier of the year. We delivered 10% growth for this customer with our new merchandise and fixtures.","In our EMEA emerging markets, we continued to exceed expectations with the Kamis brand in the fourth quarter and grew sales to increase exports in the Middle East and Africa.","Our Industrial business in the EMEA had another outstanding sales performance backed by increases in branded food service items and higher demand from quick service restaurants across the region, as well as some distribution gains with these customers.","A third area that drove fourth quarter sales growth was our Asia Pacific Consumer business. We grew sales in China at a double-digit rate in local currency with increases across all categories.","While the Asia Pacific region had a strong sales result for the Consumer business, demand from industrial customers, primarily quick service restaurants, was weak. This was largely an outcome of less new product and promotional activity versus the year-ago period. We expect this decline to extend into the first quarter of 2013, which has a tough year-ago comparison. If you recall, we grew base business industrial sales in the Asia Pacific region 22% in local currency in the first quarter of 2012.","In the Americas, our sales and profit were below our expectations in the fourth quarter of 2012. For our Consumer business in the Americas, sales were comparable to the year-ago period, a 2% increase in price offset a 2% decline in volume and product mix that resulted largely from customer purchase patterns and some temporary supply chain disruptions.","I'll discuss customer purchase patterns first. If you recall, we had reported a year ago that sales in the fourth quarter of 2011 had declined approximately $10 million or 2% due to customer purchases in advance of a price increase in the U.S. This created a favorable year-on-year comparison for us in the fourth quarter of 2012 based on customer purchase patterns.","However, based on our analysis of fourth quarter 2012, we determined that a number of U.S. retailers lowered their inventory of spices and seasonings from year-ago levels. We believe that this reflects buying patterns resulting from past pricing actions, as well as some caution on the part of retail customers following weaknesses in year-ago sales consumption.","For those of you who follow us closely know that we've experienced quarter-to-quarter fluctuations in customer buying patterns periodically for the past several years largely in response to our pricing actions. Across the past several years, we've taken pricing actions on 6 different occasions in the U.S. These actions have helped -- have had a cumulative increase of 25% and together have helped address a 45% increase in material costs.","Importantly, we've been able to execute the necessary pricing while maintaining our volumes. This is illustrated on Slide 9, which shows for our American Consumer business the significant impact of pricing in each of the last 4 years along with our volume and product mix results.","Looking ahead to 2013, with material cost inflation estimated at approximately 3% and no major pricing actions currently planned, we expect retail buying patterns for our products to normalize and for consumers to face less pressure from higher pricing.","Realizing that consumers in the Americas were still adjusting to high prices in this past holiday season, we stepped up fourth quarter activity behind coupons and focused our trade promotion funds on optimizing retail price points for key products.","This redeployment of marketing funds to couponing and price promotion put some added pressure on top line growth. It also lowered our fourth quarter brand marketing recorded in SG&A, which across all businesses was down $2 million from the year-ago period instead of up by $2 million that we had forecast in our previous earnings call. These changes in our marketing efforts paid off with improved consumer offtake during the Thanksgiving and Christmas holiday periods.","Heading into 2013, we will remain close to the consumer using a combination of equity building programs and promotions to position our business for success in the marketplace.","Also affecting Consumer business sales in the Americas were some temporary supply chain disruptions that occurred in the fourth quarter and related largely to Hurricane Sandy. While this devastating storm had a limited impact on our sales to customers in the Northeast, it did impact a number of suppliers in this area, which created product shortages during our critical holiday selling period. We also lost several shifts of production time in our manufacturing distribution facilities in Maryland.","The other supply chain disruption during the quarter, one that affected our operating income result, related to our Industrial business in the Americas. During the quarter, we recorded a $4 million charge as a result of material from one of our suppliers that was out of specification. We expect to recover a portion of this charge in 2013.","Across all of our businesses, operating income also had an unfavorable impact from our business mix. With the relative performance in the Americas versus our smaller regions, our business mix was less favorable at the operating income line. As most of you know, our Americas business is more profitable due to greater scale and less complexity. This mix of business was a primary reason for the decline in gross profit margin and also impacted operating income.","While this business mix had an unfavorable impact on operating income, keep in mind that there was some offset in the tax rate as most of our international businesses operated lower tax rate than in the U.S. We have further tax benefit from the repatriation of cash implemented in the third quarter. In total, the tax rate variance contributed to a 13% increase in EPS along with increased operating income and a significant increase in our income from unconsolidated operations. This was led by our joint venture in Mexico, which achieved double-digit sales growth.","Looking back on the fourth quarter, we were pleased with our progress and results in some areas and managed through some challenges in other parts of our business.","Looking ahead, across our global portfolio, we are well positioned as a global leader in flavor and see excellent long-term growth opportunities for our business.","Consumer interest in flavor continues to drive demand for our products. On Slide 10, you can see the latest 52-week category growth for spices and seasonings in our top 5 markets. These growth rates range from 3% in France to 8% in the U.K. and Poland and in China, the category is growing at a strong double-digit pace.","Our 2012 U.S. study revealed that while today's consumer is under pressure and striving to save both time and money, the one thing they refuse to give up is flavor. If you take a look at the metrics on Slide 11, the one that I find the most compelling is that more than half of consumers point to flavor and seasonings as a great way to add variety to everyday dishes.","Turning to Slide 12, Euromonitor projects that globally, herbs and spices will be one of the strongest of all flavor-related grocery categories through 2016. We believe these latest flavor trends, together with our effective growth initiatives and sustainable business strategy, will drive strong underlying financial performance in 2013 even in a still challenging global economic environment.","As Gordon will describe in more detail, our profit projections include some offset to this growth as a result of year-on-year increases in our tax rate and retirement benefit expense.","Before I turn it over to him, I want to share some of our projections and plans for 2013. Excluding the impact of any acquisitions, we expect to grow sales 3% to 5%, which is in line with our long-term objective for sales growth before acquisitions. We have a great lineup of new products for our Consumer business in 2013. Innovation continues to be one of the best ways to distinguish our brands from private label and other competition. Consumers in the U.S. are already seeing more than 25 new products on the store shelf this month, including new varieties of Grill Mates, Perfect Pinch, Recipe Inspirations and recipe mixes. We are introducing Zatarain's rice mixes in a convenient retort pouch and a line of frozen Thai Kitchen single serve entr\u00e9es.","In Canada, we're launching a range of recipe mixes to easily prepare authentic Chinese and Philippine dishes. We're expanding our range of Vahin\u00e9 dessert items including new extracts, decorations, toppings and baking mixes in France. In Poland, we're introducing 8 recipe mixes and 4 Bag 'n Season items under the Kamis brand.","Our team in Australia is introducing a new packaging format with liquid marinade in a bag. And our first new products for Kohinoor in India include a convenient mix of Rice n Spice and a 2-minute meal kit.","In our Industrial business, we have a solid pipeline of new flavors and seasonings more than sufficient to meet our sales growth objectives and align with our customers' new product launch plans. Our brand marketing plans include further increases in digital marketing, support for new product launches and a sharp focus on retail price points.","In the U.S., we're stepping up activity behind the first quarter events, including a multi-brand approach to Super Bowl with nearly twice as many in-store displays, as well as an additional winter cooking recipe mix event and an early start to our activity for Easter. In Europe, we plan to increase television advertising behind our core line based on strong returns in 2012.","Throughout the company, work by our higher performance team is well underway with a goal to achieve at least $45 million in CCI cost savings, providing an important offset to increase costs. And we continue to focus on the management of working capital to improve our cash generation.","As a final note, we are on track to complete the acquisition of Wuhan Asia-Pacific Condiments in mid-2013, and we'll make any adjustments to our financial guidance at that time.","To summarize, I firmly believe that McCormick's business strategy and growth initiatives, powered by employees around the world have us positioned to deliver strong underlying performance in 2013 and momentum for future success.","Let me turn it over to Gordon now for more insight into our fourth quarter financial results and more details on our 2013 guidance. Gordon?","Gordon M. Stetz","Thanks, Alan, and good morning, everyone. Our results for the fourth quarter included 4% sales growth in local currency, a 4% increase in operating income and earnings per share up 13%. We recognize that our results for the quarter differ from many of your projections, and I would like to help you understand the key variances.","Let's begin with a closer look at sales and operating income for each of our 2 segments starting with the Consumer business. As seen on Slide 17, we grew Consumer business sales 4% in local currency, a result driven by pricing and the impact of our 2011 acquisitions.","Volume and product mix was comparable to 2011 in the fourth quarter, but varied by region. In the Americas region, volume and product mix declined 2% as shown on Slide 18. We had some benefit from pricing taken in the fourth quarter of 2011, as well as higher prices on pepper that went into effect in August 2012.","Heading into the fourth quarter of 2012, we had a favorable comparison to the year-ago period when we reported an estimated $10 million shift in sales to the third quarter of 2011 from the fourth quarter of 2011.","However, as Alan described, volume and product mix in this region in the fourth quarter of 2012 was affected by further fluctuations in the timing of purchases by our retail customers and by supply chain disruptions. We estimate that the fluctuations in retail purchase patterns lowered year-on-year sales in the fourth quarter by approximately 2%. And we estimate that the supply chain disruptions largely related to Hurricane Sandy lowered sales approximately 1%. Importantly, we believe that the supply chain disruptions were temporary, and we expect no impact to results heading into 2013.","As for the shift in customer purchase patterns for this part of our business, a less inflationary cost environment should lead to more normal retail purchase patterns.","In Europe, the Middle East and Africa, EMEA, we grew consumer sales 9% in local currency. The level of success behind new products, brand marketing and retail distribution was evident in the 6% increase in volume and product mix. The implementation of master branding in Europe is proceeding well. Sales of Kamis products in local currency are ahead of plan, and we are growing sales in additional emerging markets, the Middle East and Africa through export.","Consumer business sales in the Asia Pacific region rose 32%. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and currency, the increase was 7% led by double-digit growth rate in China.","Across all 3 regions, fourth quarter Consumer business operating income was $177 million, a $13 million increase from the year-ago period. The Consumer business had higher sales, the benefit of CCI cost savings and a favorable comparison to the fourth quarter of 2011 when we recorded $7 million of transaction costs related to acquisitions. The positive impact of these factors was offset in part by the unfavorable mix of business across regions.","While this mix of stronger international sales had an unfavorable impact on operating margin, keep in mind that it contributed to the favorable tax rate during the fourth quarter.","Turning to our Industrial business, let's start with a review of sales. For this segment, we grew fourth quarter sales 4% in local currency driven by pricing taken in response to increased material costs. As with the Consumer business, the growth in volume and product mix varied by region.","On Slide 23, industrial sales in the Americas rose 6% as a result of pricing actions. During the fourth quarter, we grew sales of seasonings and flavors to food manufacturers and also increased sales of branded items to food service distributors. Offsetting this growth was a continuation of weak demand for our products sold to quick service restaurants in this region.","In EMEA, our Industrial business achieved another consecutive quarter of strong sales growth in the fourth quarter. We grew sales 12% in local currency with a 7% increase in volume and product mix. Quick service restaurants continue to expand in parts of EMEA, and we have gained share from the competition.","In addition, we have introduced new branded food service items.","In contrast to the consumer results in the Asia Pacific region, this was another weak quarter for the Industrial business with sales in local currency down 11%. We had a tough comparison to the fourth quarter of 2011 when we grew sales in local currency by 22%.","Following a strong first quarter in 2012, as Alan noted, we have been impacted by a lower level of promotional activity behind some of the quick service restaurant items we flavor in this region.","Operating income for the Industrial business was $23 million, down from $28 million in the fourth quarter of 2011. As previously discussed, the $4 million supplier charge was a significant part of this decrease with the remainder largely attributable to the mix of sales this period between regions. As with the Consumer business, this mix had an unfavorable impact on operating income, but helped lower the tax rate.","For the total company, we grew fourth quarter operating income 4% to $200 million. The benefit of higher sales, our CCI program and $7 million of acquisition-related costs in the year-ago period were offset in part by the unfavorable mix of sales in both segments and the $4 million charge. The unfavorable mix was also the primary reason for the 100-basis point decline in gross profit margin in the quarter.","Moving below operating income. Our tax rate for the quarter was 24.7% compared to a rate of 28.7% in the fourth quarter of 2011. As mentioned, the favorable rate in 2012 included the geographic mix of business across tax jurisdictions, as well as an additional benefit from the repatriation of cash from foreign subsidiaries that occurred in the third quarter of 2012 as was discussed in our September earnings call.","Income from unconsolidated operations has begun to lap some difficult results that began in the fourth quarter of 2012 -- 2011 related to pressure from higher material costs compounded by unfavorable currency exchange rates primarily for our joint venture in Mexico. In the fourth quarter of 2012, income from our unconsolidated operations rose $3 million to add $0.02 to EPS growth.","Sales of these businesses grew 7% this period. We reported earnings per share of $1.11, a 13% increase from $0.98 in the fourth quarter of 2011 with contributions from the favorable tax rate, higher operating income and the increase in unconsolidated income.","Let's turn next to our cash flow and year-end balance sheet. Cash flow from operations was $455 million, up from $340 million in 2011. The improvement was led by the change in inventory, which was just about flat in 2012 compared to a significant use of cash in 2011 when we increased our strategic inventory of certain spices and herbs and had an impact from steep material cost inflation.","In 2012, we used $132 million of cash to repurchase 2.3 million shares. At year end, we had $137 million still available on our $400 million authorization. Our balance sheet remains strong. We paid down $85 million of debt in the fourth quarter and returned to our target debt level.","As a final topic, I want to discuss our 2013 guidance and then get to your questions.","Turning to Slide 32, we are projecting a solid sales performance with 3% to 5% growth in local currency, driven primarily from higher volume and product mix. At this time, we are projecting a minimal sales impact from currency and about 1% from pricing. This range of sales growth currently excludes the impact of our agreement to acquire Wuhan Asia-Pacific Condiments. If we close this deal as expected in mid-2013, it will add about 1% to the sales range, putting our 2013 target right in line with our long-term sales growth target of 4% to 6%.","Alan indicated earlier that the Industrial business in the Asia Pacific region has a difficult year-ago comparison in the first quarter of 2013. In fact, we'll have a difficult sales comparison in each of our 3 regions for the Industrial business. In the first quarter of 2012, we grew volume and product mix 8% in the Americas, 8% in EMEA and 19% in the Asia Pacific region.","Moving to gross profit margin, we anticipate about a 50-basis point increase due in part to our goal to achieve at least $45 million in cost savings from our CCI program.","As Alan noted, material cost inflation is projected to be up approximately 3% for the total year, a significant moderation from the past 2 years. Because this easing of material cost is expected to occur gradually as we progress through the year, the gross profit margin improvement should be marginal in the first quarter and then increase with each successive quarter.","At this time last year, we did not think that the interest rate environment could go much lower. We were wrong. At that time, we reported to you a year-on-year increase of $9 million in 2012 retirement benefit expense. Due primarily to a further reduction in the discount rate, a key factor in determining these expenses, we are facing a steeper year-on-year increase of $22 million in 2013.","While this expense increase should affect each quarter fairly evenly, it is expected to have a greater impact to EPS growth in the first half when EPS tends to be lower than in the second half of our fiscal year.","Looking ahead to 2014, while I won't predict where interest rates will go from here, I believe the most likely scenario is a stabilization of retirement benefit expense at this level. We continue to evaluate ways to lower retirement expenses and manage plan liabilities. Early in 2012, we closed our U.S. pension plans to new participants and in early 2013, announced the closure of our defined benefit plan in Canada. In order to improve the funding level of the U.S. plan, we contributed $35 million to the plan at the end of fiscal year 2012 and another $28 million early in fiscal year 2013. Largely as a result of this expense increase, we have set up our operating income growth range at 6% to 8%, slightly below our longer-term goal of 7% to 9%.","Our guidance for 2013 includes a 29.5% tax rate, a 10% increase in income from unconsolidated operations, and a 1% reduction in shares outstanding.","At the EPS line, we project $3.15 to $3.23 for 2013, which is an increase of 4% to 6% from $3.04 in 2012. This is below our long-term objective of 9% to 11% largely as a result of the year-on-year increases in tax rate and retirement benefit expense, which are expected to lower our EPS growth rate by 8 percentage points as shown on Slide 33.","We expect higher sales growth in our CCI program to drive a double-digit increase in EPS excluding these 2 factors. Largely due to the difficult year-ago sales comparison for our Industrial business and the greater impact of material cost inflation in the first part of 2013, we expect EPS in the first quarter to be comparable to the year-ago period close to $0.55, which we reported in the first quarter of 2012.","To wrap up our guidance, capital expenditures in 2013 are expected to be in a range of $120 million to $130 million, up from $110 million in 2012. This range includes our plans to expand for growth in China and Poland, as well as funding for new product development technology.","In 2013, we expect our increased profit and further improvement on working capital to deliver another year of strong cash flow.","Let's turn now to your questions. After which, Alan will provide some closing remarks. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Alexia Howard of Sanford Bernstein.","Alexia Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Can I ask about the consumer takeaway data in the U.S.? It looks as though the volumes have fallen off a bit in the recent months. And it's kind of hard for us to tell how much of this is supply chain related or the timing of the Nielsen cutoff dates or maybe Hurricane Sandy and so on. Maybe you could just go through how much these supply chain issues affected the Americas, maybe both consumer and industrial volumes this last quarter. And then, as we look out to 2013, how confident are you in the volume outlook in the North American Consumer business given that consumer takeaway data that we're seeing?","Alan D. Wilson","Yes, a couple of things, Alexia. The Nielsen data cutoff, I think, on the 22nd or 23rd, so -- I think it was 22nd. So we missed 2 pretty important days of sales for our products. And as we look at the more longer-term based on IRI, which is what we measure, we saw a pretty good recovery, and we're encouraged by what we saw in consumer takeaway in the Thanksgiving and Christmas holiday periods for our products. So that's part of the reason why we are displaying more confidence in our outlook in the U.S. business. We think there may be some impact, but not a lot of impact of actual consumer takeaway in -- from Hurricane Sandy. There's certainly an area of the country that is extremely important for us, where we have very high shares, was impacted but we think the bigger impact was on our supply chain in the quarter.","Alexia Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. And then maybe as a follow-up. There were a number of mentions of a negative mix effect this quarter, and I'm thinking more globally now. I'm trying to get a sense for the company-wide margin outlook as you continue to push for growth in emerging markets. So I mean, have you got to a point where you're profitable in places like the Middle East and Africa or China on the Consumer business, for example? And if you're not at a level of profitability there yet, how are you managing that transition as you really balance growth in emerging markets versus profitability?","Gordon M. Stetz","Alexia, this is Gordon. We are profitable in those markets. The particular issue within the fourth quarter that we were pointing to relates to the relative mix of the business of the U.S. versus those foreign markets. And given the skewing of our results and the importance of the holiday period within the fourth quarter to the extent the U.S. market doesn't perform to the expectations that we have had, that can have a negative relative mix on both the gross and operating margin lines. So that's the near-term impact that we saw within the quarter. On a longer-term basis, we fully expect the Americas businesses to continue to grow. We've talked about the Americas margin structure being a strong line as it is, so our desire is for that business to continue to grow over time. And the emerging markets, as we gain scale and share and expand our presence there, we would expect those to start to approximate overall corporate margins as well. And the margin story really does differ by which emerging market we talk about. We've been in certain areas for quite some time, China in particular. That would be a better relative margin to, say, India where we're still establishing an infrastructure and then versus Poland, where we have an established business there that's being integrated into the European team, where they have margins comparable to the overall company structure.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Thilo Wrede of Jefferies.","Thilo Wrede - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Gordon, you indicated that the Wuhan acquisition could add about 1 point of incremental sales growth that's not included in your guidance right now. Is there any reason to assume that the income benefit would be in similar range?","Gordon M. Stetz","It more than likely would be flat to slightly dilutive, and that's primarily a function of the transaction cost that we would expense at the time we close the transaction, which we've indicated previously are about $4 million.","Thilo Wrede - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay, fair enough. And then the China Industrial business, what impact do you expect from the troubles that YUM! is having in China or just had in China?","Alan D. Wilson","Well, certainly, when our customers in China are not growing their sales, it does impact us in a couple of ways and, without giving specifics on a particular customer, I think our larger customers there, our quick service customers, have reported challenges in their current sales as a result of this chicken issue. Most of it, the quick service business there, is chicken, although we do a lot of other kinds of things like dessert toppings and drink mixes. But if their traffic's down, then our sales are under some level of pressure.","Thilo Wrede - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Do you see a corresponding uptick in your Consumer business then if China's consumers don't want to go to quick service?","Alan D. Wilson","Our Consumer business grew very strong in China through the year, and we've continued with that momentum.","Thilo Wrede - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then last question I have is for the Industrial business overall, is the target still to get to about 10% EBIT margin and kind of what's the time frame you're looking at right now?","Gordon M. Stetz","Well, what obviously impacts that and many of you heard us talk about this is the material cost environment, to the extent it's inflationary, which is what we've seen through -- from 2011 to 2012. Our pricing mechanisms are pass-throughs as we've talked about, and those pass-throughs do not allow for a margin expansion. In fact, it's passing dollar for dollar through on the raw material cost and actually has margin -- gross margin points compression on it. So what we point to in those periods is year-on-year operating income growth. We've seen consistent year-on-year operating income growth out of that Industrial business, and we've seen margins stuck pretty much in that 7.5% to 8% range. So underneath this period of cost inflation, there actually is margin improvement. But in terms of the timing of when we continue to believe we can get to that, say, 8% to 10% range is going to be very much a function of the cost outlook.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Akshay Jagdale of KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Akshay S. Jagdale - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","My first question is on gross margins. You've talked a lot about mix. So based on your comments, my interpretation is that because of the softness in the Americas business, your gross margins came in below even your plans. So if I'm wrong on that, please correct me. But my broader question on gross margins is your long-term goal has been to increase gross margins, I believe, roughly by 50 basis points every year. We've had now 2 or 3 years of -- 2 years, at least, of significant margin compression, and now commodity costs seem to be easing. So at some point, shouldn't we start to see gross margins increase higher than the 50% rate that you typically expect? And if you can give us an answer to when that might happen, that's my first question.","Gordon M. Stetz","Akshay, this is Gordon. Your first assumption is correct. The gross margin impact was very much a function of the geographic mix of the business, as we've said in the call, and that's primarily the Americas region softness we pointed to. As we have indicated in the call, we expect -- because of a more benign environment, improvement in our gross margin this year, and that follows 2 years of material cost inflation, which we've had that compression on now. In those periods of material cost inflation, we want to make sure that we're still able to deliver operating income dollar growth, and certainly our teams primarily in the industrial group but also in the consumer group have been focused on delivering those operating income growth targets. It's difficult to give you an exact time frame as to where we will be on the gross profit margin in the long term. I can tell you in a benign environment, we would expect this nice steady improvement that we had seen over time, and that would be a function of the Consumer business growth outpacing the Industrial business growth. Our Industrial business margin structure is getting better through their CCI and portfolio mix, and that's still the strategy that we have adhered to.","Akshay S. Jagdale - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And just one follow-up on the pension expense issue. So it's a little bit hard to judge that from an analyst perspective. So I mean, it's been a bit frustrating because your underlying performance has been very solid. So to glean into that, I'm trying to understand, I mean, when you set your management compensation plans, are you excluding those type of issues as onetime? I mean, I'm just trying to understand, I mean, if the interest rate environment reverses, how would you deal with some positive tailwinds from this type of item?","Alan D. Wilson","Just -- our philosophy is that we're all in it. So when we have a negative like we did in 2012, we take the hit on that. When we have a negative like we expect in 2013, we've got to figure out how to overcome it from a compensation standpoint. And when it's positive, we expect that there will be some level of benefit to our growth rate. Obviously, every year is unique as we set our compensation plans, so we will adjust targets and goals based on that. But our basic philosophy is we're all in and we're measuring ourselves against top-tier performance.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Growe of Stifel, Nicolaus.","Christopher R. Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I just had 2 questions for you. The first one I want to be clear on was in your discussion with -- to Alexia's question about product -- or about mix. I want to make sure I also understood the product mix within businesses. I'm not sure if you were addressing that or if you're addressing the business mix between Industrial and Consumer. Can you speak to the product mix within each division, and how that was a factor? In particular, it sounds like it was a negative in Industrial in the quarter.","Gordon M. Stetz","Yes, on the Consumer side, it was mostly the volume issue as it relates to the entire portfolio mix in the Americas softness. But within the Industrial business, I would agree that we did have some negative mix, in particular in the U.S. Industrial business within the quarter.","Christopher R. Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","And that would be related to weaker QSR performance? Is that the main factor there?","Gordon M. Stetz","Yes, that's certainly a part of it, yes.","Christopher R. Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then I want to ask just a bigger picture question about, I guess, the cash flow but more importantly like how you expect to use the cash in 2013? You got some share repurchase authorization available. And I guess, along those lines, can you also talk about maybe acquisition pipeline and how that -- it looks for the company from here?","Alan D. Wilson","Yes, I'd say, as always our priorities on the use of cash are dividend is extremely important. Acquisitions, because we believe investing in growth is important. We have some CapEx as we're expanding our facilities in China and Poland specifically, and investing in a new flavor technology in the U.S., which we're very keen on, and we think we'll have a positive impact long term on margins in that business. But we have room as we do acquisitions for cash repurchases with, at least, the Wuhan acquisition that we have on the table right now, we'll continue to buy back shares. We are always in the market. We see some level of activity. I would say it's not as robust as we've seen in some years, but we still have -- we have some good targets and continue conversations at expanding our footprint.","Gordon M. Stetz","Chris, I would just add that's given where we are with our targeted debt level and the amount of cash we generate, depending on the acquisition size, we've historically been able to do both share repurchase and acquisitions, and that's our intention as we go into this year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rob Dickerson of Consumer Edge Research.","Robert Dickerson - Consumer Edge Research, LLC","I guess, first question is just I've heard you say, I guess, on the Q3 call and also this morning that overall you would expect that consumers would increasingly become a little bit more comfortable spending on flavors because it's such an attractive category, and flavor matters at current prices. But then, at the same time, it seems like your couponing and retail takeaway in the IRI data, which precludes the full holiday, does seem to improve a little bit on the margin and volume, part of that could be from the increased couponing. So I'm just curious, I guess, what studies, one, have you done not on flavor being a great category, but on consumers willing to pay current prices for that flavor; and then two, if the couponing seems to be working, would there be a point such that you would consider lowering your pricing to actually get volume growth?","Alan D. Wilson","Thanks. We do a tremendous amount of work on price elasticity. And we have, as we've gone in this aggressive pricing environment, as I said on the call, we've had about a 45% increase in commodity cost over the last 4 years and have taken about 25% pricing and we've taken a number of different actions along the way, and we are always evaluating the impact of that on volume. The consumer is looking at 2 things. One is we're a fairly low-frequency purchase, and there has traditionally been less price sensitivity on some of our items than there is in a number of other categories. All that said, though, on the shelf, when you've got a range of price points ranging everything from $1 up to about $8 in gourmet, we want to get the promoted price right when the consumer is there to buy. Our business is largely a base business, which means that a small percentage is sold on promotion. But as we get into some of these key periods, we want to make sure that we're incenting customers to buy our brand and not let them have a reason to walk away. Coupons are always a part of our mix, as are price promotions at certain times of the year, that really hasn't changed. We did view that we needed to make sure that we were driving positive volume consumption in the fourth quarter, and so we shifted some of our spending and we'll keep evaluating what the right mix to get to consumers are. We've taken some price reductions on shelf on a couple of key items that we talked about like vanilla and grinders, and we're measuring the impact of that. We think it's -- the results have been generally positive in terms of that, and we'll continue to evaluate certain items to get to the right price points. And this -- and by the way, what we have seen as our pricing has gone up, we have seen those price gaps close now as competition, largely private label, has also taken price increases to either catch up or improve their margins. So we're seeing that situation moderate a bit. All that, we -- it's fairly complex because of the number of items and we've got different elasticities with different items. So we may be trying to be sharper on things like dry seasoning mixes and evaluating what we do on certain spice items, but we do a tremendous amount of work in really understanding that dynamic.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Robert Moskow of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse Group.","Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I think you're not the only food company or CPG company that's kind of entered the year thinking that they could increase brand marketing and then have to adjust that expectation down, but I wanted to get to a final number for you for the year. Were you still up about $10 million in terms of increasing your brand marketing for the year, and -- I'll leave it at that.","Gordon M. Stetz","Yes, Rob. We were up $11 million and a significant portion of that was also up in the advertising. So we were up year-over-year. We also -- as mentioned, we had a significant portion in digital that we're spending behind. So yes, we were up.","Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And was that kind of in line with sales growth, or was it kind of below sales growth? And how would we compare that to your guidance for 2013, which is to be in line with sales growth?","Gordon M. Stetz","It was just ever so slightly below sales growth if we do the math.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Andrew Lazar of Barclays Capital.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Research Division","With respect to some of your comments about industrial sales in the Americas, I think, you were -- and actually the organic side of that were actually pretty good, and I think you said it was driven by increased sales of branded products to food service as opposed to the QSR. So that's fairly consistent, I think, with some of your comments in the third quarter where you said you were a bit more optimistic that as pricing was starting to wane, volumes for the -- just the branded sort of packaged food companies, many of which you supply, were starting to improve a bit. So I was hoping to get a bit of an update from you on just kind of how you see the landscape around the branded packaged food guys and if that trend has continued in a way that keeps you somewhat maybe cautiously optimistic from an industry standpoint.","Alan D. Wilson","Yes, we're encouraged by what we're seeing in that part of the business. Obviously, different companies have different philosophies and challenges. I'd say the one thing that we didn't see as we went into last year is the amount of actual new product launches that we would typically expect to see. A lot of our customers are going through restructurings and have focused on some level of reorganization. We do see a pretty strong pipeline of new product activity among the consumer food customers that we have, that does encourage us as we go into the second half of the year.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Got it. Okay, that's helpful. And then, I know that from time to time, not just in your business, but in others, there can be these quarter-to-quarter shifts in kind of inventory management in key customers, particularly, in the ends of key retailers' fiscal years, and we've seen that from time to time. Is -- I guess, I'm trying to get a sense of how your capabilities or systems allows you to have some visibility to what your inventories are at the customer level. Has your ability or capabilities there changed at all in the last couple of years to where you have a better sense of how that tracks, because it still seems like a lot of companies in this space get blindsided every so often by some of these shifts? And admittedly, maybe that's just the reality of the customer shifting things kind of quickly in a given period that you can't read. But I'm trying to get a sense of what your level of visibility is to that.","Alan D. Wilson","Yes, we have a level of visibility to about half our U.S. volume because of things like vendor managed inventory or data that we can purchase to evaluate consumption versus their factory sales. So we have that level of visibility. It doesn't -- even in the case of our BMI customers, though, it doesn't change the fact that they decide on a short term that they're going to aggressively manage inventory that, that won't happen. I would say we did miss this a bit in terms of laying out what we thought was going to happen relative to prior periods because of the amount of pricing that we've taken. I'd say there's probably a little bit of an underlying caution by a number of our customers because of some softness in December and January of last year. Now we're seeing the volumes pick up, so we're encouraged by that. But I think, in terms of their inventory management, there was a level of caution around what they thought they needed to bring in, in that period.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Got it. And I think Gordon said that you felt like separate from the supply chain issues from Sandy, that these issues as well, around the inventory side seem like they're pretty well behind you, or is some of that bleed into the first quarter? I wasn't clear on that piece.","Gordon M. Stetz","No. We think it's -- just based on what we've seen so far since we closed the year, we're cautiously optimistic and encouraged by what we're seeing in the U.S. business.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Eric Katzman of Deutsche Bank.","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I still have a couple of questions. I guess, first, Gordon, a number of companies have changed their pension accounting and have offset having to take a pension expense hit. Obviously, yours is pretty significant. Did you look into that, and why didn't you use this mark-to-market methodology or maybe Hershey's IFRS approach to offset some of this $22 million in expense?","Gordon M. Stetz","Our philosophy, Eric, has been to disclose the amount, the underlying economics whether -- based on whatever accounting you're using doesn't really change. So from our standpoint, we felt certainly it's important for our investment community to know what the amount is and for you to evaluate the impact to us. We've given you the cash impact associated with some of the funding as well, but we do look at those things. However, we finally landed that the best way to disclose this was purely to give you the amount that was the impact. And as Alan said, we're challenged as a management team to overcome this and move on.","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then, I guess, on Slide 15, maybe you answered this question, but you -- Alan, you talked about retail price points. And maybe you could expand on that a little bit. I don't recall for a long time you talking about retail price points. I assume you mean sharpening those to drive consumption higher because you weren't talking about higher pricing in the business. So...","Alan D. Wilson","No, there's a couple of initiatives. One is making sure we got the right prices on items that are price sensitive. So things like dry seasoning mixes and pepper and vanilla and that sort of thing, and so we've got some initiatives on that. We're not talking about higher prices. We're talking generally about how we apply our promotion funds to make sure we're hitting the items that are really volume -- that are really price sensitive.","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then, last question back to Gordon. You -- right, the pension expense is noncash, although, you are making a contribution. I guess, you have your tax rate going up, and I'm not really sure what that means for actual cash taxes paid. But I guess, my point is if EBIT is up 6% to 8%, and excluding the pension expense, it's up close to 10%, and then you've also got the JV income up 10%. Is your free cash flow in fiscal '13 up double digit, especially if inflation and working capital aren't much of a challenge?","Gordon M. Stetz","We haven't a specific number out there, Eric, but I don't disagree with your math and that certainly could be an outcome as we progress through the year.","Alan D. Wilson","Yes, we do expect a year of strong cash flow, and built into that assumption is that commodity costs are fairly moderate.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ann Gurkin of Davenport & Company.","Ann H. Gurkin - Davenport & Company, LLC, Research Division","I have 2 questions. One, you've commented about the outlook for the Industrial business in the first quarter, but can I get some more detail on your outlook for the overall QSR segment of your business for the year, and as the year progresses the outlook for that QSR segment?","Alan D. Wilson","We think it's going to be fairly challenged. We have some positives in certain markets. And then, as we get into the back half of the year, some easier comparisons. But we do think through the year that, that -- and I'm following our customers' releases as closely as -- probably closer than you are because they really impact us. But I would say that we think that it's going to be fairly challenged.","Ann H. Gurkin - Davenport & Company, LLC, Research Division","Great. And then, Alan, in Australia, can you comment on the environment and how you're approaching the consolidating retailer environment and your strategy to address that changing marketplace?","Alan D. Wilson","Yes. Australia has been a tough market for McCormick. As you all know, we're not the brand leader there, and so what we have done is we kind of used it as a laboratory in terms of how a second-place supplier challenges a market leader. And so we've been pretty innovative with new products. We've been very targeted on the kinds of things that we're doing and -- outside our core spice and seasoning line, and we've seen some pretty positive results over the last 2 years as we've done that, but it is a challenging market.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Erin Lash of Morningstar.","Erin Swanson Lash - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","I apologize if I missed this, but I was curious, the fourth quarter tends to be a quarter where there's more of a -- branded sales are more emphasized just because of the holiday cooking season and that sort of thing. So I was wondering if you could comment between the mix of branded versus private label sales, if there was an increase in private label sales relative to branded in the fourth quarter?","Alan D. Wilson","I don't have the actual comparative data between branded and private label in the fourth quarter, but typically we do see an increase in branded shares for a couple of reasons. One is consumers are less willing to take chances on their meals. The second is private label is pretty prevalent in really popular items, but a lot of the items that are purchased at the holiday like nutmeg and pumpkin pie spice and apple pie spice and things like that aren't necessarily replicated in private label because they're a onetime purchase. So I'm afraid I don't have the data specific to private label in this period on these items in front of me, but typically what we've seen is our branded shares are at the highest in the fourth quarter of the year. I would expect they still are.","Erin Swanson Lash - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","All right. That's helpful. And then just one other question. When -- with the retailer inventory adjustments that were occurring in the quarter that you discussed, was that concentrated at any one channel, or was that across all channels?","Alan D. Wilson","It was pretty concentrated with a limited number of customers.","Operator","Our final question of the day comes from the line of Leigh Ferst of Wellington Shields & Co.","Leigh Ferst - Wellington Shields & Co., LLC, Research Division","I was wondering if you could comment on your digital marketing spending of 12%. Give us some background on how you spent that in different categories and geographies, and how you're evaluating the impact of that.","Alan D. Wilson","Sure. Our focus is in a couple of areas. The main spending is in our larger consumer markets like the U.S. and EMEA, and we're doing a number of things, everything from digital recipes to promotions that we work with on search to really target where consumers are at -- on their mobile phones. So as they're searching for things like chicken, we're working with retailers on driving specific purchases of specific McCormick items to a retailer, and we're seeing some really great results with that. As we continue to expand, we have some technologies, which allow for individual flavor selection, and we've been talking to a number of retailers around tying that to their programs. But we're very encouraged by what we're seeing in terms of returns, how consumers are responding. The digital consumer is a very engaged consumer, and so it's one that increasingly we're reaching out to.","Leigh Ferst - Wellington Shields & Co., LLC, Research Division","And on your CCI, is there any evolution or change in the focus of the spending this year or in the savings this year?","Alan D. Wilson","I wouldn't say specifically. I think, it's been a pretty balanced approach to everything from SG&A to productivity in our manufacturing plants, as well as looking at savings within our procurement channels. So it's pretty balanced, and I don't expect that, that's going to change. We're not going to be heavier this year in one versus the other, different than we've been in the past.","Operator","At this time, I would like to turn the floor back over to management for any concluding remarks.","Alan D. Wilson","Thanks for your questions and for participating in the call today. We do believe interest in flavor continues to grow, and McCormick is well positioned to meet this through our growth initiative, our increased global presence and our passion for flavor. While today's environment remains challenging, we're staying close to the market, we're going to be agile, and we're going to adapt our business to drive sales and profit. McCormick's leaders and all its employees are committed to building shareholder value. So thank you very much.","Joyce L. Brooks","Thanks, Alan.

This is Joyce Brooks, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you for joining today\u2019s call for a discussion of McCormick\u2019s Third Quarter Financial Results and our Latest Outlook for 2016. To accompany this call, we have posted a set of slides at ir.mccormick.com. [Operator Instructions]","We\u2019ll begin with remarks from Lawrence Kurzius, President and CEO; and Mike Smith Executive Vice President and CFO, and then open the lines for questions. [Operator Instructions]","During our remarks, we will refer to non-GAAP financial measures. These include adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share that exclude the impact of special charges as well as information in constant currency. Reconciliations to the GAAP results are included in this morning\u2019s press release and slides.","As a reminder, today\u2019s presentation contains projections and other forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those projected. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or other factors. As seen on slide two, our forward-looking statement also provides information on risk factors that could affect our financial results.","It\u2019s now my pleasure to turn the discussion over to Lawrence.","Lawrence Kurzius","Thank you, Joyce. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. McCormick\u2019s third quarter results continued the strong performance we delivered in the first half of 2016 with adjusted earnings per share of $1.03. In constant currency, we grew sales 6%, with increases in both segments in each of our three regions, and grew adjusted operating income 15%. These results demonstrate the effective execution of our strategy, designed to drive both top line sales and significant productivity improvements. This balanced approach is being managed by McCormick leaders and employees around the world and I thank them for their effort and engagement. ","For the year-to-date financial results and momentum heading into the fourth quarter, we\u2019re well positioned to deliver record results in 2016. Taking a look at the third quarter, we were pleased with the performance of both our consumer and industrial segments. On a constant currency basis, we grew consumer segment sales 7% and increased adjusted operating income 12%. As those who follow McCormick know we're driving sales with increases in our base business, new products and acquisitions. All three of these drivers contributed to consumer segment sales increase this quarter. ","Our base business growth was particularly strong in the Americas region and led by sales of core McCormick and Lawry's brand spices and seasonings. Also our sales of recipe mixes including wet recipe mixes have picked up in the US and we gained category share this quarter. China was another major driver of the consumer segment sales increase this quarter, with double-digit growth in constant currency and category share gains for both herbs and spices and recipe mixes.","As for innovation we shared with you at our June earnings call a great lineup of new products we are launching in the second half of our fiscal year. These include the rollout of herb grinders in additional markets, organic recipe mixes and kitchen basics bone broth in the U.S., which is a simple way to add flavor and 10 grams of protein per serving. Internationally among the new products we're introducing our new world cuisine recipe mixes across Europe and innovative dessert items in France and Australia.","On the acquisition front, we had an incremental benefit this quarter from both Stubb\u2019s and Gourmet Garden. While it is less than six months since we acquired Gourmet Garden I'm pleased to report that we're already gaining new distribution for these products in the U.S. and our first retail placement in Canada.","While constant currency sales rose 7% for the consumer segment, the increase was even higher for adjusted operating income at 12% in constant currency led by our comprehensive continuous improvement program TCI we're making great progress in lowering costs throughout our business and improving margins for both our consumer and industrial segments.","We are well on our way towards reaching our goal of $100 million to $110 million cost reduction for 2016. We also had more positive mix this year, this included sales in North America with the strength of our branded business outpacing our sales of economy products and in the Asia-Pacific region where we benefited from our year ago actions to improve our product mix and margins.","Turning to our industrial segment on slide six, we grew sales 4% and increased adjusted operating income 23% in constant currency. We had solid sales results in each of our three regions and Mike will go through some of the specific drivers. Our growth strategy to excel in customer intimacy and consumer insight is really paying off for the industrial segment. This is evident in our third quarter growth and share gains of our branded food service sales in the U.S. and other markets and we're meeting growing consumer demand for organic flavors, non-GMO products, and a whole range of on-trend flavors.","In this regard the addition of Brand Aromatics in 2015 has been a real success expanding our capabilities and leading the new business. Increasingly our industrial customers are also seeking innovative solutions for healthier food including snacking, which is also driving higher sales. ","The third quarter profit growth for our industrial segment was particularly high this quarter with adjusted operating income of 23% in constant currency and we increased adjusted operating income margin more than 100 basis points. TCI was the significant driver of this increase and business mix was also a key contributor.","Our customers are seeking unique flavors that tend to be more complex, value added and higher margin. We're unlocking some new opportunities most recently with flavors for savory side dishes and dessert baking mixes with our FlavorCell technology encapsulated flavors that offer protection and controlled release in a wide variety of processing environments. These segment results with the excellent growth in adjusted operating income helped us achieve adjusted earnings per share of $1.03, an $0.18 increase from $0.85 in the third quarter of 2015. The higher operating income added $0.11 of the increase and the other main factor was a lower tax rate as Mike will describe more fully.","With one quarter remaining in the fiscal year we've increased our guidance for adjusted earnings per share to $3.75 to $3.79 from our previous guidance at the upper end of $3.68 to $3.75. This new range is based on our strong third quarter results partially offset by several headwinds for earnings per share as we move into the fourth quarter.","The first headwind is a greater impact from unfavorable currency particularly for our joint venture in Mexico. Second a reduction in our initial 2016 plans for share repurchases due to acquisition activity throughout the year for both completed and uncompleted deal. As many of you know, it\u2019s our practice to curtail share repurchases in conjunction with acquisition activity to achieve our target debt leverage.","And third, the rising cost for certain raw materials, particularly, Vanilla and Garlic. When we provide our material cost inflation outlook for 2017 in our January earnings call, it is likely to be above 2016\u2019s low single-digit rate.","As we\u2019ve done in the past, we expect to manage this increase through pricing actions and cost savings. While we\u2019ve already begun to take pricing actions, we anticipate some near-term slowdown in our rate of margin improvement. Part of his remarks, Mike will be providing more comments on our outlook.","Next, let\u2019s take a closer look at our growth in our U.S. consumer business beginning on Slide 8. As I indicated, our third quarter sales growth from McCormick and Lawry\u2019s brands spices and seasonings in the U.S. was particularly strong. Leading this increase were core McCormick brand spices and herbs.","Our conversion to non-GMO labeling has gone extremely well. And we activated marketing for new herb grinders. We at McCormick are proud to share that our herb grinders were recently awarded Innovation of the Year by GMA, the Grocery Manufacturers Association.","We\u2019re continuing to increase our digital marketing to drive sales. Our plans are to take digital marketing to nearly two-thirds of our total U.S. advertising this year, up from 46% in 2015. Traffic to our McCormick.com site is up 15% versus last year, as millennials and other generation seek recipes, how to videos and other content.","Just last week, we learned that L2 research ranked our McCormick brand in the U.S. number 5 out of 126 food brands in its annual digital IQ ranking. For a third year in a row, we had achieved the number five spot, which places us at L2\u2019s \u201cgenius level\u201d.","The L2 ranking is based on the following criteria: brand site effectiveness and e-tailer investments, digital marketing, social media based on reach, search and engagement, and mobile encompassing experience search advertising and apps.","In 2016 we\u2019re getting more value out of each marketing dollar. In the U.S., we\u2019re on track to reduce our non-working media by 20% in 2016 versus 2015, and increase our working media by 12%. Across all markets, we\u2019re shifting our marketing towards more high ROI digital marketing. ","As a result of these actions and including the currency impact, we\u2019ve lowered our planned increase in brand marketing for 2016 from an increase of $20 million to an increase of $15 million. This is a 6% increase from our brand marketing spend in 2015 and well ahead of our projected 3% year-on-year sales increase on a reported basis.","Also behind the strong sales performance this quarter was our great grilling season. We grew Grill Mates sales 6%, with incremental marketing support and the introduction of new single use marinades an innovation that is exceeding our expectations at market.","Sales of our Lawry\u2019s brand seasoned salt and other products were up with some strong brand marketing activity. And as we worked through resets of our gourmet line for the new organic versions, sales this period rose at a double-digit rate.","For those of you, who watched the retail consumption data, our reported sales growth might seem at odds with the latest data, which has shown a sequential increase in category share decline for McCormick versus the last quarter. A large part of the share decline this quarter related to the significant retail shelf disruption from the conversion of our gourmet product line.","We remarked on this as part our outlook at our June earnings call. As the old gourmet products rotate off the shelf and are replaced by new organic varieties have been a number of out of stock situations and shelf label changes. As customers work to replenish their shelves, our shipments of gourmet items were strong toward the end of the third quarter, and we expect this to read through in stronger retail consumption data for the fourth quarter.","For those customers who have completed the resets to organic gourmet we\u2019re seeing significant sales lift and we expect most our customers to have these conversions complete before the holiday period begins later this fall. In addition with this move to organic, we\u2019ve been able to increase our distribution of gourmet items with 4 of our top 10 retailers.","Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we\u2019re excited about this year\u2019s holiday period in the U.S. We\u2019re reminding consumers to flavor these important meals with the pure flavors of the holiday, during its high consumption period, we\u2019re driving brand loyalty through television, digital and in-store communications, and featuring some of our latest core product innovations, such as roasted ground cinnamon and ginger bread spice.","As part of our fourth quarter communication plan, we\u2019re reactivating our highly successful purity campaign. This campaign has been particularly effective with millennial consumers. We measured a two percentage point increase in millennial household penetration for McCormick spices and seasonings when we introduced our purity message. In addition the purity TV and digital messaging lifted millennials' purchase intent for McCormick brand by 15 percentage points. This is driving a strong retail sales response with a 9% increase in our spices and seasonings during a seven week on air period. ","Across all of our markets and both of our segments our leaders and employees throughout McCormick are driving towards a solid finish and great fiscal year results. McCormick is uniquely positioned as a global leader in flavor a category that is on trend with today\u2019s consumer and healthy eating. We\u2019re driving strong momentum with our strategies to grow sales, balance with our CCI program and other efforts to build fuel for growth and higher margins.","I\u2019d like to thank you for your attention and it\u2019s now my pleasure to turn it over to Mike. Mike?","Mike Smith","Thanks, Lawrence and good morning, everyone. As Lawrence indicated our third quarter results continued the strong performance we achieved in the first half. I\u2019ll provide some added perspective on the financial results and then discuss the details of our latest 2016 financial outlook. On a constant currency basis, we grew sales 6%. Acquisitions, higher volume and product mix and pricing taken in response to higher material costs each contributed to the increase as seen on slide 12. Both our consumer and industrial segments delivered solid top-line growth with increases in each of our three regions.","On Slide 13, consumer segment sales in the Americas rose 8% in constant currency, with 3 percentage points of the increase from acquisitions, both Stubb\u2019s and Gourmet Garden. The balance of sales growth this period was in the U.S. and led by McCormick and Lawry\u2019s brand spices and seasonings, Zatarain's brand items and Kitchen Basics products. These sales increases were offset in part by a slight decline in our sales of private label and economy brands. ","EMEA consumer segment sales rose 1% in constant currency. We\u2019ve continued to drive sales growth in Poland and Russia that includes the benefit of new distribution and we delivered another strong sales quarter along with category share gains in France with new products and brand marketing. These gains were offset impart by weakness in the UK where a number of food companies have been challenged by difficult retail environment.","We grew consumer sales in the Asia Pacific region 11% in constant currency. Sales from Gourmet Garden added 7 percentage points of this growth. In China, we return to a strong sales increase this quarter following some moderation in the second quarter that related to a successful SAP implementation in our Wuhan facility. Third quarter sales in China were mainly driven by promotional activity and pricing.","Year-to-date, our consumer sales in China are up 9% on a constant currency basis. A decline in India lowered our third quarter sales in this region by 6 percentage points due to a decision a year ago to discontinue certain low margin products.","For the consumer segment in total, we grew adjusted operating income 11% to $127 million. In constant currency, adjusted operating income rose 12% from the year ago period, the impact of sales growth and cost savings more than offset higher material costs and our investments in growth including higher brand marketing.","Turning to our industrial segment on slide 17, we had excellent results this quarter in both sales and profit. We grew industrial sales in the Americas 4% in constant currency. This strong performance was driven by sales of branded food service products in the U.S. where we\u2019ve gained share with a leading customer. Also in the U.S. we\u2019ve been winning business with several new restaurant customers. Although demand from some of the quick service restaurants remains weak. And in Latin America we\u2019re growing sales of snack seasonings and other products supplied from our operation in Mexico. ","In Canada, we took pricing to pass through higher material costs that include the impact of currency, but this was offset by weaker volume for industrial products in that market. We grew industrial sales in EMEA 5% in constant currency versus the third quarter of 2015. We had solid sales growth of branded food service products and customized labor solutions. Industrial segment sales in the Asia-Pacific region were up 3% in constant currency. We had strong growth from our operations in Australia and Southeast Asia, driven impart by new product wins and promotional activity by our quick service restaurant customers.","In China as we indicated last quarter a large customer is diversifying their supply chain by adding a second supplier for some core items that McCormick supplies. ","Adjusted operating income for the industrial segment ended the quarter up 14% at $45 million. In constant currency, the growth was 23%, driven by higher sales, our cost savings and a more favorable business mix offset impart by higher material costs and increases in brand marketing.","Those of you who follow us closely know that the industrial segment tends to have some quarter-to-quarter profit volatility. Largely due to customer activity, including new product launches, limited time offers and other promotions. Following an exceptionally strong third quarter, we are projecting adjusted operating income for this segment to slow in the fourth quarter. For the fiscal year, we expect both an increase in adjusted operating income and improved margins versus 2015.","Across both segments, adjusted operating income, which excludes special charges rose 12% in the third quarter from the year ago period. And excluding the impact of unfavorable currency, we grew adjusted operating income by 15%. Year-to-date, the increase in adjusted operating income in constant currency is 11%. We increased gross profit margin 180 basis points year-on-year to 41.6% in the third quarter. This improvement was a result of cost savings from our CCI and streamlining actions, favorable mix and pricing actions taken to offset higher costs.","Given the rise in certain materials as Lawrence described, we still expect the increased gross margin in the fourth quarter, but the increase is likely to be below 100 basis points.","Our selling, general and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales was up year-on-year by 20 basis points from the third quarter of 2015. Mainly due to the increase in brand marketing. The tax rate on a GAAP basis this quarter was 22.3% below both the prior year rate and our previous guidance for the second half, mainly due to discrete tax items. At this time, we expect a tax rate of 28% to 29% in the fourth quarter and a fiscal year 2016 tax rate of 25% to 26%.","Income from unconsolidated operations was down this quarter by $2 million. As a reminder, income from unconsolidated operations in the third quarter of 2015 had a $2 million favorable impact from special charges, due to the minority interest in our Kohinoor joint venture in India. ","Currency also had an unfavorable impact on the year ago comparison. However, we have a good underlying performance. Our largest joint venture McCormick de Mexico has grown year-to-date sales at a high single-digit rate in local currency. We anticipate a greater impact from unfavorable currency and have increased our expected decline in income from unconsolidated operations to about 15% from approximately 10%. ","At the bottom-line, third quarter 2016 adjusted earnings per share was $1.03. This was a $0.18 increase from the year ago period. As a result of higher adjusted operating income, a favorable tax rate and lower shares outstanding. As a reminder, this year-to-year comparison includes the unfavorable impact from currency on both consolidated and unconsolidated income.","On slide 26, we summarized highlights for cash flow and the quarter end balance sheet. Through the first three quarters of 2016, cash flow from operations was $322 million, up slightly from the year ago period. The impact of higher net income was offset impart by a pension contribution, timing of tax payments and an increase in trade receivables this period.","For the third quarter, our cash and conversion cycle was down from the year ago period, and we are putting programs in place, such as extended payment terms with our suppliers to achieve further reductions. We still expect capital expenditures of $150 million to $160 million. Much of this is in support of our growth, with major construction in both Shanghai and Dubai. ","In August, we approved future capital investments in Southeast Asia to support our growth. With a new manufacturing facility in Thailand, and a new and advanced technical innovation center in Singapore. We\u2019re also returning a fortune of cash to our shareholders. And through the first three quarters used $343 million for dividends and share repurchases.","At the end of the third quarter, $391 million remained on the current $600 million share repurchase authorization. Note that we now expect to reduce shares outstanding by 1% from fiscal year 2015. This is below our initial projection of 2% it is due to the curtailment of our repurchases related to acquisition activity in 2016.","In summary, 2016 is expected to be another year of strong cash flow providing the funds for continued investment and acquisitions and other growth strategies. Our debt leverage is low and we are well positioned to finance these investments.","Let's move now to our financial guidance. We continue to expect strong growth for fiscal year 2016 and have updated several projections based on our third quarter results and latest outlook for the fourth quarter. At the top-line we expect to grow sales approximately 3% on a reported basis and approximately 6% in constant currency. This is at the upper end of our previous range and applies a fourth quarter increase of approximately 6% on a constant currency basis.","We expect to grow adjusted operating income approximately 7% from $614 million in 2015. In constant currency, our estimated rate of growth is 10%, which is at the midpoint of the previous range. Our guidance for cost savings remains $100 million to $110 million and our current estimate for increased brand marketing is around $15 million, reflecting the spending efficiencies as Lawrence noted. ","As also discussed, we're increasing our guidance range for adjusted earnings per share to $3.75 to $3.79. Our previous guidance for adjusted EPS was the end of $3.68 to $3.75. This increase reflects the favorable third quarter results, partially offset by the effect of currency on our income from unconsolidated operations, a lower reduction of shares outstanding and the rise of vanilla and garlic. ","Excluding the estimated 4 percentage point impact of unfavorable currency rates, this range is an increase of 12% to 13% from adjusted earnings per share of $3.48 in 2015. Based on this fiscal year 2016 range, we're projecting adjusted EPS for the fourth quarter of $1.24 to $1.28. This is an increase of 5% to 8% from adjusted EPS of $1.18 in the fourth quarter of 2015.","To summarize, our projected fiscal year 2016 constant currency growth rates for sales, adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share are at or above our long-term objectives for the business. We look forward to reporting our final results to you in January.","That completes my remarks I'll turn it back over to Lawrence. ","Lawrence Kurzius","Thanks, Mike. As we move to your questions let me leave you with our key takeaways for the quarter. First we had great results, in constant currency, we grew sales 6% with growth in both segments in each region and adjusted operating income was up 15%. We're executing on an effective strategy to drive sales and lower cost. Our CCI program is driving higher margins and profit and generating feel for growth. And based on our year-to-date results and business momentum, we expect 2016 to be a record year for McCormick.","So operator let's take the first question. ","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","Thank you. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question today comes from the line of David Driscoll with Citigroup. Please proceed with your questions.","David Driscoll","Good morning and thank you. ","Lawrence Kurzius","Good morning, David. ","David Driscoll","I had two questions I was hoping to ask. The first question is I just like to hear your thoughts on U.S. food trends and just kind of what you're seeing from the consumer. Specifically it's been pretty strong growth within the spice category, but yet the overall grocery stores have been deflationary. So just like to hear your thoughts about kind of the differential between these two and does it have any implications to your category going forward? And then a follow up if I may.","Lawrence Kurzius","So thanks David. I think that the food generally still continues to be relatively flat and the spice category -- herbs and spices is one of the strongest categories in the store. If you look at a heat map for the entire store you would see that the herb and spice category is about the hottest spot in the store.","David Driscoll","Yeah, I totally understand that. Do you think that there is anything to be worried about in terms of the deflation that we see more broadly in the store versus this exceptional growth or in fact did lower prices in the meat category have maybe a positive linkage to what\u2019s going in spices, that\u2019s really where I'm trying to drive at.","Lawrence Kurzius","We just see the spice category being driven by a number of long-term trends David. There is increased interest in cooking from scratch as Millennials come to be a larger and larger part of the shopping universe, we\u2019ve talked about this a couple of times and we just think that that\u2019s a real advantage for our core category. I'm not so sure that I can speak to change in the trend for the whole center of the store, there does seem to be a shift away from more prepared foods and a move towards closer to fresh more scratch type foods, I think that bodes well for the perimeter of the store and for companies that have businesses that involve scratch cooking and again I think that that\u2019s a positive for our category. ","There\u2019s also a trend towards greater interest in health and wellness and healthier eating and again I think that\u2019s supportive of the herb and spice category, particularly in the U.S. where herbs and spices are in the dietary guidelines for Americans really for the first time ever as a strategy for reducing things like added salt, added sugar in foods. ","David Driscoll","Just one fast follow-up on the\u2026","Lawrence Kurzius","By the way as we see this also on the industrial side of our business, almost left that out. Many of our industrial customers are working with us to change the formulations of their products to make them more natural, to take out things that sound artificial, to make them sound fresher and less processed. ","David Driscoll","A quick follow-up on inflation in pricing, I believe that you said but I just want to confirm that you\u2019ve had a tremendous period here where you\u2019ve actually had price increases on the portfolio, you had I believe it\u2019s been net deflation where you\u2019ve had low single-digit raw material inflation, but this incredible CCI program so on balance net deflation, but it sounds like in your script you\u2019re telling us that going forward if it\u2019s not going to be as good, the inflation is really going to start to pick up for as I think you called out a couple of particular items. But it just sounded like there was a real material change here in the trajectory of inflation. Is that correct, and is that the message?","Lawrence Kurzius","Well there has been a lot of volatility in raw materials over the last couple of years; we\u2019ve had to deal with a long and sustained increase in the cost of one of our iconic raw materials in particular that being pepper. We did this year experienced low single-digit inflation so I wouldn\u2019t say that there was deflation in our cost. CCI doesn\u2019t just go to the cost of the raw material inputs, but looks at every line of the P&L. So a portion of that CCI was in our fixed cost structure and SG&A and so on.","We do see a higher rate of inflation for next year, but we\u2019re really not ready to give guidance on 2017 just yet. We are seeing cost increases that are quite well publicized in a couple of key raw materials, vanilla and garlic. But we also anticipate that we\u2019re going to be able to take pricing actions that will -- between pricing action and CCI, we\u2019ll be up to mitigate those costs. ","What we\u2019re really talking about in the fourth quarter is that some of the pricing actions that we took were against raw material cost increases that occurred in the market but where we may have had some strategic positions. And so as the cost of those materials as they flow through, begin to catch up with the price increases the margin improvement that we\u2019ve been experiencing will begin to narrow. ","Mike do you want to comment?","Mike Smith","No, we\u2019ve seen this trend coming and we\u2019ve taken pricing actions for things like vanilla this year in the U.S. a couple of times; in China we\u2019re taking the garlic action right now. So we\u2019ve been ahead of the curve here and we\u2019re monitoring very closely, but through pricing and CCI upping the level there we feel comfortable we\u2019ll cover the costs going into next year. We\u2019ll provide more guidance in our January earnings call.","David Driscoll","Thank you so much. ","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Ken Goldman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question.","Ken Goldman","Hi good morning and thanks for the questions. ","Lawrence Kurzius","Good morning, Ken. ","Ken Goldman","Just one follow-up as you guys think about the gross margin growth into 4Q, I think you talked about it decelerating, you mentioned garlic and vanilla. Are there any headwinds we should be thinking about as we model the fourth quarter's gross margin or is it really that that you're focused on and you want us to focus on as we think about our models?","Lawrence Kurzius","Well in terms of gross margin those are the really I'd say those are the right things to be focused on. I want to be clear that we're talking about lower rate of margin improvement. So we're not talking about a margin decline. ","The other thing though as that reads through to EPS that's actually the minority of the, kind of the -- what I\u2019ll call the gap between our beat in third quarter and the amount that we're raising our guidance by. The larger impact items is that we are expecting more FX impact particularly on our JV income. That's below the operating profit line that comes through on the unconsolidated line. The big part of that JV income is from a joint venture in Mexico. We\u2019ve seen substantial softening in the peso and just so, while they\u2019re having great results, the translations of those great results back into U.S. dollars is less than we had anticipated when we had our last call.","The other major factor is just the lower rate of share repurchase. As you know we curtail our share repurchases when we have an acquisition between actually completed acquisition activity and for activity around deals that we did not complete there was a curtailment of share repurchase and we end up -- it looks like our share repurchases are going to be more closer to 1% than 2% and that's a substantial factor also. Mike you want to?","Mike Smith","Yeah, I think the other factor we talked about the material cost rising during the year. And the industrial business had a great third quarter, real good mix, we had strong branded food service business, which is high margin for us. And the timing of some of those promotions and some of our customers were basically the same with fourth quarter. For the full year we're very happy with performance, but I wouldn't expect them to grow at the 23% adjusted operating income again in that fourth quarter.","Ken Goldman","Okay, that's helpful. One quick follow-up from me if I can. There was some comment and I may have misheard, I really asking for a clarification, about the relationship with raw material savings and CCI. Could you repeat that and let us know what you meant by that? Because I was hearing it, but I wasn't quite sure exactly what you were saying about whether raw material savings were included in how you calculate CCI and so forth. That would be helpful. ","Mike Smith","Definitely, when we renegotiate with vendors or have raw material savings, they are included in CCI. ","Ken Goldman","When Garlic prices go up or down you're talking about more active\u2026","Mike Smith","More active reformulations, vendor consolidations things like that with market moves [indiscernible].","Ken Goldman","Perfect, thank you so much. ","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Rob Moskow with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your questions.","Robert Moskow","Hi, thank you. Lawrence I think you said that your advertising efficiencies are helping you save about $5 million versus your prior expectations. And it sounds like you're dropping it to the bottom-line, but you're also keeping your operating income guidance for the year unchanged as far as I can tell. So is the $5 million in savings kind of offsetting some of this narrower gross margin trend that you're talking about in fourth quarter owing to costs and I think you also said timing of purchases of customers?","Lawrence Kurzius","No the change in the guidance on advertising really relates to being more efficient with digital and more efficient with our -- the non-working portion of advertising. We're running all of the programs that we intended to. We frankly to spend the $5 million we\u2019d have to waste it. A portion of that change in outlook actually is already captured in Q3. And so this is a change in guidance for the full year and not really specific to the fourth quarter.","Robert Moskow","Okay. I think my question then is that the $5 million benefitted third quarter you could have taken it to the year and raised your op income guidance for the year. But instead fourth quarter is going to be a little bit lower than at least what I thought -- what I had modeled. So is this is a comment about a more challenging gross margin environment in the fourth quarter than you thought? Or maybe there is a potential for upside in 4Q?","Mike Smith","No. Again, I know I point to the fourth quarter, I know you\u2019re talking about operating income specifically. I\u2019m thinking the whole P&L all the way down, but the three headwinds that we talked about, the FX impact, the lower share repurchases, summarize and raw material cost are really the factors that we want to overcome.","Also, I got to say that we are a bit conservative when we look at guidance as we get to the fourth quarter, because it\u2019s our largest quarter. October and November are our highest shipping months. One big order from one customer or one odd shipping day in the last week of the year can swing the number a bit. And so we tend to be careful on the guidance that we give that can be interpreted specific to fourth quarter.","Robert Moskow","Okay. ","Mike Smith","And to put in perspective our first half of the year, our adjusted operating income was up between 5% and 6%. We had a really good third quarter at 12% for a variety of reasons. And fourth quarter is about really our earnings per share so it\u2019s a big quarter for us. So there is a lot of moving parts as Lawrence said.","Robert Moskow","Okay. Just one more question. You have rising cost garlic and vanilla. I was a little unclear, are you considering taking -- you are going to take more pricing, it sounded like you were proactive and already taking some pricing. When will U.S. customers be notified of the pricing? And how do you think the category will respond? You had issues with private label or just really more like lower cost brands couple of years ago. Do you need to expect everyone else to follow?","Lawrence Kurzius","Yeah I don\u2019t want to get too specific about the exact timing of pricing actions, but I know that we will be taking pricing action. And we\u2019ve moved on vanilla twice already this year and expect that that will be one of the areas, where we go up. Vanilla in particular is in a situation where there is a worldwide shortage.","We don\u2019t believe that any competitor the advantage versus McCormick in their -- in that particular commodity. And indeed, we believe that we\u2019re actually in advantaged supply position compared to some of our competitors. We\u2019ve by customers have competitors, who are experiencing defaults and are having difficulty getting vanilla at any price. The raw material and the shortage of that raw material is going to dictate a higher price across the whole market. And we\u2019re confident that we won\u2019t be moving alone.","Robert Moskow","Right. ","Mike Smith","The other thing through these category management tools, we\u2019ve invested in over the past couple of years. We\u2019ve shown when we took the pricing action earlier this year in the U.S. our volume rate of share gain in volume was positive. So we grew volume while taking a price increase. So we\u2019re doing our pricing much smarter than we used to. So we feel when we need to take pricing again, we\u2019ll do that with a minimal impact of volume.","Robert Moskow","Great, thank you so much. ","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Mario Contreras with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. ","Mario Contreras","Hi, good morning. ","Lawrence Kurzius","Good morning, Mario. ","Mario Contreras","So I wanted to follow-up on the U.S. business. You mentioned that at least in terms of the scanner data, we\u2019re seeing market share down, you attributed most of that to the shift to the gourmet organic product line. If we set that aside, can you comment on how some of your other key product lines were performing in terms of market share?","Lawrence Kurzius","If we set that aside, we\u2019d essentially be flat on market share. Earlier was the disruption at the shelf due to the transition from the kind of conventional spices that were in gourmet to the new organic spices that really cause -- that disruption really accounted for nearly all of the share gap.","The -- what else I going to say about that, that\u2019s really, I mean that\u2019s really the whole story there Mario. We\u2019re pretty pleased with our progress overall. And that the gourmet was the one thing. I should add that it really wasn't a surprise when we had our call back -- last call back in June. We were in the middle of it we knew what was happening and we said on the call that this was going to happen and there would be some disruption at the shelf.","I'm pretty encouraged that we'll have the work I'm pretty optimistic that we have completely work through it by the time the real holiday season starts. The shipments that we experienced on gourmet don't really line up with the consumption they were very strong at the end of the quarter as our customers were restocking their shelves. So I'm pretty encouraged throughout that. But again if I could just going back to your original question the scanner data it's really a story about gourmet. ","Mario Contreras","Okay, thanks for that color. One other question, if I could shift to China on the industrial business, you've mentioned recently that there was a partial loss from a customer that was diversifying. Has there been any progress in terms of sourcing that business to other customers or finding some ways to offset some of the deleverage that might have happened there? Thanks.","Lawrence Kurzius","Well we certainly have a broad customer base in China. And we continue to work to build our business with local Chinese based customers both on the restaurant food service side and on the consumer food manufacturer. But this is a very large customer, and so their diversification of their supply base is going to have an impact on our business. It's not something that can just be immediately made up.","I expect that we will grow into it, but this customer had a problem with the supplier that put them in a bad business position. And they've made a strategic decision that they're not going to be sole sourced on anything. And in the products that we supply we were very close to the exclusive supplier. So as that customer diversifies its supplier base it does have an impact on us as well due to their strategy.","Mario Contreras","Okay, thank you very much. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Akshay Jagdale with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. ","Lubi Kutua","Hi good morning this is actually Lubi filling in for Akshay. So you mentioned in your press release that your Kohinoor business in India saw better results this quarter versus last year. I'm just wondering if you can provide a bit more color on sort of what's driving that and how you expect trends in that business to develop over the course of the near future?","Lawrence Kurzius","Sure I'm just going to say a few words about it. Last year we exited a portion of the business that was very low margin and frankly exceptionally complicated. And so we were able to simplify the business, improve the margin and let this with a business that was smaller than it was. And I think that's what the nature of the comments and the script were. We are not going to elaborate a lot on Kohinoor just because it is so small relative to the rest of our business. The Kohinoor business is less than 1% it's approximately 0.5% of our business. And so we're just not going to get too specific comment on a business unit that is that size.","Mike Smith","Our strategy there longer term is to rollout more spices and seasonings and recipe mixes and that's still on track as we talked about in the past. So long-term this is a great market for us.","Lawrence Kurzius","And this is just one of three businesses that we have in India. The other two are on the unconsolidated line they're non-consolidated joint ventures.","Lubi Kutua","Okay, thank you. That's helpful. And then you mentioned in your prepared remarks that you guys are expecting a near-term slowdown in the rate of margin improvement. And I'm assuming that leads into fiscal '17 as well. Now I know you're not providing guidance for fiscal '17 yet, but are there any other sort of high level puts and takes that we should be thinking about that might impact the earnings growth for next year? Thank you.","Lawrence Kurzius","We\u2019re really going to give some pretty robust earnings guidance for 2017 on our January call as we always do, we\u2019re in the middle of putting together budgets right now. So any guidance that we could give would be probably incomplete and too soon. We are giving some visibility that we\u2019re experiencing an increase in the commodity costs on those two particular commodities and we expect our pricing actions to cover that increase. But I don\u2019t think we\u2019re ready to give guidance on margins, other than to the extent that we\u2019re talking about Q4 right now. ","Lubi Kutua","Thank you I\u2019ll pass it on.","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] the next question comes from the line of Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Andrew Lazar","Good morning, everybody.","Lawrence Kurzius","Good morning, Andrew. ","Andrew Lazar","I just wanted to make sure I understand what I should expect around the U.S. consumer business in the fourth quarter, is it that you have incremental visibility now that you\u2019ve got a lot of this shelf reset worked its way through, is it that you have visibility to an acceleration in consumption in the fourth quarter or is it that the over shipment in 3Q could result in a bit of an under shipment in the fiscal fourth quarter?","Lawrence Kurzius","Sure, well first of all that over shipment that you just referred to is just on gourmet and it was really a restocking it\u2019s actually making up an under shipment in Q2 and Q3, when we talk about this at the end of Q2 Andrew, I think we said that we had actually restrained our shipments on gourmet at the end of Q2 to manage the transition, we didn\u2019t wanted to get a lot of returns of the old product as we wanted to transition.","So we were rationing it out a bit and then in Q3 there were some disruption at the shelf and it was really just a refilling of the shelves. And no I don\u2019t expect that we\u2019re going to see a slowdown actually we\u2019re quite encouraged by the strength of our holiday program in the U.S. business as we look into the holiday season. We\u2019re actually pretty optimistic that we\u2019re going to have both strong shipments and strong consumption.","Andrew Lazar","Great, thanks for the\u2026","Lawrence Kurzius","We\u2019re going to go back on air with the purity campaign, we got a tremendous lift from that campaign when we ran it earlier this year. So our holiday advertising will include purity. When we ran that purity campaign we not only got an immediately lift from it, but we also increased our penetration with Millennials, which kind of builds the franchise for the long-term. I think that we\u2019re feeling pretty good about Q4 in the U.S.","Andrew Lazar","Great, that\u2019s helpful clarification there. And then one just last one just more to check my memory, I could remember this incorrectly, but I remember years ago when there was vanilla issue I think coming out of Madagascar there might have been some efforts to try and expand or diversify the sourcing of vanilla into some other markets in growing regions I know it\u2019s kind of hard to do and it takes time for that to develop.","But whether it be areas like in Vietnam and others. I guess whatever became of that is it still happening, but it\u2019s just not big enough to really make up the difference in terms of Madagascar sourcing or it\u2019s more of curiosity on my part.","Lawrence Kurzius","Hey that\u2019s the advantage of having a long memory there Andrew. We did have a vanilla shortage back in 2003-2004 and 2005 and that it\u2019s probably time I came to the company so some of this when happened then is old lore for me. But subsequently there was quite a big market decline and many of the sources dried up due to market pricing and we are ourselves working actively to develop the growth of vanilla in a number of regions of the world then including a pilot operation that we have to grow our own. But those are efforts that will take a little bit of time to bring on stream and right now 85% of the world\u2019s vanilla comes from Madagascar and that\u2019s where the shortages.","A lot of the changes not so much around supply, but around demand as consumers want to move to more natural flavors there is a shift in the market demand away from artificial vanilla and vanillin to being able to label the product straight up vanilla or vanilla bean. So there we do have an effort underway to develop those alternate sources.","Again, I\u2019ll just emphasize that, we believe that nobody has an advantage position right now in the market versus us. And we know just from the customer enquiries that we\u2019re getting, that in fact, we currently have an advantage position versus a number of our competitors.","Andrew Lazar","Great, thank you very much. ","Operator","Thank you. At this time, I will turn the floor back to Lawrence Kurzius for closing remarks.

We're driving this growth through innovation, brand marketing and the expansion of distribution and current consumer markets like Poland and Latin America and expanded support for our industrial customers as they move into new parts of Asia and the Middle East.","The three acquisitions completed this year, the latest being Stubb's in August, are providing an added boost to McCormick sales and will have a full impact in the fourth quarter.","I mentioned that some added 2015 headwinds and these specifically affected our third quarter profit results. In constant currency, adjusted operating income rose 1% from the year ago period, compared to a 4% increase through the first half.","Kohinoor results lowered our growth rate by two percentage points. I'll come back to this topic in a minute.","Aside from this impact, our strong sales in the savings related to our stepped up cost reduction programs are more than offsetting increases in material cost and employee benefit expenses.","Moving to adjusted earnings per share, if you recall at the time of our call back in early July, we got into a double-digit decline from the year ago period. Due to a projected year-on-year increase in the tax rate resulting from the favorable discrete tax items in the third quarter of 2014, our guidance also anticipated some added pressure from currency.","Our actual result for the quarter, excuse me, at $0.85 of adjusted earnings per share was down about 10% from the year ago period right in line with our guidance. We continue to generate strong cash flow and continue to have a balanced use of cash in 2015 with similar amounts invested in the business through acquisitions and return to McCormick shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.","Before I update you on our latest outlook, I want to recognize McCormick employees and our leadership team for their focus on growth, driving high performance and engaging in our success. We\u2019re one month into our fourth quarter and have a positive view for this last and largest quarter of fiscal year 2015.","Gordon is going to provide some specific financial guidance, but let me share a few remarks. Given our year-to-date results and momentum and the added benefit of our acquisitions, we\u2019re tracking toward the upper end of our 4% to 6% sales growth target.","An important factor in this outlook is a continued strength in the category growth for spices and seasonings in the U.S. and our progress in improving our consumer business in this market. Lawrence will have more to share on this.","We've a more conservative outlook for adjusted earnings per share than we had back in early July reflecting the impact of Kohinoor and the recent decline in the Mexican peso, which affects income from our McCormick to Mexico joint venture.","We recognize our profit growth in 2015 is below our long-term target of 9% to 11%. But overall, we feel good about our performance this year and our ability to address these specific headwinds.","As we shared in this morning\u2019s press release, we\u2019ve raised our expected cost savings and will use this fuel for growth for more aggressive brand marketing support during the fourth quarter holiday period. Let\u2019s move on to my comments about Kohinoor.","As many of you recall, in 2011 McCormick purchased a majority interest in India entering the basmati rice business with a strong category share, well established and extensive route to market and a great brand name.","Our intent was to continue to drive the growth of basmati rice sales in India and use this business as a springboard into other branded products such as season rice mixes and herbs and spices.","Since 2011, we built a capable leadership team, increased our distribution and introduced several new products. However certain parts of this business have led to underperformance.","We recently made a decision to exit certain low margin product lines and bring greater focus to higher margin items and our expansion plans. This decision triggered a non-cash impairment charge and some additional cost recorded in the third quarter that Gordon will discuss.","We continue to regard India as a compelling long-term growth market for McCormick. With this action, we expect to improve our Kohinoor business and with our other two joint ventures more fully participate in the enormous growth potential in this market.","Let me circle back with a remark about our stepped up cost reduction programs. Across functions and in countries around the world, McCormick employees are working to lower cost and we\u2019ve added leadership resources behind this effort. We now expect to deliver at least $75 million from our comprehensive continuous improvement program. This is an increase of $10 million from our initial guidance.","Together with $20 million of projected savings from our streamlining actions, we now anticipate total cost savings of at least $95 million in 2015. This is a significant increase from last year's record $69 million in annual cost savings.","Before I turn it over to Lawrence, I want to point to the strong momentum underway as we head into the fourth quarter and our 2016 fiscal year. My enthusiasm and confidence in this business starts with our advantage categories and engaged employees.","Our products are on trend with today's consumer. Across nearly all of our markets, people are exploring new flavors, seeking fresh simple ingredients, focused on source and quality and working to improve their wellness.","Keep these trends in mind as Lawrence provides a business update and you'll see how they continue to shape our growth strategies including innovation, brand positioning and acquisitions.","I\u2019ll turn it over to Lawrence.","Lawrence Kurzius","Thank you Alan and good morning, everyone.","Consumer trends are indeed setting our direction for both of our segments, consumer and industrial. Investors continue to be interested in progress of our U.S. consumer business, that will be the focus of my initial remarks and then I'll move on to several other key consumer markets followed by an update on McCormick's industrial business.","For our U.S. consumer business, we've had actions underway to improve this business for nearly two years now that include accelerating innovation, building our brand equity and winning at retail. Our quarterly business results in 2015 are showing steady progress with these actions.","Our largest category, spices and seasonings, remained strong with consumption up 5% during the third quarter. The same day that indicates we grew consumption of McCormick brands spices and seasonings 2% this period, which is the sequential improvement from a 1% increase in the second quarter. We'll continue to work toward a growth rate that is at parity with the category.","Within this broader category, we are particularly pleased with the performance of our Gourmet line. We launched about six months ago consumption results for the fourth quarter show a 4% increase maintaining a strong pace we set last quarter.","For recipe mixes, our next largest category, we achieved a 23rd consecutive month of share gain, driven by innovation and effective marketing for both new products and core items. Our Liquid McCormick Skillet Sauces in the market for a year now have reached a category share of 10% and continue to grow.","During this period we also had standout sales results with Zatarain\u2019s, Grillmates and Kitchen Basics.","On the innovation front, we discussed most of our new second quarter products back in the July call including additional varieties of gluten-free recipe mixes, new slow cooker skillet sauces and Kitchen Basics stock cubes. Our latest breakthrough innovation is herb grinders, which are just starting to appear on retail shelves.","Herb grinders conveniently deliver the flavor and aroma of fresh herbs. The herbs are in larger pieces and gently dried through a proprietary process that protects color and flavor. We're excited about the results of this product in consumer testing.","Two thirds of consumers use the grinder every three days both before and during meal preparation as well as at the table. As you can appreciate, we\u2019ve created a significant opportunity to convert consumers that currently purchase packaged fresh herbs to our new grinders.","In building brand equity, our 2015 emphasis has been on easy ways to prepare healthy meals, new product news and freshness and purity. You'll be hearing a lot from us this quarter as brand marketing increased nearly 10% as planned across all markets for the portion here in the U.S. to support a new purity campaign.","We're introducing a distinct consumer facing message on freshness and purity, one that lets consumers know the McCormick purchases the best spices and herbs from around the world. We know the origin and we control the quality. In a recent large industry recall of ground cumin we were able to reassure our consumers of the purity of McCormick\u2019s cumin.","We also have additional news on wellness as it relates to our product. Last quarter, we shared with you that the U.S. Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee recommended to the Federal Government that the 2015 dietary guidelines encouraged the use of spices and herbs as a flavor alternative to sodium.","This summer the USDA issued a recommendation to school nutritionist to use herbs and spices for more appealing taste and as a way to reduce sodium. In fact the new tag line of their program is \u201cSpice It Up.\u201d","Also for people 65 and older, the USDA recommended using spices and herbs to compensate for changes in the sense of smell and taste. While this is top of mind for a lot of consumers these days and many of them are equating this with certain attributes like gluten-free, non-GMO and organic.","To continue to shape our product portfolio for the evolving consumer we've recently committed to labeling more than 70% of our McCormick brand spices, herbs and extracts in the U.S. non-GMO within one year. Appearing on retail shelves right now is our first product to carry the non-GMO designation, McCormick brand vanilla extract.","In addition, by the end of 2016, 80% of our gourmet line will be organic, up from 10% today. This news is being well received by our consumers. We're eager to get these products in front of consumers and are continuing to evaluate related initiatives in the U.S. and other markets.","In addition to high impact brand marketing messages, we need an effective means of delivery, which includes digital marketing. McCormick is not alone in this shift toward digital marketing as a better way to reach consumers and to achieve the higher ROI on our spending.","In 2015, we're planning for digital marketing to reach one third of our global advertising, up from 11% in 2010. We put a lot of effort and resources into staying at the forefront of digital and eCommerce and these investments are paying off.","I am proud to share that McCormick ranked number five out of 114 food brands in the U.S. market on L2\u2019s latest Digital IQ Index. This firm scores companies on several key factors including digital marketing presence and social media community size, content and engagement.","The Digital IQ Index also considers eCommerce effectiveness. For the eCommerce channel, we're equally proud of the recent award from Amazon which named McCormick Supplier of The Year for grocery.","Just as important, if not more so are our efforts and resources devoted to partnering with our retail customers. Slide 15 shows the timeline of activity that has been underway for about two years now and leading up to our latest investment in category management tools and resources.","Compared to last year we have increased this investment fivefold focusing on price modeling and assortment optimization across our top categories.","This quarter with an expanded team we're mobilizing our insights and tools to optimize sales and profit for us and for our customers. We're in the very early stage of this activity and just beginning to share insights with retail customers, I am excited about the potential for these new tools and customer discussions as we head into 2016.","Another area of investor interest has been our consumer business in China. We continue to achieve double-digit constant currency sales growth in this market in contrast to some other consumer products companies.","Given the broader impact of the economy on consumer retail purchases, to date our business has seen less of an impact and our leadership in China is cautiously optimistic. In our top three categories, average spend per household has continued to grow and McCormick is gaining share through brand marketing, in-store execution and continued geographic expansion including cross-selling of our McCormick brand in Central China following the acquisition of Wuhan Asia-Pacific Condiments.","Moving to our Europe, Middle East and Africa region, EMEA, we had strong 18% constant currency sales growth in the third quarter, despite some challenging retail environment especially in the U.K.","We achieved increases in both the U.K. and France with a significant increase in brand marketing and from innovation including grilling product and Vahine brand dessert items. In both Poland and Russia, the big driver has been expended distribution including with new retailers and our acquisition of Drogheria & Alimentari give a further boost to sales adding 11 percentage points of our increase.","Turning now to our industrial business, I am going to start as I did last quarter with our results in the EMEA. The third quarter of 2015 marked another period of outstanding sales growth as our team in this market is winning on all fronts, particularly with quick service restaurants.","We're winning with product innovation, distribution gains and supporting the geographic expansion of these customers. Likewise we're expanding into new markets align with the food manufacturers we supply, including the new facility we have under construction in the Middle East.","In the Americas region, we had a solid performance but mixed results. The growth this quarter came from pricing, our Brand Aromatics acquisition and sales from our operation in Mexico. However these gains were partially offset by lower sales to quick service restaurant customers that are working through a period of weak consumer demand in the U.S.","We're partnering with these customers on ways for them to drive their sales growth and are also selectively building relationship with other food service customers in the U.S.","In our Asia Pacific Region, we had a strong increase in new industrial product shipped from our operation in Australia. In China, the recovery in base sales to quick service restaurants has continued from the year ago period and these customers were adversely impacted by consumer concerns regarding a quality issue from a supplier of protein.","To wrap up my remarks, employees and business leaders throughout the company are driving our success. We had good momentum heading into the fourth quarter and beyond with new products, incremental marketing, distribution expansion opportunities and tools for a better retail partnership.","Our acquisition pipeline is strong. We've aggressive cost saving programs underway and a culture of participation and high performance.","Thank you. And it\u2019s my pleasure to turn it over now to Gordon.","Gordon Stetz","Thanks Lawrence and good morning, everyone.","As both Alan and Lawrence indicated, we had some very strong performance in parts of our business along with significant headwinds. Aside from the Kohinoor performance, our overall results were generally in line with the guidance we shared with you back in June.","Let\u2019s start with a closer look at McCormick\u2019s third quarter sales and profit, followed by comments on our cash flow and balance sheet and then the details of our latest guidance.","On a constant currency basis, the underlying growth in sales was a step up from what we've seen year-to-date with a 7% increase that included two percentage points from our acquisitions.","Taking a look at our consumer business, Slide 21 shows that we grew third quarter consumer business sales 7% in constant currency, driven by higher volume and product mix for our base business as well as a full quarter of sales from the Drogheria & Alimentari acquisition and about two weeks of Stubb's.","We grew sales in the Americas with our largest increases in recipe mixes, gourmets, Kitchen Basics and Zatarain\u2019s in the U.S. Product innovation and brand marketing support particularly in digital as Lawrence described are driving these results.","We\u2019re pleased with our progress based on the latest consumption data. Although still a small part of our business, sales in Latin America had another quarter of double-digit sales growth as we expand distribution across a number of markets from our production base in El Salvador.","In EMEA we continue to achieve strong sales performance and had the added benefit of DNA sales this quarter. The core business growth was broad based with increases in each of our top markets driven by our higher brand marketing, our new product innovation and expanded distribution.","In constant currency, we grew consumer business sales in the Asia Pacific Region, had a double-digit rate in both China and Australia again this quarter.","In China sales of bullion products were particularly strong. In India, lower pricing more than offset a slight increase in volume and product mix. The consumer business in total our third quarter adjusted operating income was down from the year ago period.","In constant currency adjusted operating income declined 3% from the year ago period with the impact of sales growth and cost savings offset by the unfavorable impact of material cost and benefit expense. In addition, operating income from Kohinoor was down $3 million from the third quarter of 2014.","Turning to our industrial business, we grew third quarter sales a robust 8% in constant currency from the year ago period. This increase was led by higher volume and product mix followed by pricing actions taken in response to higher material costs and by sales of Brand Aromatics that we acquired earlier this year.","As shown on Slide 27, sales of Brand Aromatics contributed 2.5 percentage points to our growth in the Americas. We also had higher pricing for total sales increase of 5% in constant currency.","In the third quarter, strong sales from our operation in Mexico were largely offset by continued weakness in U.S. sales to quick service restaurant customers.","Our industrial business in EMEA continues to post impressive growth with sales this period up 15% in constant currency, higher volume along with our CCI actions is driving greater profitability for this business too.","As we indicated, this is the third year of exceptional performance as we support the growth and geographic expansion of leading quick service restaurants and food manufacturers in this region.","We grew industrial business sales in the Asia Pacific region 12% in constant currency. In China, we are benefiting from further recovery in demand from quick service restaurants and in Australia, our growth includes new product wins with these customers.","Adjusted operating income for the industrial business rose 5% from the third quarter of 2014. In constant currency, the growth reached 12% with the benefit of higher sales and our CCI program more than offsetting the unfavorable impact of material cost and increased employee benefit expense.","Let\u2019s turn to Slide 31. While adjusted operating income excluding special charges declined 4% if we also exclude the impact of unfavorable currency, our third quarter result was up slightly from the year ago period. This is despite the $3 million decline in Kohinoor profit.","Gross profit margin declined 50 basis points. Included in this result is the impact of Kohinoor, which lowered the gross profit margin by 54 basis points. So we're seeing an underlying sequential improvement from the first half of 2015, as the benefit of our cost savings actions build and pricing actions are implemented.","The 54 basis point reduction to gross profit from Kohinoor was comprised of $3 million of special charges included in cost of goods sold, which represents an inventory write down, directly related to the decision to discontinue the sales of certain lower margin product lines along with a $2 million year-on-year decline in Kohinoor's gross profit prior to that special charge.","Even with this third quarter result, we still expect our fiscal year 2015 gross profit margin to be comparable to 2014.","As a percentage of net sales, our selling, general and administrative expense rose 60 basis points due in part to increased employee benefit expense. In addition to higher retirement benefit expense there were increases in incentive compensation for those parts of the business performing ahead of plan.","Also the percentage increase in brand marketing this period at 5% or $2 million exceeded our rate of sales growth this quarter.","As described in this morning's press release, there were three components to the special charges we recorded in the third quarter. $10 million for the non-cash impairment of the Kohinoor brand name, $3 million for special charges and cost of goods sold as I just described and $2 million of charges that related to previously announced streamlining actions in EMEA and North America.","For the fiscal year, we now estimate total charges of $65 million. This assumes $2 million of additional charges in the fourth quarter.","Below the operating income line, the tax rate this quarter was 30%, an increase from 21% in the third quarter of 2014, which was the primary reason why we guided to a double-digit year-on-year decline in adjusted earnings per share this period.","If you recall, in the third quarter of 2014, we had a significant favorable impact from discrete tax items. We continue to expect a tax rate of approximately 29% in the fourth quarter of 2015 based on our current outlook.","Income from unconsolidated operations rose this quarter. This increase was largely the net result of three factors. Underlying growth in our unconsolidated income led by our joint venture in Mexico, the unfavorable impact of a dramatic decline in the Mexican Peso and a favorable $2 million impact related to an allocation of the $13 million in special charges to Kohinoor's minority interest.","As a result of the increased weakness of the Mexican Peso, we now anticipate our income from unconsolidated operations for the fiscal year to be up slightly versus our previous estimate of at least 10%.","At the bottom line, third quarter 2015 adjusted earnings per share was $0.85. As you can see on Slide 34, this was a $0.10 decline from the year ago period due in large part to the tax rate and adjusted operating income.","Turning next to Slide 35, we've summarized highlights for cash flow and the quarter end balance sheet. Our year-to-date cash flow from operations was $317 million compared to $276 million in the year ago period. This year we've returned $226 million of cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases and expect to be back in the market for share repurchases this quarter.","We used $211 million of cash and short term borrowings for our three acquisitions and our debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was at 2.0% at quarter end, slightly above our target of 1.5% to 1.8%.","Our balance sheet remains sound. We're generating strong cash flow and we're well positioned to fund investments to drive growth including future acquisitions.","I'll wrap up with our latest financial outlook for fiscal year 2015. Alan already provided perspective on this, so let me quickly run through the numbers. We reaffirm our expectation to gross sales and constant currency at the upper end of a 4% to 6% range.","Acquisitions will contribute about one percentage point to this increase and we continue to estimate that currency will reduce our sales growth rate by five percentage points in 2015.","We now expect to be at the lower end of a 6% to 7% constant currency growth rate for adjusted operating income from a 2014 base of $608 million. We now anticipate that unfavorable currency rates will reduce operating income growth by four percentage points up from three percentage points.","For operating income on a reported basis, we expect a 7% to 8% decline from $603 million in 2014. This includes a $65 million estimated impact from special charges up from our prior estimate of $54 million with the increase due to the third quarter charges.","We also expect to be at the lower end of $3.47 to $3.54 in adjusted earnings per share. This range assumes a $0.13 unfavorable impact on operating income from currency. On a reported basis, we expect earnings per share of $3.11 to $3.18 including a $0.36 impact from special charges.","For fiscal year 2015, we continue to expect another year of strong cash flow. This is providing funds for our dividend payments, our acquisition activity, debt pay down and share repurchase activity.","Let\u2019s turn now to your questions and then some closing remarks from Alan. Operator, we're ready for the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Please proceed with your questions.","Andrew Lazar","Good morning, everybody.","Alan Wilson","Good morning, Andrew.","Gordon Stetz","Good morning, Andrew.","Andrew Lazar","Hi, two quick questions for me. I guess the first with McCormick now looking for the full year EPS towards the lower end of the range and consensus being more in the middle of the range currently, I guess it seems like with the incremental CCI savings you now expect, you probably could have made up that profit shortfall had you decided to let those savings flow through to the bottom line rather than reinvesting a good chuck of it in the fourth quarter as you've talked about.","So maybe can you talk a little bit about the trade-off and the decision to up marketing in the fourth quarter and kind of more specifically what that\u2019s going behind?","Alan Wilson","Yes, we were investing both in the U.S. and in Europe behind our brands and we think that\u2019s really important and critical as we\u2019re trying to build share and support the new products that we\u2019ve introduced. So we think that is a good investment. We\u2019re really happy with our CCI program that we have the ability to provide that fuel as opposed to trying to offset some of these headwinds.","Andrew Lazar","Okay. If we -- Lawrence, if we think about some of the progress that you\u2019re continuing to make in the core consumer business in the U.S., I know that you\u2019re just starting to have more of those let\u2019s call it robust discussions with customers given the capabilities that you\u2019ve got now.","But one of the key efforts for last couple of quarters was sort of getting those price points in the right place on some of those top key items right in the urban spice space.","Is there any way you can share a couple of metrics with us on maybe where you are in that progress? Do you now have those at the right price points? Are you most of the way there and is that's what's driving the improved sequential consumption trends we\u2019re seeing?","Lawrence Kurzius","Okay. Thanks Andrew. I think that that's a good part of it. We\u2019re really pleased with the progress that we\u2019ve made on our management of price points with our customers. When I talk about being at the beginning of a process here in our prepared remarks there is really in reference to the use of the new tools that we added in the middle of third quarter.","So we have time set up with most of our leading customers in the U.S. to work through analytics with them around both pricing and on assortment and the two really need to work both together. We've had a new modeling tool for both pricing and assortment. They work together in tandem and we expect to get through about 50% of the ACV of our customers by the end of the fourth quarter of this year, so that\u2019s pretty good progress.","In terms of implementing, what we\u2019ve done so far on the price points on those key items, we\u2019ve made a lot of progress and that is part of the reason or the strength of our business. But we don\u2019t want to underestimate the value of the other things that we\u2019re doing in terms of innovation and in A&P to drive our core business.","So one of the other things that you\u2019re starting to see now is innovation in the core part of our business with things like the herb grinders and you\u2019re seeing renovation of our core business to kind of take away the reason for being for some of these smaller brands that have made some inroads against us.","So the extension of -- the expansion of organic within our gourmet line, the non-GMO labeling on our core spice line, these are all important consumer elements that go beyond price to get at the consumer and build the strength of our core brands.","We\u2019re very committed to getting not only growing that core business, but to winning market share in that business as well.","Andrew Lazar","Okay. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Alexia Howard with Bernstein. Please go ahead with your question.","Alexia Howard","Good morning, everyone, a couple of quick questions. As a follow-up to Andrew's are you able to actually quantify what the organic ex-acquisition sales growth was for the U.S. consumer business?","And then as a follow-up on a different topic, you mentioned acquisitions a couple of times and obviously you\u2019ve moved into the wet sauce business with the Stubb's acquisition in a very small way. Could you give us an idea geographically and by category what your priorities are there, thank you?","Alan Wilson","Sure. Let me take the acquisition real quickly and then I\u2019ll ask Lawrence to talk more about the U.S. consumer business, but where we\u2019re targeting with our acquisitions is again in adjacent categories where flavor can matter and you've seen with the Stubb's acquisition an example of that, we\u2019re moving into some areas that are more closely related to what we do, but not directly. So we have room to grow there and Stubb's specifically puts us into more of a natural and interesting category.","Our Stubb's business doesn\u2019t have high fructose corn syrup. It\u2019s gluten free and so it differentiates itself and is premium in the category. So we feel good about that.","The other acquisitions that we\u2019re making, we\u2019re continuing to target are those leading companies in markets where we have either a small presence or no presence and so that\u2019s what we did with D&A this year.","And we\u2019re also targeting more flavor acquisitions for our Industrial business. So while we\u2019ve done very few over the last 10 years, we see that as an opportunity to really build and grow our business and I\u2019ll let Lawrence answer the question, I\u2019m sorry, Gordon answer the question on\u2026","Gordon Stetz","So, Alexia in terms of how much -- the only acquisition in the Americas that would have contributed to any consumer growth would have been Stubb's and since it was just the last couple of weeks of the quarter it\u2019s very small, it was 0.2 on the total Americas and the U.S. drives that number as you can imagine given the size of our market.","So the 2.4% volume mix in Americas would also be directionally correct for the U.S. since it\u2019s a big part of it.","Alexia Howard","Great. Thank you very much. I\u2019ll pass it on.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from the line of David Driscoll with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.","David Driscoll","Great. Thank you. Good morning.","Alan Wilson","Good morning.","Gordon Stetz","Good morning.","David Driscoll","Could you talk a little bit about the sales guidance, the 4% to 6%? Can you break it down, price and volume? And then most importantly, just talk to me about what's driving the upside here?","Because obviously when the foreign exchange gets more negative we would assume that you would try to raise price in response to it. So I'm really just trying to get a sense as to what's driving the upside on that organic? Or, it's not organic, it's the constant currency sales growth.","Gordon Stetz","Hi David, it\u2019s Gordon. So pricing -- our outlook on that hasn\u2019t really changed for the year. So of the 4% to 6%, we\u2019ve said all along, it\u2019s going to be in the 1% to 2% range, especially as we pass through the commodity cost increases on the industrial side and those adjustment mechanisms have been reading through.","When we first started to guide towards the upper end of that range, part of that was based on the acquisitions that we were completing during the year. So that helps us contribute about another 1% to the growth of that number.","But I would also point to the fact that also the confidence is in the underlying base business, where we've seen strong organic growth, pretty broad-based candidly. So that\u2019s also allowing us to feel good about the upper end of that range.","David Driscoll","And if I could just follow on, on this, on the consumer side: so profits are down here. You've got the issue on the Indian business. But what was the description in terms of -- if its profits are down something like $8 million, $7.5 million year-on-year, what's the driver here?","Again, just many of your comments are extremely positive, but then when you just look at the OI line on consumer it's down. So what's the simple one-liner here beyond the Indian business problem, in terms of why OI goes down in consumer?","Gordon Stetz","Well FX obviously is a large headwind on a reported basis because that obviously has been a factor on both the reported top line and bottom line. So that obviously is one we continue to wrestle with and as you heard in my comments it's gotten slightly worse on the operating income line as we've upped the negative impact on the total company to 4% versus the prior three.","So FX, Kohinoor and part of this also in terms of profit realization has been the commodity cost environment where commodity cost have been hitting us hard earlier in the year as we've indicated the CCI program was going to help offset that as we progressed through the year.","So we are seeing the sequential improvement in the gross profit margin with the expectation that fourth quarter we see a rebound in both gross profit and operating income. So part of it is also the timing of material cost increases and how those are being offset by the CCI program itself.","David Driscoll","Okay. Thank you. I'll pass it along.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead with your question.","Robert Moskow","Thank you. I had two questions. How big is India today in terms of sales and profit? I think when you bought it, it was about $85 million in sales. Just it might help us model for next year.","And then secondly for Lawrence, the pricing trends for the company are a little below what we had expected. We were thinking pricing would be up about 2% this year, especially considering the higher commodity costs.","You said you'd be 50% done by fourth quarter with all the category management efforts; but are you tracking a little behind where you thought you would be at this point in terms of pricing? And maybe it's also a question for Gordon, is the pricing for the company a little behind, given the commodity cost environment?","Alan Wilson","In terms of the size of the business it\u2019s about a $50 million business and while we don\u2019t disclose specific profitability, I\u2019d say it\u2019s not in a strong profit position, now clearly by some of the actions we're taking.","So it\u2019s not a strong profit generator and has teetered on loss positions in the current year. So it\u2019s been in a loss position this year and that\u2019s part of the reason for us taking the actions that we did. I don't know if Lawrence \u2026","Lawrence Kurzius","I\u2019ll take the second question. Rob on the category management effort, I want to separate that from the idea of price increase. We're working to manage to get our key items to the critical price points within our existing spend in promotion by managing the use of promotional funds and directing them towards the most productive purpose.","In our U.S. business we've not taken a price increase in 2014 or 2015. So what is reading through maybe in the Nielsen as movement in price is more the way Nielsen reports units and the amount of weight per package.","But there hasn\u2019t been any kind of pricing action in the U.S. either last year or this year and our promotional spending is pretty much in line with what it has been historically. All of that category management work has redirected existing promotional fronts.","Robert Moskow","And Gordon, is the pricing trends for the company overall in line with expectations for the year?","Gordon Stetz","Yes. I\u2019d say yes, and also in terms of the gross margin other than the events surrounding Kohinoor, we've talked about the sequential improvement in the timing and it is lining up with the expectations that we had as we've talked to you throughout the year.","Robert Moskow","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The next question is from line of Brett Hundley with BB&T. Please go ahead with your question.","Brett Hundley","Hey. Good morning, guys.","Alan Wilson","Good morning","Gordon Stetz","Good morning.","Brett Hundley","Alan, I wanted to push back a little bit on an answer you gave earlier in the Q&A here on elevated brand marketing expense. You talked about pursuing share, looking to support new innovation. Presumably that would have been planned out ahead of time, I am guessing.","And so I wanted to drill in a little bit further and get a sense of whether Q3 was running a little bit more than expected and you're upping Q4, whether that might be macro-related in the U.S. and Europe, expectations on a macro maybe due to your own performance thus far or maybe its additive to your performance.","Maybe your performance has been good thus far and you really want to push hard against some of your competitors. I was just looking for a bit little more clarity there, if you don't mind.","Alan Wilson","Yes. We're seeing good topline performances as we've talked about, but we're also investing behind a purity campaign, which is fundamentally that fresh tastes better and our pure tastes better and so we believe that\u2019s the message that's resonating with consumers and we want to make sure that we have enough engine in the tank for what is our most important quarter of the year.","This is where a lot of our purchases come and so this is the time to invest and while we did have good plans going in, we've see the opportunity to invest a little more.","Brett Hundley","Thank you; I appreciate that. And then Gordon, a question for you just on CCI. You can correct me if I'm wrong, excuse me, but I believe CCI got off to a slower start this year; and I am curious if you have any sense on, A, how efficiencies and cost savings can pace as we move into fiscal 2016. So that's the first part of the question.","And then secondly, I'm also curious what the bottom line drop looks like relative to other years on a percentage basis? And the reason I ask that is just given your organic announcement on gourmet; I am curious if there's added cost to tracing and tracking your capabilities there and what that means for potential cost saves falling to the bottom line. So a two-part question there, if that makes sense.","Alan Wilson","I am going to ask Mike Smith to take the CCI question.","Mike Smith","Good morning. I would also like to echo Alan's, thanks to the McCormick employees for really helping us provide more fuel for growth this year. It's their efforts that we've been able to do that and you're right, we did say earlier in the year that CCI was going to build as we address the commodity increases we saw come into 2015 a lot of our programs are really hitting now and into the fourth quarter.","We did the North American effectiveness initiative, which as you remember we've added more resources at the leadership position and elsewhere to drive more CCI programs and we're seeing success there and we're also seeing additional -- I think the units are working together more collaboration across functions and really driving more savings and it's setting us up well for next year as you alluded to.","We're very comfortable with the $95 million in total for CCI and the special projects at this point.","Brett Hundley","Okay. Thank you.","Alan Wilson","Comment on the organic, McCormick is already the number one brand of organic herbs and spices in the grocery store and so with the action that we're taking on our gourmet line to make it 90% organic by this time next year, it just builds on a capability that we've already got.","So this is not going to add to our fixed cost structure in any meaningful way that we've already got a great deal of capability around organic. But raw material themselves are undeniably more expensive than regular spices and that\u2019s reflected in the premium price that organic products command in the market place. It's not just a scarcity issue, it costs more money to produce organic ingredients and products and the same is true for us.","This is why we're starting really what the gourmet end of our line because the gourmet products can support a premium price.","Brett Hundley","Okay. Very clear. And Alan, if I can just sneak in one yes or no question for you, you talked about potential M&A and you named industrial with flavors. We understand that there might be a global natural colors portfolio for sale, and I am just curious if natural colors are an area that you might want to get into.","Alan Wilson","We look for areas more where flavor can matter and it\u2019s hard to do a yes or no question because in almost every deal we look at, there is some things we like and some things we don\u2019t.","And so rather than say yes or no to that particular opportunity, I would say we are looking to expand our industrial portfolio to better serve our customers and it's really geared around where flavor matters","Brett Hundley","Thanks guys.","Alan Wilson","Sure","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Jonathan Feeney with Athlos Research. Please proceed with your question.","Jonathan Feeney","Good morning; thanks very much.","Alan Wilson","Good morning, Jonathan.","Jonathan Feeney","I wanted to -- a little bit of a follow-up on a question Rob asked about pricing; but maybe bigger picture about the earnings guidance, maybe if it tells us something. When you go back to -- when I look at the -- below your 9% to 11% earnings growth that we've seen for the past few years, couple of years anyway, currency has clearly played a huge role in that.","Then I would go back to digging through -- you had about three or four quarters back in '08, '09, where currency just crushed you at like twice the magnitude. And the difference, it seems to me, is that -- I know you had some more acquisition tailwind back then, but you priced a lot more aggressively.","And so it leads me -- I guess two questions. First would be, I guess, what's different this time? It seems like especially in overseas markets that are affected by currency it seems like you're a little bit more shy to price to that currency -- and cost obviously, as I know a lot of these costs wind up being denominated in something like dollars, if not explicitly dollars.","And I guess secondly, when you look at that 9% to 11% earnings algorithm, it seems like it's the right thing to do for your business, to balance volume and pricing like that in the face of currency headwinds. Do you think that maybe 9% to 11% earnings wise, is that a signal that maybe that's too much as far as what the core business should be able to sustain prudently? Those are my questions. Thanks.","Alan Wilson","Thanks, I will answer the pricing question and we can kind of get into the long term discussion, but specifically to pricing what we saw in 2009, '10 and '11 and '12 was extreme commodity inflation and so we're trying to respond to that.","We've had some of that in this year and we recognize that what we're really focused on is getting our price thresholds right in the marketplace and that\u2019s not unique to the U.S. it\u2019s around the world.","And so we've taken a pause a bit on pricing. We've taken some pricing to offset currency in some of our markets, but our focus has been more on getting the right price thresholds and making sure that we're not giving consumers or customers a reason to go somewhere else. So that\u2019s really what we've seen more this year.","Around the overall EPS guidance of 9% to 11% we still feel pretty confident that over time that that is an achievable target. Obviously year to year we have to make adjustments based on what's happening. This year we had the particular headwinds around pension costs and around currency.","While we offset some commodity inflation, but we still feel over time that that's the right targets.","Remember that includes some contribution from acquisitions in the years and this year while we made a couple acquisitions, they have a minimum impact on the earnings for the year, but we'll see those flow through next year.","Jonathan Feeney","Great. Well, thank you very much.","Alan Wilson","Thanks Jonathan.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Eric Katzman of Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your questions.","Eric Katzman","Hi. Good morning, everybody.","Alan Wilson","Good morning, Eric.","Eric Katzman","A couple of questions; hopefully we can kick through them quickly. Did you say whether in the U.S. you lost share in consumer, or did you maintain it and I think, Lawrence, you may have said our goal is to maintain share and I always thought it was to increase the share, albeit even within a growing category. Maybe you could just clarify a couple of those things.","Lawrence Kurzius","Sorry Eric, in our two core categories in herbs and spices, we did have a share decline in this quarter. It was less than a share point. We continue to improve in this area and although the prepared remarks did say we want to get to parity growth with the category, that\u2019s a mile post along the way and a journey.","It\u2019s hard to talk to -- the real conversation we want to have with retailers ultimately is about driving category growth and driving consumers to the segment and to section of the store and it\u2019s hard to have that conversation until our growth rate catches up with that of the category. So yes, we want to get to parity growth with the category, but certainly that\u2019s not where we want to stop.","On recipe mixes, it\u2019s a different story. That\u2019s where we started out, but we've really turned the tide there pretty convincingly and we did have a share gain on receipt mixes, our second core category during the quarter and I think in our remarks we said we had 23 consecutive months now of share gains in that category.","Eric Katzman","Okay. And then on the -- just to switch up again, on the industrial it seems as if some of the U.S. QSRs, for example, are doing a bit better and I think you noted some weakness there. Is that a function of menus and product introductions or something? Maybe just touch a little bit on that and then I have then the last question.","Lawrence Kurzius","Yes, it's more a function of what we sell -- what the products we sell to them go in and where their growth is coming from. So for instance one of our customers launched all day breakfast. We've very little bit that goes in there for that customer. So even if they're doing a little better, it doesn\u2019t impact us.","We tend to be in the U.S. on the core menu items and outside the U.S. more on the product innovation and limited time offers, which is why we're seeing a little bit of a disparity in the results.","Eric Katzman","Okay. And then just kind of like the CCI figure, it sounds like -- remind me, Gordon that's a -- like I know you look at it very conservatively versus other companies in their quotes and so the $95 million is obviously for this fiscal year.","But does the fact that it's ramping up, I think there was a previous question in this regard, does the fact that it's ramping up as the year progresses suggest that fiscal '16 can also be quite a good year?","And then related to that, Alan maybe I'm crazy, but did you mention earlier in the year about a certain level of SG&A savings into fiscal '16 and how does CCI figure into that, if my memory is correct?","Lawrence Kurzius","Yes, your memory is correct. We talked about leveraging SG&A and that\u2019s a lot of what we except to get from and are getting from our restructurings. I'll let Gordon specifically about that.","Gordon Stetz","So there is wraparound effect of CCI from the current year programs into next year and you alluded to the SG&A, which indeed we talked about a 100 basis point improvement.","So some of that started this year, but there will be the full year benefit going into next year because with some of the actions that we took and announced this year only had a partial year impact. So you certainly have that wraparound benefit.","And then there are the programs within the year that kind of go into the base and then we start all over again next year and there is a new hill to climb and our teams every year find a way and to Mike's earlier comments, they find a way to get to savings targets that we need.","So we're still developing what those programs are for next year, but certainly there is going to be wraparound from the actions we've taken this year.","Eric Katzman","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. I'll pass it on. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the floor over to Mr. Alan Wilson for closing remarks.","Alan Wilson","I want to thank everybody for your questions and for participating in the call today. Consumer demand for flavor is rising and driving demand for our products. Our geographic presence and product portfolio are expanding and align with the move towards healthier eating, fresh ingredients, ethnic cuisine and bold taste.","In 2015, we're achieving strong sale growth and significant cost savings. We look forward to reporting to you on our continued progress as we wrap up 2015 and continue to build momentum for the future.","Joyce Brooks","Thank you, Alan, and thanks to everyone for joining us today.

This is Joyce Brooks, McCormick's Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you for joining today's call to review the company's third quarter financial results and latest 2013 outlook. We've posted a set of slides to accompany the call at our website, ir.mccormick.com. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, the conference is being recorded. With me on the call are Alan Wilson, Chairman, President and CEO; and Gordon Stetz, Executive Vice President and CFO. Please note that today's presentation contains projections and other forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those projected. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or other factors.","As seen on Slide 2, our forward-looking statement also provides information on risk factors that could affect our financial results. It's now my pleasure to turn it over to Alan.","Alan D. Wilson","Thanks, Joyce. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. I'm pleased with the progress we're making in 2013 to advance McCormick's growth initiatives in operations around the world. We've had strong product innovation activity. Our recently acquired business, WAPC, is off to a great start. Plans are in place for a significant increase in our fourth quarter brand marketing, and we're again raising our projected cost savings from our CCI program.","We continue to operate in a difficult environment and weak third quarter results in certain parts of our business have put pressure on our projected 2013 financial results. While we have moderated our sales and profit outlook for 2013, we believe that the growing consumer demand for flavor, along with our brand leadership, CCI program and solid fundamentals will lead to a stronger performance in 2014.","For this morning's call, I want to begin with our third quarter results and then move on to a review of current market conditions and our outlook for fiscal 2013. I'll conclude with an update on progress with our growth initiatives.","Turning to third quarter results on Slide 4. We grew sales 4%. This was driven largely by increased sales in our consumer business led by the acquisition of WAPC and a shift in sales from the fourth quarter. Industrial sales decreased just slightly, and we were glad to see some improvement in China this quarter.","Gross profit margin was even with the year ago period, following the decline in each of the past 4 quarters. This improvement was primarily due to a favorable mix of business and our CCI cost savings.","Operating income rose 3%, which is below our expectations for the quarter as the profit impact of the sales shortfall in the industrial business was greater than we expected. Despite this pressure, we continue to invest in our brand marketing this period. The favorable tax rate provided an offset to the operating income result, and at the bottom line, we reported earnings per share of $0.78. This is in line with the EPS guidance that we provided in June and even with EPS in the third quarter of 2012.","For our consumer business, we grew sales 8% and operating income 9%. Our acquisition of WAPC and the shift in sales together contributed 10% to sales. I'll comment first on the sales shift and then address the underlying decline in consumer sales for the quarter.","As in past years, we offered a holiday display program to customers to encourage adequate inventory and early displays for the fall cooking period and holiday season. This year, we had a particularly strong response with twice the number of display units shipped when compared to a year ago. As for the pricing action, we implemented a 3% increase in the U.S. that went into effect in the fourth quarter.","Since our last major U.S. price increase at the end of 2011, the majority of our materials, including cinnamon, oregano, rice and packaging continued to increase. While savings from our CCI program have partially offset these higher costs, we believe this pricing action was appropriate.","Turning to the underlying performance in consumer sales for the quarter, we had varying results this period, as Gordon will cover in more detail. But I want to provide some remarks and the third quarter results for our U.S. consumer business. If you recall, we achieved a strong 6% growth rate in the first half of 2013 for consumer business sales in the Americas. We had excellent sales and marketing execution for Super Bowl, Easter and grilling events. This was followed in the early part of the third quarter by lower sales of spices and seasonings, including grilling items, with softness in both our factory shipments and in retail sales.","In the latter part of the quarter, we're encouraged by stronger growth at retail for the spice and seasoning category, and we expect this improvement to extend into the fourth quarter.","For our industrial business, third quarter sales were comparable to the year ago period in local currency, although operating income was down 16%. As anticipated, we had weak demand from quick service restaurants in the U.S. and China, although China was better than we expected as sales begin to recover from consumer concerns about bird flu earlier this year.","In the U.S., quick service restaurant customers have faced lower restaurant traffic and have emphasized menu items that don't use McCormick flavors. The decline in operating income is largely attributable to an unfavorable mix of business across regions as our U.S. industrial business is more profitable in some other regions due to scale and efficiency. Other factors affecting this quarter included the higher retirement benefit costs and increase material costs.","For our industrial business, we have a more cautious outlook for the fourth quarter performance, although do -- we do expect better sales and profit growth.","I'd like to comment next on our view of the current economic conditions in our primary markets and the impact on McCormick's business. There's been a lot of news recently about the slowdown in emerging markets. In Eastern Europe, we entered the market post recession with our acquisition of Kamis in 2011. The economic outlook in this region has been lowered for 2013, but we continue to see growth in our main markets and are achieving solid increases in both our consumer and industrial businesses.","Latin America slowed recently. Although our primary business in Mexico has had solid sales growth in both our consolidated industrial business and our consumer business joint venture. And in Asia, recent reports indicate a slowdown in China and India. Despite a lower GDP growth rate in China, we're growing consumer business sales at a double-digit rate, and we believe that the weak demand from quick service restaurant customers relates more to consumer concerns specific to poultry than in general economy as our customers continue to invest in new locations.","In India, we would expect greater economic volatility, and we're experiencing fluctuations in our businesses. But we're in this market for the long-term potential as a leading flavor company. India is a compelling market for McCormick where the per capita spice consumption is estimated to be 5x greater than in the U.S.","In our developed markets, while we see a slow recovery underway in North America and Western Europe, it's a bit unsteady quarter-to-quarter and benefiting some demographic groups more than others. For our business, even with the third quarter slowdown in the U.S., the 52-week increase in our largest category, spices and seasonings, remain strong in our top developed markets as seen on Slide 7.","Many customers and consumers are preparing meals at home as a way to explore new flavors, improve healthy eating and manage their budget. Some consumers are managing their budget by purchasing private label. In the latest 52-week period, the U.S. consumption data shows sales of private label up at nearly twice the category rate, although this trend was also affected by retailer price increases and by our success in reducing opening price point offerings at certain retailers to improve category sales and profits. By reducing these low price and lower margins opening price points, we're encouraging consumers to trade up to private label or our branded alternatives.","At McCormick, we have the advantage of strong brand leadership, not just in spices and seasonings, but across many of our categories as seen on Slides 8 and 9. As a supplier of everything from opening price point to private label to premium gourmet, we continue to work with our customers to optimize the shelf set. Our objective is to keep our brands relevant and the perceived value to the consumer by continuing to invest in marketing, developing distinctive and compelling new products, gaining placement for our products across retail channels and focusing on in-store merchandising and execution to stay front of mind with consumers.","Pressure on today's consumer in our developed markets is also evident in our year-to-date sales to the food service industry which account for about half of our industrial business. The other half of sales are products sold to many of the major packaged foods companies. A number of these companies have faced a period of weak category growth, private label inroads or branded competition and have aggressive programs underway to lower costs.","As a supplier to these companies, this focus on cost reduction efforts can detract from their new product activity. While 2013 has been a difficult year for our industrial business, we're proud of our long-term relationships with food service and packaged foods companies that are global leaders. Together with these customers, we recognize that innovation is a key element to attracting the consumer and we'll continue to develop winning products to restore growth. We're encouraged by an industrial business pipeline of new products heading into 2014.","I began my remarks with McCormick's third quarter results and shared our perspective on current business conditions. In the fourth quarter, we expect to grow sales 7% and adjusted earnings per share by 7%, which is moderated from our previous outlook due in part to the shift in U.S. sales.","For the fiscal year, our sales and profit projections have moved to the lower end of our ranges, but remain within our long term 4% to 6% range for sales growth. And for EPS, excluding the impact of higher retirement expense and tax rate, are within our long term 9% to 11% EPS growth objective.","So why do we expect this improvement in the fourth quarter given our year-to-date results? As discussed, we see retail sales recovery from the category softness early in the third quarter. We're driving sales with innovation and approximately $10 million in incremental brand marketing, which I'll describe in a minute, and we have some favorable comparisons to the fourth quarter of 2012 which included some areas of sales weakness and costs related to a supplier quality issue. Gordon will comment on these factors in more detail.","Looking beyond 2013, while I'm not prepared to give guidance for 2014, we expect a stronger financial performance based from progress with our growth initiatives. In addition, we anticipate low single-digit material cost inflation, and we do not expect our 2014 retirement benefit expense or tax rate to be the headwind that it was for McCormick in 2013.","I want to comment next on progress of our key growth initiatives and the momentum we're building as we approach 2014. Starting with acquisitions on Slide 12. We're pleased to report that WAPC is off to an excellent start with sales and profit ahead of expectations and on target in our integration process. We have sales and marketing activity underway in 3 central China provinces to introduce McCormick's strengths and capabilities to WAPC customers. And in the coastal regions where McCormick has strong relationships with modern trade, we've began to introduce WAPC bouillon products.","Looking ahead, we have a solid pipeline of potential acquisition opportunities. These include core spice and seasoning businesses in markets where we don't have a strong presence, and in our current markets, brands that deliver flavor and that we can profitably expand.","Innovation is another key growth driver. We're introducing a number of innovative new products this year and most of them are now in distribution. In the U.S., these include our flavorful McCormick steak sauces, easy-to-serve Zatarain's microwavable rice mixes and our success with a line of gourmet recipe mixes, for which 36% of sales are incremental to the category.","In France, we introduced a premium gourmet spice and herb line and an assortment of recipe mixes for which we've already gained a 6% category share. This quarter, the U.K. is launching Flavour Shots, a blend of spices and seasonings and sunflower oil that combines convenience and great flavor. Retailers are telling us it's our most innovative product to date. Under the Kamis brand in Poland, we've introduced a full line of recipe mixes.","In China, we have a new squeezable pouch ketchup and a 13-spice blend that will be supported by television advertising this quarter. And we're having success with the new Aeroplane brand desserts in Australia and convenient rice and seasoning blends in India.","As for our industrial business, as I indicated, we're pleased with our new product pipeline as we head into 2014. In support of all of our innovation efforts, we continue to expand our sensory, culinary, flavor analysis and our other capabilities in our worldwide R&D facilities.","Turning to brand marketing support on Slide 14. We're planning a $10 million increase this quarter, led by holiday activity in EMEA and programs in the Asia\/Pacific region to build awareness and trial of new products. The fall cooking and holiday season are an important period for our U.S. consumer business. In addition to the significant increase and display activity, we're staging the same type of mega-themed event approach that led to the success with our first quarter 2013 Super Bowl event. We've kicked off the fourth quarter with a fall cooking event supported by a new TV ad, print and online support, and we have a similar approach ready for the Thanksgiving and Christmas season.","Across all of our businesses, we're excited about the growth potential of our leading brands and continue to measure and improve the effectiveness of our marketing support. Underpinning our growth initiatives is the increased interest in flavor in markets around the world. Globally, Euromonitor projects robust long-term sales growth for spices and seasonings, our largest category. With a 22% share of this category, 4x that of our next largest competitor, we are a global leader and meeting this consumer demand for flavor with a broad portfolio of products and increasing geographic presence.","Before turning it over to Gordon, I want to thank all of our employees for their efforts and achievements. Together, we have a passion for flavor, and we're working toward continuing our growth and success at McCormick. Gordon?","Gordon M. Stetz","Thanks, Alan, and good morning, everyone. As Alan described, the third quarter results of our business segments varied by region, and in certain areas, were below our expectations. While we expect better growth rates in the fourth quarter, we have adjusted our full year outlook to reflect the third quarter performance.","I'm going to begin with a closer look at sales and operating income results for each segment, starting with the consumer business. We grew consumer business sales 7% in local currency. As Alan indicated, this third quarter increase included the impact of WAPC and the shift in sales from the fourth quarter. Each of these contributed about 5% to sales growth in the third quarter for the consumer segment.","Excluding the impact of currency, WAPC and the sales shift, consumer business sales declined 2% in the third quarter. On the same basis, we have grown consumer business sales 3% year-to-date.","On Slide 18, in the Americas region, sales rose 4% with an underlying decline of 4%, following the strong first half and soft consumption early in the third quarter. While the shift in sales creates a fourth quarter headwind for this part of our business, we expect our brand marketing, new product activity and in-store fall cooking and holiday season execution to drive growth.","And as a reminder, in the fourth quarter of 2012, the combined impact of Hurricane Sandy and retail purchase patterns lowered sales growth in this region by about 3%.","In Europe, the Middle East and Africa, EMEA, sales in local currency were even with the year ago period. Increases in Poland and parts of Western Europe were driven by innovation and our brand marketing activity. This was offset by a decline in the U.K. related to weak retailer sales across a number of categories.","Consumer business sales in the Asia Pacific region rose 54% in local currency. WAPC contributed 59%, leaving a base business decline of 5% in local currency. While we grew sales in China at a double-digit rate, excluding WAPC, sales in India declined significantly. In India, sales declined as consumers reacted to a significant increase in the cost of rice.","Operating income for the consumer business rose 9% when compared to the third quarter of 2012. Higher sales and our CCI cost savings drove this increase and more than offset the impact of a $3 million increase in brand marketing support and higher material and retirement benefit costs.","Turning to our industrial business as seen on Slide 22. Third quarter sales were comparable to the year ago period in local currency, with an increase in pricing offset by a slight reduction in volume and product mix.","In the Americas industrial business, sales declined 2% as a result of lower volume and product mix. Solid sales growth with food manufacturers was offset by lower demand for customized products sold to quick service restaurants, as Alan described.","We grew industrial sales in EMEA by 4% in local currency. This is on top of 7% year-on-year growth in the third quarter of 2012. In the third quarter of 2013, we had similar contributions from pricing actions and volume and product mix, with the primary increase in customized flavor solutions, supplied from our facilities in Turkey and South Africa to quick service restaurants. In the third quarter of 2013, Asia\/Pacific sales in local currency grew 2% from the year ago period. This reflects an improvement in China with sales to quick service restaurants, and while we remain cautious, we expect further improvement in the fourth quarter. As a reminder, industrial sales in this region declined 17% in the fourth quarter of 2012.","Operating income for the industrial business was $30 million in the third quarter of 2013 compared to $35 million in the year ago period. An unfavorable mix of business, higher retirement benefit costs and material cost inflation were offset in part by CCI cost savings. We expect operating income for this business to improve in the fourth quarter versus the year ago period, due in part to $4 million in costs associated with a supplier quality issue that we recorded in the fourth quarter of 2012.","For the total company, third quarter operating income was $148 million compared to $144 million in the year ago period. The favorable impact of higher sales and cost savings from our CCI program more than offset an unfavorable business mix, approximately $5 million in retirement benefit expense, $4 million of incremental brand marketing support and higher material costs.","As Alan indicated, gross profit margin improved from prior quarters and was even with the year ago period in the third quarter. This was due in part to a favorable business mix with the stronger consumer business sales as well as CCI cost savings.","Moving below operating income. Our tax rate for third quarter was 26%, largely as a result of a $3 million discrete tax item. The 26% tax rate was up slightly from 25% in the third quarter of 2012. We currently expect an underlying tax rate of 29% for fiscal year 2013. This is down from our prior guidance of 29.5% as a result of our current mix of earnings across tax jurisdictions. Our 2013 guidance for income from unconsolidated operations continues to be an increase of about 10%. This growth rate was front-end loaded as income from unconsolidated operations was up 33% through the first half of 2013.","In the second half, profit for our joint venture in Mexico is being unfavorably impacted by the cost to relocate to a new manufacturing facility. This new facility has been built to create capacity for growth in this market and to improve efficiency. We reported 78 -- I apologize, we reported $0.78 earnings per share. Compared to the third quarter of 2012, higher operating income added $0.02 to earnings per share, offset by the increase in the tax rate and the net impact of other factors shown on Slide 30.","Let's turn next to our balance sheet and cash flow on Slide 31. Increases in working capital from the year ago period are largely related to extended terms, which were part of the holiday display program in the U.S., as well as the WAPC. Year-to-date cash flow from operations was $227 million compared to $256 million in the first 3 quarters of 2012, with the decrease due, in large part, to the timing of tax payments and higher receivables.","During the quarter, we issued $250 million of debt and were able to price our new 10-year note offering with a 3.5% coupon, a 90 basis point spread to U.S. treasuries. These proceeds have been used to retire our long-term debt that came due in September.","In the fourth quarter, we intend to bring the debt levels closer to our debt-to-EBITDA ratio target by fiscal year end. Following the acquisition of WAPC, we had minimal share repurchase activity in the third quarter. In the fourth quarter, we expect to complete our current $400 million authorization, which had $45 million remaining at the end of the third quarter and to begin repurchasing shares from the $400 million authorization approved in April.","Before turning to our outlook, let me comment on the outcome of the lump sum payout program for the U.S. pension plan that we announced during our last earnings call. As we described, a lump sum payout was offered to approximately 3,300 former U.S. employees with deferred vested pension benefits. Based on the strong response to this program, we expect to pay out approximately $60 million, which will be funded from pension assets. We will record a settlement charge of approximately $20 million in the fourth quarter and will provide supplemental non-GAAP earnings per share exclusive of this item. This program was an important step forward in the long-term management of McCormick's retirement plans and we are pleased with our success.","As a final topic, let's review McCormick's latest 2013 financial outlook as shown on Slide 33. The projections I am sharing are on an adjusted basis to exclude the impact of the settlement charge. Starting at the top line, we expect a 7% sales increase in the fourth quarter, which puts us at the lower end of our 4% to 6% range for fiscal year 2013.","We are seeing improving consumption numbers. We expect a favorable impact from WAPC of 2% to 3%, and we have a favorable comparison to the fourth quarter of 2012, which had some sales weakness in the Americas consumer business. Offsetting these increases in part will be the unfavorable impact of the sales shift we described.","We expect a double-digit increase in operating income for the fourth quarter, leading to a 3% to 5% increase in adjusted operating income for the fiscal year versus our prior guidance of 5% to 7%. Factors that we anticipate will have a favorable impact on operating income this quarter include the projected sales growth rate and CCI cost savings, which we now expect to reach at least $55 million in 2013.","In addition, our fourth quarter 2012 result included $4 million of expense related to a supplier quality issue. We expect these factors to more than offset a planned increase in brand marketing support of approximately $10 million and a projected increase of about $5 million in retirement benefit expense.","Moving on to the tax rate. As I indicated, our guidance for the fourth quarter tax rate is 29%. This compares to a tax rate of 24.7% in the fourth quarter of 2012 due to cash repatriation. This year-on-year variance in the tax rate is expected to lower our adjusted earnings per share by approximately $0.07 in the fourth quarter. For the fourth quarter, we expect to grow adjusted earnings per share of 7% from earnings per share of $1.11 in the fourth quarter of 2012. We expect operating income to have the strongest contribution to this growth, followed by the favorable impact of lower interest expense and shares outstanding, partially offset by the unfavorable tax rate impact. This fourth quarter outlook leads to a fiscal year earnings per share projection at the lower end of our $3.13 to $3.19 range.","As shown on Slide 34, excluding the impact of increases in our 2013 retirement plan expense and the higher tax rate, our underlying adjusted earnings per share growth rate is expected to be close to 9%. Just to be clear, the $0.11 increase in retirement benefit expense I'm referring to here is the actuarially determined annual expense, which is part of our operating cost and is separate from the onetime settlement charge related to the lump sum payout program.","That concludes my comments on guidance. So now let's turn to your questions, after which, Alan will provide some closing remarks. Operator, we're ready for the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instruction] Our first question comes from David Driscoll with Citigroup.","David Driscoll - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I have 2 questions. One on the cost outlook, the inflation outlook, and one on that comment about the 2014 tax and retirement costs. On the cost outlook, the -- I believe what you wrote there was in 2014, you're looking for low single-digit material cost increases. I guess I just want to get your impressions that if we have deflation in the grain markets potentially affecting much of the grocery store, how do you see your business in 2014 in comparison to what might be many other categories, in fact, seeing price declines while you guys are actually having to take pricing? So that's the first one.","Alan D. Wilson","Yes, we -- our commodities certainly are different. Most of our products are grown outside the U.S. in areas that are within a few degrees in the equator. And there's a lot of different dynamics that impact that. Weather, like monsoons in India, can impact some of the -- some of our costs. We're certainly not expecting cost declines across our core spice and seasonings ingredients. We may see some and -- that impact more of our industrial business in things like grains, but we're going to be a little counter to what you may be seeing in some of the other commodities. I'll let Gordon take the other part of the question.","David Driscoll - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Second question was just on 2014 tax and retirement costs. It seems like from the comments, both from the lump sum payment, like I'm struggling to understand why that's not favorable to the retirement cost picture going forward in 2014. And the tax rate, it doesn't seem like it should be moving up much. So when you make this comment that it's less of a headwind, that still suggests that it is a headwind. It's just less of a headwind. But kind of why is it? It doesn't seem like it perhaps should be.","Gordon M. Stetz","Yes, David, just to focus first on the retirement going forward, our -- what we're saying when we say less of a headwind is really we're speaking to the fact that this year's increase in the operating income expense impact of that was a function of the interest rate environment, primarily where rates declined at end of last year when we established our valuation. Our expectation, given the rate environment, is certainly that rates -- and as well as everyone knows this on the call, rates shouldn't decline any further. So at a minimum, we would expect that expense not to go up like it did this year. And then if it's a favorability, it will purely a function of what the rate environment is at November 30 when we establish the valuation date. And to your point on tax, tax rate, again, the favorable rate that we experienced in 2012 was primarily a function of a transaction we did, which was cash repatriation, which we did not duplicate this year and do not anticipate a similar transaction at this stage as we look into 2014. So again, we're not looking for any unfavorable comparison related to the tax rate as we head into 2014 as we had experienced in 2013.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ken Goldman with JPMorgan.","Kenneth Goldman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Alan, if I heard you correctly, and I may not have, I thought you said -- you mentioned some success in reducing opening price points at certain retailers and that this is encouraging consumers to trade up to private label or branded alternatives. Again, I may not have heard that right, but it's not often that a company talks about trading consumers up to private label. So maybe you can add some color there.","Alan D. Wilson","Yes, sure. What -- opening price point in the spice business, and has been there for a long time for these products. And we have a number of these brands like Fifth Seasons and Spice Classics and a couple of other control brands that would show up actually in our branded sales that sell between $0.50 and $1. And a number -- some retailers, some major retailers have reduced their reliance on those. And what's happening is, that's improving the category sales and profits for the retailer. A lot of those are shifting into private label, but that's a good thing for both us and them.","Kenneth Goldman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then when you look at the change in your consumer performance in the Americas from the beginning of the quarter to the end, and I know you've touched on this a little bit, but can you just again add some color as to what you maybe think some of the biggest drivers were of that improvement...","Alan D. Wilson","I never like to use weather as an excuse, but the early part of June, it was a fairly atypical weather for the early part of the summer. I think that did impact it, we saw -- and the reason I can say that with some confidence is because of the impact on grilling items and -- which is a big part of our summer sales in the U.S. So I think there was something going on there, and we've seen it from the releases by retailers and other food manufacturers that the beginning of summer was weaker than I think they expected. We're encouraged by what we've seen later in the summer and what we're seeing early in the fall.","Operator","Your next question comes from Leigh Ferst with Wellington Shields.","Leigh Ferst - Wellington Shields & Co., LLC, Research Division","I was wondering if you could tell us what kind of reaction you've gotten to 3% price increase. And what kind of marketing you're doing to -- marketing promotion you're doing in relation to that?","Alan D. Wilson","Yes, price increases are never easy. And as David mentioned in the first part of the call, we're a little counter to what some other companies are seeing because our products are going up and some are seeing some commodity health. By and large, and we have a long history of this, we have a good story. We are explaining the reason for the price increase and we're moving it through. From a consumer standpoint, we are certainly continuing our strong advertising program. We are promoting to make sure that we get to the right price point at the right time, so that we maintain consumption as we move it. 3% is pretty modest as this is, I think, one of the lower price increases we've had in the last 5 or 6 years.","Leigh Ferst - Wellington Shields & Co., LLC, Research Division","And shifting to a long-term perspective, I know you're not giving guidance on '14, and you're still using the Euromonitor 5-year outlook, but is there any change in how you look at your business long-term based on what's going on around the world?","Alan D. Wilson","Well, certainly, we believe long term that we're well positioned. There is -- there is some lumpiness in different markets that we are adapting to, and we continue to do that, but we're -- we believe that long term, we're in a great business, we are seeing category growth rates that are strong. Over time we're seeing the world's consumers continue to develop a level of affluence, which means they improve their food supply. And we think that's positive. We're seeing more move in most markets to modern trade. We think that's all positive. Certainly, we believe we're well-positioned. And we'll adapt our business to make sure that we can manage through whatever situation that we have.","Leigh Ferst - Wellington Shields & Co., LLC, Research Division","Great. And regarding Wuhan, you said you're ahead of plan. Are you -- do you think that's because you had to wait so long to implement this and you had a long-term to -- a long time to evaluate what was -- and plan what you wanted to do there?","Alan D. Wilson","Yes, we had a very strong integration plan and it's been well executed. And so I think that's a -- that is certainly a piece of it. I want to give the team on the ground a lot of credit for what they've done to bring it in. But we, given the length of time between the announcement and the actual close, we did have time to put together good plans.","Operator","Your next question comes from Chris Growe with Stifel.","Christopher R. Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I just had 2 questions for you. I wanted to start first with the industrial division and just to get a better sense of kind of what's going on in that division. We have seen an improvement in Asia, still some weakness in the U.S. I guess what I'm trying to get at is, do you have any more visibility into the pipeline of products your restaurant customers are implementing, do you foresee an improvement, say, into Q4 and into early 2014?","Alan D. Wilson","In terms of specific restaurant customers, about half of our business is foodservice distributors and the other half are quick service. We're seeing actually more optimism in the branded food service business than we are in the QSR. From our standpoint, but remember, this isn't -- you shouldn't read that we're making a comment on the entire consumption for QSR, just the products that we supply. We tend to supply more core menu type items. And as they are introducing breakfast, for instance, that's not necessarily an area that we play in. We're encouraged that we're seeing some new product activity, but we're not seeing enough to offset some weakness in the core items.","Christopher R. Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","And so do you have visibility to those improving say, later in the quarter and early into next year? Is there any kind of a little positive outlook as we look ahead?","Alan D. Wilson","Yes, we think over the next few quarters, we're going to see some continued improvement, but we've expected to see that for -- as we've have headed in the second half of the year. We think fourth quarter will be better, certainly, than we've seen in the first 3 quarters.","Christopher R. Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And just one -- if I could ask one on the consumer division. You had a weak start to the quarter, it sounds like, from a demand standpoint. So I'm just curious, was that related to I guess what you were talking about earlier about some of the weather weakness earlier in the quarter? And then just to understand, as you ship more product ahead to the degree at which that helps sales this quarter, it sounds like you got more product out there, more in the slate out there. Do you think that could help fourth quarter sales, then, as well for the consumer division?","Alan D. Wilson","Yes, we think that will help fourth quarter consumption. The earlier we get it up, the more likely we are to move it through. And last year, we saw consumption -- even with everything that happened, we saw consumption stay pretty steady. But our factory sales were a little more lumpy because of certain internal events. But I think we're feeling pretty good at this point as to where we are in fourth quarter. We've got a good advertising program. We've got strong displays out on the floor. So we're encouraged and optimistic about fourth quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from Alexia Howard with Sanford Bernstein.","Alexia Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Can I ask about the U.K. You mentioned weak retailer sales over there. So I'd like to get a bit of a sense of whether that's likely to persist and what's causing that over there?","Alan D. Wilson","The U.K. has been a little bit weaker. The question on what's driving that weakness is probably a little tougher. The U.K. is, as you know, a difficult market. The retailers are largely consolidated. We saw just relatively flat sales in the U.K. in the quarter. We again, we have a good line of product activity. We have advertising in place and so we're trying to make sure that we can keep our products relevant to the consumer.","Alexia Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. And as a quick follow-up, the Mexico JV relocation, when will that be completed? And when can we expect a rebound in performance over there? And I'll pass it on.","Alan D. Wilson","Yes, the performance of our business -- the underlying performance of our business in Mexico has been pretty good. We'll finish the charges in the fourth quarter as we relocate from an older plant to a new plant, where we expect higher productivity. So we should see the impact of that as we go in through next year.","Operator","Your next question comes from Thilo Wrede with Jefferies.","Thilo Wrede - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Gordon, in the last few quarters you've made a good effort of reducing inventories. You seem to have had inventory growth this quarter. What's your view on inventory right now and your ability to reduce that going forward?","Gordon M. Stetz","Well, I think the 2 factors impacting it this quarter, the vast majority of that increase year-over-year relates to the Wuhan acquisition, probably -- not probably, 70% of that increase year-over-year is primarily the fact that we now have inventory associated with that acquisition. We did have also some increases as we prepare for the fourth quarter this year, making sure that we're ready for great execution around our products and having that inventory sufficient to drive through with the programs that we have in place. I'd say, on a go-forward basis, it is something that we continue to have a lot of programs around and we have lots of energy around our sales and operation planning process. You've heard us talk greatly about systems improvements, which we have done and we're leveraging globally. So if we look at our 3-year forward plans, we continue to believe that that's an area we can get efficiencies and continue to get a benefit in our cash flow.","Thilo Wrede - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then maybe I missed this in your prepared remarks, but you're obviously now doing price increases in the U.S. consumer business. Yet, in the third quarter, price was more or less flat if not down in the U.S. consumer business. How do I need to look at that? Why was the pricing going in the opposite direction of what I would have expected?","Alan D. Wilson","We haven't taken pricing in a couple of years, it's been 2 years. And so what we introduced was a 3% price, which will be effective in the fourth quarter. So you would not have seen pricing impact in the third quarter at all.","Thilo Wrede - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","But was there an increase in promotions in the U.S.? For example, I mean last quarter, price grew at a much healthier rate.","Alan D. Wilson","There may have been some promotional activity. Our -- Gordon, can you help me with that?","Gordon M. Stetz","Yes, I mean really, we haven't seen a great deal of price realization in the U.S. I mean, the only price that we've taken was a minor one that was in the third quarter of last year related to pepper, so you probably saw a slight benefit. But we've anniversary-ed that now as we've come into this third quarter. So as we go into Q4, as Alan said, the latest price increase really is not executed until partway through the fourth quarter.","Thilo Wrede - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay. I appreciate that. And then last question I have for you was the rice business in India, you said it was a reaction to an increase in rice cost. If the Indian consumer, other than the price increase, how is the Indian consumer doing right now? Is that a healthy market for you other than that?","Alan D. Wilson","I wouldn't say it's a healthy market. There's a lot of volatility in India and you've seen that with currency changes. So we've got some internal things specific to our business that we're working through and that's around making sure that we've got a competitive position. But I wouldn't say that the Indian consumer at this point is a robust consumer.","Operator","Your next question comes from Chuck Cerankosky with Northcoast Research.","Charles Edward Cerankosky - Northcoast Research","If you sort of look at the Americas and keeping in my how people talked about this bifurcated recovery, can you comment on the demand trends both in consumer and industrial segments? What you're seeing by channel and type of restaurant and retailer?","Alan D. Wilson","Yes, we're seeing -- and it is, I think, bifurcated. I think there are certain segments that are doing well. We're seeing in most of our markets more robust, an interest in high-end gourmet-type products. We did a really good job with a higher-end gourmet product in France. We're seeing that and some results in the U.S. as well. And we're seeing from retailers like we talked about, eliminating some of the opening price points, they're still a value consumer, but we're able to serve them a little bit better with better quality products. I do think it is tough. I think consumers are not feeling very robust. And I think it's a tough market.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ann Gurkin with Davenport.","Ann H. Gurkin - Davenport & Company, LLC, Research Division","I have 2 questions. One, if you think about top line growth for the next 12 to 18 months, what do you see as the key levers to driving that growth? Is it pricing? Innovation? Mix? Can you help me as to how to think about what drives top line?","Alan D. Wilson","Yes, I'll start it and Gordon, if you want to add anything, please do. Certainly, we'll see some impact of pricing that we'll experience most of the next year. We have a pretty good pipeline of new products that we think will help drive growth. We're starting to shift our industrial business into more higher-value flavor-type products as we have some new technology coming online. So we kind of see some of that coming. Gordon, do you want to add anything to that?","Gordon M. Stetz","Yes, I'd emphasize back to our long-term algorithm and the elements of that, where we talk about the 4% to 6%. Now don't take this yet as guidance for 2014 but certainly, if you break that down, 1\/3 of that is in the base business around strong execution and the strong category trends, 1\/3 of that through the innovation and 1\/3 of that through acquisitions which have occurred, on average, over time. So if you look into next year, we have certain elements of all of that with a little bit of price. So that's the way I would be thinking about it.","Ann H. Gurkin - Davenport & Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Great. And then second, in the fourth quarter, for some reason, I think you all are going to launch a new flavor platform, a product platform. Is that still on track? Can you give me any update on that?","Alan D. Wilson","It will be commercialized and we're in the process of commercializing it. It really won't impact fourth quarter very much. It will be probably be more through next year as we start to get it completely online.","Ann H. Gurkin - Davenport & Company, LLC, Research Division","But we should still learn about it in Q4. As expected?","Alan D. Wilson","Yes.","Operator","Your next question comes from Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse.","Rachel Nabatian","This is actually Rachel Nabatian in for Rob Moskow. So by our math, given that $30 million was pulled forward in 3Q, it seems like you need a really big 4Q for consumer, especially since industrial is expected to be weaker than our prior expectations. Now to be fair, you did say that it's an easier comp and you have programs in place to drive sales. But even so, it still seems like you need a rather large sales increase. So I guess we just wanted to know, what gives you the confidence that you're going to be able to hit your sales target?","Gordon M. Stetz","Well, just -- you pointed out all the accurate elements. We are looking at a more favorable comp in Q4 as it relates to both the U.S. consumer business and the global industrial business. When you net the 2 elements of the pull-ahead and the issues that we experienced last year in the Americas on the consumer side, we're probably up against a net headwind of about 2% to 3%. So your question obviously is what gives us the confidence. Well, we're starting in a good place with the merchandising displays up there and we're starting in a good place with the consumption trends that we're seeing. And behind all that, we have very, very strong programs targeted in every month in advertising around, as you heard us talk about the mega events and for holiday cooking. So ultimately, it's going to be the execution and the pull-through that we're gearing up. You heard us talk about $10 million of incremental spend to drive those sales. So we're looking for sales recovery in that Q4. Combining that with what we would see as an improving gross profit trend relative to what we've seen prior year in the first 3 quarters, that's all the elements of our thinking in our guidance.","Operator","Your next question comes from Rob Dickerson with Consumer Edge.","Robert Dickerson - Consumer Edge Research, LLC","I guess, just to try to summarize the strategy around the pricing increase a little bit. It's basically what you're saying is that input costs, you're probably expecting it to be still low single-digits into fiscal '14. And because of that, you're taking the 3% price and that's it? Because I guess what's still a bit counterintuitive is if we look at the global forecast despite growth either in the U.S. or on a global basis, when you look at your trends, I mean, you have been losing share and that share has been lost by volume. So I'm just trying to get an idea of like how to match the price increase with continued volume share loss because it would seem like, as you said, as we go into next year, most of the growth I would think would be coming from price at least in the Americas, which could mean that you could continue to lose volume. So if you could just comment on that please?","Alan D. Wilson","Yes, we believe we've got the programs that will help us to continue to drive and increase volume. And our growth is going to be based a little bit on price, pricing is a big part of our algorithm. We only use price to offset commodity costs and we have seen that commodity cost increases. Part of what you've seen in the growth in private label has been price. Our private label customers and our retail customers, whether we supply the private label or not, have been taking price. So I think you're seeing some of that in the dollar growth from private label as well. So we're in an environment and we've been very responsible on price where we believe that this is appropriate. We have not taken pricing in a couple of years. It was time to do that because our costs have continued to accelerate. But we take our responsibility in terms of how we price, we take a lot of responsibility and accountability for that.","Robert Dickerson - Consumer Edge Research, LLC","Okay. And then just a quick follow-up. On the marketing side, it looks like kind of as the year has progressed, the plan is to increase marketing and it's supposed to be up $13 million for the year. I think original guidance, it was supposed to be up $15 million. So you're technically spending less than you originally expected even though $10 million of it, almost all of it is coming in Q4. So can you just comment on why -- I mean, I know, it's only $2 million, which is -- off of $15 million, but could you just comment why it would come in at a little bit lower? And why it is so Q4-loaded even with the volume pressure that we saw in Q3?","Alan D. Wilson","We do, in our U.S. business, about 40% of our sales in the fourth quarter. So it would be back-loaded. The highest ROI that we get in our marketing programs are geared towards the Thanksgiving and holiday -- and Christmas periods. So it just makes sense that that's where the bulk of that would be, and it supports the programs and the display activities that we have out there. We are leaning into our business. We recognize that we have had some challenges. We've typically had pretty good volume growth. We want to continue that and that's why we are leaning in with our marketing programs.","Operator","Your next question comes from Eric Katzman with Deutsche Bank.","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I guess first question. Alan, you know it's -- I've been hearing about Wal-Mart reducing inventories across many categories. And so I guess in relationship to the fourth quarter and your easier comps but hopes for some improvement, kind of how does -- how do lower inventories at retail -- by the retailers figure into your calculations of improvement?","Alan D. Wilson","Yes, we -- I'll say, the big impact on the sell-in in the third quarter were specific large customers who took their orders at end of August instead of at the beginning of September. So that would say that they are believing, at least in this category, that there's some reason to get those displays up early, and we've seen them and they're up. So that we think is positive. Ultimately, what happens is the consumer is going to have to pull it through, which is why we have the marketing programs that we do. So we're banking on our sales -- our factory sales and our consumption relatively matching up. We haven't factored in that we think there's going to be a large de-loading by the retailers at the end of the year. Typically, we don't see that in our category in the fourth quarter.","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And just to kind of follow on to that. It seems like over the last few years really, and I've heard this from some investors, questions about how shipments versus consumption have moved around. I think last year, you may have had some movements from the fourth into the first quarter and now you've had third versus fourth. And so as the category manager and clear share leader, why don't -- why doesn't the company have seemingly like better or maybe more consistent kind of shipments as opposed to what seems kind of almost like a high low from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year?","Alan D. Wilson","I think what happens, and what's happened in more recent periods, is customers have been buying a lot closer to consumption. And in their stores, they tell us, their customers, the consumer is buying on a different pattern. They're buying closer to when they get paid. And so they're trying to manage their levels of inventory closer to when they're going to have needs. When they miss it and they have too much inventory, they immediately react to that. When they have not enough inventory, which is what happened in fourth quarter last year, they also react to that. So I think there's -- I think it's a little bit less certainty around how the consumers purchase patterns are and a focus by everybody on making sure that they're maximizing cash flow.","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. Last question. Your stock has underperformed the group pretty significantly this year, maybe anticipating some of what we're talking about today. You're saying that fiscal '14 should be a pretty strong year. Yet it sounds like, and it's not a huge business, but it sounds like Kohinoor is missing your targets and Wuhan is not going to add to earnings next year, if my memory is correct. So I guess, what else can you -- you talked about the top line a little bit for '14, but what should -- and you talked about some of the non-operating things. What should help? Is like CCI savings maybe going to be accelerated? Or is there -- you're just counting on the mix shift getting better to help the business? Because it sounds like input cost will continue to be a bit of a headwind.","Alan D. Wilson","Yes, without getting into giving guidance for next year, we're still putting our budgets together. But the key things that we think will help to impact, one is recovery in our U.S. industrial business and in China as well. Wuhan will add about $0.03 the next year. We do expect to be in a better position in India next year, so that is certainly a piece of it. We've talked about the impact on pension cost, which we're not forecasting at this point, but we believe shouldn't be the headwind that they've been this year. And then underlying -- and none of that stuff actually matters except the core performance of our business. And we believe that we will continue to show the kind of resilience that we have with good advertising programs, good new product introductions and execution on our -- in our core business.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Akshay Jagdale with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Akshay S. Jagdale - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","So I wanted to -- I'm a little still confused on how this quarter turned out relative to expectations? Obviously, lower guidance. The numbers came in on the sales and gross profit, and gross margins are much below what we had, but we could have been way off. So how did the quarterly sales numbers come in relative to your expectation? And then I have a few follow-ups on that.","Gordon M. Stetz","Well, as we try to highlight in the call, Akshay, that from the U.S. consumer side, the underlying core was not as strong as what we would have liked based on the slow start to the third quarter. However, relative to our expectation on the holiday program, that came in a bit stronger. So net-net, 9% operating income growth on the consumer side is pretty strong and I'd say, primarily close to our expectation, although we would have liked to have seen stronger performance in areas that have been doing quite well year-to-date. Europe is -- was flattish in consumer. And although the team is doing a great job there, that had been up until that point, performing at a slightly better rate than that. And certainly on the industrial side, we would have -- we expected a weaker performance, but we would have liked to have seen even stronger performance out of the industrial side relative to our expectations. So basically, that weakness in those areas were offset by the tax rate.","Akshay S. Jagdale - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","That's helpful. And then just focusing on the base consumer performance on sales, what was it that came -- I mean, is it the consumer switching to private label? Was that something that was unexpected? Or was there something else to it? I mean, I'm just trying to gauge what might happen in the fourth quarter? So I'm trying to understand whether it was the consumer behavior that was different than what you expected? Was it your execution in the stores? Just if you could give some color on that, that would be helpful.","Alan D. Wilson","No, it was weak consumption at the beginning of the quarter, as we talked about a fairly weak offtake for Memorial Day. And I think you've heard that, and consistent with a number of other companies. And we've seen some improvement as we have gone into the later part of the quarter.","Akshay S. Jagdale - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","And so what -- what do you think is underlying, sort of, why is that happening? Why is the consumer...","Alan D. Wilson","Why is the consumer getting better?","Akshay S. Jagdale - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Well, no. First of all, what changed early on in the quarter in your opinion, from the consumer standpoint, that caused them to be more cautious? And then what's changed since then that it's getting better through the quarter?","Alan D. Wilson","I think, one, was a weak Memorial Day, a rainy Memorial Day up and down the East Coast impacted the sales of grilling products and related categories. I think if you look at some of the related categories around that, you'll see that. And what we've seen with improvement, I think, is that the consumers are starting to come back and we've seen that. And I don't want to put too much stock into to the 4-week IRI or Nielsen data, but we've seen continued improvement off the weakness from early in the quarter.","Akshay S. Jagdale - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. Great. And just 1 last one on India. You mentioned next year you expect improvement there. Is that distribution-driven? Are you changing price points? Is it new products? Can you just help me understand that?","Alan D. Wilson","Well, we expect to see some impact from the new product introductions that we introduced this year. We think that will be a positive, but we also expect that we should see -- and we know the rice harvest is right now, we expect to be in a better position in terms of our rice productions for next year.","Operator","Your next question comes from Andrew Lazar with Barclays.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Can you talk a little bit more about the piece of the industrial business with sales to other food manufacturers? It doesn't seem like that was so much the issue in the quarter as you discussed. It was more of the QSR side. But what we've heard obviously from, at least, more recently a lot of the food manufacturers out there, trends in their businesses haven't been particularly robust on the volume side So I'm just trying to get a sense of if you expect obviously industrial to get better as we go into '14, is there a risk that the piece that goes towards other food manufacturers maybe is at risk a little bit just given what we've heard from so many of the other food manufacturers? First question.","Alan D. Wilson","Yes, we think that is at some level of risk. Our focus in the industrial sales to other food manufacturers tends to be heavily in the snack area. And that has seemed to continue to be fairly robust, whether it's crackers or chips or those sorts of things, that part of the business has been fairly robust and we still see a lot of new product activity. So we're feeling a little more encouraged with that. I think as we saw at your conference, Andrew, there are certain customers that are pretty focused on productivity and cost. And if they aren't introducing new products, that would -- that could impact our business.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I think the last price increase that you mentioned was in 2011. And I think that was the first time you had taken pricing, maybe ever, heading into your key fourth quarter or the seasonal fourth quarter. And I remember at that time, that was -- you had to make sure that went smoothly and was a little bit of a risk. From my recollection, it went very smoothly. I don't think there were any issues around pricing into the big holiday quarter. So if you can just remind me if that was the case and what were some of the learnings there and did that help you obviously with the confidence going into this fourth quarter with the pricing?","Alan D. Wilson","Yes, it had been a long time since we had taken an increase heading into the fourth quarter. And that one was pretty much commodity-driven. And it did give us the confidence that we can execute it and that we can maintain our promotional plans as we do that. So -- and our view was that this was a better time to do this given where our markets are and where our customers are, to be able to get it executed. And we're finding -- certainly, it's not easy, but we're finding that we're executing it.","Operator","That concludes our Q&A session. I will now turn the call back to Alan Wilson.","Alan D. Wilson","I want to thank you for your questions and for participating in the call. Our passion for flavor, our broad portfolio and our expanding global presence have led to a decade of strong performance at McCormick, and we believe we are well-positioned for the future. Through our growth initiatives, CCI program and the efforts of our employees around the world, we expect to deliver solid sales and profit growth in 2013 and are committed to delivering on our long-term financial objectives.","Joyce L.

This is Joyce Brooks, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you for joining today's call for a discussion of McCormick's second quarter financial results and our current outlook for 2015. We started a bit early to coordinate with the General Mills\u2019 call at 8:30 AM. To accompany our call, we posted a set of slides at ir.mccormick.com. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow our remarks. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, the conference is being recorded.","With me this morning are Alan Wilson, Chairman and CEO; Lawrence Kurzius, Chief Operating Officer and President; Gordon Stetz, Executive Vice President and CFO and Mike Smith, Senior Vice President Corporate Finance. During our remarks, we will refer to non-GAAP financial measures. These include adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share that exclude the impact of special charges as well as information in constant currency. A reconciliation to the GAAP results is included in this morning's press release and slides.","As a reminder, today's presentation contains projections and other forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those projected. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or other factors. As seen on Slide 2, our forward-looking statements also provide information on risk factors that could affect our financial results.","It's now my pleasure to turn the discussion over to Alan.","Alan Wilson","Thank you, Joyce. Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us. ","McCormick\u2019s second quarter results demonstrate the effectiveness of our sales and profit growth strategies and continued the momentum that we established in the first quarter. While sales declined 1%, in constant currency we achieved a 5% year-on-year increase. We achieved higher constant currency sales in both our business segments and across geographic regions, a very good performance from our business leaders and employees throughout McCormick. ","Based on this broad-based growth and our outlook for the second half of 2015, we reaffirm our projection for 4% to 6% constant currency sales growth for the fiscal year. In fact, this year\u2019s pace of acquisition activity gives us more confidence at the upper end of the range. ","Special charges along with currency lowered our operating income results. However we grew adjusted operating income in constant currency by 7%. This is an improvement from the first quarter when adjusted operating income in constant currency rose 1%. As we anticipated, profit growth is improving as our cost savings build and as additional pricing actions go into effect. This improvement supports our reaffirmed outlook for 6% to 7% adjusted operating income growth in 2015 on a constant currency basis. ","With a very favorable tax rate variance, second quarter earnings per share exceeded our expectations. Earnings per share this period was $0.65 and excluding special charges, grew to $0.75 from $0.64 in the year ago period. In addition to the favorable tax rate, other positive factors included the increase in adjusted operating income, further growth from our joint venture in Mexico and lower shares outstanding. The CPS result includes the impact of unfavorable currency. ","We\u2019ve raised our latest earnings-per-share guidance to reflect the net impact of the favorable tax rate in the second quarter and our estimated tax rate for the second half. Aside from this tax adjustment, we feel just as confident in our base business EPS outlook. ","Cash flow from our operations remained strong in $186 million, supporting our dividend program along with business growth strategies including acquisitions. I want to recognize McCormick employees around the world for focusing on growth, driving high-performance and engaging in our success. ","Next, Lawrence is going to provide an update on each of our two business segments. Lawrence?","Lawrence Kurzius","Thank you, Alan, and good morning everyone. As Alan indicated we delivered constant currency sales growth for both our consumer and industrial businesses with particularly good performance in several markets this quarter. ","Let\u2019s start with the consumer business. Across our entire consumer business, although we reported a sales decline of 3%, in constant currency we achieved a 3% increase. I will comment first on the strong results in certain international markets, then turn to the US market for more detailed remarks. ","China led our consumer business sales growth again this quarter with a double-digit increase in constant currency. We had strong demand for McCormick brand herbs and spices, condiments, and seasoning blends driven by our brand building activities, geographic expansion and great in-store execution. We also grew sales with the introduction of a McCormick brand product into Central China, part of our sale synergies from our Wuhan Asia-Pacific Condiments acquisition. ","In Europe, Middle East and Africa, EMEA, economic and retail conditions remained challenging in parts of the region. However in constant currency we had strong volume driven sales growth this period particularly in France, Poland and Russia. ","In France, we\u2019re benefiting from our brand marketing and have expanded to grow brand sales through the discount retailer. Distribution gains were also a primary sales growth driver for our business in Poland and Russia. And in Australia, consumer sales in constant currency rose at a double-digit rate this period from new distribution and product innovation. ","Before moving to the Americas, let\u2019s take a look at our lineup of new products for the second half in our EMEA and Asia-Pacific regions on Slide 7. One of our global initiatives is grilling. In EMEA we\u2019re building out our barbecue products in the UK, France, Poland and other markets with dry seasonings and wet marinades and sauces. And in France, Belgium, Spain and Portugal recognizing the popularity of burgers we are introducing restaurant quality burger seasonings in wet and dry sachets. Our Airplane gelatin in Australia is an iconic brand with 90% category share and we\u2019re continuing to grow sales with new flavor varieties. Also in this market we will be leveraging the authenticity of our [Keene\u2019s] [ph] brand into curry recipe bases. ","Let\u2019s turn to the Americas. In this region we\u2019re making further progress improving the performance of our US consumer business. Consumer interest in flavor, simple and healthy ingredients and cooking with fresh products continues to drive strong category growth for spices and seasonings as seen in the latest consumption data with category sales up 5% in the quarter. The same data shows that sales of our McCormick brand spices and seasonings rose 1%. This is an improvement compared to a 1% decline in the past 52 weeks. We are definitely heading in the right direction. ","For recipe mixes, our next largest category we continued to gain share. In this latest quarter, the increase of 50 basis points marked the 20th consecutive month of share gain. We are achieving this through innovation as well as effective marketing for both new products and core items. ","Within the subsegment of Taco seasoning mixes, we increased share of our McCormick brand 3 percentage points in the last 52 weeks and our share of Chili seasoning mixes is up 4 percentage points. We grew share of Zatarain\u2019s 5% this quarter versus the year ago period. Zatarain\u2019s rice mixes are outpacing the category growth rate and consumption of our frozen entr\u00e9es rose 4%. ","Across all of our US brands we are driving growth through accelerating innovation, building brand equity and through our category leadership at retail. ","On the innovation front, I will comment on two of our recent launches. I am pleased to report that in less than one year our McCormick Skillet Sauces have exceeded a 10% share in this growing category driven by the retail placement we\u2019ve gained and our marketing support. The relaunch of our gourmet line began early in 2015 with greater variety of Flavor Sealed technology that locks in flavor, color and aroma and a packaging that has a more premium fresh appearance. ","In this subsegment of the spice and seasoning category nearly 80% of retail distribution points are now converted to the new packaging and we\u2019ve seen base consumption trends for McCormick gourmet strengthened with consumption up 4% in the second quarter. This gourmet initiative has also helped us expand the number of McCormick brand SKUs on the shelf with existing customers, gain distribution of new customers and at other customers reduce the number of competitive brands they carry. ","For the second half of 2015 we're excited about our renovation plans. These include extending our liquid recipe mixes platform with the introduction of slow cooker sauces. Flavors include smoky barbecue pulled pork, and pot roast with caramelized onion and cracked black pepper. We will introduce additional gluten-free recipe mixes, including beef stew andfajitatobuild off the success of our initial variety; and Kitchen Basics stock cube, a convenient way to boost flavor for soups, stews and risottoswith no MSG or artificial flavors, including a vegetarian variety. Also in the Americas region, our launch plans in Canada include additional skillet sauces, gluten free recipe mixes and reduced sodium items. In Latin America, we are introducing mustard flavours and barbecue sauces. ","A second growth initiative in the US is building brand equity. We had particular success this quarter with our Grill Mates campaign, including excellent in-store display execution, great new television advertising and a 2015 grilling flavor forecast. ","Second quarter sales of Grill Mates grew 9% and we expect to maintain this momentum through the peak grilling season. Through digital marketing we\u2019re connecting directly with consumers. We are moving up the list of go to places for online recipe. McCormick.com is now in the top 40 recipe destinations, up from 175th in 2012 with 30 million annual visitors and 40 million recipe views. We have the largest online grilling community and are connecting with passionate users of Old Bay, Zatarain\u2019s and other distinctive brands. And behind the scene, we have better alignment of our digital assets not only in the US but all around the world. ","We continue to strengthen our retail partnership to drive category growth and engage consumers. On the last call Alan discussed the sharper focus on our retail price points and advanced analytic rigor around category management. As we rolled this out several retailers have begun to partner with us on self price adjustments and we\u2019re very encouraged by the results for them and for McCormick. ","At the end of the third quarter, we will be ready to launch a new comprehensive category management tool supported by additional internal resources and we expect these capabilities to accelerate our progress as it relates to pricing optimization. As you would expect this is an account by account discussion. As the latest consumption data illustrated we have reduced the category share decline for our brand but we are not yet where we want to be.","I believe we have the right actions and the right team in place to stabilize and then grow our share. In tandem with these actions, we\u2019re driving growth for our recipe mixes as well as niche brands within our US portfolio such as Lawry\u2019s, Old Bay, Grill Mates, Zatarain\u2019s, Thai Kitchen and now Drogheria & Alimentari.","Before I move to our industrial business, I just want to recognize the great performance of our joint venture in Mexico. Despite unfavorable currency rate, net income for this business rose 36% mainly due to sales growth and favorable costs. ","Turning now to our industrial business. We grew sales for this segment 1% and in constant currency a very strong 7%. This higher sales and our cost reduction initiatives led to a double digit increase in adjusted operating income in constant currency. EMEA led the growth this period with a double-digit constant currency sales increase and volume and product mix up 9%. This part of our business has had exceptional sales growth for the past three years as seen on Slide 11. ","As our business with quick service restaurant has been a challenge in other regions during this period, we're winning in the EMEA with product innovation and for the third year in a row were named new product supplier of the year in this region by a leading quick service restaurant customer. ","We also increased our share of business with quick service restaurants and are supporting the geographic expansion of those customers. Likewise we\u2019re expanding into new markets along with food manufacturers we supply and as an example have broken ground on a new facility in the Middle East. ","In the Americas region we are benefiting from an increase in consumer snacking, developing seasonings for snack bars, crackers and chips and similar products. At the same time our customers are moving toward more simple ingredients and our foundation in spices and herbs has us well-positioned. ","In the second quarter we had particularly strong demand from these customers in Latin America with double digit sales growth in constant currency. We have a strong base in Mexico and are supporting customer expansion into South America. In Brazil we cut the ribbon on a small R&D center this quarter to build our expertise in the local flavours. ","We also grew year on year sales to food manufacturers in the US this period and had a solid performance with sales of branded food-service product. In addition we had the benefit of sales from Brand Aromatics acquired early in March. Offsetting a portion of these gains is further weakness in our US sales to quick service restaurants. ","In our Asia-Pacific region we are pleased to be seeing further recovery in base sales to quick service restaurants. As in the first quarter we had an added benefit of innovation and limited time offers and with export sales of product supplied by our facilities in China, our outlook is for continued improvement through the second half of 2015 for our industrial business in China. ","Thank you for your attention. I will turn it back over to Alan.","Alan Wilson","Thanks Lawrence. As Lawrence reported, we are driving solid performance across many parts of our business, demonstrating the effectiveness of our growth strategies and our strong execution. We are making steady progress with our initiatives and encouraged by 2015 results through the first half. ","Next, I\u2019d like to provide a few updates from the time of our first-quarter earnings call back in late March, starting with acquisition activity. McCormick\u2019s business development team is having a busy year with great results. Back in February, we announced an agreement to purchase Drogheria & Alimentari and completed this purchase at the end of May. ","In early March, we acquired Brand Aromatics. About a week ago, we signed an agreement to acquire One World Foods, seller of Stubb's, the number one brand of premium authentic barbecue sauce in the US. Stubb's products also include marinades, rubs and skillet sauces. Annual sales of this business are approximately $30 million that are growing at a double-digit rate. Stubb\u2019s is a perfect complement to our products, rounding out our range of grilling items under the Grill Mates, Lawry\u2019s and McCormick brands. Maintain the authenticity of this brand we plan to keep the business headquarters in Austin, Texas. ","We expect to maintain a double-digit pace of sales growth near-term through expanded distribution, increased household penetration and innovative flavours. We anticipate significant cost synergies that will deliver at least $10 million of incremental EBITDA by 2017. At an anticipated purchase price of $100 million we expect Stubb\u2019s to be another attractive deal for McCormick. ","Along with our efforts to build sales through acquisitions and the innovation and brand marketing activity that Lawrence discussed, employees throughout the company are making great progress through their efforts to eliminate costs. We reaffirm our goal to achieve at least $85 million in cost savings this year. This will bring our cumulative annual cost savings to more than $400 million since our 2009 launch of McCormick\u2019s comprehensive continuous improvement program, CCI. ","During the second quarter we announced additional reorganization plans in the EMEA region. These plans include the transfer of certain additional activities to the recently established McCormick shared services center in Poland. While we expect record charges of approximately $25 million related to these actions, there's a very good payback with estimated annual cost savings of $16 million by the end of 2017. We recently increased our resources to drive our CCI program and expect to continue our track record of productivity improvement throughout the organization. ","Let\u2019s turn to some recent leadership changes. As announced in early June, we are pleased to have Maritza Montiel and Michael Conway joining our board. Maritza is former deputy CEO and Vice Chairman of Deloitte. During her 40 years with the firm she led a variety of strategic initiatives prior to retiring in mid 2014. Michael was president of Global Channel Development for Starbucks. His responsibility for all commercial and business strategy functions and is driving aggressive plans to expand to emerging international markets. Prior to Starbucks, Michael served in leadership roles at Johnson & Johnson and Campbell Soup. ","Retiring from our board is JP Bilbrey, Chairman President and CEO of Hershey. He served as a director since 2005 and we truly appreciate his participation and contributions to our success. ","Turning to our company leaders. Cile Perich, Senior VP of Human Resources retired from McCormick after 32 years of exemplary service and seven years as a member of our management committee. ","On Slide 17 we have listed the current members of the management committee which now include Lisa Manzone who\u2019s promoted to Cile\u2019s role and also Brendan Foley who joined us from Heinz about a year ago and whose responsibilities have been broadened from head of US consumer business to a North American role.","We also announced in April that Nneka Rimmer has joined the company. Most recently with Boston Consulting Group Nneka is responsible for shaping overall corporate strategies and working to increase EVA at McCormick. I'm confident that these latest changes will provide strong leadership for our business going forward. ","The last topic I want to cover before turning it over to Gordon relates to the helpfulness of spices and herbs. Since its formation in 2007, The McCormick Science Institute, MSI, has supported scientific research and dissemination of information on the health benefits of culinary herbs and spices. In 2014, MSI in partnership with The American Society for Nutrition hosted a summit of researchers, government officials and health and wellness communicators to discuss the role of herbs and spices in a healthy diet. This message is beginning to resonate. ","In May, we were pleased to learn that the US Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee has recommended to the government that the 2015 dietary guidelines encourage use of spices and herbs as a flavor alternative to sodium. We\u2019re optimistic that this change will be made. ","In addition, Australia's Healthy Eating Pyramid was recently updated and now encourages people to enjoy herbs and spices to flavor food without using salt. We regard our categories as advantaged on-trend with spicy foods, fresh foods, ethnic cuisine, simple ingredient. This latest health news is just one more reason for consumers to turn to spices and herbs to add flavour. ","It\u2019s now my pleasure to turn it over to Gordon for a financial perspective on our results and guidance.","Gordon Stetz","Thanks, Alan and good morning everyone. As both Alan and Lawrence indicated, we were pleased with our sales and profit results in the second quarter across our two segments and in both developed and emerging markets. ","On a constant currency basis, the underlying growth in sales was very strong at 5%. Our adjusted operating income excludes special charges and rose 1% but if we also exclude currency, we achieved 7% growth, a sequential improvement from the first quarter results. ","Taking a look at our consumer business, Slide 21 shows that we grew second-quarter consumer business sales 3% in constant currency driven by higher volume and product mix. Sales in the Americas rose 2% in constant currency from the second quarter of 2014 with contributions from higher volume and product mix as well as pricing actions mainly related to honey products in Canada. ","As Lawrence described, we grew US sales of recipe mixes, Grill Mates and Zatarain\u2019s products. While still a small part of our business, sales in Latin America grew at a double-digit rate this period as we expand distribution across a number of markets from our production base in El Salvador. ","In EMEA, consumer business sales in constant currency grew 4% as a result of higher volume and product mix. Distribution gains were major reason for the increase with wins in France, Poland and Russia. Our brand marketing and innovation are additional factors driving sales and we look forward to including sales of Drogheria & Alimentari in our results starting in the third quarter. ","In constant currency, we grew consumer business sales in the Asia-Pacific region 7% with a 9% increase in volume and product mix. Our sales in China continued to grow at a double-digit rate year on year. And Australia also delivered a double-digit increase for the second quarter. We had some further pressure from basmati rice prices in India leading to lower pricing for the region this period. ","In total for the consumer business, adjusted operating income was $81 million compared to $86 million in the second quarter of 2014. In constant currency, adjusted operating income was comparable to the year ago period with the impact of sales growth and cost savings offset by the unfavorable impact of material costs, retirement benefit expense and product mix. ","Also in the second quarter, we recorded about $1 million of transaction costs related to the acquisitions we\u2019ve announced in 2015. ","Turning to our industrial business. We grew second-quarter sales a robust 7% in constant currency from the year ago period. Pricing actions taken in response to higher material costs and higher volume and product mix, each added three percentage points and acquisitions another one percentage point of growth. ","In the Americas region, sales rose 5% in constant currency mainly from pricing actions and the addition of Brand Aromatics. Volume and product mix were comparable to the year ago period as increased sales of snack seasonings, particularly in Latin America, and higher sales of branded food service products were offset by continued weakness in sales to quick service restaurant customers. ","In our EMEA industrial business, we grew sales 12% in constant currency with a 9% increase in volume and product mix. As Lawrence described, we are in our third year of exceptional performance in this part of our business as we support the growth and geographic expansion of leading quick service restaurants and food manufacturers. ","We grew industrial business sales in the Asia-Pacific region 4% in constant currency. In China, we grew through innovation and export and the recovery continued from 2014 challenges with lower demand from major quick service restaurants. ","Adjusted operating income for the industrial business was $42 million, well ahead of $36 million in the second quarter of 2014. In constant currency, the growth was even more impressive at 24% with the benefit of higher sales and our CCI program more than offsetting the unfavorable impact of material costs and retirement benefit expense. ","Let\u2019s turn to Slide 31. Across both segments, adjusted operating income was $123 million, a 1% increase from $122 million in the second quarter of 2014. In constant currency, we grew adjusted operating income 7%. This is an improvement from the first quarter as increased cost reductions and additional pricing actions are providing a greater offset to material cost inflation. These same positive factors are impacting gross profit margin. ","While we were down 50 basis points year on year in the second quarter, this was a better performance than the first quarter. Heaving into the second half, we expect our cost reduction and pricing activity to continue to improve gross profit margin. However we now expect gross profit margin for the fiscal year to be comparable to 2014 rather than up slightly. ","As a percentage of net sales, our selling, general and administrative expense declined 60 basis points even with the impact of transaction costs related to our 2015 acquisition activity. Special charges of $19 million in the second quarter related primarily to the additional actions planned in EMEA that we announced in April. ","Below the operating income line, our effective tax rate was 16% which was below our initial guidance and year ago quarter due to $13 million of discrete tax benefit recognized in the second quarter of 2015. Based on our current outlook, including these benefits and our projected mix of our business across tax jurisdictions, our estimated effective tax rate for fiscal year 2015 is approximately 27% compared to our prior guidance of 27% to 28%. This is based on an underlying rate of approximately 29%. ","Keep in mind that in the absence of any further discrete items, we expect an unfavorable variance in the next two quarters with a tax rate of 29% versus 21.4% in the third quarter of 2014 and 25.9% in the fourth quarter of 2014. ","Income from unconsolidated operations rose 19% led by our joint venture in Mexico which continues to have a strong financial performance as Lawrence described. This increase is net of an unfavorable currency impact. ","At the bottom line, adjusted earnings per share for the second quarter of 2015 was $0.75. As you can see on Slide 34, this was an $0.11 year-on-year increase led by the lower tax rate along with increases in our adjusted operating income, unconsolidated income and lower shares outstanding. ","Turning next to Slide 35. We\u2019ve summarized highlights for cash flow and the quarter end balance sheet. Our cash flow from operations this period was $186 million compared to $182 million in the first half of 2014. During the first half of 2015, we used $70 million of cash to acquire nearly 1 million shares of McCormick stock occurring mostly in the first quarter. ","Given our activity to date we continue to anticipate a 1% reduction in shares in 2015. At quarter end we had $46 million remaining on our $400 million authorization. The Board approved a new $600 million share repurchase authorization in March. ","During the second quarter, we used a combination of cash and short-term borrowings to acquire Brand Aromatics for $63 million and make the initial payment of $49 million to acquire Drogheria & Alimentari. Likewise we expect to use a combination of cash and short-term borrowings for the acquisition of Stubb\u2019s later this quarter. ","Consistent with past practice, we have curtailed our share repurchase activity in order to return to our target debt to adjusted EBITDA level of 1.5 to 1.8. Our balance sheet remains sound. We are generating strong cash flow and we believe we are well-positioned to fund investments to drive growth, including future acquisitions. ","I will wrap up with our latest financial outlook for fiscal year 2015. We reaffirm our expectation to grow sales 4% to 6% in constant currency. The three acquisitions we have announced should add at least 1% of growth this year, giving us greater confidence in achieving the upper end of our range. We continue to estimate that currency will reduce our sales growth rate by 5 percentage points in 2015. ","We reaffirm our expected 6% to 7% constant currency growth for adjusted operating income from a 2014 base of $608 million in adjusted operating income. We continue to anticipate unfavorable currency rates to reduce operating income growth by 3 percentage points. ","For operating income on a reported basis, we expect a 4% to 5% decline from $603 million in 2014. This includes a $54 million estimated impact from special charges. We expect adjusted earnings-per-share of $3.47 to $3.54. This is a $0.03 increase from the previous guidance, reflecting the latest tax rate estimate. This new range, excluding an estimated $0.12headwind from currency is an increase of 7% to 9% from $3.37 in 2014. ","On a reported basis, we expect earnings-per-share of $3.18 to $3.25 compared to earnings-per-share of $3.34 in 2014. This range assumes a $0.29 impact from special charges. As you consider the financial projection for the second half versus the year ago period, keep in mind the projected headwinds from a higher tax rate, unfavorable currency and our plans to increase brand marketing. These factors are expected to cause a double-digit decline in third-quarter adjusted earnings-per-share compared to adjusted earnings per share of $0.95 in the third quarter of 2014. However our projection is to increase fourth quarter adjusted earnings-per-share from adjusted earnings-per-share of $1.16 in the fourth quarter of 2014. ","For fiscal year 2015, we continue to expect another year of strong cash flow. This will provide funding for our dividend, our acquisition activity, some debt paydown and future share repurchase activity. ","Let\u2019s turn now to your questions, then some closing remarks from Alan. Operator, we are ready for the first question. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from the line of Ken Goldman with JPMorgan.","Ken Goldman ","The shift to e-commerce in China, it\u2019s hurt a lot of consumer companies lately. McCormick seems to be bucking the trend. Just curious the spice and seasoning category, is it not being hit by the channel shift as much as others or is McCormick benefiting from that channel shift? I'm just curious for your thoughts here because it does seem to be a little bit of an anomaly versus what we're seeing elsewhere. ","Lawrence Kurzius","Hi Ken, this is Lawrence. I will take this question if you don\u2019t mind. We do participate in the e-commerce sector in China but I'll tell you for us it\u2019s still developing segment of the market, or developing channel just like it is for everyone else. The big difference I think in our business in China for our consumer segment is that we\u2019re a lot less dependent on the modern trade than many of our peer companies. With the acquisition of Wuhan Asia-Pacific Condiments, we got a strong foothold in the central part of China, great penetration in the more traditional segment of the market and we\u2019re experiencing really broad-based growth on both our McCormick brand and on our acquired brands across China. We recognize that there has been some slowdown in economic growth in China but our categories continue to do well and our brands in particular had really broad-based growth in this quarter, and we don't really see any change in that trend.","Ken Goldman ","Thank you. And then one follow-up. In general you're looking for a nice improvement in the gross margin as the year progresses at least on a year-on-year basis. I just want to make sure I understand if we had to sort of rank order the factors that are going to help that margin, how much might we attribute to currency versus pricing, just want a little bit more color if possible on what some of those factors might be?","Gordon Stetz","We're looking for sequential improvements in the gross profit margin and it's going to be a combination of CCI, which will be obviously continuing to progress as we go through the year, the pricing actions primarily on the industrial side of the business which as you know those pricing mechanisms get readjusted periodically based on the commodity basket. So those will continue to readjust periodically throughout the year, and then obviously our fourth quarter tends to be more heavily weighted to our consumer business so you'll get some benefit of business mix as we approach the fourth quarter. ","Operator","The next question is coming from the line of Alexia Howard with Sanford Bernstein.","Alexia Howard ","Can I ask about the trends in operating profit growth on the consumer side? It\u2019s been pretty flat for the business as a whole in the last couple of quarters on a constant currency basis. Are you expecting an improvement going forward and what are the puts and takes there and particularly I don't know what you can say about the consumer Americas business but how has that been moving and how is it expected to shape up for the rest of the year? Thank you. ","Gordon Stetz","Hi Alexia, it\u2019s Gordon. Again what we\u2019re expecting the raw material cost pressures as we mentioned in the conference call has been a factor primarily well across both businesses. The consumer business savings are starting to ramp up as we progress through the year. So those benefits we anticipate to be more heavily weighted to the back half of the year. The operating margins are also being impacted by our brand marketing expenses. So as we mentioned in the call we do have some increase in our brand marketing expenses. Some of this is going to be particularly weighted to Q3 and then finally we\u2019re looking just for the continued consistency of growth and volume to leverage our scale. So again by the fourth quarter anticipating -- our guidance anticipates a good fourth quarter for our consumer business, particularly in the US consumer business. So with the combination of CCI, scale and the timing of our brand marketing we expect good margin performance by the fourth quarter. ","Alexia Howard ","And just as a quick follow-up. In the US consumer business do you expect the price realization to improve through the course of the second half? Would you expect to get a little bit more of a benefit from year-on-year pricing being a little bit more stable than it has been in the past? Thank you. ","Gordon Stetz","We really haven't taken any pricing in the US consumer business there but we do expect a different mix as we\u2019re selling more branded items and less of the value item.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Driscoll with Citigroup.","David Driscoll ","Wanted just to ask your impressions of the US spices and seasoning category and the market share trends over the course of time. You guys mentioned this in your script but could you just spend a little bit more time on the share declines here and what should we expect going forward? Is this a multi-year trend where you'll just progress very slowly to try to getting the share declines to stop to get back to neutral? I'm just trying to get your sensitivity on when you see these kinds of share declines how the business wants to respond to it, how significant they are to you. You got top line growth but share declines are always something that we look at quite closely and I'm trying to get a sensitivity here on your concern level on this and then how it should progress forward? ","Alan Wilson","We are obviously very focused on stabilizing and growing share. Our intention is to actually be the driver of growth in our categories. We are seeing share improvement and have for 20 consecutive months in our recipe mixes. We're seeing it in some of our other brands like Zatarain's where we're seeing share improvement and we're seeing share improvement in some of our other markets. So our core focus is on the US consumer business where the core spices and seasonings represent a little less than 15% of our total company sales. So I want to keep it in perspective but we are very focused on regaining and driving share in those core items. We think the things that we're doing like working on the pricing of the high price sensitive items at retail is a good mix. We're helping our retailers in understanding the importance in the profitability of the category and that McCormick drives that profitability. So we feel like we're doing a lot of the right things but it is going to take some time. ","Lawrence Kurzius","Yes, David, this is Lawrence, if I can just add to those comments. We\u2019ve really been out in front of CAGNY in 2014 where really we were stepped up and said that we had lost some share in both of our core growth platforms in the US to some smaller competitors and put in place some initiatives to tackle that. I think we did a lot of the heavy lifting last year and we are really actually pleased with our sales progress in both the first quarter and the second quarter of this year. We are not gaining share yet in spices and seasonings. We are in recipe mixes and really have turned that around quite strongly, and in portions of our spices and seasonings business, we are seeing some great progress. Our gourmet relaunch, which is a part of turning around our spices and seasonings category growth is generating great early results. We are really winning the grilling season this year and we are confident that we will do more than just stabilize our share in this segment but that will return to share growth and will be driver of the category in the US. We won\u2019t be satisfied with our results ourselves until we do.","David Driscoll ","Is it still a price gap issue or do you think you have that under control? ","Lawrence Kurzius","I think that we thought about our pricing and really our thinking on pricing has evolved as our understanding of this issue has matured with the greater analytics capability. So when we spoke about this at CAGNY in 2014 our focus was on price gaps versus private libel and versus key competitors and having conversations with retailers about those price gaps with the aim of narrowing them either by reducing the prices on McCormick or frankly by raising the price on some competitive items that were irrationally priced, in some cases below the retailers private label. But as we've gone through 2014 and we\u2019ve developed greater understanding of the pricing dynamics we came to realize that the price gaps actually mattered less than the absolute price points on about a dozen key items. So our initiative this year has been focused more on managing the absolute price points on those key items and it does not involve additional pricing action or promotional activity on our part. It's really at the way we allocate the promotional spending that we're already doing with the customers to direct it to the most productive place. ","And then finally I think in my prepared remarks I mentioned a comprehensive category management tool and this is really the next step in our evolution on this to have an even stronger analytic capability that allows us to understand and model the cross-elasticity of the entire category to optimize it for the retailer.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Akshay Jagdale with KeyBanc. ","Akshay Jagdale ","One quick one just in terms of your guidance for this year, how much of the M&A related charges are included in your constant currency EBITDA or operating in some guidance? ","Gordon Stetz","We mentioned about $1 million related to the consumer acquisitions that is already absorbed in those guidance numbers. ","Akshay Jagdale ","And just can you talk a little bit more broadly about the consumer environment? There has been some talk about lower gas prices helping consumer spending. We really haven't seen it on broad data that we look at but how would you characterize the health of the consumer here in the US and maybe talk a little bit about China because all the indicators that we\u2019re seeing point to a little bit of slowdown there but your business is actually doing quite well. So can you talk about those two topics broadly? Thanks.","Alan Wilson","Sure. We are still seeing a bifurcated consumer with some level of growth in premium and our gourmet brand is an example of that and niche categories. So there is some growth. We are seeing some recovery in food service with people eating out. So we are seeing some of those lower gas prices find their way in. On the other hand, there is a vast number of consumers who are still stressed economically and so we are competing in the value segment to try capture that. ","In China, as Lawrence said, there has been some slowdown in economic activity. We\u2019re encouraged because we\u2019re still \u2013 we\u2019re pretty broad-based, we\u2019re in the traditional trade, we have our presence in the modern trade and we\u2019re participating in the emerging and fast-growing e-commerce. But we're still long-term believers in China. We continue to make investments there and are bullish on our prospects. ","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Jonathan Feeney with Athlos Research.","Jonathan Feeney ","Thanks. I just wanted to understand a little bit about -- seems like particularly as it relates to EMEA you've come back a few times with some business reviews around these restructuring charges and I guess it seems to me like maybe you're just trying to get your hands around new cost opportunities that kind of make sense in a changing context whether that's currency or some of the effects currency might have on the market. Could you tell me about that process a little bit because you've come up with some new charges a couple times now, I guess in the past six months sort of seen more opportunities to take special charges restructurings and maybe where we stand -- should we expect more of that in the second half of the year, more opportunity to do that? Thanks. Any perspective on that would be great. ","Gordon Stetz","Yes, I'll really point to -- and this is specific to Europe. It's a continuation of the journey of shared service structures and leveraging scale where we have opportunities to do that. You mentioned a couple of charges, the first charge was primarily our first truly shared service opportunity which we went to Poland with and it was focused primarily in the financial end of things. The current activities are again related to an extension potentially of other activities into those, into the same shared service center. So it's broadening shared service. It's the same journey we've gone on here in the US. The North American initiative that we took more recently was again more of an extension of shared service activity into our North American shared service and also in both cases it's looking at span of control, faster decision-making and how we can delayer decision-making to be more responsive in a very, very competitive market. ","We do these things very very analytically and thoughtfully. To say that we would never do anything again would be probably a misstatement but at the same time we have to execute what we've already discussed and as a result, we need to get done the charges that we already announced this year and execute against those programs. ","Operator","And next question is from the line of Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse.","Robert Moskow ","On gross margin erosion, I guess, it's kind of hard to see how all this trade activity and pricing actions, why is that not helping you get your gross margin up, like why is the gross margin continuing to erode a little bit? It doesn't appear to be hurting the year but I would have thought by the end of the year maybe do you expect to be back on track in track in terms of boosting gross margin?","Gordon Stetz","We expect gross margin -- as we talked about the impact of raw material costs this year, we said it would hurt us earlier in the year. We're forecasting mid single digit material cost inflation and the CCI -- that was hitting us right away in the beginning part of the year. The CCI was going to take some time for us to help offset that. So our expectation is as we progress through the year, gross margin will have a sequential improvement such that by year-end we should see gross margin improvement year on year. So we've got improvement in Q2 versus Q3. We anticipate further sequential -- I'm sorry Q2 versus Q1, we expect further improvement in Q3 versus Q2 and then again, improvement in the fourth quarter. So it's a function of the timing of raw material costs and the timing of our CCI. ","Robert Moskow ","Gordon, like what\u2019s the factor that caused you to have to lower the guidance for the year? What fell below expectations in the first half?","Gordon Stetz","The price realization is the same and CCI savings is the same. It\u2019s a tweak on the business mix candidly and the offset was obviously in the favorability of the SG&A. But there's -- we were up slightly, now we are comparable. It\u2019s not what I would call a major change to our full year guidance. But the terms of the fundamentals of how we see this playing out that has not changed. ","Robert Moskow ","Secondly, on the acquisition of Stubb\u2019s, is that providing any contribution to operating profit for the year? ","Gordon Stetz","It's pretty neutral based on acquisition integration costs and the transaction costs that we've already mentioned. ","Robert Moskow ","Okay, and then lastly, one of your biggest or I guess your biggest customer had been very promotional on its private label side. Has that eased off at all and has that allowed you to compete or to perform better at that retailer? ","Lawrence Kurzius","Hey Rob, this is Lawrence. I think what you are referring to is actually not private label but it\u2019s a controlled brand that is a McCormick brand that we sell them. They\u2019ve had a big \u2013 that\u2019s had a pretty big impact on us in the first part of the year but we do see as they lap the activity that started really last year, that is backing off considerably.","Robert Moskow ","Does that mean that it's kind of continuing at a steady state or is it\u2014","Alan Wilson","Actually the ACV, the large displays is about half its level of the peak. So we're still going to see some year-on-year comparison but it is greatly reduced from its peak. ","Lawrence Kurzius","Right. It's not steady state. ","Operator","The next question is from the line of Eric Katzman with Deutsche Bank ","Eric Katzman ","I guess two questions. On China industrial is limited time offers that helped you in the first quarter, did those roll off in the second as you had expected and is that business kind of on track or on plan with what you had thought? And then a bigger picture question for Alan. The company has gotten more aggressive with M&A this year, three deals and the latest one Stubb\u2019s in barbecue, I think the company\u2019s challenge in M&A has been potentially some kind of conflict with industrial customers who may be in the same business. Are you concerned about all of that, any of that or is there still enough runway based on the M&A you see to not have any conflicts arise within your industrial customers? ","Alan Wilson","Let me take the industrial question first or the acquisition questions first and I'll have Lawrence talk about China industrial. We always analyze for deals what the competitive overlap is going to be. We know that we need to be in parts of the categories that are growing faster and we see opportunities for this in this case and in the case of barbecue sauces, we saw very little competitive overlap and we saw the opportunity for us to really participate in more of the premium and higher priced part of the category that's growing. And so it's a brand that has no high fructose corn syrup and has carved out a very nice free firm all of the stuff that consumers don't seem to want right now. So that one fits very well for us and we see some other opportunities like that that don't impact or overlap with our critical customers. So we've expanded our horizons in terms of the kinds of acquisitions that we're considering. And I'll have Lawrence talk about China industrial. ","Lawrence Kurzius","Eric, on our China industrial business, the growth that we are experiencing there partly reflects a recovery of the quick service restaurants and partly reflects gain in share that we\u2019ve achieved with those same customers. So while the limited time offers are important, there is a steady stream of innovation that these customers are doing, that cycles through our business continuously. I\u2019d say the key underlying trend this year has been a recovery in the quick service restaurant themselves and a gain in our share with those customers. ","End of Q&A","Joyce Brooks","I think what we ought to do, since we are coming up on the hour is, I\u2019d like to turn it over to Alan for closing remarks and we will welcome any further questions. We will take those off-line. ","Alan Wilson","Sure. Great, thanks for all your questions and participating in the call today. Consumer demand for flavour is rising and driving demand for our products. Our geographic presence and product portfolio are expanding and in line with the move towards healthier eating, fresh ingredients, ethnic cuisine and bold taste. And we\u2019re driving growth through innovation, marketing and acquisitions. In 2015, we are seeing the benefits of our stepped-up cost reduction activity and we\u2019ll continue to pursue ways to improve our productivity and profit as we grow the topline. We look forward to reporting you on our continued progress in the upcoming quarters and we hope everybody goes out and grills on the 4th July weekend. Have a great weekend.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Joyce Brooks, Vice President, Investor Relations for McCormick. Thank you. Ms. Brooks, you may begin.","Joyce L. Brooks","Good morning, and welcome to our review of McCormick's fourth quarter financial results and 2012 outlook. We have posted a set of slides to accompany today's call at our website, ir.mccormick.com.","With me are Alan Wilson, Chairman, President and CEO; and Gordon Stetz, Executive Vice President and CFO. Also joining us for the first time is Mike Smith, who was named Vice President, Treasury and Investor Relations in October. Mike has been with McCormick since 1991 and brings to this role his experience in a variety of leadership positions, most recently as Vice President of Finance for a U.S. consumer business.","This morning, Alan's going to begin with some highlights from 2011 and then discuss our perspective on the current business environment and McCormick's growth opportunities as we head into 2012. Gordon will provide a review of our fourth quarter financial performance and introduce our 2012 financial guidance. After that, we look forward to discussing your questions and some closing remarks from Alan.","As a reminder, our presentation today contains projections and other forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those projected. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or other factors. As seen on slide 2, our forward-looking statement also provides information on risk factors that could affect our financial results. ","In addition, certain information that we will present today are not GAAP measures. This relates to financial results from 2010 that exclude items affecting comparability. We present this non-GAAP information for comparative purposes alongside the most recently comparable GAAP measures. Reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP measures can be found in the presentation slides for our call.","It is now my pleasure to turn the discussion over to Alan.","Alan D. Wilson","Thanks, Joyce. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. McCormick's financial results in the 2011 fourth quarter were a strong finish to a year of solid growth and important accomplishments. We delivered these results in a period of volatile material cost and a challenging economic environment in many of our markets. Our financial performance demonstrated the resiliency of our business and the ability of our leadership team and employees throughout the company to adapt to the current environment. I want to recognize and thank our employees for their efforts and achievements.","We grew sales in the fourth quarter by 13%, including a 5% benefit from our latest acquisition activity. Pricing rose 6%, yet we still achieved a 1% increase in volume and product mix. Product innovation, higher brand marketing and distribution gains helped drive the sales growth.","Fourth quarter earnings per share were $0.98 compared to $0.99 in the fourth quarter of 2010. Operating income rose 4% despite $7 million of transaction cost related to acquisitions completed in 2011, which lowered earnings per share by $0.05. We also had an unfavorable impact from a higher tax rate, increased interest expense and a slight decline in income from unconsolidated operations. Gordon will go into more details, but if you consider these headwinds, we had solid underlying growth in earnings per share, which reflected our strong sales performance and significant CCI cost savings.","For the full year, we grew sales 11% and 9% in local currency. This was well ahead of our initial expectation for 5% to 7% growth in local currency. Acquisitions were not in our initial range and added 2% of our growth for the year. Pricing added 5% to sales, above our initial projection, as we responded to a double-digit increase in material cost. In light of these pricing actions, we were extremely pleased with our volume and product mix, which rose 2.5% in 2011 excluding the impact of acquisitions.","I want to spend a moment on our key sales drivers in 2011, and we'll start with Kamis in Poland and Kohinoor in India. These businesses are helping to reshape our portfolio of leading brands around the world with more exposure in emerging markets. ","The integration of these businesses has progressed well to date, and we've maintained their pace of growth. With the addition of these businesses and our projected growth in China, Mexico and other countries, we now expect sales in emerging markets to account for at least 13% of 2012 sales. This is a significant increase from 2010, when sales in emerging markets accounted for 9% of sales. Keep in mind that we have additional presence in these markets through our unconsolidated operations. Income from these operations contributed 7% of our 2011 net income.","Product innovation continues to be a primary component of our sales growth. New products launched in the past 3 years accounted for 9% of 2011 sales. Rather than 1 or 2 big launches, we achieved broad-based success across a number of our growth platforms. In our consumer business, we launched more than 200 new branded products in 2011, well ahead of our normal pace which is closer to 100. These included 6 new World Flavors Recipe Inspirations in the U.S. and the launch of this product line in Canada and the United Kingdom. Grinders is another growth platform, and we added new versions in the U.S., the U.K. and France along with an introduction of Grinders in China. ","Our team in France developed nearly 40 new products, including an organic line of spices and herbs and a number of Vahin\u00e9 dessert items. One of our biggest successes was here in the U.S. with Zatarain\u2019s frozen entr\u00e9es. Including new items, we grew sales of Zatarain\u2019s frozen entr\u00e9es 40%, and our sales of these new items now comprise nearly 1\/4 of our total Zatarain\u2019s brand sales.","For our industrial business, we had strong demand for new products from food manufacturers, particularly for flavor solutions that feature all-natural ingredients, reduced sodium, lower calorie and other healthy attributes. In the U.S., these types of health and wellness projects accounted for nearly 40% of our product development projects in 2011. ","We're driving sales with brand marketing support. Promotion and advertising reached $187 million in 2011, up 12% from 2010 and up 72% from 5 years ago. As a percentage of sales, brand marketing support continues to rise, reaching 7.6% of net sales for our consumer business in 2011, up from 6.3% in 2006.","About 1\/3 of the 2011 increase was in digital marketing, one of our highest return investments in brand marketing support. We had an effective digital marketing program behind Grill Mates in the U.S. that contributed to a 7% unit increase in 2011. Support behind our Hispanic products in the U.S., including television and a sampling program, helped drive a 9% increase in sales of these products, which exceeded $100 million in 2011.","2011 was a particularly strong year for distribution gains. Wins included both brand and private label, with penetration of multiple channels: grocery, club store, dollar stores, drug chains in the U.S. and in Europe, grocery, medium and small store formats and discounters. Our industrial business continues to benefit from the global expansion of strategic customers. In 2011, we supported the opening of new quick service restaurant locations in China, the Middle East, Russia and for the first time, India.","Cost savings from Comprehensive Continuous Improvements, CCI, is our fuel for growth. CCI is our ongoing effort to improve productivity and reduce cost across the organization. In 2011, our CCI cost savings funded incremental brand marketing support as well as helped to offset the unfavorable impact of increased material costs. Led by our CCI champions and with the engagement of employees throughout the business, we achieved $65 million in cost savings in 2011, a result that was well ahead of our initial goal for the year. Since we embarked in our CCI activity in 2009, our cumulative savings have reached $156 million.","Our cash flow was clearly impacted by the material cost inflation that we faced in 2011. Cash flow from operations was $340 million compared to $388 million in the prior year due largely to increased inventory. The increase in material cost affected the value of the inventory we held and also led us to increase our raw material quantities of certain spices and herbs, which is how we hedge these items. As Gordon will discuss, we expect to improve our cash flow in 2012.","We are committed to returning cash to shareholders and used $238 million of our cash for dividends and share repurchases in 2011. In November, McCormick's board approved an 11% increase in the quarterly dividend, our 26th consecutive annual increase. Including the dividends, our total shareholder return was 13% for fiscal year ending November 30, 2011. For the 10 years ended November 30, our total annual shareholder return has been 11%. This exceeds the return of the food group as well as the S&P 500 as shown on Slide 8.","While we continue to operate in a difficult environment, we expect a year of strong sales growth and higher profit in 2012. While Gordon will discuss the financial outlook in more detail, I'd like to spend the next few minutes on the current environment and our opportunities for growth in the year.","Based on recent discussions within the food industry, there continues to be a focus on higher material cost and the impact of pricing actions. So let's start with that topic.","In 2011, based on the strength of our brands and our industrial customer relationships, we were able to offset a double-digit increase in material costs with a combination of pricing and CCI cost savings. Our most recent action was a price increase of about 5% for our North American consumer business products and industrial food service items. This went into effect in the fourth quarter and was taken in response to further material cost increases in the second half of 2011, which we expect to persist in 2012. The effect of this pricing action will carry over into 2012 with an anticipated favorable sales impact in the first 3 quarters. While the timing and percentage increase varied, we've taken similar actions in a number of our other markets.","In order to gauge the impact of our price increases, we've been actively monitoring and analyzing consumption information. Based on our work to date, we can state that retailers have accepted the pricing actions on our branded products and have reflected them in shelf prices. Price increases have also been accepted on the private label products we supply. In addition, we've seen branded competitors take similar pricing actions.","Based on our analysis of recent U.S. consumption data, we've seen some general slowdown, particularly in measured channels, in both the category and our branded sales. In addition, the rate of growth for private label has also slowed in recent weeks. Similar results have been seen in other food categories. Our shipment trends during this period for both brand and private label have been in line with these consumption trends.","While other factors may be behind some of this near-term fluctuation, we attribute a portion of the trend in branded spice and seasoning volumes to our pricing actions. As those of you who have followed us for a while know, it's not unusual for us to see an initial volume impact following a price increase. In the upcoming quarters, we plan to reallocate a portion of our brand value marketing to more coupons and other promotional tools. We will monitor the situation closely as we expect this pressure on sales volumes to be a headwind in 2012, particularly in the first quarter results.","As for our outlook for material costs, we expect further volatility in 2012. Based on the insights of our global procurement team, we expect our 2012 raw and packaging material increases to be broad based across our supply chain and then the aggregate to rise at a high-single digit rate.","At this time, we believe we're priced appropriately based on this cost outlook and have no plans for further significant pricing actions in our consumer businesses. For our Industrial business, we continue to pass through increases on major commodities as well as on flavor ingredients, including spices and herbs. As explained in our September call, the pricing actions for flavor ingredients occurred with a little bit of a lag but have been accepted by our customers.","Across both businesses, we expect to offset projected 2012 material cost inflation with a combination of pricing actions, including a carryover benefit from 2011 increases and CCI cost savings. Pricing is expected to add about 5% to sales. CCI cost savings for 2012 are expected to be at least $40 million. This year's projects will include the consolidation of one of our manufacturing facilities in Canada and the creation of wet product manufacturing for our consumer business in North America. This new capability will allow us to move production of Lawry's marinades from a co-packer in 2012 and establish a manufacturing base for our condiments, sauces and spreads growth platform.","Even in this environment of higher prices, we grew sales volume in 2011. And in 2012, we have activity underway behind each of our 3 avenues of growth: base business, innovation and acquisitions. McCormick's leadership group will be discussing these in more depth at our April investor meeting, but let me provide a quick overview this morning.","We'll be driving base business growth with brand marketing support. We're planning to increase our 2012 brand marketing at least $10 million following our $20 million increase in 2011, and our programs will continue to adapt to today's consumer. This includes another significant increase in digital marketing, more Hispanic programs in the U.S. and an emphasis on value to include targeted coupons. Our new products will receive a portion of advertising support to build new awareness and trial. For example, all major U.K. customers now have Recipe Inspirations on the shelf, and we began our advertising campaign this month. Also driving base business growth will be a carryover effect from some of the distribution gain in 2011. And in 2012, we continue to pursue new distribution opportunities, including further penetration of alternative channels and improving our category share.","Our product innovation activity is also designed to build share as well as differentiate our brand. We have an exciting line of new products for our consumer business for the first part of 2012. In the U.S., we'll be introducing new Grill Mates rubs, marinades and seasoning blends; Perfect Pinch varieties that include Southwest Sweet 'n Smoky; Gourmet blends; 5 new Lawry's items, including Mediterranean Herb & White Wine Marinade; 8 new products under our Simply Asia and Thai Kitchen banner; and additional varieties of Zatarain\u2019s frozen entr\u00e9es.","To date, the restaging of our dry seasoning mixes in the U.S. has included product reformulation with natural ingredients and new advertising. In 2012, we'll introduce this next phase of this restaging, which includes new flavor varieties, new packaging design and new merchandising as well as an introduction of a premium line of gourmet dry seasoning mixes to prepare dishes like sweet basil and oregano bruschetta chicken.","We also have innovative -- innovation underway behind dry seasoning mixes outside the U.S. with our limited addition items in the U.K. In France, our product development team has another busy year underway with plans for 20 new Ducros brand items and 10 Vahin\u00e9 dessert products. In China, dry seasoning mixes, jams and sauces will be among our new product launches.","On the industrial side of our business, we have a robust new product pipeline in each of our 3 regions. Customers continue to turn to McCormick as they work to improve the health profile of their products and at the same time, deliver great taste. This month, we broke ground in China to create our Asian Technical Innovation Center, where customers can come to collaborate with us on the development of on-trend consumer-preferred products. ","Our third avenue of growth is acquisitions. In our developed markets, we're seeking strong brands like Kitchen Basics that could expand our flavor portfolio. And we're expanding geographically through acquisitions with an emphasis on emerging markets. In 2011, we completed transactions that meet both of these criteria and have created strong momentum for 2012. ","Kamis is off to a great start. The integration of Kamis is well underway, and we are already pursuing growth opportunities. One of these opportunities is to bring our category management expertise to this business. In the first 3 months following the acquisition, we've met with each of Kamis' top customers and in doing so, uncovered numerous joint opportunities to improve product assortment and merchandising. We also worked to build consumer demand during the holidays, delivering more television ads in November and December that will run in either of the previous 2 years.","The integration of Kohinoor is also well underway. We've augmented the Kohinoor management team and completed meetings with each major customer to ensure that the new leadership is well received and meeting expectations. In 2012, this business will be continuing to build retail distribution against -- across India and develop new products for the market.","And just briefly, to round out my remarks on acquisitions, for Kitchen Basics in the U.S., our 2012 focus is on product innovation and optimizing our brand position within the category of liquid stocks. In Turkey, in less than one year, our new joint venture has developed 42 items and achieved 100% acceptance of all Ducros brand in the modern trade. We are poised for rapid growth in 2012.","Toward the end of his remarks, Gordon will discuss how these sales growth initiatives, along with our pricing actions, cost inflation and CCI program, will shape our financial outlook. But let me state that while we are cautious, given the continued volatility in material cost and the economic pressure faced by the consumer in many of our markets, I'm pleased with our prospects for growth in 2012. We have excellent opportunities and initiatives underway in each part of our business.","I'll now turn it over to Gordon for a discussion of our fourth quarter financial results and then our 2012 guidance.","Gordon M. Stetz","Thanks, Alan, and good morning, everyone. Given the difficult economic situation that consumers are facing in many of our large markets, we were encouraged by our solid financial performance for the fourth quarter and operating results, which were generally in line with our expectations.","In each of our 2 segments, we grew sales at a double-digit rate, with a 13% increase for the total business. Operating income was up 4% net of a 4% headwind from acquisition-related transaction cost, and we delivered earnings per share of $0.98 compared to $0.99 in the fourth quarter of 2010, including the unfavorable impacts of these transaction costs and tax rate.","Let's start with top line growth and a look at our consumer business. As seen on Slide 14, we grew consumer business sales 13.5%, with a 12% increase in local currency. In a period of increased pricing, our volumes held up well, and we had a strong contribution from acquisition activity in the fourth quarter of 2011.","In the Americas region, we grew consumer business sales 7%. As seen on Slide 15, sales from Kitchen Basics added 3% to growth, and the effect of currency was minimal. Pricing was up 7% this period with the impact of both our December 2010 price increase and the pricing actions that went into effect in the fourth quarter of 2011.","Along with these price increases, we had some shift in sales as customers purchased product in advance of the increases. In fact, we were affected by an estimated $10 million shift into the fourth quarter of 2010 from the first quarter of fiscal 2011 and by an estimated $10 million shift into the third quarter of 2011 from the fourth quarter of 2011. So compared to the year ago period, these shifts in customer purchases created a $20 million headwind for us in the fourth quarter of 2011. This had an unfavorable impact of about 4% on consumer sales in the Americas region, a 3% sales impact on the total consumer business and a 2% sales impact on our fourth quarter sales for the total company.","In the Americas region, volume and product mix declined 3%, which reflects the 4% unfavorable impact from the shift in sales, offset in part by a 1% increase in the underlying business. We are pleased with this result given the pricing actions implemented in 2011. In Europe, the Middle East and Africa, EMEA, we grew consumer sales 36% with a 32% increase in local currency. Our Kamis acquisition added 26% to sales this quarter, with the remaining increase mainly from pricing. Excluding Kamis, we had a 1% increase in volume and product mix. The primary drivers of growth this period were export sales into developing markets and improved results in some of the smaller markets, such as Portugal.","We remain cautious in our business outlook in Western Europe. Our fourth quarter performance was solid in France, with increased pricing only slightly offset by lower volume and product mix. We supported sales of our Ducros and Vahin\u00e9 brands in this market throughout 2011 with incremental brand marketing support, distribution gains and a number of new product introductions.","In the U.K., we continue to operate in a competitive retail environment, where private label share has increased in many categories. We have launched differentiated new products, such as Recipe Inspirations and are delivering enhanced promotional programs to offer value to consumers. We are also redirecting a portion of our brand marketing support to emphasize the value of our products. While these initiatives combined with the merchandising of our brands in store and execution of specific activities are showing encouraging results, we expect our business in the U.K. to continue to be under pressure in 2012.","Consumer business sales in the Asia Pacific region rose 36% and in local currency were up 29%, with Kohinoor in India adding 33% to sales this period. Excluding this impact, sales this period were below the fourth quarter of 2010. A change in the timing of customer purchases in China led to a sales shift, which unfavorably impacted the fourth quarter of 2011.","For the full year, in local currency, consumer sales in China rose 10%. For the fourth quarter and throughout 2011, our business in Australia has been challenged by a tough retail and competitive environment. Across the entire region, we expect solid growth in our Asia Pacific consumer business in 2012, led by new products, expanded distribution and stepped-up marketing in China along with the incremental sales from Kohinoor.","Fourth quarter operating income for our consumer business increased $5 million to $164 million, with the favorable impact of higher sales and CCI cost savings offset in part by increased material cost and $7 million of transaction cost related to the completion of the Kamis and Kohinoor acquisitions. During the quarter, we invested an incremental $9 million behind our brands, with increased advertising behind Thanksgiving in the U.S., Recipe Inspirations in Canada, Vahin\u00e9 products in France and Grinders in China. $4 million of the increase related to our acquisitions.","Let's turn to the sales performance of our industrial business. For this segment, we also grew sales at a double-digit rate. In local currency, the increase was 12%. McCormick continues to drive industrial business sales with product innovation and expanded distribution to support our strategic customers as they grow globally.","On Slide 20, industrial sales in the Americas grew 11%, with 6% from pricing and 4% from volume and product mix. We grew sales to food manufacturers at a double-digit rate, with new products that included snack seasonings in both the U.S. and Mexico. Many of these products featured all-natural ingredients, reduced sodium, lower calorie and other healthy attributes for which we continue to see high demand. Sales to the food service industry also rose with the increase due primarily to pricing actions. ","In EMEA, our industrial business had another quarter of strong sales growth. We grew fourth quarter sales 12% and in local currency, 13% as a result of favorable volume and product mix. We are meeting greater demands from quick service restaurants with products that we supply from operations in the U.K., Turkey and South Africa.","In the Asia Pacific region, industrial business sales rose 29% and in local currency, grew 22%. Australia, China and sales in Southeast Asia all achieved strong increases in sales of new products, such as beverage flavors, as well as more basic ingredients, including pepper. For sales to quick service restaurants, we also benefited this period from their promotional activity and expansion in the region. ","Operating income for the industrial business rose 5% to $28 million. This was a significant improvement from the decline in profit that we reported in the third quarter and due in part to our ability to get price increases in place for many of the smaller ingredients that are not part of the pricing protocol. This profit growth puts our industrial business back on track with a 5-year record of increases in operating income. For the year, industrial operating income was up 4%. In this period of material cost volatility, we are closely managing our pricing actions and cost pass-through protocol.","For the total business, fourth quarter operating income rose 4% from the year ago period. This is after the effect of a 4% unfavorable impact from acquisition-related transaction cost. At the gross profit line, we achieved a 7% increase in gross profit dollars with the strong sales performance and CCI cost savings. ","During the quarter and for the fiscal year, we were able to offset material cost inflation with a combination of pricing actions and CCI cost savings. Gross profit margin ended 2011 at 41.2%, down 130 basis points from 42.5% in 2010. As a percentage of net sales, the positive effects of our pricing actions and CCI cost savings were more than offset by material cost inflation as well as unfavorable segment and product sales mix.","Product mix within the industrial business was unfavorable, with increased demand for ingredients as well as weakness in our sales of branded food service items. Segment mix also weighed on gross profit margin with our 2011 sales growth from the industrial business a bit higher than the consumer business.","SG&A rose 10% from the fourth quarter of 2011 but as a percentage of sales, was down 80 basis points. This period, SG&A included a $10 million increase in brand marketing support, $9 million for our consumer business and $1 million behind our branded food service products in our industrial business. For the year, we increased marketing by $20 million, with $4 million of the increase in both the fourth quarter and fiscal year related to acquisitions. SG&A this quarter also included the $7 million of transaction cost related to Kamis and Kohinoor.","Our mix of earnings during the fourth quarter of 2011 led to a tax rate of 28.7%, which compared favorably to our 31% guidance for the fiscal year. Even at this reduced rate, the fourth quarter 2011 tax rate exceeded the 26.7% tax rate that we had in the fourth quarter of 2010. If you recall, in the year ago period, we had a favorable impact from U.S. foreign tax credits that resulted from the repatriation of cash from foreign subsidiaries.","Moving to income from unconsolidated operations. We reported $4.5 million this quarter, down $1.4 million from the fourth quarter of 2010. Results from our joint venture in Mexico were under pressure from higher soybean oil cost and the devaluation of the Mexican peso. While we had incremental profit from our Eastern joint venture in India in the quarter, we also had investment spending behind the [indiscernible] joint venture in Turkey this period.","For the full year, sales of our unconsolidated operations rose 32%, with 18% of the increase from our new Eastern joint venture in India and 14% of the increase from existing businesses, particularly our long-standing joint venture in Mexico. Profit from higher sales was offset in part by material cost pressure, currency impact and our initial investments to launch our brand in Turkey. Income from our unconsolidated operations ended 2011 at $25.4 million and accounted for 7% of our reported net income. ","Early in 2012, we expect the favorable impact of higher sales to be largely offset by unfavorable material cost as well as currency exchange rates. This is likely to cause a decline in income from unconsolidated operations in the first quarter. For the full year, we project income from unconsolidated operations to be about even with 2011.","At the bottom line, as shown on Slide 27, fourth quarter 2011 earnings per share was $0.98 compared to $0.99 in the prior year period. Operating income added $0.04, which included $0.05 from acquisition-related transaction cost. This $0.04 increase was offset by a higher tax rate, lower joint venture income and higher interest expense. While we continue to expect 2012 accretion from our latest acquisitions, their profit impact was neutral in the fourth quarter during the integration phase of these businesses.","Let's turn next to our year-end balance sheet and 2011 cash flow. We maintained a solid balance sheet in 2011 even with the spike in material cost and a $441 million investment in acquisitions and joint venture interest. Debt at November 30 was $1.3 billion compared to $0.9 billion at the end of fiscal year 2010. We expect to continue our pay down of debt in 2012 as we return to our target debt ratios and prepare for future acquisitions.","A portion of our debt was used to finance increased inventory in 2011. As we have discussed throughout the year, much of the increase was due to increased material cost as well as strategic inventory positions we've taken for certain spices and herbs in order to secure a steady supply of high-quality materials for our customers. At year end, inventory was up $136 million, with about 1\/3 of the increase due to the cost impact, 1\/3 to strategic positions and about 15% related to our acquisitions.","In 2012, we anticipate further material cost inflation, but given our current outlook, we expect inventory to level off and begin to decline as we work down a portion of our strategic inventory. In addition, we have seen some early progress with our new inventory management processes in North America and expect this to have further benefits in that region in 2012 before we expand it to other regions.","As evidence of our progress, net cash flows from operating activities in the fourth quarter of 2011 exceeded cash flow in the fourth quarter of 2010. For the full year, net cash flows were $340 million in 2011 compared to $388 million in 2010. The increased inventory was the primary reason for this decrease.","During the year, we used a combination of cash, debt and proceeds from stock option exercises to fund $441 million of acquisitions, $149 million of dividends, $97 million of capital expenditures and $89 million of share repurchases. In 2012, we expect to further pay down our debt and resume our share repurchases in the absence of any acquisition activity. At November 30, 2011, $270 million remained of our $400 million share repurchase authorization.","Let's turn next to our outlook for 2012 on Slide 29. As Alan described, we continue to operate in an uncertain environment, facing further cost inflation and consumers that are under economic pressure in many of our markets. We are responding to this environment with our latest pricing actions and CCI program and have initiatives in place to drive sales with product innovation, brand marketing support, new distribution and our acquisitions. At the top line, we are projecting 9% to 11% sales growth in local currency. We estimate this range will be reduced by 2% based on prevailing foreign exchange rates.","Acquisitions will be an important driver of sales growth in 2012, and we expect an incremental impact of 5% to 6% in the first 3 quarters from Kamis, Kohinoor and Kitchen Basics. For the full year, the expected sales increase is 4%.","We anticipate sales of our base business to grow 5% to 7%, with a similar increase in both the consumer and industrial segments. We expect our pricing actions to be a large driver of this 5% to 7% increase, with volume and product mix flat to up slightly. While we are seeing an impact on volumes from our latest pricing, we expect to offset this with our new products, brand marketing and distribution expansion activity.","Operating income is projected to grow 9% to 11%, driven largely by higher sales. We expect to offset high-single digit cost inflation with our pricing actions and at least $40 million in CCI cost savings. We plan to increase total brand marketing support by at least $10 million with about half of the increase related to the acquisitions. As Alan indicated, this builds upon the $20 million of incremental brand marketing support in 2011.","There are 2 more factors to keep in mind as you update your 2012 financial models. First, we recorded $11 million of transaction cost in 2011 related to completion of acquisitions. This will create a favorable variance for us in the second half of the year when comparing 2012 to 2011. ","The second factor largely offsets this favorable variance and relates to our retirement benefit expense, which is projected to increase $9 million in 2012. This increase is largely a result of the very low discount rate at November 30, 2011, which was used in the actuarial calculation of 2012 expense. Below the operating income line, we expect interest expense to be higher following our 2011 acquisitions, and we project a tax rate of 30%, which compares to 29% in 2011.","Although we believe 2012 will be a year of strong sales growth for our joint ventures, as I indicated previously, unconsolidated income is expected to be about even with 2011 as a result of increased material cost and the unfavorable exchange rate of the Mexican peso. At the bottom line, our guidance for 2012 earnings per share is $3.01 to $3.06. ","We do not typically provide quarterly guidance. However, based on our current outlook, we expect earnings per share of $0.51 to $0.54 in the first quarter. This is down from $0.57 in the year ago period, and there are several factors behind this projection. ","The first relates to cost inflation. If you look at our first quarter of 2011, gross profit margin increased by 130 basis points. At that time, we were not yet feeling the impact of higher material cost, but this quickly reversed in the second quarter when year-on-year gross profit margin declined 120 basis points. So we have a bit of a tough comparison in the first quarter of 2012 as it relates to gross profit margin, which we expect to be down around 250 basis points, similar to what we reported in the last 2 quarters of 2011. For the balance of the year, we expect gross profit margin to be close to the prior year.","The second factor also relates to raw material costs and the effect on our income from unconsolidated operations. As I mentioned earlier, higher costs year-on-year and currency exchange rates are going to cause a decrease in income from unconsolidated operations, which is expected to lower first quarter earnings per share by about $0.02.","Third, we plan to increase our brand marketing support in the first quarter by more than $5 million. As a result of these factors, our first quarter is going to be a slower start to 2012, but we expect to resume profit growth beginning with the second quarter.","The last part of our 2012 outlook to cover is cash. As indicated earlier, we expect to achieve an increase in net cash flow from operations primarily driven by higher net income and a reduction in inventory. We are planning capital expenditures of $100 million to $110 million, further debt reduction and share repurchases that will result in a slight decline in our shares outstanding.","To summarize, our 2012 outlook is for 9% to 11% growth in sales in local currency, a 9% to 11% increase in operating income and a solid EPS result. We are committed to solid execution of our growth initiatives and to achieving these goals. ","Alan has a few closing remarks, but let's turn next to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Akshay Jagdale of KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Akshay S. Jagdale - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","So my first question is regarding fiscal '12 growth and your EPS outlook. Just is it possible for you to talk to us about the growth in terms of base business versus acquisition and the cost that you had last year? So the way I thought about the growth is I've broken out the growth between base business growth and then the accretion from your acquisitions as well as the lower cost related to the transactions that you did. So it seems to me that base business growth is going to be well below sort of your normal long-term growth rate in terms of operating income. And it looks like it's mainly because of higher commodity cost, and it looks like all of it's going to hit you, really, in 1Q. Am I reading that correctly? Or am I missing something? I know the retirement benefit expense may be something to do with it, but is that the right way to think about it?","Gordon M. Stetz","Yes. Certainly, as we're building our budgets and plans, we look at the incrementality, the acquisitions. And as we indicated last year, those acquisitions are expected to be accretive and the guidance we gave was $0.07 and $0.09. I'd say we're still within that guidance as we built our outlook for 2012. So the factors that you pointed to, which we talked about in the call, the material cost as well as the pension, I\u2019d just like to emphasize that, are impacting the base business.","Akshay S. Jagdale - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","So if you just look at longer term, obviously, you've done a tremendous job of building shareholder value, and your targets internally as well are very much in line with shareholders\u2019. So it seems like some exogenous factors, just commodity costs that are out of your control, have impacted your base business significantly over the last, let's call it 12 months. So should we expect that to sort of reverse as we go forward? So the base business has been growing at a lower rate than normal recently. But if commodity costs level out or even come down, should we expect to see that growth sort of come back in a sense that maybe at some point, you start growing at a much faster rate for a short period of time than you have been recently? Is that a possibility? Or you're -- you think if that happens, you will just reinvest back in the business and continue to grow sort of 9% to 11% on the bottom line?","Alan D. Wilson","We would -- what\u2019s happened with all the cost volatility over the last couple of years has impacted our long-term growth model, which is built around being able to invest behind the business but also to improve margins in a fairly stable cost environment. So what we've been doing is adapting our business over the last, really, 2 years to take more pricing than we would typically take. Certainly, as with our strong CCI programs, as we start to see stability -- even if we don't see a big retreat in cost, as we start to see stability, our model kind of starts to work again, because our CCI program is generally built towards increasing our margins, while our pricing is just to offset cost. What we've seen in the last 2 years is we've needed a combination of pricing and CCI to offset the increased costs.","Akshay S. Jagdale - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","So in other words, I mean, just would you -- would we -- should we expect to see an acceleration in growth even if it's above your long-term target? I mean, is that possible? Or would you -- if that happens, would you tend to invest that in future growth initiatives?","Alan D. Wilson","I think we've been pretty balanced through the combination of investment for growth behind our consumer and our industrial businesses and returning returns to shareholders to increase EPS. So we would likely spend some of the money, and we would likely take some of the earnings.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Ken Goldman of JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Kenneth Goldman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So you're the second food manufacturer in the last couple of weeks to call out weak overall food trends in traditional channels, not just in spices, obviously, but overall. And I think this is maybe counter to what some people expected as the economy maybe slowly recovers. So just curious for your insight there. Do you think traffic's maybe down because of continued high pricing? And I'm sure that's a big part of it, or there's some other drivers we're not seeing. Maybe club and dollar stores are just doing something better and unique in terms of marketing and attracting consumers. Just curious, I know you don't have a presence across the whole store, but I'm curious what your insights are there.","Alan D. Wilson","I think there is some impact, as some of the other manufacturers have talked about, of people moving to other channels, like dollar and club and that sort of thing. What we are seeing is some consumer behavior, which we've not seen before, that has led to a decline in the most recent period in the data that we have.","Kenneth Goldman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And what would you say is the normal run rate, separate subject, for your CCI annual savings? I know it's difficult to forecast these items. Sometimes they come in, obviously, faster or slower than expected. But how should we think about this going forward? Because a $25 million swing year-on-year is not insignificant.","Alan D. Wilson","Year-on-year, we try to target about $50 million of CCI savings, just below, and for the last couple of years, we've been able to overachieve that. And I'd also point out, the $40 million goal that we set this year, we expect is a goal that we\u2019ll hit and likely exceed. So we're setting targets and trying to drive it. It's really a part of our ongoing operations, and we've got some good ideas and some good projects that we think will be good, that will help us.","Kenneth Goldman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. So you do see the $40 million -- I know you're not promising this -- but as potentially conservative?","Gordon M. Stetz","We typically hit what -- at least hit what we say we're going to hit.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Alexia Howard of Sanford C. Bernstein.","Alexia Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Just one quick question as a follow-up to Ken's question and then something on new products. Are you seeing a pickup in the restaurant sector? And is that putting pressure, as far as you're seeing it, on the packaged food space in general? I'm just wondering whether it's not just growth in dollar stores and alternative channels but maybe a pickup in the restaurant sector, which you may have a good handle on from your industrial business, might be causing some of the pressure on the packaged food sector. And then secondly, in new products, you mentioned new products represent about 9% of sales at the moment. What do you think is the right long-term level of that? Can you accelerate that? And maybe can you make any commentary about how quickly that's expanded over the last 2 or 3 years?","Alan D. Wilson","Yes. Thanks, Alexia. In the fourth quarter, we did see some positive volume growth in the restaurant sector, which we kind of view as healthy, because it's been a couple of years of pretty significant declines. And so I don't want to speculate on what -- if consumers are eating out and not cooking at home, I don't think we're seeing that return as much, but we did see some positive volume growth late in the year in our food service business. Secondly, on the new products, we would expect a new product sales to be in -- to be something in the order of 10% to 12%, so 9% over the last 3 years, we would expect, as we go forward, that to be a higher percentage.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Thilo Wrede of Jefferies & Company.","Thilo Wrede - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Are your industrial contracts, are they completely repriced now to reflect not only the inflation that you saw in 2011 but also to reflect the inflation you're expecting for 2012?","Alan D. Wilson","For the most part -- I mean, we've got a broad range of contracts with customers across the world, but generally, we are appropriately priced. Now a lot of the major commodities like wheat and soybean oil gets passed through as those commodities change. So as we see increases, we price. And then as we see decreases, we pass through that pricing. But I'd say, by and large, as we caught up in the fourth quarter, that we're appropriately priced. And we'll -- as we see additional inflation, we'll deal with that. Or if we see some softening in cost, we'll deal with that.","Thilo Wrede - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","And then could you give just a little bit more color on your comment that you will resume the share repurchases? Is that going to start soon? Or is that more back loaded in the fiscal year?","Alan D. Wilson","I would suggest that you would -- by the end of the first quarter, you'll start to see activity as we report.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Rob Moskow of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse Group.","Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just a couple of follow-ups. If the share repurchase continues, do you think you could ever get back to your long-term guidance of 2% reduction in share count as a result of share repurchase? And then secondly, your cost inflation for this year is a lot higher than I thought it would be, up in the high-single digit range. Is it your objective to just kind of wait and see before taking another price increase? Or are you comfortable that the pricing that you have in the market right now plus the CCI is enough to just get you back to keep the gross margins from falling further? And then one more follow-up. Regarding the acquisitions, is there any dilution to your gross margin from those acquisitions?","Alan D. Wilson","I'll take the pricing commodity question, let Gordon handle the share buyback and the margin question. But in terms of our pricing, as we see it today, we don't anticipate taking additional -- significant additional pricing. Now we also didn't anticipate that as we went into the fourth quarter of this year if you talked -- when we talked last January, but what we saw was a fairly significant run-up in cost, and so we thought we had to do that. And you can see from our margin performance that we did have to do that. But as we sit here today, we don't anticipate significant pricing for the rest of the year, but again, we'll adapt our plans as we see cost. And I'll let Gordon handle the other 2 questions.","Gordon M. Stetz","Yes, in terms of the 2%. The 2% on our long-term guidance, we think about this either as an accretive acquisition, Rob, or a share repurchase. In the absence of -- and you'll -- this year, in our guidance, we talked about the 7% to 9%, and that, in fact, reflects a 2% to 3% type of a benefit on EPS. In the absence of an acquisition, we would be buying back shares in that financial leverage to return to a 2% benefit on the shares outstanding, and that's purely opportunistic based on what the pipeline is. In terms of the dilutive impact, I'd say, without getting too specific on the gross margin structures, that the acquisition -- we talked about the operating income margin of the Kamis acquisition at 16% to 17%. Its margin structure is a healthy margin structure that reflects strong consumer businesses that we -- in the rest of our European businesses. And the business in India as an emerging market, as you would expect, would be lower margin structure. But again, that's higher growth, and we would expect to get scale in margin improvement over time in that one.","Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Gordon and Alan, it's -- this is the second year in a row that we've had EPS guidance that's well below the normal range of 9% to 11%. When do you think you get back to that normal range, if not better?","Alan D. Wilson","I think in a stable environment, a stable cost environment, we can certainly execute that. But what we want to do is give you the best transparency over what we're seeing at this point.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Chris Growe of Stifel, Nicolaus & Co.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I had -- first, a quick one, sort of a follow-up. The accretion from acquisitions in 2012, is that just the absence of cost? Is there actual accretion as well on top of the absence of those costs, the $11 million of cost, in 2011?","Gordon M. Stetz","There's actual accretion, incremental profit after interest, and that's that 7% to 9% number that we've guided to previously.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","$0.07 to $0.09 per share, then you had the $0.06 drag. So we can just back into some rough math if it's going to benefit EPS in 2012.","Gordon M. Stetz","I'm sorry? I -- would you say that again, Chris?","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","So it's $0.07 to $0.09 of accretion in 2012?","Gordon M. Stetz","That's correct.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","And that's -- again, you're comparing against roughly $0.07 in cost in 2011.","Gordon M. Stetz","Right. So -- but remember also, the other thing that's offsetting that $0.07 is an incremental $9 million of retirement benefit. But yes, your math is correct.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. Yes. And then I want to understand, with the marketing increase for the year, in '12, the $10 million increase, does that incorporate acquisitions? And then if I could add to that, does that also -- is that -- a broad consumer support, does that include promotion as well?","Alan D. Wilson","It's -- I'll answer for the first one, and Gordon can talk more about how things get allocated. But the $10 million increase is about half from the base business and about half coming from acquisitions.","Gordon M. Stetz","And depending on the nature of the promotional expense, the $10 million does contemplate more consumer-facing promotional. But there probably will be additional dollars, as Alan indicated, on some of the value messaging that would be between gross and net.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And so I guess I'm -- so the -- my last question, sort of a follow-up to that would be as you're shifting more to promotion, that seems like it's mostly occurring in Europe consumer. I think you started that or did some of that in 2011 as well. I mean, have you seen that stabilize the business or does that need to step up a little more heavily in '12 to try and stabilize be it trade down to private label or just some of the more difficult consumer trends in the business?","Alan D. Wilson","It's very similar to what we did in 2009, when we saw the weakness. And it's putting an emphasis, one, on the messaging to consumers on value, and we're ramping that up and then secondly, using some of our promotion plans and really targeting those. So we expect there will be some balance. We\u2019re kind of rebalancing our whole marketing program for the year to make sure that we're getting back to a healthy volume growth.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. So we should see better volumes throughout the year, and a suspicion that that\u2019s spending, correct?","Alan D. Wilson","We expect that -- we expect it to have a positive impact.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Ann Gurkin of Davenport & Company.","Ann H. Gurkin - Davenport & Company, LLC, Research Division","Just wanted to return to your comments regarding your outlook for the U.K. and France. Do you think it's going to get worse from here for '12 -- have you modeled that -- or look like Q4? Can you just give me some more details, I guess, particularly on France?","Gordon M. Stetz","Well, as I -- we said in our remarks, France in the fourth quarter continues to be resilient. We had sales growth mainly through price execution, but volumes held up in a tough environment. U.K. continues to be challenging. So as we -- and we've seen stabilization in the other markets, which we had expected would occur as we progressed through 2011. So I guess that outlook that I've just described is a similar outlook as we look into 2012, and that's baked into our thinking. And then obviously, we have the benefit of the acquisition that we just did in Europe as well.","Alan D. Wilson","Yes. It's a pretty steady state outlook. Obviously, we're not contemplating any major collapse in Europe or anything like that, but we expect it to be a continued pressure.","Ann H. Gurkin - Davenport & Company, LLC, Research Division","Great. That's helpful. And then secondly, on -- it was nice to hear that private label is increasing prices. Is that gap between branded and private label pretty much in line with historic measures? Can you comment on that?","Alan D. Wilson","Yes. We -- the gap is pretty similar to historical levels, but what we are doing is really analyzing the price thresholds that we've crossed to understand the impact on volume. But if I look at the year and even in the 4-week period, we've seen private label prices go up at about the same level on a percentage basis as brand.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Eric Katzman of Deutsche Bank.","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","A couple of questions. I guess I want to follow up on Ken's initial question, because I think it's a very important one. I just -- I'm not -- I mean, are you as confused as I am in terms of trying to understand how QSR can be up, because obviously QSR purchases per serving are so much more expensive than cooking your own food at home. And yet, the industry and yourself today are talking about pretty significant elasticity hits. And it sounds like, if anything, as 2011 progressed, that dynamic got worse. So why should we be at all confident that even with a little bit of advertising or more promotion, that this consumer who is just so cautious can be convinced to kind of open up the wallet for core products or all the new products that you're putting out there?","Alan D. Wilson","I think as you point out, it is a better value than necessarily going to a restaurant and much cheaper to cook at home. And that's what we're trying to convince the consumer and show them that for a lower cost, you can actually have a better and healthier meal. But there is a consumer behavior that we are, again, watching and targeting, and us and our retail partners will be working on how we do that. Now on the other side of that, we also have a pretty significant participation in those restaurant sales. And as that goes through our food service distribution business, it's not necessarily a bad tradeoff for us.","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then if I could follow up on the raw material side of things. We have no visibility on a lot of your raw materials. And we kind of got a surprise last quarter, and it sounded like you were a bit surprised at how much those items had moved up. But is it because you've locked in via raw material purchases that your costs in 2012, Gordon, are going to be up so much? Because I would normally assume that whether it's, I don't know, cinnamon or pepper or vanilla farmers are going to plant from fence post to fence post to try to exploit the higher prices. So have you kind of hurt yourself a little by buying in so much inventory?","Alan D. Wilson","No. Actually, our inventory positions are better than the current market's, because we're out seeing and anticipating what's going to happen. So we're not upside down at all on our inventory. We're still seeing some competition for land in some of those emerging markets where people aren't necessarily planting more pepper volumes. And when they decide to do that, it takes about 3 years before they have significant yields. We've seen them move to shorter cash crops like cassava, which is a thickener that's used. So there is continuing to be pressure on the spice commodities that we buy, but our strategic inventory positions are an advantage for us.","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So just with that -- Alan, with that time lag on the farmer intent and the yield, so are -- do you think that this could be a multi-year issue on raw materials even if you're a little bit better than the spot market for, I don't know, whatever, the next couple of quarters based on your inventory?","Alan D. Wilson","Yes. Specifically in pepper, we've seen pepper almost quadruple in -- or triple in 4 years and double in the last 18 months. Now we don't anticipate it's going to continue to rise at that kind of rate, but we have not seen significant softness. I mean, it softens from time to time, and we take advantage of that, but we haven't seen significant softness to this point in that. It has been a couple of years of that acceleration. I think that's my main point, is -- and typically, a lot of our materials are on those kind of cycles, where they'll be up for a couple of years and then as plantings increase and yields go up, then they start to come down again.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Eric Serotta of Wells Fargo Investments.","Eric Serotta - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Most of my questions have been answered, but I wanted to follow up on your comments about mix. You commented how you had some negative overall segment mix from industrial growing a bit faster than consumer and some negative mix within industrial. I'm wondering whether you could comment upon the mix impact within consumer. How did your sort of premium products perform relative to your more baseline products? And was mix a positive or a negative contributor in the consumer segment?","Gordon M. Stetz","This is Gordon. I'd say mix was not a major factor in the overall consumer segment performance. Most of the volume performance within the quarter that was impacted within consumer relates to the timing issues that I spoke about earlier, mainly in the U.S. consumer business, and that's a volume issue.","Eric Serotta - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And how did your premium products perform relative to your base or core products?","Gordon M. Stetz","Yes. If we're speaking about the gourmet relative to, say, red cap, they were generally in line with each other. There wasn't any divergence between the 2.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Andrew Lazar of Barclays Capital.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just 2 quick ones. One, have you been able to -- I've generally thought that you and others can manage any kind of a shift from a channel perspective, whether it be from traditional grocery to alternative channels, can manage that in a relatively sort of margin-neutral way, at least. And we've had one company recently talk about this being kind of a negative hit for them, albeit it was a private label entity. So I just want to get a sense of how you manage that and if you typically are able to manage that in a pretty margin-neutral way, sort of at a minimum. And then just a quick follow-up.","Alan D. Wilson","Generally, we can manage it in a fairly margin-neutral way. I think what the other company was talking about is a move in their business to more opening price point-type business from a standard private label-type product. We do very little opening price point. We do some but not very much. Ours tend to be more standard private label. And then our whole selling story is to do the right thing for the whole category. So even where we have a private label presence in an alternative channel, we are also bringing branded solutions to those customers. So we -- it helps maintain a similar kind of margin than what we see across the rest of our business.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Got it. Okay. And then also wanted to ask -- I don't want to beat this too much. I'm just trying to get an understanding, because I still find myself very confused over sort of recent consumer behavior or just lack of kind of consumption, I guess, if you will, from the -- just the broader consumer given the weakness we've seen broadly in the industry. So do we think that it's primarily just some of the normal elasticity that this industry sees when they get pricing through? Or are they -- is the consumer -- I've heard everything from they're wasting less product in their household than they typically do. I assume there's maybe some inventory de-stocking at retailer levels. Like, I'm just trying to get a sense of if we think there's something that's beyond normal elasticity that the consumer's dealing with. Or -- because I'm still very confused. And I hear all these different answers, but no one seems to have a great -- sort of really a great read on it.","Alan D. Wilson","I don't know that we have great insight on it at this point. I mean, for our products, warm weather at this time of year isn't necessarily a good thing. We like a little cold weather to get people back to cooking chili. And so we kind of see that, and I know people have talked about that as part of the issue. But I don't think we have a firm handle on really what's happened in the very short period. Now if you look over the course of the longer-term 6 months and 12 months, the pattern isn't that dramatically different than what we've seen historically. But I think what everybody's kind of looking at is what happened in the last couple of weeks of the year.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Right. Right. And the last thing is in the quarter at least, it looks like x the sort of a volume shift in your Americas consumer business, volume was still flat to up in spite of all that, admittedly your quarter ends in November, but it wasn't like we saw some -- at least, at this stage, some huge volume sort of decline.","Alan D. Wilson","No. That's correct.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Robert Dickerson of Consumer Edge Research.","Robert Dickerson - Consumer Edge Research, LLC","Just a couple of quick easy questions. I guess first is just on taxes. I haven't really -- I haven't heard anyone ask a question on taxes. I'm kind of surprised. I know, I think, what, the beginning of the year, the guidance was for 31%, and I know in Q3, you had the benefit and got $0.09. And then I think the expectation -- I may have even asked this last quarter -- the expectation for full year wasn't really changed. But you did come in quite below such that you got basically 29% tax rate for the year which, if you just do the math, winds up being more than half of your EPS improvement. So if I'm thinking about fiscal '12, you're guiding to 30%, but I'm assuming there's no -- there's nothing within that 30% that could potentially make it lower again.","Gordon M. Stetz","A couple of things. One is that we actually had an unfavorability on the tax relative to prior year. The -- what you may be citing in terms of...","Robert Dickerson - Consumer Edge Research, LLC","No, I'm just talking about guidance. I...","Gordon M. Stetz","Yes. Okay. Versus the guidance. I understand.","Robert Dickerson - Consumer Edge Research, LLC","Yes. Like you beat last year and you beat this year both on tax.","Alan D. Wilson","Yes. Obviously, tax is a very difficult thing to forecast. You're just trying to anticipate mix of earnings, and it's also a volatile legislative environment. And there are programs and tax credits and things that get hung up in the heated discussion right now, and you cannot include that in any type of a guidance as you start a year until these things land and are resolved. So we start with our best estimate as to what we know now in the legislative environment, as to what we know now as it relates to currencies and its impact on the mix of earnings and the earnings themselves, and that's our guidance. Obviously, there's things that resolve during the course of the year that can be favorable and unfavorable. Last year, they tended to be more favorable than our initial guidance. So I can tell you the best I can say at the moment is the guidance we're giving you is based on all the knowledge we have at this moment on all those factors.","Robert Dickerson - Consumer Edge Research, LLC","Okay. Fair enough. Okay. And then just a quick follow-up question from what Chris asked before on the acquisitions, just to be clear. I know -- so this year, it was the $0.07 in cost that's been -- that's inclusive in earnings. But then next year, we're saying $0.07 to $0.09 in accretion? Or is it really $0.07 year-over-year benefit from not having the cost and then there's an additional $0.02 potential upside, which is really the accretion?","Gordon M. Stetz","No. It's going back to Chris' point. We are not repeating the $0.07 of transaction cost, and we have an incremental benefit from the acquisitions in $0.07 and $0.09. And again -- then that's offset by the incremental retirement cost of $9 million or partially offset all of those numbers.","Robert Dickerson - Consumer Edge Research, LLC","So kind of on average, about $0.14 of benefit for '12?","Gordon M. Stetz","Yes. Yes.","Alan D. Wilson","That's correct.","Joyce L. Brooks","We've run a bit over an hour. Why don't we take one more question and then we'll turn it back over to Alan.","Operator","Our last question is coming from Mitch Pinheiro of Janney Montgomery Scott.","Mitchell B. Pinheiro - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","I'll let everybody go. My questions have been answered.","Alan D. Wilson","Just to wrap up, at -- just a couple of comments. We've been pretty effective at adapting our business to meet a very challenging environment. As we head into 2012, we're managing through this with cost -- the cost volatility with our pricing and our CCI. Our product innovation and our marketing support are meeting consumer demands for flavor, convenience and value. As we've increased our participation in emerging markets with the acquisition of leading brands, we expect that to drive higher growth. I'm confident that we're well positioned, and we've got the leadership and the employees in place to meet the challenges and deliver a year of strong financial performance for McCormick shareholders. We appreciate your time and attention. We'll turn it back over to Joyce.","Joyce L. Brooks","Thanks, Alan. I'd like to add my thanks to everyone listening on today's call.

These include adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share that exclude the impact of special charges as well as information in constant currency. Reconciliations of these measures to the GAAP results are included in this morning\u2019s press release and slides.","As a reminder, today\u2019s presentation contains projections and other forward-looking statements.

Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. McCormick\u2019s fourth quarter results led to a record 2016 performance. On a constant currency basis, we met each of our long-term growth objectives for sales, operating income and earnings per share and achieved the top end of the range for sales and operating income.","We exceeded $100 million in annual cost savings and delivered our fifth consecutive year of record cash flow and we have great momentum heading into 2017. These financial results were driven by our broad strategies, our focus on performance and our people.","I want to recognize McCormick employees around the world and our leaders for their effort, engagement and success. Together we are effectively executing a balanced approach across the business, balancing between growing sales and improving productivity.","I\u2019m going to begin this morning with our fourth quarter results, highlight key accomplishments of 2016 and then share our business plans for 2017, after that I will turn it over to Mike, who will go into more depth on the quarter end results and the details of our 2017 financial guidance.","Starting at the top-line for the fourth quarter, we grew sales 4% in constant currency from the year ago period. Sales from our acquisitions of Gourmet Garden, a leader in Chilled Earth and Cajun Injector, a smaller business purchased later in 2016 added two percentage points of the increase.","Across our base business, the strongest rate of constant currency growth this period was in our consumer segment led by the America and the Asia Pacific regions. In the Americas, we had strong increases in our U.S. sales of McCormick and Lawry\u2019s brands of both spices and seasonings and recipe mixes along with the double digit increase in sales of simply Asia brand products.","In the Asia Pacific region, we grew constant currency sales in China by 9% with increases in a number of McCormick brand category as well as our [indiscernible] product. The primary area of weakness for the consumer segment was in the UK, where difficult retail environment has persisted throughout 2016.","For our industrial segment, we grew sales 2% in constant currency; this period pricing had a greater impact than the prior quarters. Pricing that related to higher material cost as well as the transaction impact of unfavorable currency rates.","We had a number of various strengths during the first quarter that we expect to continue into 2017, including food service sales in the U.S., seasoning buns in Mexico and sales in Southeast East Asia where construction will begin this year on a new facility in Thailand to accommodate our growth in that region.","With higher sales and cost savings, led by our Comprehensive Continuous Improvement program CCI, we grew adjusted operating income 6% in constant currency, gross profit margin rose 60 basis points.","At the bottom-line, adjusted earnings per share of $1.27 was an 8% increase from a $1.18 in the fourth of 2015. This includes the impact of unfavorable currency rates, which was particularly significant this period for income for our joint venture in Mexico. In summary, we overcame some economic challenges by currency rate and delivered a solid increase in sales and profit in our largest quarter of the year.","For the fiscal 2016, we had some excellent performance starting with our financial results. As I indicated, we delivered growth rates that met our long-term constant currency guidance. We were especially pleased with nearly 6% constant currency sales growth at the top-end of our 4 to 6% long-term range.","With significant improvement in our U.S. consumer business, we grew consumer sales in the Americas by 6% in constant currency. Excluding the impact of both currency and acquisitions, consumer segment sales in the Americas were up 4% in 2016.","Led by our CCI program, our fuel for growth, we reached a record $109 million of annual cost savings, exceeding $100 million for the first time and are well on our way towards reaching our full-year $400 million goal. Importantly, this significant effort is not hampering our sales growth and in fact is fueling our investments in brand marketing, product innovation and acquisitions.","We increased gross profit margin 110 basis points, the 41.5% from 40.4% and achieved 60 basis points increase in adjusted operating income as a percentage of sale. For the industrial segment, margins continued on a strong upward trajectory this year.","Our combination of innovation, acquisitions and customer intimacy continued to shift our portfolio to more value added products. This progress, along with our cost reduction efforts, lifted adjusted operating income margin for our industrial segment to 10% compared to 7% just three years ago.","2016 was a fifth consecutive year of record cash flow ending the year at $658 million. Cash flow from operations is up at 14% compound annual rate for the five year period.","At yearend, the board announced a 9% increase in the quarterly dividend, our 31st consecutive annual increase. Between the dividend and share repurchases, we returned more than two thirds of our cash from operations to shareholders this past year. In the past five years, we have returned nearly $2 billion of cash to shareholders.","Beyond our financial performance, we had ambitious growth plans for 2016 and a number of significant achievements. A key driver of sales growth was our brand marketing, which reached a new high of $252 million importantly 46% of our advertising was in digital marketing.","With consumers interest in recipes, cooking tips and how-to videos, our business lend this particularly well the social media and other digital platforms. Among food companies McCormick was an early mover in this area and digital is one of our highest returns on investment.","As we shared in our September earnings call, L2 research named the McCormick brand in the U.S. out of our 100 other food brands in its annual digital IQ ranking. This is our third consecutive year in the top five.","Innovation is another important driver and 9% of 2016 sales came from new products launched in the last three years. This rate was particularly strong for industrial business and driven impart by our work at the intersection of flavor and health.","This year approximately half of new product breeds for industrial customers in the U.S. had sometimes health and wellness attribute up from 40% in 2014. Innovation also played a role in recognition to our major industrial customer Yum Asia naming McCormick supplier of the year.","For our consumer segment, we were proud to have our new Herb Grinders recognized as innovation of the year by the grocery manufacturers association in the U.S. and the new product of the year based on consumer votes in France.","On the acquisition front, we purchased Gourmet Garden a fast growing leader in chilled herbs. We are off to a great start with this business, retail consumption sales in our largest market the U.S. were up 22% in the fourth quarter from a year ago period. In 2016, we established direct distribution for the brand in Canada and a plant in 2017 to introduce Gourmet Garden in China.","At the November, we signed an agreement to acquire Enrico Giotti SpA and completed this deal in December. Giotti is a leading flavor business in Europe with expertise in high growth health and nutrition products, including a number of beverage applications.","The addition of Giotti expands our flavor capability in our Europe, Middle East and Africa region, EMEA with complementary products and a number of new customers. Giotti supports our global industrial strategy to migrate our portfolio to flavor globally.","A new production facility in Dubai was completed this year, opening up a direct supply for our industrial customers as they expand in the Middle East and we are making great progress in Shanghai, with the construction of a new larger facility that we plan to move into and begin production in mid 2017.","Our McCormick Science Institute celebrated its 10th anniversary and its progress in advancing the health benefits of spices and herbs. Also in 2016, we were pleased that the USDA included spices and herbs in the latest dietary guidelines for Americans and on an AARP MyPlate for older adults.","And we are making miserable progress toward our 2019 sustainability goals. Just last week at the World Economic Forum in Davos, McCormick was recognized by Corporate Nights in their 2017 Global 100 Most Sustainable Corporations Index, ranking number 14 among all publicly traded companies with a market cap about two billion and number one in the Consumer Staples industry.","Also during 2016, Diversity Inc listed McCormick among their Noteworthy 25 and we reached a milestone with our 75th year of Charity Day. Our progress in 2016 gives us greater confidence in delivering another strong year of growth and performance at McCormick in 2017.","We expected increased sales at a rate ahead of our long-term 4% to 6% constant currency objectives driven by our base business and innovation including certain pricing actions. In addition, we have nearly a full-year of sales from our acquisition of Giotti and an incremental impact from Gourmet Garden in the first part of the year.","At the foundation of our sales growth rate, is the rising consumer demand for flavor. Euro Monitors\u2019 latest research projects that global sales of spices and seasonings will grow at a 5% compound annual rate for the next five years, up 4% in developed markets and 8% in emerging markets. This is our largest category and accounts for about half of our consumer segment sale.","With lead in these categories, you can see from our latest share information on Slide 9. Our growth strategies are designed to build consumer interest and differentiate our brands. We are planning to increase brand marketing at the high single digit rate this year and will continue to develop our digital programs to directly connect with consumers.","Our purity message drove increased sales in 2016 particularly in millennial consumers and in 2017 will be launched in the EMEA region. There is a lot of ground work done in renovating our core products in 2016 with non-GMO labeling on our U.S. everyday spices and seasoning and a move to organic for our premium gourmet line.","In 2017, in the U.S. we are transitioning to clean label for Zatarain\u2019s rice mixes, removing high fructose corn syrup from Laurie\u2019s marinades and will be converting our iconic black pepper and old baken to a BPA-free recyclable package.","And in early December, we have published our 2017 global flavor forecast including predictions and ideas for modern Mediterranean cuisine, planch of grilling and out of the box breakfast ideas. First launched in 2000, our annual forcast is now eagerly awaited by our retail and industrial customers along with food editors and bloggers.","Before moving on to our new product pipeline, I want to comment on the recent retail scanner data trends for spices and seasoning in the U.S. For the fourth quarter, the category growth rate for spices and seasoning to remains strong at 5%. McCormick brand spices and seasoning grew 2%.","However, this is a growth rate in major channels. We had very strong fourth quarter sales growth in certain unmeasured channels including club, e-commerce and Hispanic retail chains. We estimate that these unmeasured added another two percentage points to McCormick\u2019s retail sales growth for spices and seasonings.","The fourth quarter retail scanner data also reported an increase in sales of private label spices and seasonings. More than half of the increase this period related to the transition by a large retailer of their organic line from a competitive brand to a private label line.","Heading into 2017, we continue to build on our category management capabilities and partner with our customers to maximize their sales and profit for this spice and seasoning category and to drive McCormick\u2019s share growth. As an example, we have recently used our pricing tools to minimize the volume impact of an early 2017 price increase in the U.S., a price increase that was taken to offset our cost inflation driven in part by Vanilla and Garlic as discussed in our September call.","Turning now to innovation in 2017, our plans include a robust line up of new products for our consumer segment. Innovation is an important way to differentiate our brands and to drive growth. In the Americas, we are rolling out our kitchen basics bone broth organic recipe in mixes and Zatarain\u2019s rice cups.","Also under the Zatarain\u2019s brand, our team has brought new varieties, biscuit mixes and hot sauce. For grilling we had new varieties of Grill Mates seasonings and liquid marinades along with Stubb\u2019s dry marinade mixes and longer size BBQ sauces.","In Canada, we have extensions of our La Grill products and plan to penetrate the natural retail channels with unpasturized Billy Bee Honey. In EMEA, we plan to launch gluten-free recipe mixes in the UK, improved Vahin\u00e9 brand packaging and dessert decorations in France and barbaque marinades in Russia. Also in Russia, we are introducing our Vahin\u00e9 line of desert items. The dessert category there is currently growing at a double-digit rate.","And in Asia-Pacific, we are rolling out recipe mix varieties in China and expanding our liquid cooking and dipping sauces. In Australia, we are introducing our Gourmet Garden re-sealable pouch of lightly dried herbs and seasonings.","For our Industrial segment, we have a robust pipeline of customized flavors for both packaged food companies and the restaurant industry. We also plan to further expand our branded product portfolio for broad line food service distributors.","We expect our innovations of more value-added products along with our acquisitions and CCI cost savings to drive further progress towards a higher profit margin for our industrial segment. Our business leaders will have more to share of market dynamics and these growth plans at McCormick April 4th, Investor Day.","Beyond the strategies to drive sales growth, we have plans to increase profit and margins. Led by CCI, we expect to achieve approximately $100 million in 2017 cost savings with these cost savings and higher sales, we expect to grow adjusted operating income 9% to 11% in constant currency, this is ahead of our long-term objective of 7% to 9%.","We plan to increase adjusted earnings per share right inline with our long-term constant currency objective of 9% to 11%. As indicated, Mike will provide details on our financial guidance and additional remarks on the financial results for the quarter.","Next, I\u2019d like to recap some recent announcements about McCormick\u2019s Board of Directors. Effective next week, I will assume the role of Chairman from Alan Wilson. Alan will remain a member of our board, I\u2019m honored to have been named Chairman and I think Alan for his outstanding leadership during his term in this role.","Along with his retirement from McCormick in December, Gordon Stetz retired from our Board. We recognized and appreciate Gordon\u2019s 29 years of service to the company including his time as CFO.","Just yesterday, we announced the election of Gary Rodkin to our board. Gary is the former CEO of ConAgra and many of you know him from his previous role. We believe he will further strengthen the great group of leaders that comprise our board.","Let me summarize. We made great progress in 2016 with our growth strategies and delivered strong financial performance. McCormick is uniquely positioned as a global leader in flavor a business that is on trend with today\u2019s consumer and healthy eating. We are driving strong momentum with our strategies to grow sales, balanced with our CCI program and other efforts to build fuel for growth and higher margins.","As we kick of the New Year, I look forward to my second year as CEO of this great company and a new role as Board Chairman. Our leaders and employees are fully engaged and focused on our growth strategy and I have confidence in our ability to deliver the aggressive but achievable financial objectives we have set for 2017.","Thank you for your attention and it is now my pleasure to turn it over to Mike. Mike.","Michael Smith","Thanks Lawrence and good morning everyone. As Lawrence indicated, our fourth quarter financial results were a strong finish to the year. I\u2019ll begin with some additional perspective on these results and discuss in more depth, our 2017 financial guidance.","On a constant currency basis, we grew sales 4%, pricing, acquisitions and higher volume and product mix each contributed to the increase as seen on Slide 14. In constant currency, both our consumer and industrial segments delivered solid top-line growth.","Consumer segment sales in the Americas rose 7% in constant currency versus the fourth quarter of 2015 with two percentage points of the increase from our acquisitions. The greatest increase in sales this period was in the U.S. with broad based growth across several brands as Lawrence indicated.","EMEA consumer sales declined 3% at constant currency. As in previous quarters, we grew sales in constant currency in France and Eastern Europe. However, a deflationary retail environment in the UK has continued and our fourth quarter results in that market have been affected. This includes a reduction in the number of Schwartz brand products by a large UK retailer which has been rationalizing its portfolio to gain space for general merchandize.","We grew consumer sale in the Asia Pacific region 10% in constant currency. Sales from Gourmet Garden added six percentage points of this growth. In China, we grew sales 9% in constant currency led by higher volume and product mix across a broad range of product categories. These increases were offset in part by a double-digit decline in India resulting from our decision towards the end of 2015 to discontinue certain low margin products.","For the consumer segment in total, we grew adjusted operating income 8% to $183 million. In constant currency, adjusted operating income also rose 8% from the year ago period. The impact of sales growth and the cost savings more than offset higher material costs.","Turning to our industrial segment on Slide 19, we had solid sales results this quarter. We grew industrial sales in the Americas 2% in constant currency led by sales of branded food service products in the U.S. where we have gained share with a leading customer. And in Latin America we are growing sales of snack seasonings and other products supplied from our operation in Mexico.","In Canada, we took pricing to pass through a higher material cost that include the impact of currency, but this was offset by weaker volume for industrial products in that market. Year-on-year, EMEA industrial sales declined 10%, but grew 4% in constant currency. We had solid pricing led sales growth with packaged food customers and quick service restaurants.","Industrial segment sales in the Asia Pacific region were comparable to the year-ago period in constant currency. Growth in South East Asia and Australia was offset by a sales decline in China which was impacted by our large customer decision to diversify their supply chain as we have mentioned in previous quarters.","As we indicated in our September call, we expected our growth in the industrial segment adjusted operating income to slow from a double-digit percentage increase in the third quarter. In the fourth quarter, adjusted operating income declined 2% on a constant currency basis. This compares to the 62% year-over-year increase in the fourth quarter of 2015.","Throughout 2016, our industrial segment profit has fluctuated quarter-to-quarter driven largely by sales mix across regions, customers and products. For the fiscal year, we are very pleased with our industrial performance. With adjusted operating income up 12% in constant currency and a record 10% margin. This follows a 24% constant currency growth rate for fiscal year 2015. We believe our growth initiatives including acquisitions like Brand Aromatics and Giotti will lead to further margin improvement for our industrial segment.","Across both segments, adjusted operating income, which excludes special charges rose 5% in the fourth quarter from the year ago period. And excluding the impact of unfavorable currency, we grew adjusted operating income by 6%. For the fiscal year, the increase in adjusted operating income in constant currency was 9%.","We increased gross profit margin 60 basis points year-on-year to 44% in the fourth quarter. As we discussed in our September earnings call, the increase was at a lower rate than the first three quarters of 2016, due to rising material costs, but it was still positive and we ended the year with a 110 basis point increase.","Our selling general and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales was even with the fourth quarter of 2015, including the impact of higher incentive compensation this year. The tax rate on U.S. GAAP basis this quarter was 29.7% similar to the rate in the year ago period. Looking ahead, the 2017, we expect the tax rate to be close to 28%. This concludes our estimate of a favorable impact from the adoption of a change in the accounting for taxes related to equity awards.","Income from unconsolidated operations was $12 million compared to $10 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. Both period had a smaller impacts from special charges attributable to minority interest in our joint ventures. And excluding this impact the year-to-year performance was comparable.","We were pleased with this result, given the significant currency headwind for our joint venture in Mexico. In 2017, we expect our income from unconsolidated operations to be about even with 2016 due to further continued currency pressure.","At the bottom-line, fourth quarter 2016 adjusted earnings per share was $1.27. This was a $0.09 increase from year ago period mainly as a result of higher adjusted operating income and lower shares outstanding. As a reminder this year-to-year comparison includes the unfavorable impact from currency on both consolidated and unconsolidated income.","On Slide 28, we have summarized highlights for cash flow and the year-end balance sheet. Cash flow from operations ended the year at $658 million up from $590 million in 2015. Higher net income and working capital improvement were the main factors driving this increase. For the fiscal year, our cash conversion cycle was better than a year ago period and we are putting programs in place, such as the rollout of extended payment terms with our suppliers to achieve further reductions.","Our capital expenditures were $154 million in line with our initial guidance and a step-up from prior years due to major construction in Shanghai and Dubai. In 2017, we expect to spend $170 million to $190 million with the completion of our Shanghai plan, and construction in Southeast Asia to support growth in that market.","We returned 70% of cash flow from operations to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. At fiscal yearend, $327 million remained on the current $600 million share repurchase authorization. And based on our current plans for 2017, we expect to reduce shares outstanding by approximately 2% from fiscal year 2016. As always this is subject to change depending on our acquisition activity.","We expect 2017 to be another year of strong cash flow providing the funds for continued investment in our growth strategies. Our debt leverage is low and we are well positioned to finance these investments.","In the course of my comments and Lawrence\u2019s we have already shared some remarks on 2017. So let\u2019s put this altogether and discuss our guidance on Slide 29. We are well positioned for another strong performance with our on-trend categories effective growth strategies and progress with CCI.","As Lawrence indicated, our financial objectives for 2017 are at or above our long-term goals for sales operating income and earnings per share on a constant currency basis. At the top-line, we expect to grow sales 5% to 7% excluding an estimated 2% unfavorable impact from currency rates.","The incremental impact of acquisitions, a partial year for Gourmet Garden and nearly a full-year for Giotti are projected to add approximately 2% for the sales growth. We anticipate a combination of pricing, higher volume and product mix to contribute 3% to 5% of growth. We expect to increase adjusted operating income 8% to 10% from $657 million in 2016.","In constant currency, our estimated rate of growth is 9% to 11%. Our cost savings target is approximately $100 million and we are planning to increase brand marketing at a high single-digit rate. We expect our pricing actions to largely offset a mid single-digit increase in material cost. Leading to 2017, gross profit margin that is projected to be comparable to 50 basis points higher than 2016.","Our guidance range for adjusted earnings per share is $4.05 to $4.13. This compares to $3.78 of adjusted earnings per share in 2016 and excluding the impact of currency rates is an increase of 9% to 11%, right inline with our long-term goal.","For the first quarter of 2017, the company expects earnings per share to be comparable to $0.74 of adjusted earnings per share in the first quarter of 2016. As a result of a planned double-digit increase and brand marketing, a higher tax rate and the timing of our pricing actions. For the fiscal year, we expect our higher profit to lead to another year of strong cash flow.","Before we move to your questions, let me recap the key takeaways from our remarks this morning. With our fourth quarter results, we delivered a year of record sales, profit and cash. We are executing on an effective and balanced strategy to drive both sales and lower cost.","Our CCI program is driving higher margins of profit and generating fuel for growth. And we are confident that this strategy and our people will lead to another year of success and growth in 2017 from McCormick and the shareholders.","Operator, let\u2019s take the first question.","Question-And-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll now be conducting the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Please proceed with your questions.","Andrew Lazar","Good morning everybody.","Michael Smith","Good morning Andrew.","Andrew Lazar","Hi, just two questions from me. First one I guess you just mentioned that in the first quarter one of the headwinds is timing of pricing actions and I\u2019m just trying to get a sense of is that expected volume elasticity that comes in the first quarter, because of pricing or just the fact that pricing maybe doesn\u2019t take full effect until we move through the later part of the year?","Lawrence Kurzius","Andrew this is Lawrence Kurzius. Good morning and the pricing impact in the first quarter is because that price increase that we have taken to reflect inflation on some specific raw materials is only in effect for our portion of the first quarter. That price increase has been put in place and is ineffect now, but here we are in the middle of the quarter right now. So we only get a partial price impact for that first quarter. We do expect some volume elasticity, we have modeled that in, but the real difference on the impact of the pricing is the effective date of the price increase, which is January.","Andrew Lazar","Got it. Thank you for that. And then, past couple of quarters, I know you have had a slide typically in the slide deck that kind of compares the McCormick brand in the core of spices and seasonings category versus the category and it kind of showed sequentially the gap in growth or the market share differential was narrowing pretty significantly, as you went through the year in 2016.","Can you comment a little bit about how that share gap might have looked in the fourth quarter and maybe some of the pieces that impacted that and sort of your expectation around I guess market share in your core category in 2017 particularly in light of some of the pricing that you are taking?","Lawrence Kurzius","Right. We have through the scanner and everyone has remarked on this. The scanner sales show a widening gap especially in the fourth quarter where the category grew at about 5% rate and McCormick brands through scanner channels grew at about 2%. So that nets to about 100 basis point decline in market share during that time period for spices and seasonings of business.","As I commented in our remarks, we actually had very strong sales in unmeasured channels during that same time, so we believe that the scanner sales understate our performance, we had strong sales in certain club and Hispanic targeted customers and in e-commerce. And so we believe that the measured scan data for the period understated our performance.","I\u2019ll also comment as we said in our third quarter call that we were putting Vanilla the allocation for the holiday season. So during the holiday season, which is also the peak baken season and peak demand period for Vanilla, in advance of the price increase that we were taking on Vanilla, we had that product on allocation. So actually we feel that our underlying business strength is even stronger than not only about showing piece of scan sales but also in our reported sales. Mike, do you want to comment on that further.","Michael Smith","Yes, I think the other thing to remember and we talked about this a lot in the third quarter call the transition to the new Gourmet organic items was a negative impact in the third. We had it reset for the holiday period but there was a small impact in the beginning of the quarter. So a couple of factors worked against it, but it should provide some tailwind next year also.","Andrew Lazar","Got it. Okay. So the 2017 is your hope that shares are basically more or less in line with the category or is that over the optimistic on my part?","Lawrence Kurzius","I have been hesitant to fin a tale on a specific quarter for share gains, because it has been a long road, but we continue to work toward a situation where we are not only matching the category growth, but where we are exceeding it and are gaining share and certainly that is our goal to get there over the course of 2017.","Andrew Lazar","Thank you. See you in April.","Lawrence Kurzius","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Driscoll with Citi. Please go ahead with your questions.","David Driscoll","Great, thanks a lot. Good morning everyone.","Lawrence Kurzius","Good morning David.","Michael Smith","Good morning.","David Driscoll","Wanted to ask, Andrew was asking a little bit about price volume elasticity on the first quarter. Can you broaden this out more towards the year, I think you got something like three points of pricing expected on the year and then it looks like I think zero to two points of volume. We would just like to hear your thoughts, a little bigger picture on mid-single digit inflation, the last time we saw it in the price volume elasticity.","And then just a, just a second question to follow-up on the unmeasured channel benefit, I think you guys were great about how you explained what happened in the data, but maybe what I\u2019m sure everyone would like to know is, is that benefit for the unmeasured channels? Is that something we should expect going forward, I mean it probably sounds reasonable, but I think we need to hear you say that if that\u2019s okay?","Michael Smith","Yes, hey David good morning, this is Mike. Regarding the prices increases related to the mid-single digit cost increases, you are right, there is about 3% price increase, pricing impact on sales we built in about 0% to 2% on volume mix. What we saw last year and we have these new category management tools, we put in a pricing last year little lower, but we were able to really from an elasticity perspective didn\u2019t really see volume degradation. So we are pretty confident this time while there are some pretty significant increases on the Vanilla and Garlic and that\u2019s the difference I think if you look back in history with our mid-single digit price increases a couple of years ago, that was spread across the line.","This is really specific against two of the sub-categories. So there will be some impact in there v think in downsizing by consumers and things like that, but across the whole line we don\u2019t see a price increase. So we shouldn\u2019t see price elasticity, volume elasticity there. So we feel confident with these tools we have and the fact that is focused that\u2019s a positive for us in 2017.","Lawrence Kurzius","As for the unmeasured channels, the gains that we had in unmeasured channels really reflect real distribution gains that we have achieved. So we expect them to be sustainable overtime.","David Driscoll","Great, thank you so much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Alexia Howard with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.","Alexia Howard","Good morning everyone.","Lawrence Kurzius","Hi Alexia.","Alexia Howard","Hi. So you mentioned the point about the gourmet line in U.S. consumer being somewhat challenged in the third quarter, but the sets were realigned by the holiday season. Was that line back to the solid year-on-year growth in the fourth quarter from what say the outlook for next year? and then I have a quick follow-up.","Michael Smith","Alexia I\u2019m not sure I got all of your question in the last part of it. But the transition on gourmet was much more difficult than we anticipated due to the retailers wanting to flush through the old UPC codes versus before they pick on the new ones. I think if we were doing this over again, we would have worked harder to maintain the same codes on the product because it just made for a complicated execution.","The scan data continues to show a decline on our gourmet business through the fourth quarter. Nielsen is showing a much more radical decline than our custom IRI database is showing and the Nielsen database is also showing a decline thats out of line with our shipment experience and we believe that there may be a data issue there but they are not picking up all of the new codes as we make the transition.","And so that we think that the Nielsen data in particular is overstating the softness in gourmet. In gourmet, we picked up real distribution, we gained distribution and shares of shelf, substantial share of shelf in four out of our top 10 customers.","We know that the consumers are buying the new organic gourmet items at a higher rate then that the free gift items in the places where transition was completed and where we are able to measure it. And we are confident that this going to be a real win for us as we go through the year in 2017, particularly as we lap the periods in the second half of the year where we were in transition.","Alexia Howard","Great. And then as a follow-up, obviously, we don\u2019t know where the new administration policies are going to release. But as far as the border tax goes. Can you give us any indication at what proportion of your comps are imported and any commentary about how that could affect that happen? Thank you and I\u2019ll pass it on.","Lawrence Kurzius","I will let Mike answer that question specifically. But I\u2019ll say you that the tax code changes that are really uncertain at this point. There are lot of ideas that are being chatted about in the press, there is nothing on the table and even our new president himself has made contradictory statements about border tax. So we are a long ways from knowing what the tax proposal is going to be.","I\u2019ll say that as a company, we support a broad based tax reform that makes our business more competitive on a global basis and to the extent that overall rates go down it\u2019s certainly a good thing for us. A large number of our iconic raw materials are improted products that are grown within a few degrees of the equator and regardless of what our tax policy is we are not going to be able to move equator into the United States so those are going to going continue to be imported product.","And so to the extent that there is a border adjustment that includes those items that\u2019s a negative for us. Historically, agricultural commodities that can\u2019t be grown in the United States have enjoyed a tax preferential treatment and so we would hope that would continue forward, but how that policy plays out is still very much unclear. Mike, do you want to comment on Alexia\u2019s?","Michael Smith","You took everyone of my talking points. Yes, just to reiterate, I mean it is very speculative now, we are [indiscernible] we do manufacture in the U.S. or one of the good guys from that perspective. So we would any hope any policy change would take that in consideration.","Alexia Howard","Thank you very much. I\u2019ll pass it on.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Ken Goldman with JP Morgan. Please go ahead with your questions.","Kenneth Goldman","Hi, thanks and good morning, everyone. One quick clarification from me, if I can. I think in the press release, you guided the brand marketing to be at mid single-digits, but its high single-digits in the prepared remarks in the slide. Can you just confirm it is high single-digits for 2017?","Lawrence Kurzius","Ken.","Michael Smith","Yes, it is high single-digit in 2017.","Lawrence Kurzius","It is high single-digit you may be thinking of first quarter, where we are guiding to to double-digit.","Kenneth Goldman","I\u2019ll go back and check, I thought we are in mid single-digit for the year, but I\u2019ll go back and check. And then my real question is I just wanted to get a sense and I really appreciate the clarity on the growth in club and e-commerce, adding 2% to retail sales growth and so forth. I also wanted to just make sure, as you head into price increases or as companies head into price increase, sometimes there can be a little bit of a buy-in ahead of time. Was there any of that you experienced that benefit the fourth quarter and maybe will be a little bit of a reversal in the first quarter. I\u2019m just trying to get a sense of how close your shipments were to your measure takeaway both in Nielsen channel and otherwise and what we should expect the reverberation to be if any in 1Q.","Lawrence Kurzius","Ken this is Lawrence heere, I\u2019ll start. I think we mentioned that the price increases were really concentrated on the items where we were experiencing commodity of the increases. The biggest increases were on the Vanilla and Garlic items. As we said on our third quarter call as i remarked a little while ago, the Vanilla was on allocation through the fourth quarter in advance to that increase to prevent any kind of forward buy, part of it is we are trying to protect our cost position on the product and make sure that we are able to get the pricing to reflect the higher commodity cost. Mike you want to?","Michael Smith","We actively made sure there was no buy-in into the fourth quarter.","Kenneth Goldman","Great. Thank you very much.","Joyce Brooks","Ken, I\u2019ll go back and comment. You are right, the slides and our comments today in prepared remarks do say high single-digit, the price we sustaned at single-digit and it\u2019s high single digit that we are guiding to for the brand marketing increase.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of [indiscernible] from Bank of America. Please go ahead with your questions.","Unidentified Analyst","Good morning everyone. First a quick follow-up on the 1Q outlook, you gave the cadence for earnings for the quarter. Can you talk a little bit sales, what your expectations are there, should there be more or less inline with your full-year outlook or ahead. Can you just kind of help frame that?","Michael Smith","Slightly lower because of the pricing impact as we talked about but we are still seeing very healthy growth both in the consumer and the industrial side.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. And then just your sales growth for the year, your underlying sales growth and size and acceleration sequentially, I guess one should we expect a sequential improvement in both segments and just trying to understand or breakdown a little bit what is the key driver behind the acceleration. Is it new products, is it a step-up in demand that you are seeing in certain market or across certain products such as clean labeling, GMO. Just kind of talk about that and just I guess really more the sustainability of the as you think about moving forward of the acceleration.","Michael Smith","Hey this is Mike. From a segment perspective, its relatively balanced both of our segments are implementing pricing. Industrial is a little ahead of consumer from that perspective, but they are generally balanced throughout the year. we are really focusing heavily on, acquisitions as you know is a big component, a third of our growth algorithm but also innovation and we talked about it in the call where we moved from 8% to 9% our new products development in the last three years. So we have it inline with our long-term growth algorithm, a lot of great new products that will help drive that growth in 2017.","Lawrence Kurzius","I\u2019ll also add, we have confidence in the underlying momentum of our business in the Americas where we are coming off a pretty strong year and see a good forward visibility on momentum into 2017.","Unidentified Analyst","I guess from some of the changes that you made to your line then again the labeling, removing artificial ingredients, are you seeing a lift and can you sort of quantify the benefit that just starting to see from these actions.","Lawrence Kurzius","We are definitely seeing a lift, I don\u2019t think we are ready to quantify those specifically just yet, but we absolutely know that consumers, particularly millennial consumers are interested in more transparency around the labeling of their products and understanding what is in the food that they eat.","So things like non-GMO labeling, organic labeling, just making the package transparent, so they can see what is inside all quality to millennial consumers. We have gained household penetration among millennial, which has been an important goal of our that the product changes are part of that so the changes in our advertising campaign. And the increase that we have made in digital marketing.","But I don\u2019t think we are ready to comment specifically on the lift from non-GMO label in particular. On the change in the gourmet products to organic in the retailers where we have made the full transition, we are definitely seeing an increase in offtake and velocity though.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. So just a question more directly given from against some of these initiatives. The acceleration in sales in the underlying business or the guidance really ahead of your long-term growth rate. Is this sustainable or do you think more the new norm in the outlook given some of these the new product initiatives and the demand fall or is this just more of a one year thing because of a lot of new product that are coming?","Michael Smith","Well i\u2019ll say our long-term guidance is for 4% to 6% top-line growth. our guidance for this year and constant currency is higher than that. I don\u2019t think we are making a change in our long-term guidance at this point, but we are definitely calling out that we expect a strong top-line growth this year.","Lawrence Kurzius","Coming off of the year, last year constant currency sales growthwas 5.5% so that\u2019s at the high end of 4% to 6% that gives us more bullishness going into 2017 also.","Unidentified Analyst","Perfect. Thanks. I\u2019ll pass it on.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Akshay Jagdale with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.","Akshay Jagdale","Good morning.","Lawrence Kurzius","Good morning.","Michael Smith","Good morning, Akshay.","Akshay Jagdale","Hi, I just wanted to follow-up on the market share question, thanks for the clarification on the measured, unmeasured, but your organic sales growth guidance of 3% to 5% you said is balanced across both segments. So let\u2019s say the mid point is 4%, if the category is growing at 5% and you are growing at 4% that assumes, that you are going to continue to lose a little bit of share including the unmeasured channel. Am I reading that incorrectly or and then I have a follow-up?","Michael Smith","Yes, Akshay its Mike, you have to be a little careful, because you know the category as we talk about it and that share is really our spices and seasons business, it is like half of our business in the U.S. So it\u2019s a much broader business with things like dry seasoning mixes, Zatarain\u2019s, Tai Kitchen and industrial so. You are trying to park it down to a very kind - that\u2019s a big part of business, but it\u2019s not more than half of our business.","Akshay Jagdale","Yes, just what I\u2019m trying to understand is intra quarter as we follow your business, one of the things that obviously you look at is market share and there has been some of a disappointing trend despite all the initiatives you have taken in that regard. So for the U.S. business, I mean how important is it to look at market share and you know when do you think you will be able to reverse those measured channel market share trends?","Michael Smith","We continue to work towards again not just matching the market but exceeding the market growth rate. I\u2019m reluctant to be pinned down on a specific quarter, but this is a goal that we are working towards and that we expect to get to in 2017.","Akshay Jagdale","And in terms of what gets you there, obviously you have done a great job consistently increasing your marketing spend, you are ratcheting that up a little bit again next year. Is new products as a percentage of sale going to be greater than 9% or are there any other moves on execution that will help you reverse this trend on market share? Thank you.","Lawrence Kurzius","Well I think there is a series of activities and programs that we have in place that are driving our business and that we expect to generate market share gains. Part of it is renovation of our core business, part of it is innovative new products that again 9% is the middle of our target range globally for new products. We aim to have 8% to 10% of our sales from new products introduced in the last three years. We would expect that rate to continue.","We continued to increase our investment in marketing expenditures A&P delivered against the consumer, we continue to shift that to the most effective channels. We said in our remarks that digital is now up to 46% actually in the U.S. its over 60% and so we are trying to drive our business with the consumer and particular with the younger consumer entering into the market, the millennial consumer. I think we got a great tailwind from the millennial generation also where we index well, we are very confident that we are going to get there.","Akshay Jagdale","Thank you. I\u2019ll pass it on.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rob Moskow with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Robert Moskow","Hi, thank you. You mentioned a big customer in the U.S. I guess the mass customer that transition to its organic line or an organic competitor of yours to private label and that caused private label to increase. And then I think you also mentioned in the UK, another customer I guess transitioned away from Schwartz and I think to lower priced product.","Lawrence have you thought through like what kind of the trend there is, are these just kind of one-offs or is there a risk that the category gets devaluated more in 2017 as private label gets in these two markets gets a bigger share of the shelf.","Lawrence Kurzius","Hey Rob, good morning by the way. That\u2019s really a great question, a great point. That the moves that these customers have made toward private label have tended to devalue the category in their source. Although we didn\u2019t comment on it, we did see a couple of retailers put heavier promotional emphasis on some private label products during the holiday season, which also devalued the category for them.","And we are able to go back to those customers and show them particularly with the tools that we have and with the kind of dialogue we have with customers today. Precisely what the missed opportunity was for them and generally that they have missed, that they have lost category profit and in particularly these customers category share versus their peers who did not make these moves.","I think that the situation in the U.S. is a bit different than the situation in the UK though, the big customer in the U.S. to transfer this brand to a private label is part of our broader effort on organic that went well beyond our product category. And so it really wasn\u2019t specific to the herb and spice category or targeted against us specifically. It was a part of a broader multi-category initiative and I think is really more directed at making them competitive versus the natural food channel rather than trying to do anything specific in the spices category.","In Europe, that the big customer in the UK, this is part of a deflationary environment in the UK, that particular customer again has a particularly strategy, that goes well beyond spices and herbs, but that did impact us and that was a drag on our performance in the EMEA. Broadly in EMEA we are still seeing good growth and good gains in other markets, but UK is a difficult spot right now.","Robert Moskow","I guess my follow-up this big customer in the U.S. when you say it\u2019s a broader initiative, I think trying to put their own brand on more organic items in the store or is that what is happening?","Lawrence Kurzius","They are trying to put their own private label brand on more organic items in the store, that correct. Well I don\u2019t want to say the customer you probably know who it is.","Robert Moskow","[Indiscernible]. Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Jonathan Feeney with Consumer Edge Research. Please go ahead with your question.","Jonathan Feeney","Thanks very much and good morning.","Lawrence Kurzius","Good morning.","Jonathan Feeney","Just two questions, i wanted to - it\u2019s been a long time since i did Freshman algebra. Can you give us what percent of your U.S. spices and seasonings sales are going to these unmeasured channels roughly speaking and if you can detail around what is the club, I know that only one maybe two club stores where you dont have data. So just the blanket one is probably the easiest number to give.","And my second question is looking to your 2017 guidance, when you consider Giotti, what contribution would you be expecting as you think about that number from acquisitions considering laps and distribution gains and everything else? Thanks very much.","Michael Smith","We don\u2019t get into a data by channel that discretely is definitely less than 10% of our sales, we talk about e-commerce sales for the food category less than 2%. So you can pluck for numbers and make it work that way. From a Giotti perspective, we bought that business in mid December, as most of our acquisitions during that first year we really don\u2019t look, because we have to make investments and things like SAP and integration cost. We don\u2019t look at that as being accretive to EPS and frankly it\u2019s a little bit of drag in the first quarter as we integrate it, but look forward to be relatively neutral in 2017.","Jonathan Feeney","I\u2019am sorry, I\u2019m purely talking about the sales, I didnt understand the accretion part. Can you give me a sense of how much it\u2019s going to contribute to sales and not just Giotti but anything, any leftovers from non-comparable acquisitions you made and distribution gains perhaps on recent acquisitions in 2017.","Lawrence Kurzius","Yes, we talked and discussed about the 2%.","Jonathan Feeney","2% for the full-year 2017 I thought that was just a 2016 number, that\u2019s 2017?","Lawrence Kurzius","Yes.","Jonathan Feeney","Thanks so much.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Brett Hundley with Vertical Group. Please proceed with your question.","Brett Hundley","Hey, good morning thank you for the question.","Lawrence Kurzius","Hey Brett.","Brett Hundley","Good morning. I just wanted to revisit the market share topic. You know there has been further consolidation in the U.S. retail spice area recently, and I am actually wondering your thoughts on whether or not that provides any opportunities or risks as it relates to your pursuit of category growth. And I guess I\u2019m wondering now as well just because it seems like brand support spend is a little bit more kind of front-end weighted this year versus last year?","Lawrence Kurzius","Yes, when you talk about further consolidation, I assume you are talking about the purchase of the ACH brand by B&G. ACH was already, they were a pretty good market of their brands, they are webber brand in particular is a well advertised, well supported business. So, I\u2019m not sure that we see any particular new threat, its hard to know what B&G would do with those brands but typically they have got kind of under loved, under marketed businesses and we would not characterize this as one of those.","[indiscernible] brand that they also own, is one of the gourmet brands that\u2019s not organic that on the shelf right now and say that they probably lost in distribution as we gained places on the shelf. We do have an acceleration of our brand spend and the marketing spend in the first quarter of the year, also cautious to you that that\u2019s the kind of our smallest quarter of the year. So, a big percentage is not as many dollars as say the smaller percentage in the fourth quarter.","Michael Smith","Just really quick on the A&P spend, we have mentioned the puree campaign which has been really successful in North America so we are spending there in the first quarter, but we have expanded that to Europe. So in the first quarter, some of that increase is also related to the UK in some of those markets too.","Brett Hundley","I appreciate that Mike. And then, the other thing I want to squeeze in real quickly was your New Spring product lineup, you know that was announced in April last year and it comes in January this year and we have seen some other package through companies talking about this innovation and schedules picking up overall.","But I\u2019m wondering if that has meaning this time of year and as well I mean the new products that you are bringing this year tend to be more focused on product outside the spice racket seems and so I\u2019m curious how that might affect contribution margin potential as we think about your new product lineup.","Michael Smith","And generally across our branded categories, gross profit, operating profits generally within the same range, so whether it\u2019s a dry seasoning mix, spice and herb, the vanilla. So there is really no kick from that perspective from these new products. And we have really made a the last couple of years of making sure new products don\u2019t degrade margins. Really focusing on [indiscernible] upfront, making sure they hit the right price points right away and then supporting them with A&P.","Lawrence Kurzius","And obviously we are quite excited about these new products where we wouldn\u2019t spoken about them. In the U.S. kind of coming from Zatarain\u2019s originally myself I love the new Zatarain\u2019s items that extend that brand and a very attractive margin. Our Vahin\u00e9 expansion in EMEA is also expanding a great brand and again that margins on our Vahin\u00e9 business are comparable to our spices and herbs. And the wet sauces in China that are being loss take advantage of the squeeze pouch format that we developed for our ketchup and Thai chili sauce product in that market.","I\u2019m really quite excited about the theme over there, quite excited about the rate of innovation in China is pretty low, a lot of the business has been built by continuing to build distribution and household penetration on existing items and relatively low rate of new product. So this is a big introduction for them leveraging a very efficiently manufacturing facility and package format that we can scale. So those would be quite attractive margin items for that business, a little bit below our global average, but still quite a good contributor for that region.","Brett Hundley","Thanks for the color guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question is from the line of Steve Strycula with UBS. Please proceed with your question.","Steven Strycula","Hi, good morning.","Lawrence Kurzius","Good morning, Steve.","Michael Smith","Good morning.","Steven Strycula","Two quick questions for you. First would be a modeling one, just wanted to get a sense of the gross margin cadence, how the first quarter should trend versus kind of the full-year. Just given the cadence of price increases and then I have a got one more operational question to follow-up.","Michael Smith","If you talk about the price increase, the fact that we will get about half a quarter impact would put some negative pressure on the first quarter comparing the of the year.","Steven Strycula","Okay. And then relate to the European business, particularly the consumer business, you spoke about, I think a little bit on Rob Moskow\u2019s question, but just want to get a senses as are you seeing across the big four retailers, just decrease display space for spices in general, is a more allocation of private label, reduction in weeks of supply and key retailers and then should we be modeling this to kind of process for the next three quarters or is it just more contained to a one-time correction in the fourth quarter?","Lawrence Kurzius","Well, first of all, I would say for retail, I think you are talking about the UK business rather than that - and so in the UK private label has always been a bigger factors, its probably the highest market share private label market we operate in and so this is kind of a steepening of that trend. This move is by one particular retailer, other retailers in that same market of course, each of them sees what the other does. So that particular market is a challenging market for us, but again that\u2019s just one country out of the whole continent. We have very good trends in our other markets in that region [indiscernible] Eastern Europe.","Steven Strycula","Okay thanks, one small tax question. I might have missed it when Mike was speaking earlier but the full-year I think you said you guided to around 28% in the first quarter would be higher, can you kind of just recap or flush that out as to kind of like the magnitude of first quarter versus balance of the year?","Michael Smith","Yes, the underlying tax rates that we see generally depends on where you make the money in the U.S. or overall, but generally 29% or 30% and then we talked about this new accounting standard, we are adopting this year which is a slight favorable which gets us down into the 28% range. A lot of times your discrete tax items don\u2019t have - they will be very variable during the year, in the first quarter right now we don\u2019t see a lot of those, you could - I would suggest 29% to 30% is probably the right tax rate for the first quarter. But a lot factors go into that tax rate and with this new accounting standard, you are probably going to see some variability across the industry as far as tax is. It will make it a little more difficult to forecast quite frankly.","Steven Strycula","Alright, well thank you.","Operator","Thank you. I\u2019ll now turn the floor over to Lawrence Kurzius for closing remarks.","Lawrence Kurzius","Thanks everyone for your questions and for participating on today\u2019s call. We are driving growth at McCormick, our experienced leaders and engaged employees are executing on a strategy designed to build long-term value for our shareholders and we look forward to continuing to report to you on our progress.","Joyce Brooks","Thanks Lawrence and thanks to everyone for joining today\u2019s call.

This is Joyce Brooks, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you for joining today's call for a discussion of McCormick's Third Quarter Financial Results and 2014 Outlook. We've posted a set of slides to accompany our call at ir.mccormick.com. (Operator Instructions)."," ","With me this morning are Alan Wilson, Chairman, President and CEO, who will begin with comments on the latest financial performance and outlook and a business update, and Gordon Stetz, Executive Vice President and CFO, who will provide a more detailed review of third quarter results and 2014 guidance.","During our remarks, we will refer to non-GAAP financial measures. These include adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share that exclude the impact of special charges. A reconciliation to the GAAP results is included in this morning's press release, as well as the slides that accompany this call.","As a reminder, today's presentation contains projections and other forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those projected. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or other factors. As seen on slide 2, our forward-looking statement also provides information on risk factors that could affect our financial results.","It's now my pleasure to turn the discussion over to Alan.","Alan Wilson","","Thank you, Joyce. Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us. Our third quarter results included solid sales growth, a significant profit increase and strong cash flow. This performance demonstrates our progress with McCormick's growth strategies and our ability to deliver shareholder value. We grew sales 3% with particularly strong growth in our Consumer business in the Asia-Pacific region, led by a 15% growth in China and in our Industrial businesses in the Americas region and in Europe, Middle East and Africa, EMEA.","In our Americas Consumer business, we're making steady progress with growth initiatives to build brand equity and strengthen our category leadership. We have the right plan and good momentum. While consumer sales in the Americas declined 1% this quarter, that's an improvement from the first half of 2014 and we expect further improvement in the fourth quarter and in 2015.","Gross profit margin increased in the third quarter and a primary driver behind our improvement is Comprehensive Continuous Improvement, CCI. With great work by employees throughout the company, we now expect our 2014 cost savings from this program to be at least $50 million. Our Industrial segment has been particularly effective in raising margins year-to-date in 2014. ","Sales growth, higher gross margin and our diligent expense management led to a 6% increase in operating income. Income from unconsolidated operations also had strong profit impacts this quarter, led by our McCormick to Mexico joint venture. Along with 5% sales growth, this business has completed the transition to a new, more efficient production facility, a move that has raised its profitability.","Clearly, earnings per share at $0.94 were ahead of our previous outlook. While we anticipated higher operating income, the tax-rate came in well below our projections. Gordon will provide the details on this. Importantly, part of the reduction reflects a continuing benefit on our anticipated tax-rate going forward.","In the third quarter, we continued to step up our share repurchase activity and have lowered shares outstanding nearly 2% year-to-date from compared to 2013. This is one use of strong cash flow that McCormick generates. Our debt leverage is close to our target and we believe we're in a very good position for financing potential acquisitions. Between share repurchases and our dividend payments, we reached $323 million year-to-date in cash returned to shareholders, up 42% from the same period in 2013.","Next I want to provide some general remarks on our latest 2014 financial outlook. Again, Gordon will go into more depth on this topic. We're maintaining our projected sales growth rate at 3% to 5%. We expect this growth to be driven by product innovation, brand marketing support, certain pricing actions and in the first half of 2014, incremental sales from WAPC. Sales were up 4% year-to-date, close to the midpoint of this range. For adjusted operating income, we've moderated our anticipated increase to 4% to 5%. Because we've increased adjusted operating income 8% year-to-date through the third quarter, this implies a flat to slightly down result for the fourth quarter based on several factors.","First, we're supporting our brands and plan to increase our marketing support by at least $11 million from the fourth quarter of 2013. Second, we expect the growth of our International businesses to outpace the increase in the U.S. While this puts pressure on operating income, it creates a favorable tax-rate. And third, we're cautious about the near term demand from quick service restaurants in China and other parts of the Asia-Pacific region. Taking into account the new operating income range and the favorable tax-rate, we've increased our target range for adjusted EPS to $3.30 to $3.37. Overall, we believe this guidance will deliver strong 2014 financial performance.","Let's turn to our business update. We're operating in a dynamic environment, with shifting consumer demographics and preferences, continued economic pressure for many consumers, exceptionally competitive retail conditions across channels and different choices being made by consumers when they're eating out.","At McCormick, we're adapting our business to address challenges and to identify and pursue emerging growth opportunities, such as the creation of our new Skillet Sauces, funding for digital marketing to connect with consumers and investments in category management. Underlying all of our growth strategies is a rising demand for flavor.","In a recent U.S. study, at a 90% response rate, taste remains the top factor impacting food and beverage purchases. For our largest growth platform, Spices and Seasonings, the latest Euromonitor projections show a robust 10% average annual growth rate for the next five years.","On slide 7, you can see that a strong increase in Recipe Mix sales is also anticipated. We believe a number of factors are driving this growth. First, the rise of millennial consumers, a group that has strong interest in cooking, much stronger than the baby boomers. In the U.S., our data shows that both McCormick's gourmet and everyday products are well represented in millennial households. Second, the influence of ethnic demographics and the exposure each of us has to other cultures and their food. Cuisine specific or ethnic fare now accounts for about 44% of all U.S. flavoring occasions.","Third, the increased connectivity of consumers. They're sharing recipes, meal ideas and lots of food photos. We have industry-leading digital programs and were recently ranked number five in a Digital IQ survey of 80 packaged foods brands in the U.S. market and we're number three in a ranking of paid search by ad impressions among the Top 50 consumer packaged goods advertisers. Fourth, there's a measurable shift towards healthier eating in many markets around the world as consumers turn toward fresh products that are ideally suited to flavor. We're partnering with government agencies and trade agencies to inspire healthy choices among consumers.","And fifth, the rising middle class in emerging markets, while Euromonitor measures herb and spices globally as a $10 billion category, we estimate another $10 billion of product is sold in bulk. This is mainly in emerging markets where we see consumers gradually converting to the quality and convenience of spices and herbs as packaged foods items.","Let's talk about our progress in driving growth within each of our two segments, starting with our Consumer business. We grew third quarter Consumer business sales 1% in local currency. As in recent quarters, the performance for this business varied across our geographic regions. The Asia-Pacific region was the strongest contributor with sales up a double-digit rate. Particularly noteworthy was the 15% sales increase in China. The growth in this market was broadbased, spanning a number of product categories, Spices and Seasonings, Recipe Mixes and Condiments.","Our latest sales results in EMEA were similar to the second quarter with a low single-digit sales increase in local currency. We're driving sales with pricing actions, product innovation and expanded distribution. Although we continue to experience competitive conditions across the region. Our latest new product launches include Vahine dessert item, Kamis seasonings and Ducros recipe mixes along with Schwartz brand grinders refillers and Freshlock herbs and we're supporting our new products along with our core business in the fourth quarter.","Let's turn next to our Consumer business in the Americas. In local currency, third quarter sales in this region declined 1%. This is primarily the result of the unfavorable impact from a shift in U.S. sales between quarters, offset in part by the favorable effect of higher pricing and our initiatives to drive growth. As I stated earlier, we're making great progress with actions to build brand equity and win at retail.","Sales of new products this quarter included Grill Mates Burger Mix-ins, new Perfect Pinch flavors, extra rich vanilla, value sized grinders, and Zatarain's Recipe Sides. Retailer acceptance has been strong for our latest introductions, gluten free recipe mixes and our new Skillet Sauces. And in early 2015, we'll be relaunching our entire Gourmet line. We'll be differentiating our brand with greater variety, processing methods to include a flavor seal and packaging that has more premium, fresh appearance.","In the third quarter of 2014, we had continued strength with our Recipe Mixes which gained a percentage point of share this period, driven by innovation and brand marketing support. We also had a great grilling season, compared to last year. Another action underway to strengthen our U.S. brand equity is increased investment in brand marketing and we're planning an increase of approximately 20% in the fourth quarter.","These additional funds will boost our holiday campaigns with new television ads for Thanksgiving and Christmas. We'll build awareness and trial of the new Skillet Sauces and Gluten Free Recipe Mixes. We'll drive our quality message and we're supporting the Zatarain's brand. In addition to building brand equity, we're working to win at retail. We've discussed with you our actions in this area and let's talk about some of the signs of success.","In our June earnings call, I reported on better alignment of retail pricing between private label, McCormick brand and competitive brands as well as new distribution for Lawry's and Simply Asia Food brands. In the latest quarter, we've been effective in gaining shelf space for our unique items like Grinders and Grill Mates, won distribution for our Lawry's brand Hispanic items at two major southeast retailers and made further progress with retail pricing alignment.","In total, we're targeting category pricing discussions with retailers that represent 60% of ACV. Based on our discussions to-date, over half the retailers have accepted our pricing recommendations. Spice and Seasonings is one of the most profitable category for the retailer and our customers want to get it right. In addition to these bricks and mortar retailers, our e-commerce sales have risen at a high double-digit rate. This performance is a result of our global e-commerce team and dedicated support, such as feature search and recipe marketing. We recognize it's going to take some time for these actions to fully take hold. However, we\u2019re confident that we have the right actions and the right team to deliver improved performance.","Let's move to our Industrial segment, we had another strong quarter for this part of our business. Compared to the year-ago period, sales grew 3% in local currency and adjusted operating income was up 26%. While we're comparing to a year-on-year profit decline in the third quarter of 2013, on a two-year basis from the third quarter of 2012, adjusted operating income is up 6%. As in recent periods, our EMEA industrial business led top line growth, this quarter with an 8% sales increase in local currency. This was a combination of pricing actions in response to higher material costs, as well as higher volume and product mix.","We continue to meet increased demand from quick service restaurant customers and participate in the growth of snack seasonings for food and beverage manufacturers. Snack seasonings were a top growth item as well for our Industrial business in the Americas in both the U.S. and Mexico. Largely driven by volume and product mix, sales in this region rose 3% in local currency.","Our quick service restaurant customers in the Asia-Pacific region are currently being impacted by well-publicized supply issues. This is affecting our sales results in the region and has us cautious in our near term outlook as reflected in our latest guidance. Wrapping up my update on the Industrial business, we're pleased with the sales and profit results for the segment. We have good long term momentum and a solid innovation pipeline for further increases in sales and profits.","To summarize, employees throughout McCormick are applying their energy and talent to adapt and succeed in a dynamic environment. I want to recognize and thank them. Through their efforts, we've achieved year-to-date financial results that have us well positioned to deliver record results in 2014. We believe that McCormick has strong business advantages within the food industry. These include our leading positions in growing markets, a breadth of products from value priced to premium, flavors for all types of eating occasions, market leading customers and an expanding geographic presence. Our strategic imperatives focused on people, growth and performance are driving our success and designed to build value for McCormick's shareholders. Gordon?","Gordon Stetz","Thanks, Alan and good morning, everyone. As Alan has described, our third quarter financial results included solid sales growth in many parts of the business, greater than expected earnings per share driven by our growth strategies along with a favorable tax-rate and share repurchase activity and significant cash flow.","Let's take a closer look at sales and operating income for each segment. As seen on slide 14, we grew Consumer business sales 1% in local currency. The impact of pricing actions taken in response to higher material costs was offset in part by a slight decline in volume and product mix. Sales in the Americas were down 1% in local currency with higher pricing more than offset by a 2% decline in volume and product mix.","As Alan indicated, we\u2019re pleased with the innovation underway, stepped up brand marketing, and progress with our actions to win at retail. However, in the third quarter we had an unfavorable impact from a shift in sales.","For more than five years, McCormick has offered retailers a holiday display program to encourage early in-store display and merchandising of holiday products. In 2014, we expect another year of strong holiday display activity, although retailer purchases are more skewed toward the fourth quarter than in 2013.","In 2013, holiday display program purchases were more skewed to the third quarter due in part to a price increase effective in the fourth quarter of 2013. We estimate that this shift had an unfavorable impact of approximately 5% on third quarter 2014 Americas Consumer business sales and expect it to have a positive sales impact in the fourth quarter.","In EMEA, Consumer business sales rose 2% in local currency, mainly due to pricing actions. Volume and product mix was down slightly this quarter as growth from product innovation and expanded distribution was offset by competitive conditions in this region. In local currency, Consumer business sales in the Asia-Pacific region rose 11%. The growth this quarter is being driven by our base business, which now includes WAPC. An 8% increase in volume and product mix reflects 15% growth in China this quarter with the strength in core products along with sales of our squeeze pouch ketchup and other new products.","The higher pricing this quarter comes from India and relates to basmati rice costs. While the impact of this higher pricing was partially offset by lower volume and product mix, the net impact was a double-digit increase.","In total for the Consumer business, adjusted operating income excluding special charges was $122 million, a 3% increase from the third quarter of 2013. This increase was mainly driven by higher sales and the benefit of CCI cost savings, offset in part by a $3 million increase in brand marketing support. As you can see from these results, we are seeing a faster pace of sales growth in international markets. This puts a bit of pressure on our operating income margin for this segment but has a favorable impact on our tax-rate as I'll discuss in a minute.","Turning next to our Industrial business, we grew third quarter sales 3% in local currency due to higher volume and product mix and to pricing, as seen on slide 19. In the Americas region, we grew Industrial business sales 3% in local currency. We had strong demand for snack seasonings in the U.S. and Mexico including many of the new products that have been introduced by leading food and beverage companies this year.","On the restaurant side of our business, sales of branded food service products increased this quarter, while sales to quick service restaurants remained weak. In EMEA, our Industrial business team had another quarter of great performance in sales and profit. In local currency, we grew sales 8% by pricing, along with volume and product mix. Demand from quick service restaurants remained strong and we had good sales of snacks seasonings in this market as well.","In the third quarter of 2014, Industrial business sales in the Asia-Pacific region declined 1% in local currency. This is a slowdown from the growth we reported in the first half of the year. During that period, there was a significant recovery in sales to quick service restaurants in China that had been weak in 2013. However, demand from these customers slowed in this most recent quarter and as Alan indicated we\u2019re cautious in our near term outlook.","Excluding special charges, adjusted operating income for the Industrial business rose 26% to $38 million, resulting from higher sales, increased margins within the product portfolio and CCI cost savings. While we have more difficult results in the year-ago period and therefore a somewhat easy comparison this year, we are ahead on a two-year basis as stated earlier and pleased with the progress in our strategies to grow sales and profit for this part of our business.","Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we do not expect the same rate of operating income growth since the year-ago comparison becomes more difficult and we\u2019re cautious in our outlook for the Asia-Pacific region. As a reminder, adjusted operating income was up more than 50% in the fourth quarter of 2013.","For the total Company, operating income rose 6% driven by higher sales, CCI cost savings and more favorable Industrial business margins. These same factors also led to improved gross profit margin. And during the quarter, we funded additional brand marketing programs with a greater investment planned in the fourth quarter. We reported $2 million in special charges this quarter with $1 million principally related to the realignment of certain manufacturing operations in the U.S. Industrial business and $1 million related to reorganization activity in EMEA.","Let me discuss this quarter's reduction in the tax-rate. In our January 2014 call, we provided you with an initial outlook for a 30% to 31% tax-rate this year. This was an increase from a 26.8% tax-rate in 2013 and included the estimated impact of a discontinuation of the R&D tax credit, a tax law change in France effective in our fiscal year 2014, the expected mix of business across tax jurisdictions and in 2013 we reported favorable discrete tax items.","Last quarter, in our June earnings call, we lowered the projected rate to approximately 29.5% to reflect our latest projection for mix of businesses across tax jurisdictions for the fiscal year, including the faster pace of growth in China and EMEA. We now believe that the tax-rate for fiscal year 2014 will come in at approximately 27%. This reduction from 29.5% is a combination of three things; an updated mix of business across tax jurisdictions, France released final regulations clarifying the impact of the tax law change and other discrete tax items.","So what are the implications of this? First, we\u2019ve increased our projected earnings per share, which I'll discuss shortly. Second, the expected fiscal year tax-rate of 27% is now fairly close to the 26.8% recorded in 2013 and third, we anticipate a 28% tax-rate for the fourth quarter. Keep in mind that this compares to a much lower 24.3% tax-rate in the fourth quarter of 2013 which included some discrete items.","Moving on to income from unconsolidated operations, our joint ventures had a strong performance with income reaching $9 million this quarter. In addition to higher sales, our joint venture in Mexico is settled into its new, more efficient manufacturing facility. At the bottom line, earnings per share rose to $0.95 excluding special charges. As you can see on slide 27, this was an increase of $0.17, comprised largely of higher operating profit, the favorable tax-rate and increased income from our unconsolidated operations.","Turning next to slide 28, we've summarized highlights for cash flow in the quarter-end balance sheet. Year-to-date cash flow from operations was $276 million, up $48 million from the first three quarters of 2013. This improvement included higher net income and a lower pension contribution in 2014. During this period, we used a $178 million of cash to repurchase 2.6 million shares. At quarter-end, we had $181 million still available on our $400 million authorization. Our balance sheet remains sound. We\u2019re close to our target debt level and well-positioned to fund investments to drive growth including acquisitions.","Turning to our 2014 outlook, we continue to expect to grow sales 3% to 5% in 2014 on a currency neutral basis. Keep in mind that this included an incremental impact of WAPC in the first half. Also, we now expect minimal sales impact from foreign currency exchange rates although rates are still moving quite a bit. We have moderated our outlook for adjusted operating income. We now expect an increase of 4% to 5% from $591 million of adjusted operating income in 2013. This change reflects an unfavorable impact from the latest business mix projection for the full year, offset in part by our anticipated CCI savings. Our planned increase in brand marketing support remains at least $25 million.","As I indicated in my remarks, this latest projection of business mix has a favorable impact on the tax-rate which together with other tax-rate factors leads us to a higher 2014 earnings per share projection.","We have increased our range for adjusted EPS to $3.30 to $3.37 from $3.22 to $3.29. This new range excludes the $0.01 for special charges recorded in the third quarter. With our year-to-date results, we\u2019re on our way toward another year of strong cash flow.","As many of you know, we adhere to a balanced use of cash and are committed to returning a significant portion to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. In 2014, we expect to use nearly $200 million of cash for dividends and through share repurchases to reduce our shares outstanding by approximately 2%.","As I conclude my comments, we look forward to reporting to you on our fourth quarter results in January and providing our outlook for continued growth in 2015.","Let's turn now to your questions after which Alan will provide some closing remarks. Operator, we're ready for the first question.","Question-And-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions). Thank you. Our first question is from the line of Robert Moskow of Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse ","Alan, you mentioned on the call that I think you had flowed through new pricing structures for the category in about half of the retailers or at least half of the retailers had accepted it. Can you give us a sense of what that means for your pricing in 2015? I imagine it's a positive but how is it a positive? Does it improve the relative pricing that you have versus competition? And what does it mean to your top line for U.S. consumer next year?","Alan Wilson","Yes what we\u2019re talking about is actual retail pricing where we're analyzing the category, looking at all the stuff that's there and getting to the optimum price level for us and our competition. We're looking at things like margin parity, so that we make sure that the retail margins for our products are similar to the retail margins for other people. In some cases, it means raising the price -- the retail prices of some of our competition. The net impact of what that's doing, and also one thing I'll also make a point is getting sharper price points on some of the more price sensitive items from our standpoint. The net impact of that is its closing price gaps and we see that as very positive.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse","Okay and then a follow-up regarding China. I remember last quarter, I think your QSR business had shown some signs of improvement and now you're saying that you're cautious on fourth quarter. What has changed to change your tone? Is there something specific?","Alan Wilson","Well, as we went into last quarter, we were seeing increased foot traffic and some momentum in that business and then, as you've probably seen from our QSR customers, report of a supply issue which has impacted foot traffic again. We still see that business as being pretty resilient over time and the Chinese consumers tend to come back, but when they have these well publicized quality issues in the store, it erodes confidence and impacts short term traffic\u00a0and we're seeing some of that like our customers have reported.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Alexia Howard with Sanford Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.","Alexia Howard - Sanford Bernstein","Can I ask about the U.S. Consumer business? Over the past year you've had a bit of market share encroachment from private label and also from some smaller brands. Where are you in reversing those trends and how confident are you that the share trends will continue to be fairly decent? Thank you.","Alan Wilson","We're seeing some of the impact of the efforts that we've made between a combination of our new products, our category management activities and frankly some of those price gaps being closed. So what we've actually seen in the more recent periods and actually for the year, private label share in spices has not grown in the U.S. It's been pretty flat and in more recent periods, we've seen private label share flattening and actually declining a little bit. The second piece of that is we've actually grown share in the Recipe Mix category. We're up about a share point and so we\u2019re seeing some of that.","The share erosion that we've seen has declined somewhat. We were last year looking at about a 1.5 of share, now it's less than a share point and we're continuing to see momentum. So we're pleased that we have the right plans and the right kinds of activities that are going to continue to build that back.","I'd also remind you that we have a healthy, growing category. So we have not seen the growth rates of category level off at all and so we're participating in good categories, both in Recipe Mixes and Spices and Seasonings.","Alexia Howard - Sanford Bernstein","And then as a quick follow-up on the -- you mentioned acquisitions being on the radar screen. Are you continuing to look at fairly small bolt-on acquisitions, mainly in emerging markets or has your thinking changed on that? Thank you and I'll pass it on.","Alan Wilson","We are open and evaluate larger acquisitions. But the ones that we've had the most success with have been the tuck-in acquisitions that we know how to manage, largely in emerging markets, although we have some more developed market candidates as well.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from the line of David Driscoll with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.","David Driscoll - Citigroup","To be totally honest, when I looked at the press release this morning I thought, wow, this looks fantastic. Then as I get reading it further, guys, it seems more confusing. So a couple of questions here, the tax-rate, you spent a long time on it, but I still don't think I came away with maybe the most important issue here. Is this a sustainable rate for many years to go?","It felt like last year when you gave the initial guidance, there was this massive increase in the tax-rate. It was a huge headwind and it was really a dampening factor on the outlook this year but lo and behold, here we are and gosh it's nowhere near that. So, the first question is, what do we do with the tax-rate long term and how do you put some confidence around it?","Gordon Stetz","The best estimate I would have on a go-forward basis for the tax-rate and I have to put two caveats around this because it's one of the factors that impacted the volatility you've obviously described. Based on current legislation and business mix, the rate that we provided for you for the fourth quarter of 28% would be a reasonable rate.","Now, I appreciate the significant change during the course of the year, that significant change we spoke about is primarily a factor of the legislative environment and as we started the year, we had rules coming out of France that we thought were going to be a negative impact on that tax-rate and that was going to be a sustainable higher rate until the final regulations were published this quarter and we were able to interpret them more clearly and get advisory input on it and that became one of the biggest factors in the reversal of that outlook for the quarter.","So I would say simply at the moment on current business mix and current legislation that 28 is probably a good number, but again, it's a volatile legislative environment and I don't know what different countries or different legislators are going to do as we proceed.","David Driscoll - Citigroup","Following on this, just wanted to ask about when you take down your operating profit guidance for the year, the growth guidance, does this affect management incentive comp and if so how much?","","Gordon Stetz","We have a mix in our yearly incentive comp that's based partially on EPS and so there's a positive impact to that although we look at discrete items and exclude those and the other part is on what we term as -- we call it McCormick profit but it's a proxy for economic profit which is operating income with a charge for working capital. So it will impact our management incentive comp in a way in a bit.","David Driscoll - Citigroup","No, what I'm really getting after right there guys is when we think to \u201915 do we think that management comp kind of comes down this year because of the lower op profits and then rebounds next year? And it's a factor affecting the algorithm? Or is that -- I'm just running too -- trying to be too specific on something?","Gordon Stetz","Yes, that\u2019s pretty specific but to recall, last year a big part of -- because of our results, our bonuses were impacted negatively and so we're building some of those back as we perform a little better.","David Driscoll - Citigroup","Last little detail. FX in the fourth quarter, you said for the full year it doesn't matter but rates have gone crazy. Can you just give us some comment on your fourth quarter FX impact?","Alan Wilson ","Well certainly there is going to be downward pressure. We haven't quantified the exact impact in the quarter, but I would say we're definitely going to be experiencing downward pressure and that's incorporated in the full year guidance that we've given you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Akshay Jagdale of KeyBanc. Please proceed with your question.","Akshay Jagdale - KeyBanc","Two questions, first one, just a clarification on what you said on pricing, your pricing strategy in North America. Can you just talk a little bit more about that? Because what if your competitors decide to lower their prices or keep their prices where they are while you're increasing your price points? How should we think about that risk? And so maybe you can just clear clarify what you said before because I was a bit confused on that and then I have a follow-up.","Alan Wilson","Yes, just to be clear what we're doing is making pricing recommendations on the category. We can't control what our competition does, although I will say that what we've seen over history is when we lead in pricing and that's our pricing to the retailer, it takes some time for our competition to follow because of our share position. No other competitor is going to lead in pricing until we take pricing, nobody else does and then they follow it gradually and we're seeing that impact now from last year's price increase, just takes a little more time for the others to flow through. If they choose to lower prices or promote heavily and that sort of thing, then we'll adapt and respond like we always do.","Akshay Jagdale - KeyBanc","But just to follow-up, so the need for this arises from your analysis of the category relative to other categories and what's the general message that you're sending out to retailers, that prices need to be higher or lower or it's a mixed bag?","Alan Wilson","It's a mixed bag and frankly what we're trying to do is help them as they analyze the category with competitive prices relative to their competition and looking at the margins they're taking on McCormick items versus competitive items.","Akshay Jagdale - KeyBanc","Okay and just a follow-up on your guidance for 4Q. You mentioned the factors that are impacting EBIT growth to be lower now. I'm not clear as to which ones really change, right? So it seems like the mix impact is pretty significant on EBIT but is that because you're expecting lower consumer growth now than you did before or higher international sales growth? I mean it's not clear which one of those changed to cause that.","Alan Wilson","We're reflecting certainly what we've seen on the international markets and its impact on the margins year-to-date and what we anticipate on a go-forward basis into the quarter. So as we said in the call, we're maintaining the sales guidance but we're acknowledging that a lot of the sales growth year-to-date has come from the international growth and that's certainly impacted the margin structure and that's part of it.","It's also acknowledging that we're investing behind our brands and we're having confidence in the programs that we have in place. We're not going to be pulling back on any of those programs. In fact, we're leaning into those in the fourth quarter, Alan described them to you. So that's a significant increase in Q4 which certainly is going to have an impact near term on the profit but we think it's the right thing long term for the category.","Gordon Stetz","And then the caution that we talked about in China.","Alan Wilson","Right, right -- in the industrial segment.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Chris Growe of Stifel. Please go ahead with your question.","Chris Growe - Stifel","I just had two questions for you and I'm sorry to ask another follow-up on this one. But I just want to be clear on the pricing recommendations that you're changing. Is there any direct benefit to you from these price changes? Is it more about getting the prices right to the consumer at retail?","Alan Wilson","More about getting the prices right to the consumer at retail.","Chris Growe - Stifel","Okay. That's what I figured but I wanted to make sure it was clear. It was a little confusing. Thank you. If I could ask about the U.S. consumer performance this quarter given you had this 5% drag roughly from shipment changes year-over-year, would it be fair to say your underlying growth this quarter in U.S. consumer was around 4%, just given the performance that was reported versus the adjustments that came through from the shipment planning.","Alan Wilson","Yes, that's right.","Chris Growe - Stifel","Okay. That does suggest an improvement in the business, that's good. And then one final question if I could maybe to Gordon on the gross margin. So you had CCI savings coming through. I guess you had some pricing as well offsetting cost inflation. So I'm just -- gross margin was softer than what I expected. Is that more about the business mix shift or are there any other factors we should be aware of in terms of offsetting inflation or CCI savings that kind of thing.","Gordon Stetz","It's geographic and segment mix.","Chris Growe - Stifel","Okay. Do you know how much that was in terms of a factor in the quarter on the gross margin?","Gordon Stetz","I don't have that quantified in front of me right now but it would be a significant factor.","Operator","(Operator Instructions). The next question is from the line of Erin Lash of Morningstar. Please proceed with your question.","Erin Lash - Morningstar","I was curious about the Skillet Sauces, the launch of Skillet Sauces. Obviously that has been a highly competitive category and one in which several other packaged food firms have entered. And you talked to the fact that the Spices and Seasonings category growth rates overall remain healthy. I was wondering -- obviously skillet sauces moves you further into that center of the store packaged food type space. And so I was wondering if you could speak to how your product is differentiated and how you expect to compete in that category.","Alan Wilson","The products that we've launched have been more instead of being more premium; have been more focused on everyday classics with a twist and so effectively they're liquid versions of our more popular dry seasoning mixes and so we think that distinguishes us. We've obviously as everything that we do, we test with great flavors. So we believe that's going to deliver and just to remind you, we're in the liquid category already with our Lawry's wet marinades. So while this is a new launch for us and a new category that has been growing, we believe it will help with the category growth rate. We're not going head to head with the stuff that's already out there. We've got a different mix of products.","Erin Lash - Morningstar","And then I was just wondering if you could speak a little bit more to the plans for the holiday in terms of how you're maybe positioning your products, if you're positioning I guess your products any differently given the importance of the holiday season in terms of your overall results.","Alan Wilson","I wouldn't say we're necessarily positioning them differently. But we are -- as we always are very active with display activity to make sure that the stores have the product that they need as the consumers are shopping for the holiday meals. We are continuing to increase our advertising and marketing support behind the products as we go into the fourth quarter and we're working with retailers to make sure to get those displays up and in the right place so that consumers can find them.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Jonathan Feeney with Athlos Research. Please proceed with your question.","Jonathan Feeney - Athlos Research","So when you communicate this mixed bag of pricing with retailers, are there any units for which you're actually recommending price should go up?","Alan Wilson","I would say generally no, but there are certainly at least in terms of our products, we're looking at what the right level of pricing to hit the -- for the consumer is and we're managing gaps.","Jonathan Feeney - Athlos Research","And you mentioned you've done a good job maintaining that -- I should say stopping any kind of encroachment in private label share. When you go through the data with retailers, is there a really big difference? Is it the big difference in velocity between your products and private label that makes it compelling for the retailers? Is that what you lead with? Or is it a difference in absolute dollar margin to the retailer? What is the bigger factor of those two? Because I know it's a category that you have a unique level of dialogue and frankly control over, given your manufacturing on both sides private label and branded compared to some other food categories.","Alan Wilson","Yes it's more helping the retailer maximize their dollar profit and get the right margin mix for the items and remember, in our category it's a fairly small, limited number of items that are duplicated across all the brands. So there is about 15 to 20 items which are duplicated from opening price point, private label and then all the competitive brands that actually matter. And so those we're really working on getting the pricing right.","The broad array of the stuff we offer are the things that are unique to certain times of the year like poultry seasoning and sage at Thanksgiving and some of the baking items at the holidays. So it's really kind of managing those things that aren't necessarily -- that are duplicated so we get the pricing right and all the things that aren't duplicated making sure the availability is there.","Jonathan Feeney - Athlos Research","I guess just one follow-up to that, then. How is it do you think -- why is it do you think that retailers maybe got their pricing a little bit out of whack on some of these products? Do they not understand the consumer? Did the consumer change? I guess any thoughts you had on that.","Alan Wilson","Well as we talked in some of the earlier calls, we saw a lot of stuff that was coming in through either produce departments or through a DSD supplier that may not have been visible to the center store category managers and some of that is just bringing that to their attention because we're seeing lots of stuff that has just found their way in and we see it sometimes. And couple of the selling stores (indiscernible) is to help them understand the impact on their inventory levels for stuff that's not necessarily adding to category growth. So we're kind of telling the whole category story and that's the role that we can play given our position.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Eric Katzman with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Eric Katzman - Deutsche Bank","Couple of questions, why don't we start out with the advertising spend. It seems like during the year it's kind of been deferred each quarter to meet up with what your expectation was initially for the full year. So was there something about the product lineup or the landscape that's made so much of the advertising spend kind of fall into the fourth quarter?","Alan Wilson","Well typically, the fourth quarter is where we spend the heaviest and some of that spend is to support new products and so we've lined up the actual spend with the distribution level of the new products. So there is a piece to that that we've managed, but by and large -- because we do in the U.S. business and to a lesser extent in our other developed markets, and awful lot of our sales are skewed towards fourth quarter. And the fourth quarter is when we have our highest returns on investment for advertising.","Eric Katzman - Deutsche Bank","Okay. Second, you talked pretty I guess aggressively about the balance sheet and the ability to look for M&A. I know you've been very kind of EVA or economic profit focused as opposed to kind of the rest of the world that doesn't seem to even care about that anymore. It seems like it's all about EPS accretion but -- how are you seeing multiples in your ability to drive economic profit again in that context?","Alan Wilson","Yes that's always the balance and we've been pretty disciplined. Through the years, we continue to be pretty disciplined on making sure that we can more than pay back the cost of capital over time for the deals that we make. Certainly that means that in highly contested deals we get bypassed in some cases. But we've been pretty disciplined. We know what our targets are. We are willing to pay the prices we need to pay but we also make sure that we know how to get the returns. And we have as you well know a pretty good track record on generating the value that we promise.","Eric Katzman - Deutsche Bank","Okay and then last question I guess is it seems like maybe its 24 hour news these days, but it seems like the world is -- I don't know aflame in every region and we don't get great views on your input costs. I think Alan, you had mentioned to me at one point some concern over pepper cost rising. Are you seeing pressure on some of your crops and kind of how does that figure into what sounds like basically lower prices at retail for the spice category led by your discussions?","Alan Wilson","We are seeing some pressure, specifically on pepper and we're evaluating our plans as we go into next year. We're not making any changes to this year but we're evaluating how to respond to that for next year. But we're certainly seeing some upward pressure. It's pretty volatile world with everything from political unrest to some uncertain weather and -- but that's the kind of thing that we've always dealt with. But I will say that we're currently evaluating and getting our budgets ready for 2015 and making decisions on how we're going to approach it, what we do see as some input cost pressure.","Eric Katzman - Deutsche Bank","Just last follow-up, but I think it's an important issue. So I kind of read your comments about the category management work with the retailers as essentially being lower price points. If you have somewhat inflationary pressure, you didn't comment about vanilla or cinnamon but does that -- do you have additional kind of productivity savings that can kind of act as an offset to all that looking into next year, which is kind of sounds like it's more relevant to next year in any case.","Alan Wilson","Yes and we are continuing to look at and beef up our CCI programs and looking at other ways to help offset some of that inflation and to make sure that we stay within the right gaps that consumers are going to be able to buy our products.","Operator","Our next question is a follow-up from the line of Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse","Are you able from an antitrust perspective to look at Spice and Seasonings acquisitions domestically anymore or do you feel more comfortable looking outside that category?","Alan Wilson","We generally are looking more broadly at adjacent categories in the U.S. market. And I wouldn't say never that we couldn't, but I will say that most of our targets in the U.S. market are adjacent categories not directly Spice and Seasonings.","Operator","Thank you. At this time, I'll turn the floor back to Mr. Alan Wilson for closing remarks.","Alan Wilson","I want to thank everybody for your questions and for being on the call. We recognize that our financial results this quarter were a bit complex and with the tax-rate variance, the shift in sales and special charges. Putting these aside, we want to leave you with a few takeaways; we're making steady progress to improve the results of our U.S. Consumer business. We're driving increased sales and profits in a number of our international markets and we continue to invest in our growth and fuel these investments with above target CCI cost savings. This performance has us on track for record sales, profit and cash flow in 2014. Throughout McCormick, we're executing against our plans that have us well positioned for the future. Thanks for your time and attention today.","Joyce Brooks","Thank you, Alan. I would also like to add my thanks to those who joined us this morning. (Operator Instructions).

Thank you for joining today's call to review the company's third quarter financial results and 2012 outlook. We've posted a set of slides to accompany today's call at our website, ir.mccormick.com.","[Operator Instructions] A question-and-answer session will follow our remarks. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, the conference is being recorded.","With me on today's call are Alan Wilson, Chairman, President and CEO; and Gordon Stetz, Executive Vice President and CFO. Alan is going to comment on our third quarter 2012 results and share our latest progress with key growth initiatives along with remarks about the current business environment. Gordon will provide a review of our third quarter financial performance and discuss our 2012 financial guidance. After that, we look forward to discussing your questions and closing remarks from Alan.","As a reminder, today's presentation contains projections and other forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those projected. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or other factors. As seen on Slide 2, our forward-looking statement also provides information on risk factors that could affect our financial results.","It's now my pleasure to turn the discussion over to Alan.","Alan D. Wilson","Thanks, Joyce. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Our third quarter financial results demonstrate the effectiveness of McCormick's growth initiatives even in a challenging environment.","Measured in local currency, we grew sales 9%, increased operating income 12% and achieved a 13% increase in earnings per share. Through the first 3 quarters, we have generated $256 million of cash flow from operations and are on track to exceed $400 million for the fiscal year.","Our strategy to grow sales and profit by investing in the business and fueling these investments with CCI, our Comprehensive Continuous Improvement program, provides the framework for our progress. And employees throughout the company are doing exceptional work, and a key ingredient of success, our power of people.","As an example, we now expect to exceed $50 million in cost savings from CCI, a 25% increase from our initial goal of at least $40 million in cost savings during 2012. We regard this program as particularly important in a period of time when material costs remain volatile. This quarter, we were pleased to report a 50-basis-point improvement in gross profit margin following a number of quarters when margins have been under pressure.","While difficult economic conditions in many of our markets persist, we're making excellent progress with our growth initiatives in 3 areas: product innovation, brand marketing support and acquisitions. Let's start with some remarks on Consumer business innovation, where we are building on our global growth platforms as well as innovating behind our brands that are regional leaders. Following the launch of 200 branded consumer products in 2011, we are on track to launch close to 250 new items this year.","In the U.S., new McCormick recipe mixes are allowing consumers to easily prepare wholesome, traditional meals for their families. Our Zatarain\u2019s frozen meals for 2 has helped drive a 9% sales increase year to date for the brand. Grill Mates blends, marinades and barbecue sauces are behind an 8% year-to-date sales increase. And in the fourth quarter, we will be introducing Hispanic rice mixes, frozen Simply Asia entr\u00e9es and a holiday multipack of small-size Extracts.","In Latin America, we have developed and introduced value-priced condiments that are helping to drive a 9% increase in our Consumer sales in El Salvador throughout the first 3 quarters. And in Canada, we've gained strong retail acceptance for 37 new products and expect sales of our 2012 new products to be double the sales of new products introduced in 2011.","Moving to Europe, the Middle East & Africa. Consumers are under pressure and seeking ways to economize. During this period, differentiated new products are more important than ever. Building on our global platform of recipe mixes, we are having particular success with Bag 'n Season in France and the U.K., Slow Cookers and limited-edition varieties. Likewise, innovation behind our spice and seasoning platform include Grinders and, across multiple markets, new Recipe Inspirations. For consumers who want to prepare great desserts at home, we continue to expand our Vahin\u00e9 brand product offerings.","In the Asia\/Pacific region, we're expanding our recipe mix platform in China. Earlier in the year, we launched a line of family classics with flavors such as Kung Pao Chicken and honey pork ribs, followed more recently by World Flavor varieties. Australia's introductions include naturals recipe mixes as well as recipe creations and marinades.","Our Industrial teams have been equally active with innovation. Demand for healthier products remains a great opportunity for McCormick to provide customized flavor solutions for numerous food categories: snack chips, crackers, cereals, side dishes and menu items, beverages, chicken and sandwiches.","Recently, we completed a study to track the success of the flavors that we develop for customer products, comparing the performance of our flavors with flavor varieties supplied by a competitor for the same salty snack cereal and cracker brands. The 3 examples in Slide 7 are representative of what we see across a number of examples. The McCormick-flavored products are outselling. Clearly, we're providing flavors preferred by consumers.","As we continue to invest in our technical innovation capabilities, with a ribbon-cutting in August for a new facility in Mexico, new flavor labs in the U.S. and, more recently, in the U.K. and our new Technical Innovation Center in Guangzhou, China due to open by year end. Brand marketing support is another key growth initiative. While we expect to increase our spending this year by at least $15 million, we're also reallocating funds to reach consumers in new ways. A portion of funds are being directed toward a value message behind our brands with coupons, features and in-store displays. In fact, our U.S. Retail displays for the holiday period are going in even earlier during this fourth quarter, and we have a strong ad campaign planned behind new Thanksgiving advertising.","We're also adapting to reach consumers where they're spending their time, which is increasingly on the Internet, as shown on Slide 8. In 2012, we expect our digital marketing to reach 12% of our total brand marketing support, triple what we were spending just 2 years ago. We're working to connect with consumers at every stage of what we call the flavor of life cycle, from inspiration with a recipe idea to getting our product in the shopping list and helping with meal preparation and, finally, sharing success with family and friends.","In addition to our Facebook fans for brands like Grill Mates, Zatarain\u2019s and Old Bay, we are excited about our presence on Instagram and Pinterest to support our gourmet consumers. Pinterest is now the third-largest social media site after Facebook and Twitter and provides an opportunity for consumers to become engaged with our brands in more authentic and compelling ways.","The third growth initiative I want to touch on is acquisitions. Acquisitions completed in 2011 are contributing meaningfully to our 2012 sales growth at a 6% rate year to date. The addition of Kamis and Kohinoor have expanded our emerging market presence, and through the first 3 quarters, sales in emerging markets accounted for 14% of total McCormick sales. I reported last quarter that these integrations were complete, and we're now achieving some early wins.","Kamis is currently tracking ahead of plan, due in large part to our business in Russia. Russia comprises nearly 20% of the Kamis business, and we've grown sales 44% from the year-ago pre-acquisition period in this market. Our business there is supported by distribution facilities and a local sales team. As the third-largest spice and seasoning business in Russia with a category share of approximately 10%, we are further expanding our distribution in this fragmented market.","Turning to India. We are realigning our Kohinoor distribution network by retail channel rather than geography to build focus on modern trade, traditional trade and food service. This is patterned after a similar alignment that met with great success in China. And in the U.S., we continue to build retail distribution for Kitchen Basics products.","About a month ago, we announced our latest acquisition agreement, this time in China. We've agreed to purchase 100% of the assets of Wuhan Asia-Pacific Condiments, WAPC, for approximately $141 million. This price is about 12x multiple of EBITDA, with annual sales of roughly $115 million, WAPC manufactures and markets, 2 leading brands of bouillon in Central China. Sales are growing at a double-digit rate with a network of distributors that supply traditional markets as well as modern grocery stores. This business is an excellent fit with our current business in China. It extends our product portfolio of spices, seasoning blends and sauces to bouillon, and WAPC's geographic strength in Central China complements McCormick's existing strength in China's coastal regions. We regard WAPC as a great follow-on to our acquisitions of Kamis and Kohinoor in 2011. We're building out our emerging market presence through acquisitions that have been in the $100 million to $200 million range.","As we execute our emerging market strategy, we're maintaining our financial discipline and acquiring established brands that are immediately accretive to earnings when costs to close the deal were excluded. We're well on our way toward reaching the goal that we set in April:  for sales in emerging markets to reach 20% of total sales by 2015.","Let me turn it over to Gordon now for more insight into our third quarter financial results and our latest 2012 guidance. Gordon?","Gordon M. Stetz","Thanks, Alan, and good morning, everyone. As Alan indicated, we continue to operate in a challenging environment, one that has demanded adaptability, resourcefulness and the talents of McCormick employees across the company. Our financial results are a testament to their accomplishments. Alan provided some of the headline results for the third quarter: 9% sales growth in local currency, a 12% increase in operating income, a double-digit increase in earnings per share and strong cash flow.","I'd like to begin with a closer look at each of our 2 segments, starting with our Consumer business. As seen on Slide 12, we grew Consumer business sales 12% in local currency. In a period of increased pricing, we are maintaining our volume and product mix and had another strong contribution from our 2011 acquisitions this period.","In the Americas region, we grew third-quarter Consumer business sales 5% in local currency. As seen on Slide 13, sales from Kitchen Basics added 1% to our growth this period. Pricing was up 5% as a result of an increase taken in the fourth quarter of 2011 and a more recent price increase on pepper.","For the third quarter of 2012, volume and product mix were about even with the year-ago period. As a reminder, in the third quarter of 2011, we estimated that customers purchased approximately $10 million of product in advance of a price increase, shifting sales into the third quarter of 2011 from the fourth quarter of 2011. Excluding this impact, third quarter 2012 volume and product mix were up approximately 3% year-on-year, a solid growth rate being driven by the new product activity and brand marketing support that Alan discussed.","In Europe, the Middle East and Africa, EMEA, we grew consumer sales 22% in local currency. This increase was attributable to sales of Kamis, our acquisition in Poland, which was still incremental in this quarter. For the base business, a slight increase in pricing was offset by a decline in volume and product mix. Difficult conditions persist in much of Europe, where consumers are facing uncertainty and economic pressure. In this environment, we are working to drive growth with differentiated new products and our brand marketing support.","Consumer business sales in the Asia\/Pacific region rose 69% in local currency. Kohinoor, our acquisition in India, added 55% to third quarter sales. The base business grew 14%, mostly from volume and product mix. Following a strong start to the year and a more modest increase in the second quarter, sales rebounded this period, illustrating the quarter-to-quarter variability we've seen in this region, which is due in part to the timing of holiday seasons in marketing programs. Our Consumer business in China drove this quarter's increase, and sales there are up 20% year to date in local currency.","Across all 3 regions, third quarter Consumer business operating income was $109 million, up 8% from the prior year, driven primarily by sales growth. Pricing actions together with our CCI cost savings continue to provide an offset to the impact of higher material costs.","Let's turn now to our Industrial business and start with a review of our sales performance. For this segment, we grew sales 6% in local currency, with most of the increase related to pricing taken in response to increased material costs.","On Slide 18, Industrial sales in the Americas rose 7% in local currency due primarily to pricing actions. During the third quarter, we grew sales of seasonings and flavors to a number of food manufacturers and also increased sales of branded items to food service distributors. However, we saw lower demand for our products sold to quick-service restaurants.","In EMEA, our Industrial business achieved another consecutive quarter of strong sales growth in the third quarter. We grew sales 11% in local currency with a 7% increase in volume and product mix. Demand from quick-service restaurants remains robust, and we are meeting this demand with products supplied from our operations in the U.K., Turkey and South Africa. In contrast to the consumer results in the Asia\/Pacific region, this was a somewhat weak quarter for the Industrial business there with sales in local currency down 4%. This compares to 17% year-on-year sales growth in local currency for the third quarter of 2011. In 2012, we have been impacted by a lower level of promotional activity behind some of the quick-service restaurant items we flavor in this region.","In the Asia\/Pacific region and across our other 2 regions, our Industrial teams are working to partner with our customers to drive their growth through new product development. Operating income for the Industrial business was $35 million in the third quarter, an increase of 27% from the year-ago period, which reflects higher sales, CCI-related cost savings and operating expense leverage. In addition, our customer pricing is better aligned with our current material costs than in the third quarter of 2011, when we were getting pricing actions in place in response to significant material cost increases.","Across both segments, we grew third quarter operating income 12% to $144 million, mainly due to higher sales and our CCI program. Gross profit was 40.1% this period compared to 39.6% in third quarter of 2011, a 50-basis-point improvement. This reflects the favorable sales mix in Consumer and faster growth of the Consumer segment versus the Industrial segment. And as mentioned for each of these 2 segments, we are offsetting higher material costs with pricing actions and CCI cost savings.","Also affecting operating income was our selling, general and administrative expense, which was down 20 basis points as a percent of net sales in the third quarter. Brand marketing spending this period was about even with the year-ago period. This follows a 27% increase in the third quarter of 2011.","For the full year, we expect our brand marketing support to be up at least $15 million. This suggests an increase of a few million dollars in the fourth quarter, given what we have spent year to date. This fourth quarter 2012 increase builds upon a $10 million increase in the fourth quarter of 2011.","Moving below operating income, our tax rate for the third quarter was 25% compared to the prior year period at 26.8%. This year-on-year tax rate variance added about $0.02 of the earnings per share increase in the third quarter of 2012.","In the third quarter of 2011, we had the benefit of discrete tax items. In the third quarter of 2012, we repatriated $70 million of cash from foreign subsidiaries. Due to the mix of foreign earnings that related to this cash, the repatriation resulted in foreign tax credits in the U.S. Versus our underlying tax rate for 2012, the impact of these tax credits added about $0.04 to earnings per share. We expect the tax credits to add $0.02 to earnings per share in the fourth quarter of 2012 versus our underlying tax rate. We currently expect the fourth quarter tax rate to be about approximately 27%.","Income from unconsolidated operations continues to lag the year-ago results with $5.5 million achieved in the third quarter of 2012 compared to $6.8 million in the year-ago period. Although the decline has moderated from the first half of 2012, it is still due in large part to the exchange rate between the Mexican peso and the U.S. dollar not only in the translation of earnings from our McCormick-to-Mexico joint venture, but in the transaction impact for the purchase of soybean oil. We now expect income from unconsolidated operations for the full year to be down approximately 20% year-on-year.","At the bottom line, we reported earnings per share of $0.78, a 13% increase from $0.69 in the third quarter of 2011. Of the $0.09 increase, higher operating income was the primary factor behind our profit growth, followed by the favorable tax rate, as shown on Slide 25.","Let's turn next to our cash flow and August 31 balance sheet. Year to date, cash flow from operations was $256 million compared to $86 million in the first 3 quarters of 2011. The improvement was led by a much lower increase in inventory for the first 3 quarters of 2012 than in the first 3 quarters of 2011. Year to date, in 2012, we used $98 million of cash to repurchase roughly 1.8 million shares. At quarter end, we had $171 million still available on our $400 million authorization.","Our balance sheet remains strong. We have maintained our debt levels through 2012 and plan to pay down approximately $50 million in the fourth quarter. In 2013, we expect to balance the use of cash for the acquisition of WAPC in China with our share repurchase program.","As a final topic, I want to review our latest 2012 guidance, as shown on Slide 27. With strong sales results through the first 3 quarters, we reaffirm our expectation to grow sales 9% to 11% in local currency for the fiscal year. Based on prevailing foreign currency rates, we are still estimating an unfavorable currency impact of 2% for the year.","At the operating income line, we are reaffirming a 9% to 11% increase. We have increased our guidance for earnings per share to a range of $3.03 to $3.08, reflecting the impact of the foreign tax credits. This is a $0.02 increase from the prior range of $3.01 to $3.06 and indicates our outlook for the fourth quarter EPS as a range of $1.10 to $1.15. While the impact of the foreign tax credits versus our underlying rate is about $0.06, we are adding just $0.02 to reflect a more conservative view of the fourth quarter, given the global economic environment and continued volatility in material costs as well as an opportunity for additional investment and brand marketing support.","As a reminder, in updating your models, keep in mind that we recorded acquisition-related transaction costs in the fourth quarter of 2011 that lowered earnings per share by $0.05, and we expect to have a $0.02 benefit from foreign tax credits in the fourth quarter of 2012.","To summarize, we were pleased with our third quarter performance and expect record financial results in 2012. While we maintain a cautious outlook based on the global economic environment, we are excited about our growth initiatives and the enthusiasm and energy of McCormick employees around the world.","Thank you for your attention, and now let's turn to your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Chuck Cerankosky with North Coast Research.","Charles Edward Cerankosky - Northcoast Research","In looking at the QSR business in Europe versus North America, one's weaker, one's stronger.  Yet the economies, they both have a fair amount of consumer stress. Can you give us some insight on that difference?","Alan D. Wilson","I think part of what's going on there is that we've gained a little bit of share in the European business. Our share is relatively flat in the U.S. business. So I think -- I wouldn't necessarily -- and I'd say the same thing about Asia, that I wouldn't necessarily draw an inference into the performance of that channel based on our results because there's a lot of things that move back and forth based on what items we supply and what the customers are promoting and what share we've gained.","Charles Edward Cerankosky - Northcoast Research","All right. And then looking at the underlying tax rate, Gordon, you're comparing a $0.04 favorable variance to the underlying tax rate. Is that suggesting something in the low 30s?","Gordon M. Stetz","Well, as we indicated for Q4, we expect it actually to be below 30%, more in the range of 27%. Or you're saying the low -- you're asking about the underlying tax rate, I apologize.","Charles Edward Cerankosky - Northcoast Research","Right.","Gordon M. Stetz","The underlying tax rate would be around -- about 30%.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Alexia Howard of Sanford Bernstein.","Alexia Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Can I ask about some trends that we've been seeing in the consumer takeaway data?  It looks as though in spite of the seasonings in the U.S., there's been a bit of encouragement from private label dollar and volume share. Could you just tell us a little bit about what's going on there with respect to price gap to private label, private label promotional activity? And do you expect that kind of an environment to persist going forward?","Alan D. Wilson","I think it's going to be a challenging environment going forward, but as we look at it, I mean, the 4-week data is pretty skewed because it can be based on what we're promoting and when we're promoting it. And certainly what you're talking about is a factor in the 4-week period. As I look at it over the year, we've actually seen a more aggressive price change with private label than we have, necessarily, with the brand. And actually, we've grown share over the 52 weeks, all channels, all outlets with McCormick brands versus private label. The price gaps had closed pretty significantly. What we saw in the 4-week was probably some promotional activity that would suggest about 3% price impact from private label and about 5% from the brand.","Alexia Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay, great. And just quick follow-up. The Industrial business in Asia\/Pacific, you mentioned adverse promotional activity. Again, do you think that's likely to persist? Or was it really just affecting this quarter?","Alan D. Wilson","I think we'll still see some impact of that. And what it is, is that customers are focused on some -- promoting some items that we don't supply, so that is certainly a piece of it. It's not necessarily a drop in their promotional activity. I'd also take you back to we have very, very strong results in the fourth quarter of 2011 in that business. We were up 16% in volume. And so I think it's a little bit of they're focused on some other stuff, and we're up against a fairly tough comparison, and the pipeline has some new products that were launched in the fourth quarter last year.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Thilo Wrede of Jefferies & Company.","Thilo Wrede - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Gordon, if I understood you right, you're lowering the underlying guidance for the year by $0.04, offset by the tax benefits you're getting. Are there any particular parts of the business, any particular geographic regions that give you that cause for caution?","Gordon M. Stetz","No, I just go back to my comments in the call, Thilo, which relates just to the general economic environment we're operating in. Obviously, we can all read the headlines and see where there's stress around the world, in particular, Western Europe, where the consumer is still being impacted by the economic environment. Additionally, we did point to the potential for us to reinvest in the brand as well, and finally, as you heard Alan talk about, there are some tough comparisons, in particular in the Industrial side, that we're up against in Q4 on the Asia\/Pacific business that -- where we were up 16% in the prior year.","Thilo Wrede - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","So does the economic slowdown that we read about in China and Brazil and so on, does that give you any particular concern? Are you already seeing an impact on your business from that?","Alan D. Wilson","Our Consumer business in China is performing very well as we continue to grow our distribution and gain share there. So that's performing well. We are seeing some slowdown on the Industrial side, which we've seen over the last several months. But again, it's a factor of what the customers are promoting versus what we're necessarily supplying, and that's a piece of it. We're cautious in Europe and have seen some additional pressure there, although we think we've got the right plans in terms of our new products and our promotion plans and then building for a good holiday finish. I mean, I would highlight again what Gordon already said, is that we are going to continue to invest in advertising, and a part of that conservative guidance in the fourth quarter is behind our investment spending.","Thilo Wrede - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Right. Okay. And then last question I had for you, it seems like the growth of modern trade in India might accelerate, given the regulatory changes there. Is that something that would be particularly beneficial for you?","Alan D. Wilson","Yes, we believe that is very beneficial for us because our products, even though we cover the traditional trade as well as the modern trade there, our products are really geared for convenient package, safe items, and so we do benefit as modern trade expands.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Chris Growe of Stifel, Nicolaus.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I just wanted to clarify that on a follow-up comment there to Thilo. The -- in the fourth quarter, if you -- you've called out roughly $15 million of incremental marketing for the year. Are you saying you could go over and above that if you see the opportunity in the quarter? Or is your incremental investor talking about that $15 million?","Gordon M. Stetz","The current guidance would indicate that we would be up at about $15 million, would be an incremental $2 million within the quarter, with the potential for us to spend more if we determine we think it'll be an effective spend.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","And that's part of the conservatism for the fourth quarter? Is that -- I'm just trying to understand it.","Gordon M. Stetz","That is part of it as well.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. Yes. And then I just wanted to ask as well, you took your CCI cost-saving amount up for the year. Did that come through the business already? Do you expect that to come? So is there an improving outlook for that? And I guess I'd also like to ask is that more SG&A-related? The SG&A was a little lower than I thought this quarter.","Gordon M. Stetz","It's pretty consistent delivery as we progress through the year, Chris, and it's a function -- it's really as we progress through the year, more visibility into the projects and the timing of their execution. So it's pretty even as it relates to the year and the quarters. I'd say because of the fourth quarter size, we tend to incur more of the benefit just by virtue of the amount of production and materials that flow through our facilities. It's still a skew towards the cost of goods sold line. It's about 80% -- 75% to 80% do relate to our cost of goods sold, while the remainder is in SG&A.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay, and I had one final one. That was -- in this third quarter, have you said or could you say how much the benefit to consumer-operating profits came from the acquisitions?","Gordon M. Stetz","Within the quarter itself, I -- we don't get into that level of detail, but I can say we're pleased, we're on track relative to the initial accretion that we have given. All the acquisitions have been pretty much performing in line. So I view that prior guidance as a gauge, and as you know, we start to anniversary those acquisitions in the fourth quarter.","Operator","Our next question is from Eric Katzman of Deutsche Bank.","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Two questions, I guess. First one on the top line. I guess you indicated that about half of the local currency growth is acquisition-related and half is price. Is that correct?","Gordon M. Stetz","Yes. Eric, that is correct. So the 9%, it roughly breaks down into half price, half acquisition with...","Alan D. Wilson","Some slight volume.","Gordon M. Stetz","Minimum volume mix on that.","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I guess because you've done a great job of introducing new products in various niches across the industry as well as geographically. And so you highlighted them so much, Alan, I assume that they're performing at least in line with your expectations on a global level. But does that mean that there is some decent elasticity on the core given the 4% to 5% pricing?","Alan D. Wilson","I would also remind you that we had the buy-in in advance of the price increase last year. So -- and it's hard to gauge that, but if we took that out, we would have more substantial volume impact in the quarter. So we feel pretty good about what our new products are doing for us, and they're going to hit what we expect them to. I would say we still are under pressure with volumes as the consumer is under pressure. So we're seeing some level of that elasticity that we always see.","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And again, from a broader top line perspective, some of the companies that have reported recently have talked about improving, let's say, volume growth across a number of categories. Do you kind of echo that sentiment, Alan, or are you more cautious?","Alan D. Wilson","I think the volume trend in our category is a little stronger than the 52-week and a little weaker than the 12-week in the latest. So -- and you can't gauge that much for it. We feel like, in the fourth quarter, at least in the U.S., that we're set up for very good execution against last year. Now last year, as we saw, was pretty weak in December from a takeaway standpoint. So what we're gauging is what do we ship in the fourth quarter? But we feel like we're well-poised. We've got good display activity. Things are going in. And so we're pleased with how we're set up. And the thing that we're watching is what the consumer takeaway ends up to be.","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, and then last question, to -- I guess to this, Gordon, to the tax issue, I'm not even sure I know how to ask the question, let alone whether I'll understand the answer. But I thought that when you repatriated cash, which was I think one of the points you made in the text, that when you repatriate cash that it generally elevates your tax rate.  And yet you're saying it's kind of repatriating cash and getting a credit, and therefore, the tax rate's lower. How is all that working?","Gordon M. Stetz","It's the complexities of the foreign tax credit calculation, the relationship of U.S. earnings to non-U.S. earnings, calculations and the characterization of those earnings and earnings and profit pools, foreign exchange rate relationships at the time. So it would take a lot of time, but that's in a nutshell what it's all boils down to.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Ken Goldman of JPMorgan Chase.","Kenneth Goldman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","You have some insight into some broader trends in U.S. food consumption just based on your relationship with some of your customers in the food manufacturing side. But we're starting to hear some companies, as Eric said, talk about some volume improvements.  At least less pressure on that end. Can you give us some general insight into what you're seeing across food manufacturing, without mentioning companies in particular, of course, but just, is it sustainable, is it something that people are talking just building on easier comps? Do a lot of your customers, are they starting to feel better about things? Or is it a little bit of a, \"Hey, let's wait and see how we go and not get too excited yet.\"  I'm just curious based on your particular vantage point what you're seeing out there across food.","Alan D. Wilson","I think the general consensus that we're hearing is that people are seeing some recovery in volumes and some moderation of cost increases, not that they're going lower but that they aren't going up as high as they have in the past. What we're seeing from a new product activity standpoint is that our customers are focused on bigger, fewer new products as opposed to a steady stream of the base hits. So I think, that -- which would tell me that they're feeling more confident in that, and so I think, again, going back to what we're dealing with at this time last year, which was significant commodity inflation and pricing, there's -- the commodity inflation is not as high as it was, and so we expect that we should see the ability for the consumers to buy a little more and not have that sticker shock. Because I think what we saw early in the year was a little bit of the sticker shock, people living out of their pantries. And I think kind of the general impression is that things are improving a bit.","Kenneth Goldman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. That's helpful.  And then you seem to be doing well in China at -- on the Consumer side at a time when many of -- many consumer companies aren't, right? And I'm sure it's partially because spices are more of a staple but partially because of your strong execution, too. Can you just talk a little bit about what you're seeing in the Chinese economy overall? There've been a lot of consumer companies, not just in food, citing those tough trends there, like I said. I'm just interested in your views and maybe whether if there is a slowdown in China, does that affect your plans in any way? Or is it just more full steam ahead for you?","Alan D. Wilson","I think that the long-term growth rate of China is going to be good and positive, and it's going to be an important part of our business, as well as for a lot of people's business. We're seeing a general slowdown and some impact of -- with consumer confidence, I think, in China. What we're seeing in our Consumer business is that we're continuing to gain share and increase our distribution. So we're offsetting a little -- some of those trends by driving our business. We've increased our advertising there. We're increasing our new product activity, and so I think we're offsetting some of that. But I think there is a general slowdown that we've seen over the last, say, 9 to 12 months in China. But I think the long term -- my long-term view on China is that it's going to continue to grow and be a great market for us. That's why we're making the investments that we're making with the Wuhan Asia-Pacific Condiments business, but we're also investing in our facilities. We're in the process of completing a new technical center and a plant expansion. So we're pretty bullish long-term on China.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Akshay Jagdale of KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Akshay S. Jagdale - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Just one clarification on your guidance. So you didn't change your EBIT guidance, right? I mean, a lot of the noise is just below the line, correct?","Gordon M. Stetz","Yes, we reaffirmed operating income growth at 9% to 11%, that is correct.","Akshay S. Jagdale - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay, good. Can you just talk a little bit more in depth about what's going on in India?  And you mentioned your experience in China helping with that. So specifically, I mean, did you expect to make this change in your go-to-market strategy, I guess, before you made the -- or when you made the acquisition? Or have things changed? And just give us a little bit more color on why you think that's the right idea.","Alan D. Wilson","Yes, we were pretty regionally focused, and what we're seeing, as the modern trade starts to grow in India and then -- and from some of the other earlier comments, we expect that, that could accelerate. But the activity that we have focused on the geographies. We felt like we were missing some opportunities. This is a model that we had in China. So as we went into the acquisition, we did expect to make this change to -- and what we're talking about is a change from focusing on geographies to organizing our sales by channel. So we did expect to make that change. We -- it's early in making that, but we're very confident that that's going to be the right move for us and especially as modern trade grows.","Akshay S. Jagdale - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. That's helpful, and just back to China. I may have missed some of your comments, but your Industrial business saw a slowdown, and that was related to quick serve and partly China. Is that right?","Alan D. Wilson","That's correct.","Akshay S. Jagdale - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","So -- but your Consumer business in China did pretty well, right?","Alan D. Wilson","Yes.","Gordon M. Stetz","That is correct, yes.","Akshay S. Jagdale - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","So overall, I mean, we saw last couple of quarters the Industrial business was really hitting on all cylinders. Is there any trade-off between sort of Away From Home and at home going on in your opinion in terms of consumer spending?","Alan D. Wilson","I'm not sure I would draw necessarily that trend at this point. It's something that we watch, but I don't know that we've seen a measurable enough impact to really say that at this point. I think it's more the internal work that our teams are doing in the Consumer business there.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The next question is from the line of Robert Moskow of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just curious about the comment about reinvesting into advertising. It sounds like you want to reinvest a little bit more than the $15 million that you targeted for the year. But for the incremental dollar of reinvestment, Alan, would you -- is that the best place to put it, or is it in India or Poland? And are there places to put it in those 2 markets? If you had the incremental dollar to put it in there, what kind of activities would you put it in, in those 2 markets?","Alan D. Wilson","Well, for short-term investments, media, either whether -- either digital TV or TV or where we have the opportunity to spend, we'd seem to be -- we tend to be more developed in our developed markets in being able to do that.  Our programs were set, and it's easy to add more incremental in either the EMEA region or in the U.S. to -- for that to be effective. And in the smaller markets or in the newer markets, we're less positioned with programs that we can pull the trigger on, in -- on the short term. Long term, we -- long term, by the way, we are investing in Poland. We are -- we're investing in India as well. But for the short term, we tend to develop -- we tend to focus more on our developed markets.","Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, I think I get that.  And then a follow-up. Your guidance says that because of the tough global environment, you want to be a little more cautious in your guidance here, I guess. But your organic sales here have been outstanding all year with -- and this quarter, your volume mix would have been up 3%, pricing up 4.5%, if not for the pull-forward. So what's to be cautious about?","Gordon M. Stetz","Well, I guess, I mean, just pointing back to some of the comments we made earlier, in particular, we are up against some comparisons in the Industrial side in Asia\/Pacific that is creating some level of caution for us as we head into the fourth quarter. And again, we are still looking at a world in which we see consumer stress and uncertainty, and that always gives us a moment to pause. And then as we -- I guess I'll just point finally to the comments earlier on the potential to reinvest.","Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay.  And then, Gordon, just so we get the top line right for fourth quarter, because of the pull-forward last year, your volume mix was only up about 1%. So for fourth quarter this year, should we take the full shift and assume that you have a 2% easy comp, or I think 2% or 3% easy comp in fourth quarter on volume mix?","Gordon M. Stetz","Yes, certainly that -- the fact that it was pulled in would give us an easier comp in -- versus the prior year because of that $10 million. That would be as it relates to the U.S. consumer. The other thing that I would suggest that we need to keep in mind as well is we're going to anniversary the acquisitions. We do have continued pressure from FX, and we're starting to anniversary the price increases from last year in certain markets. So I would just -- I'd also have that in mind as well.","Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. So the pricing won't be quite as robust as it was year-to-date?","Gordon M. Stetz","That is correct. Because if you recall, part of the whole reason for that $10 million shift is we started to implement that in the fourth quarter of last year.","Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. So should we think in terms of the mix of this more volume than price in fourth quarter, or maybe even?","Gordon M. Stetz","You would certainly expect a little bit of both, but relative to prior quarters where -- or this quarter, I should say, you'd expect some more volume.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Ann Gurkin with Davenport and Company.","Ann H. Gurkin - Davenport & Company, LLC, Research Division","Just following up on the repatriation of cash. Why now? Is there a change in potential acquisitions? Or can you help me understand the timing of that?","Gordon M. Stetz","We're constantly evaluating our capital structure, Ann, and opportunities for us to improve our overall cost of capital. And as a result of that, as we evaluate and we look at our future cash needs and the current programs we have here in the U.S., we felt now is a good time to pull some of that cash back.","Ann H. Gurkin - Davenport & Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. As we think about next year, can you comment on expectations for input cost, commodity cost, anything we should watch out for?","Alan D. Wilson","Yes, we certainly expect commodity cost to be up, and we're putting our budgets together now, so it's kind of early, but we would expect something in the low single-digits in terms of cost of goods inflation.","Ann H. Gurkin - Davenport & Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay, great.  And then third, I'm just curious, consumer behavior in the U.S., are you seeing any changes in impulse purchases, any change in consumer behavior?","Alan D. Wilson","I wouldn't say anything dramatic. I mean, we saw the real short-term issue in the first part of the year, but I don't think we're seeing any major trend changes at all.","Operator","Our next question is from Chuck Cerankosky with Northcoast Capital -- actually, Northcoast Research.","Charles Edward Cerankosky - Northcoast Research","Somebody just asked about the inflation outlook for COGS, but any other thoughts about the volatility of raw material product supplies over the next couple of quarters?","Alan D. Wilson","We're watching that all the time, because, as you know, we're sourcing from some potentially volatile areas of the world. We don't see anything that would suggest that we're going to have major supply disruption. But we're always managing that and staying -- trying to stay ahead of that, as we always do, with our global sourcing team. So we make decisions on bringing in more inventory when we expect something to happen or we expect a weather event that may cause some change in yield. So we're always monitoring that. But we don't see anything immediately that's going to be a major impact.","Charles Edward Cerankosky - Northcoast Research","And, Gordon, the press release mentioned a reduced investment in working capital this quarter versus a year ago, but your inventories are still at a strategically built-up level, I would gather, the $628 million.","Gordon M. Stetz","Yes, clearly last year, we were building inventory for, as you recall, 2 primary reasons. One was the impact of price on the purchase of raw materials and the other was a strategic inventory build as well. We don't reveal specifically our position, but we still have a view on that. And as a result, we do carry some strategic inventory. But that, you build and then you maintain or you roll a little off or you add a little bit to it, so year-on-year, the growth rate is not as dramatic, obviously. And if you look at the increase of the inventory versus prior year, about half of it, after you adjust for FX, is going to be related to the acquisitions we did in the fourth quarter of last year.  And the rest of it would be price and some -- what's left of whatever the strategic inventory build was.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Andrew Lazar of Barclays Capital.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I just wanted to ask a quick question about the frozen space. It's an area overall that's been the last couple of years, right, a pretty rough place, it's a pretty fragmented space. It's been pretty price-competitive. And again, I'm talking about broadly speaking, right, across sort of the frozen space. But you've had some -- obviously, you've come up with some interesting entries here of late, obviously, in some of the key niches in which you operate. So I'm just trying to get a sense of what you see is the opportunity there, at least for you, because that seems to buck the trend a little bit of the broader trends we've seen in this space overall.","Alan D. Wilson","Yes, what we're trying to do is deliver the core products that we -- that makes sense for us in a frozen format that makes -- that gives the consumers convenience and value. We're not trying to be 10-for-10s on frozen lasagna or anything like that. We're really niche-focused on the specialty items that we have, like Thai Kitchen and Zatarain\u2019s, that we believe we can make a difference in. So by staying focused that way, we're kind of going against those trends. We recognize we have to continue to innovate and bring new products and keep that fresh. But that's our strategy in frozen. It's not to be a 30% supplier or a 30% share. It's really to augment those regional businesses that we have.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And as you see it, in those sort of sub-segments of sort of the frozen space, if we were to look at the data that we have access to, I assume we'd see growth rates and whatnot that look, I guess, perhaps very different than one would see if you just looked at the overall, the broader frozen entr\u00e9e category or something like that. Is that a fair statement?","Alan D. Wilson","That's correct. And just to put it in perspective, our size in frozen would probably be a rounding error in a lot of those big companies. It's a pretty small business. It's good for us, it's great for Zatarain\u2019s, but it's pretty small relative to the overall category.","Operator","Our next question is a follow-up from the line of Thilo Wrede of Jefferies & Company.","Thilo Wrede - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Yes, I just had one quick follow-up. I think in the press release and also in your prepared remarks, you talked about the innovation in Europe and how that will help to counter the negative economic trends there. Does that mean that the innovation is geared more towards value products, and if that's the case, what impact would that have on margin?","Alan D. Wilson","No, it's actually a combination of things. It's -- we've got a pretty good stable of dessert aid [ph] products with Vahin\u00e9 in France, and then a lot of what we're doing both in France and the U.K. is launching against some of our global platform. So we launched, for instance, Grill Mates in the U.K. We have launched Recipe Inspirations across Europe and Bag 'n Season across Europe. So it really is bringing our product platforms much actually less value focus than product innovation -- or than -- it's more about product innovation than it is about value in those markets. And we still have the value items that we are advertising, but it's more around the value of the cost of the meal as opposed to we're going to try to sell stuff really, really cheap.","Thilo Wrede - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","So in a difficult economic environment, the approach is still if you have the product on the shelf, it should sell and you don't need to do anything in particular to push these product?","Alan D. Wilson","We still have a level of promotional activity, and we have been promoting, especially behind our recipe mix, our dry seasoning mix items in those markets. But our product innovation isn't necessarily geared in -- to value.","Operator","Our final question is from the line of Jonathan Feeney of Janney Montgomery Scott.","Jonathan P. Feeney - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","I just had a detailed follow-up about -- to the Asia\/Pacific Industrial business. And you're getting a lot of questions about that. I just -- could you refresh my memory or our memory about how the product actually works, how the revenue actually works? Do you -- yes, I mean, I saw the press release about the sort of the slowdown of the promotion of certain items by a customer, but do you get paid as products ship, typically, in -- even in an overseas Industrial business where there might some inventory taken on by the customer? What's the lag from the time people are eating a delicious McCormick-enhanced food service product to the time it hits McCormick's revenue?","Alan D. Wilson","Our revenue cycle is pretty much we bill it as we ship it. So it's not necessarily the way it's really seen [ph].  It's pretty much the same that we do around the world.  So if there is -- but also the use-up on the kinds of products. Our Industrial business in Asia is predominantly a quick-service restaurant condiment or breading business. And so as we ship it, it gets used up pretty quickly in the restaurants.","Jonathan P. Feeney - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Okay, and then so there's not really -- there doesn't really tend to be a big customer inventory issue?","Alan D. Wilson","No, I don't think so at all. I mean, the only place that could even happen is where we're shipping, for instance, a bread or to a chicken supplier that could end up in inventory there. But from our revenue standpoint, as we ship it, we would bill it.","Gordon M. Stetz","And these tend to be our higher-turn items in our portfolio.","Alan D. Wilson","Okay. Great. I want to thank everybody for your questions and for participating in today's call. McCormick has a great portfolio of products across our business segments, and we've got operations around the world that bring our passion to flavor to customers and consumers globally. In a difficult environment, we have a strategy that's achieving growth and building value for our shareholders.","Joyce L. Brooks","Thank you, Alan.

This is Kasey Jenkins, Vice President of McCormick Investor Relations. Thank you for joining today's fourth quarter earnings call. To accompany this call, we posted a set of slides at ir.mccormick.com. [Operator Instructions]. We'll begin with remarks from Lawrence Kurzius, Chairman, President and CEO; and Mike Smith, Executive Vice President and CFO.","During our remarks, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. These include information in constant currency as well as adjusted gross profit, adjusted gross profit margin, adjusted operating income, adjusted income tax rate and adjusted earnings per share that exclude the impact of transaction and integration expenses related to the acquisition of our Frank's and French's brands, special charges and, for 2018, the net nonrecurring income tax benefit associated with the December 2017 U.S. tax reform legislation, which we refer to as the U.S. tax act.

As seen on Slide 2, our forward-looking statement also provides information on risk factors that could affect our financial results.","It is now my pleasure to turn the discussion over to Lawrence.","Lawrence Kurzius","Thank you, Kasey. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. Starting on Slide 4. Our fourth quarter results completed another year of record financial performance, both from our underlying business and the incremental impact of our acquired Frank's and French's brands. We continue to drive growth, and in 2018, we delivered double-digit sales, operating profit and earnings per share growth. We expanded operating margin while also making significant investments to drive continued growth. ","We delivered substantial cost savings and our seventh consecutive year of record cash flow. We achieved our year 1 expectations from the acquisition of our Frank's and French's brands. Our sales growth and focus on profit realization drove strong financial results across both our consumer and flavor solutions segment and reflects the successful execution of our strategies and the engagement of our employees around the world. We have a broad and advantaged global flavor portfolio, as seen on Slide 5, which we are continuing to grow. No matter where or what you choose to eat or drink, you're probably enjoying something flavored by McCormick every day. This morning, you'll hear about our 2018 accomplishments, which were driven by successes across the portfolio. ","Our investments in new products, brand marketing, capabilities and infrastructure continue to drive growth across our categories. In our consumer segment, we had strong U.S. consumption growth, and our Asia Pacific region had another year of outstanding growth. In our flavor solutions segment, we continued to win with customers, driving base business and new product growth. We also continued our progress on expanding our portfolio with flavor growth while pruning some low-margin ingredient business.","We have a full year of our Frank's and French's brands impacting our business not only in retail condiments and sauces and branded foodservice but now in other categories as well with our Frank's expansion beyond liquids. Growth in these brands accelerated over the course of the year, and we're excited about their trajectory.","Overall, we are confident that the breadth and reach of our portfolio continues to position us to fully meet the demand for flavor around the world and grow our business. Heading into 2019, I'm confident our momentum will continue.","This morning, I will begin with our fourth quarter results, reflect on our 2018 achievements and then share with you some of our 2019 business plan. After that, I will turn it over to Mike, who will go through more depth on the quarter-end results and the details of our 2019 guidance. ","Let's start with our fourth quarter results on Slide 6. Starting with our top line. Versus the year-ago period, we grew sales 1% for the total company, including a 1% unfavorable impact from currency. In constant currency, we grew sales 2%, with all regions in both segments contributing to the increase. Despite significant trade inventory reductions in the U.S., sales growth was driven by brand marketing support, expanded distribution, new products and pricing. ","In our consumer segment, we grew our constant-currency sales 2% in the fourth quarter. In the Americas, we grew 1%, driven by pricing. We believe we substantially under-shipped consumer consumption due to trade inventory reductions. We estimate this resulted in the negative 3% impact to the Americas growth rate for the quarter. A portion of this reduction was due to a change in a large retailer's replenishment system, which caused supply chain disruption in November. We continue to work collaboratively with this retailer to restock their stores. ","Overall, with this customer as well as some other retailers, the trade inventory reductions resulted in significant out-of-stock situations on high-margin quality items, therefore negatively impacting our fourth quarter adjusted operating income. Despite these out-of-stocks, our IRI data shows U.S. prices in seasoning scanner sales through multi outlets grew approximately 3% for both the category and McCormick branded, supported by strong holiday advertising and merchandising execution and reflects improving share trends. Additionally, we had strong growth in unmeasured channels, including club, e-commerce and Hispanic retail chains.","We also had strong consumption growth in other parts of our U.S. branded portfolio, and combined with spices and seasonings, we achieved our best fourth quarter consumption performance of the last 5 years. Our fourth quarter IRI data shows total U.S. branded measured consumption, excluding Frank's and French's, grew 4%. And we estimate, including unmeasured channels, total consumption grew 5%.","We're seeing accelerated consumption trends driven by strong marketing and merchandising as well as new distribution. McCormick branded dry recipe mixes, Stubb's and Kitchen Basics stocks and broths all had high single-digit consumption growth, with dry recipe mixes and Stubb's outpacing their respective categories and Kitchen Basic growing in line with its category.","We're also seeing accelerating trends for Frank's RedHot sauce and French's since we acquired these brands. During the fourth quarter, our IRI data shows Frank's consumption grew 9%, outpacing its category. We continued our sequential improvement on French's mustard. Mustard volume consumption grew in the quarter, and total dollar consumption growth was aligned with the category. This was the best performance for both Frank's and French's mustard since the acquisition.","In Europe, Middle East and Africa, the EMEA region, constant-currency consumer sales growth was driven by new products, an increase in brand marketing support and continued momentum in France. And in the Asia Pacific region, our consumer segment momentum continued with double-digit constant-currency growth and increases across all categories and channels. Fourth quarter constant-currency sales growth was the best sales performance in both regions for the year.","Turning now to the flavor solutions segment. We grew sales 3% in constant currency in the fourth quarter, with all 3 regions benefiting from higher volume. In the Americas, we grew in on-trend areas, such as snack seasonings and savory flavors. We're continuing to work with our customers, particularly those experiencing several historic challenges to provide flavor solutions that deliver clean label and better-for-you attributes. Across all regions, we grew with quick service restaurants, driven by both new customers and new products as well as existing business. And as we continue to refine and optimize our portfolio, the fourth quarter as well as the full year was impacted by the exit of lower-margin business. ","Our fourth quarter adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share results had a significant negative impact from the trade inventory reductions I've mentioned a moment ago. At the bottom line, our fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.67 compared to $1.54 in the fourth quarter of 2017. This increase of 8% was driven primarily by favorable adjusted income tax rate and included an unfavorable impact from currency.","Moving from our fourth quarter results. I'm pleased to share our performance for the full fiscal year, starting with our strong financial results, as seen on Slide 7. We drove 11% constant-currency sales growth, with the incremental sales from our acquired Frank's and French's brands contributing 8% of this growth. Our underlying base growth increased 3%, driven by new products, brand marketing investments, expanded distributions and pricing actions to offset material cost increases. ","Our consumer segment grew sales 10% in constant currency, led by the Frank's and French's acquisition impact and underlying base growth driven by the U.S. and China. Constant-currency sales growth in our flavor solutions segment was 11%, also led by incremental sales from Frank's and French's. All 3 regions delivered flavor solution base growth, including our exit of some lower-margin business.","We grew constant-currency adjusted operating income 19%, driven by higher sales and 180 basis points adjusted gross margin expansion from CCI-led savings and our portfolio shift. This increase, combined with a lower adjusted effective tax rate and partially offset by higher interest expense and shares outstanding, drove a 17% increase in adjusted earnings per share to $4.97 for fiscal 2018. This increase includes the impact of favorable currency exchange rates versus last year.","With higher sales, CCI and our portfolio shift, we increased our adjusted operating margin to 17.4%, which was a 110 basis point expansion from last year. We expanded adjusted operating margin in both of our segments, hitting record highs in each, while also making investments to drive continued growth.","We reached a record $118 million of annual cost savings, led by our CCI program, our fuel for growth, and are well on our way toward exceeding our full year $400 million goal, having realized $344 million over the past three years. 2018 was the seventh consecutive year of record cash flow from operations, ending the year at $821 million. We're making great progress with our working capital improvement and expect the programs we have put in place will continue the momentum into 2019. At year-end, our Board of Directors announced a 10% increase in the quarterly dividend, marking our 33rd consecutive year of dividend increases. We have paid dividends every year since 1925 and are proud to be a dividend aristocrat.","Now I'd like to comment on some of our 2018 achievements beyond our financial performance. We've successfully completed the integration of our Frank's and French's acquisition and celebrated the acquisition's 1-year anniversary. We created value, achieved synergies and are obtaining results according to our acquisition plan. Importantly, we have achieved year 1 sales and earnings per share accretion expectations. By strengthening distribution, category management, effective brand marketing investments and innovation, we are successfully growing Frank's and French's. As Mike will mention in more detail, we've also made great progress in paying down our acquisition debt and finished the year ahead of our debt-to-EBITDA target.","A key driver of sales growth was our brand marketing, which was up 18% over 2017. Our leadership in digital was rewarded again in 2018 with recognition as the Top 3 brand by Gartner L2 research on their Digital IQ Index. This marked our fifth consecutive year in the top 5 ranking of over 100 food and beverage brands on the effectiveness of our website, digital, social media and e-commerce.","Our investments in constant development, resources to support acceleration as well as programs and items tailored to the e-commerce channel are paying off. We grew local e-commerce sales 41%, driven by strong omnichannel performance. In the second half of 2018, we began increasing the level of our technology investments as we modernize our information technology systems around the world to a single global platform, including starting the replacement process of our existing ERP system. This will allow us to align our global operating model with end-to-end processes, simplify our work, better manage risks and, importantly, enable growth.","In 2018, we continued to invest further on our global footprint by increasing our capacity to support our growth in the Asia Pacific zone. We opened a new regional manufacturing facility in Thailand to expand both production capacity and capability to support both segments' growth plans in Southeast Asia. We continued progressing on our global programs to upgrade to modern work environments. In the second half of 2018, we opened a new Lean-certified global headquarters in Hunt Valley, Maryland, which enabled us to bring nearly 1,000 employees from 4 different Maryland-based office buildings into one location. The new headquarters incorporates open space that's technology-enabled and accommodates the way employees want to work today and into the future. It fosters greater collaboration and engagement and helps us attract and retain the best talent.","And finally, we're making measurable progress toward our 2025 sustainability goals. And in addition, we committed that by 2025, 100% of our plastic packaging will be reusable, recyclable or able to be repurposed. We're being recognized for our efforts in sustainability. Just two days ago, at the 2019 Davos World Economic Forum, McCormick was named by Corporate Knights in their 2019 Global 100 Most Sustainable Corporations index, ranking us #1 in food products industry for the third consecutive year and #13 overall. And we were included on Barron's inaugural 100 Most Sustainable Companies list in 2018. Additionally, we are a DiversityInc Top 50 company for the second consecutive year, which is a testament to our emphasis on embracing and leveraging diversity and inclusion globally. ","Mike will go over our 2019 guidance in a few moments, but I'd like to mention a few highlights related to our sales growth plan and provide some summary comments on Slide 10. As the foundation of our sales growth rate is the rising global consumer demand for great taste and healthy eating, consumers have an increased interest in creating flavor experiences with bold, rich authentic flavors while also demanding convenience. Additionally, consumers are focused on fresh, natural and recognizable ingredients with greater transparency around the sourcing and quality of food. Flavor continues to be an advantaged global category, and our products inspire flavor exploration and are the essential complement to fresh real food. We deliver flavor across all markets and through all channels and are aligned with the consumers' demand for flavor, convenience, health and sustainably minded business practices. ","Our alignment with these long-term trends, our breadth and reach, combined with our execution against effective strategies, positions us well to meet increased consumer demand both through our products and through our customers' products and drive sales growth. In 2019, we'll continue to differentiate our brand, build capabilities and make investments for growth that will continue to move McCormick forward. Across both segments, we have confidence in our ability to drive sales through strong brand marketing programs, continued focus on customer intimacy, our opportunities to expand distribution and, of course, new products.","New products are integral to our sales growth. In 2018, 8% of our sales were from product launches in the last 3 years. In 2019, we expect new product sales growth to be even higher because, in 2018, we were focused on integrating and growing Frank's and French's. In our consumer segment, new product innovation is an important way to differentiate our brand and stay relevant with the consumers. We have a robust global pipeline of new product launches in 2019 that renovate brand, inspire flavor exploration and experimentation and meet the demand for convenience, health and transparency.","And in our flavor solutions segment, we will continue to capitalize on our culinary foundation and customer collaboration, both of which differentiates us with customers. This unique combination allows us to continue our new product momentum as our customers continue to move their portfolios to on-trend flavors and more natural and better-for-you products while ensuring that taste is not compromised. We're looking forward to sharing more details regarding our 2019 growth plans and market dynamics in just a few weeks at CAGNY.","To summarize, on Slide 11, before turning it over to Mike, we achieved top-tier financial results in 2018, delivered by both strong underlying business performance and the incremental impact of our acquisition of the Frank's and French's brands that are driving strong momentum in sales growth. In the consumer segment, we finished the year with strong total U.S. consumption, and fourth quarter growth in our EMEA and APZ regions were the highest of the year. ","In our flavor solutions segment, we continue to grow through winning with customers on new products and existing business. We are balancing our resources and efforts to grow sales with our work to lower cost, build fuel for growth and higher margins. We have a solid foundation. And in an environment that continues to be dynamic and fast paced, we are ensuring we remain agile, relevant and focused on long-term sustainable growth. ","Our experienced leaders and employees are executing against our strategies, which are designed to build long-term value for our shareholders, and with our 2018 results, they have again proven to be effective. We are confident this effectiveness will continue in 2019. ","I want to recognize McCormick employees around the globe and thank them for their efforts and engagement, which drive our momentum and make us succeed. Looking forward, with this engagement and our effective strategies and momentum, we are well positioned to achieve continued growth in 2019.","Thank you for your attention. And it is now my pleasure to turn it over to Mike for additional remarks on our 2018 financial results and the details on our 2019 guidance. Mike?","Michael Smith","Thanks, Lawrence, and good morning, everyone. I will now comment on our fourth quarter performance and full year results as well as providing more detail on our 2019 outlook. Starting on Slide 13. During the fourth quarter, we grew sales 2% in constant currency. Both our consumer and flavor solutions segments delivered top line constant-currency growth in each of our 3 regions. The consumer segment grew sales 2% in constant currency. This growth was driven by all 3 regions, with strong growth in Asia Pacific and EMEA.","On Slide 14, consumer segment sales in the Americas rose 1% in constant currency versus the fourth quarter of 2017. This increase was driven by pricing actions. Volume growth was flat due to trade inventory reductions, as mentioned by Lawrence. In EMEA, constant-currency consumer sales were up 3% from a year ago, primarily driven -- due to broad-based volume and product mix growth, driven by brand marketing support as well as new products in the U.K. and continued momentum in the organic product line in France. Partially offsetting this growth was the pricing impact of trade promotional activities related to new products. We grew consumer sales in the Asia Pacific region 10% in constant currency, led by China growth, with strength in new World Flavor sauces, ketchup, chicken bouillon as well as herbs and spices.","Turning to our flavor solutions segment and Slide 17. We grew fourth quarter constant-currency sales 3%, which was attributable to broad-based growth across all regions. In the Americas, flavor solutions constant-currency sales increased 2%, driven by increased sales to quick service restaurants and continued flavors momentum. This was partially offset by the elimination of some low-margin business as well as the global realignment of a major customer sales from the Americas to EMEA. In EMEA, we grew flavor solutions sales 5% in constant currency. This increase was primarily driven by pricing as well as the previously mentioned global realignment of a major customer's sales from the Americas to EMEA. In the Asia Pacific region, flavor solutions sales grew 3% in constant currency as higher sales to quick service restaurants were partially driven by the timing of our promotional activity.","Across both segments, adjusted operating income, which excludes the transaction and integration costs related to the acquisition of our Frank's and French's brands and special charges, declined versus the fourth quarter of last year by 3%, which included a 1% unfavorable impact of currency. In the consumer segment, adjusted operating income declined 3% to $228 million, which in constant currency was a 2% decline. The flavor solutions segment was also down 3% to $70 million, and in constant currency, that was a 1% decrease. The decline in both segments was partially due to unfavorable product mix, higher freight costs and investments to drive future growth.","In the consumer segment, the unfavorable mix was primarily driven, as Lawrence mentioned earlier, by lower sales of high-margin holiday items due to trade inventory reductions. Our investments to drive future growth included an increase in brand marketing of 7% or $7 million versus the fourth quarter of last year, and we began the process to modernize our information technology systems, including the replacement of our ERP system. Additionally, the flavor solutions segment had an unfavorable transactional impact of foreign currency exchange rates.","For the fiscal year, the increase in adjusted operating income in constant currency was 19%, and we expanded adjusted operating income margin 110 basis points, with both segments contributing to the growth. The consumer segment grew constant-currency adjusted operating income 13% while increasing our brand marketing and investments by 18%. The flavor solutions segment grew constant-currency adjusted operating income 34% versus 2017. Our flavor solutions strategy to migrate our portfolio to more value-added categories is evident in these results. ","The shift in our portfolio, combined with CCI, has increased flavor solutions adjusted operating margin to 14.2%, an expansion of 230 basis points in 2018. As seen on Slide 22, in this fourth quarter, adjusted gross profit margin, which excludes transaction and integration expenses, declined 30 basis points versus the year-ago period, driven by unfavorable product mix, partially offset by CCI-led cost savings. We ended the full year with a 180 basis point increase, driven by the accretion impact from the addition of the Frank's and French's portfolio as well as CCI-led cost savings and favorable product mix across the core business.","Our selling, general and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales increased by 40 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2017. Leverage from sales growth and CCI-led cost savings was more than offset by increases in both brand marketing and freight expense as well as spending related to our information systems modernization. Below the operating income line, other income increased $7 million. The increase in other income was driven due to a gain on the sale of a building we vacated as part of the office consolidation into our new global headquarters, which Lawrence mentioned earlier. The expenses we incurred related to the office consolidation reduced operating income for the year by approximately $4 million.","Turning to income taxes on Slide 23. Our fourth quarter adjusted effective tax rate was 19%, which reflects the favorable impact from a lower U.S. corporate tax rate as compared to 26.2% in the year ago period. Our fourth quarter adjusted rate was lower than anticipated due to the favorable impact of discrete items, principally a higher level of stock option exercises. For the full year, our adjusted tax rate was 19.6% compared to 26.1% in fiscal 2017.","Income from unconsolidated operations for both the fourth quarter of 2018 and the full year was comparable to the respective year-ago periods. For 2019, we expect a low single-digit increase in our income from unconsolidated operations. At the bottom line, as shown on line -- on Slide 25, fourth quarter 2018 adjusted earnings per share was $1.67, up 8% from $1.54 for the year-ago period, mainly due to a favorable adjusted income tax rate. This increase included an unfavorable impact from currency.","On Slide 26, we summarized highlights for cash flow and the year-end balance sheet. Our cash flow provided from operations ended the year at a record high of $821 million compared to $815 million in 2017. For the fiscal year, our cash conversion cycle was significantly better than the year-ago period, down 21 days, as we executed against programs to achieve working capital reductions, such as extending payment programs with our suppliers and inventory management programs. We returned a portion of this cash flow to our shareholders through dividends. ","Additionally, we reduced our acquisition debt in the fourth quarter by $209 million, which brings our total acquisition debt reduction in the fiscal year to $545 million. And we have now paid down over 50% of the term notes related to the acquisition. We finished the year with a debt-to-adjusted-EBITDA ratio of 4x, which was ahead of our target. This strong progress positions us well to achieve our 3x target by the end of 2020. Our capital expenditures were $169 million in 2018 and included the completion of our regional manufacturing facility in Thailand and spending related to our new global headquarters. In 2019, we expect our capital expenditures to be higher than 2018 to support our investments to drive growth, particularly the transition of our ERP platform. We expect 2019 to be another year of strong cash flow, driven by profit and working capital initiatives, and our priority is to continue to have a balanced use of cash, making investments to drive growth, returning a significant portion to our shareholders through dividends and to pay down debt.","Let's now move to our current financial outlook for 2019 on Slide 27. We are well positioned for another year of solid performance with our broad and advantaged flavor portfolio, effective growth strategies and focus on profit realization. As Lawrence mentioned, we continue to expect solid constant-currency growth for fiscal year 2019. We estimate, based on prevailing rates, a 2 percentage point unfavorable impact from currency rates on net sales, adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share. We expect the impact of unfavorable currency will be greater in the first half of the year than in the second half.","At the top line, we expect to grow sales 1% to 3%, which in constant currency is a 3% to 5% projected growth rate. This increase will be entirely organic growth, with no incremental impact from acquisitions. The growth will be driven primarily by higher volume and product mix as well as the impact of pricing to offset an anticipated low single-digit cost increase.","Our 2019 adjusted gross profit margin is projected to be 25 to 75 basis points higher than 2018, in part driven by our CCI-led cost savings. We expect to increase adjusted operating income 7% to 9% from $942 million in 2018, which in constant currency is a 9% to 11% projected growth rate and reflects our continued focus on profit realization. Our cost-savings target is approximately $110 million, and we expect brand marketing to be comparable to 2018.","Our 2019 adjusted effective income tax rate is projected to approximate 22% based upon our estimated mix of earnings by country, in addition to our state tax rates. This projection is lower than our underlying effective tax rate of 24% due to the favorable impact of a discrete tax item which occurred during the first quarter of 2019 related to our entity structure. Our full year 22% outlook versus our 2018 adjusted effective tax rate of 19.6% is approximately a 300 basis point headwind to our 2019 adjusted earnings per share growth.","Our guidance range for adjusted earnings per share in 2019 is $5.17 to $5.27. This compares to $4.97 of adjusted earnings per share in 2018 and represents a 4% to 6% increase or 6% to 8% in constant currency. This increase includes the expected significant tax headwind I just mentioned. In summary, we are projecting solid growth in our 2019 constant-currency outlook for sales, adjusted operating profit and adjusted earnings per share, following record double-digit performance across each objective in 2018.","I'd like to let you know that we will be adopting 2 new accounting standards in the first quarter of 2019 on a retrospective basis. With the adoption of these 2 standards, we expect no impact to net income and only a geography shift between income statement line items. We also do not anticipate these adoptions would materially impact growth rates or other expectations we provided in our 2019 financial outlook. This morning, we have provided summary points regarding this topic in the appendix of our presentation, and further discussion of these changes will be included in the 10-K we file this evening.","On a final note related to our guidance, turning to Slide 28, I want to discuss our performance versus our constant-currency long-term financial objectives. We evaluate our performance against our long-term objectives every several years, partially because of the variability which can occur year-to-year related to acquisition activity. As a reminder, we have an objective to grow sales 4% to 6%, with base business, new products and acquisitions each contributing 1\/3. So excluding 1\/3 from acquisitions, our growth expectations will be to grow sales approximately 3% to 4%.","Additionally, our objective is to grow adjusted operating income 7% to 9%. Then, by using leverage gained through our capital deployment activities, including our share repurchase program, our objective is to grow adjusted earnings per share 9% to 11%. As we have previously stated, after making our Frank's and French's acquisition, we have curtailed acquisition activity and our share buyback program as we delever and therefore use our cash flow to pay down debt. As mentioned earlier, we are making significant progress to leveraging. And in line with our original plan, our acquisition activity and buyback program will remain curtailed in 2019.","From a sales perspective, our 2019 guidance of 3% to 5% is in line with our long-term growth objectives without incremental acquisition growth. Our adjusted operating income guidance is 9% to 11%, which is actually above our long-term growth objectives. Despite these strong operating expectations, the adjusted effective income tax rate increase I mentioned before is a significant headwind to our 2019 adjusted earnings per share growth.","Looking at our performance over a 4-year period, using the 2019 guidance I've just reviewed, our compounded annual growth rates from 2015, from before the Frank's and French's acquisition, to 2019, the first full year these brands are in our base, are projected to exceed our long-term goals for each objective, even including the negative effect of currency experienced during this period. As Lawrence mentioned, our foundation is strong, our strategy is effective, and we are generating results in line with our objectives.","I'd like to now turn it back to Lawrence for some additional remarks before we move to your questions.","Lawrence Kurzius","Thank you, Mike. Now that Mike has shared our financial results and outlook in more detail, I would like to recap the key takeaways, as seen on Slide 29. We delivered another year of record results in 2018. Despite trade inventory reductions, we achieved strong organic sales growth for the year. We significantly grew adjusted operating income while also increasing brand marketing and achieved Frank's and French's results in line with our plans. We ended 2018 with the strongest consumption trend in years in our consumer business and solid growth in every region for flavor solutions. Our 2019 constant-currency outlook reflects strong operating performance, driven by our solid foundation and continued momentum.","Our earnings per share growth was robust despite a significant tax headwind, and we're confident that 2019 will be another successful year and we will create additional value. And importantly, we're continuing to deliver differentiated results while significantly investing for growth to build the McCormick of the future. And we'll share more about these investments at CAGNY in a few weeks.","Now let's turn to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Andrew Lazar with Barclays.","Andrew Lazar","I guess, my -- first, I'm looking at -- was the replenishment issue that you talked about at a key customer -- or customers, were those really just in McCormick's category or categories? Or is this something you think we'll hear more about from peers as we go forward? And then a 3% headwind to Americas consumer that you mentioned is obviously less of a headwind to the overall business. It still seems like maybe organic sales growth, even excluding that, might have come in a little short of where like consensus was for organic sales growth in the quarter. So I wonder if there were any additional areas that came in differently around the top line than maybe you anticipated that are worth mentioning.","Lawrence Kurzius","Thanks, Andrew. I'm going to start with the first part of that question, the replenishment issue. There's been a general trend for all of our customers to be working their inventories lower, as you know, and others have reported on it. The particular issues that impacted us in the fourth quarter were -- really had 2 parts to it. The first part was the move by a key customer as well -- actually, a handful of key customers to reduce their inventory levels. Overall, it is odd timing for them to do this for our category, but it may have made sense for them across their broader store. And for us, of course, the fourth quarter is the real peak. And I would expect you to hear from others saying similar things regarding that portion of the trade reduction, and I believe, actually, some of our peers have already commented on this in calls, those who have come ahead of us. ","There was a part, though, that was unique to us, and that is there was a large customer, who's name I'm not going to use, that had change in their internal store replenishment system. This was actually switched on in error by them. And so that had a big impact in that their warehouses and their stores did not recognize each other's order numbers, and as a result, stores were not replenished. That's going to be a change that is unique to us. This customer is making that transition broadly, but just for our category, it was scheduled for much later next year. We would have run all the beta tests and so on, on it and would have had a different experience if it had been done in a planful way. And again, it was an error, internal hit, at the customer, and we are still working through this in a sense that for every order, we have to do, literally, a workaround to get the stores restocked. So that part is unique to us. We've highlighted this as a 3% headwind overall to our business in the -- to our Americas business in the quarter. We're not rounding up to get to that number. We have a pretty good handle on our ability to quantify it. We -- it was holiday items, it was specific customers, and we really know what it was. Mike, do you want to go further on that?","Michael Smith","I think you got it.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Robert Moskow with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Robert Moskow","I guess I have two questions. The 9% to 11% constant-currency EBIT growth target for 2019 now sounds rather aggressive given that -- what's demonstrated here in fourth quarter, is that you ended up vulnerable to a lot of the trends that are happening across the food space. You had inventory reductions. You mentioned some freight costs. And I just want to know, how do you get from the sales guide to the EBIT guide? I know you have your normal cost-savings programs. But you also mentioned mix was a headwind in fourth quarter. Why wouldn't it be a headwind in 2019? And then I have a follow-up.","Michael Smith","Rob, this is Mike. I'll start this one. Let's talk about fourth quarter first because you talked about -- we talked about product mix in the fourth quarter. A significant portion of that is really related to the trade inventory issues. These are our highest margin holiday items, so that was a significant hit to our fourth quarter operating profit. We also did take the opportunity in the fourth quarter -- we -- just like we did in the third quarter, we had some benefits from stock options, which is below the operating profit line. So some of those savings, we invested those in brand marketing, up 7%. We took the opportunity to start investing in our IT refreshment program. So if you look at 2019, though, you're going from the 3% to 5% down to 9% to 11%. We've talked about keeping brand marketing flat. We took the opportunity, as I said, in the fourth quarter to really invest and drive back consumption in the fourth quarter, got it to a level we feel comfortable expanding in 2019. While we're going to get more effective and we're going to have more working media in 2019, that's going to give us about 100 basis points right there, keeping that flat. ","We're also -- we're getting more synergies from the Frank's and French's, the second year of that. So we're going to ramp from last year additional Frank's and French's synergies. Our CCI focus really is -- we look at both cost of goods sold and SG&A. We're really leaning in there also. And some of the things that happened in the fourth quarter, we talked about the move into the new building, we're not going to have those costs next year. So it's a variety of things that aren't going to happen in 2019 that we feel very strongly about giving this guidance.","Robert Moskow","Okay. And then my follow-up is -- I did an inventory report on the broader group back in October, and McCormick popped up as the company that had been shipping at a growth rate that was well above the Nielsen-measured consumption for quite a while. You had called out that there are other channels that are not measured by Nielsen, so that was a big portion of the disconnect. And you also pointed out that you always do a conservative job of assuming inventory reductions during the course of the year. So I guess, given what happened here in fourth, like how much comfort do you have that you have good visibility of how much inventory is really at the trade and that you head into 2019 and that this will truly prove episodic? Or have you assumed another inventory burn again in 2019?","Lawrence Kurzius","Sure, Rob. I'm going to take this to start. And Mike, join me if I miss anything here on this. But this was an extraordinary situation. It's not the normal pattern that we've experienced. Normally, we see a drawdown in Q1, our Q1 that coincides with a lot of our customers' end of year, and then relative flatness for the rest of the year. This impact that happened in fourth quarter was really extraordinary and does not reflect a build of inventory previously. This is -- it's quite discrete with a small set of customers or one very large customer that had the biggest impact. It was devastating to their stores, their -- to the inventory. This was not an intentional move on their part. And as a result, their stores had tremendous out-of-stocks through the holiday season. And so it just -- it's hard to imagine that retailer taking inventory down further than they did because they literally ran themselves out of product. ","In terms of our looking forward, we always include, in our plans and in our sales guidance, a level of inventory of drawdown -- I shouldn't say always, but we have for the last several years. And we've included in the guidance for sales for next year further reduction in inventory across the trade, not necessarily at those customers specifically. But this timing that happened, with this -- both the size and the timing of it and of course -- and the products involved, we're surprised this happened to us at the most sensitive time of year for us, right, as we are coming to not only the peak consumption period but also the cutoff on our fiscal year. We don't get a do-over on Thanksgiving, and so this had -- really did have a big impact for us.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Alexia Howard with Bernstein.","Alexia Howard","Could I ask about the flavor solutions business? It's -- up until this quarter, it was doing really incredibly well on profit growth, top line growth. Clearly, the profits took a bit of a pause on that trajectory this time around. Was there something that happened? Did the contracts get lost or is this just lapping tougher comps from a year ago? And what's the prognosis from here? Does it step down to some sort of more normal level? Can the margins continue to expand?","Lawrence Kurzius","Alexia, I'm going to just say a word about this, and I'm going to give it to Mike. But this -- the flavor solutions business is always pretty lumpy. And so there's more volatility in the quarter-to-quarter results on that. I think if you look at the whole year, we're very pleased that we don't see any issue. We actually are quite pleased with how we've come out of the year on flavor solutions, and our outlook is as optimistic as it has been. Mike?","Michael Smith","Yes. I'd say, too, within the flavor solutions business, a couple of things had happened in the quarter. We had -- and I mentioned this on the call. We had a bit of transactional effect, some unfavorability, which impacted not -- the whole company, too, from an operating profit perspective, but hit -- because of our footprint with some of the currencies but also unfavorable product mix. In some of -- as Lawrence said, flavor solutions can be lumpy. In some of our regions, the growth was more on core products versus LTOs. LTOs generally have higher margins. So you'll have these sometimes when our customer is advertising. Something we've done for a long time is a base product that has a lower margin that might have a little bit of product mix negative. So we saw some of that this quarter, too.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ken Goldman with JPMorgan.","Kenneth Goldman","One for me. In each of the last, I think, seven years by our math, your initial guidance for your tax rate has proven a bit conservative, meaning you guided to a higher tax rate than, I guess, what you ultimately reported. Just wondering, is there any reason we should think 2019 will be different? Given history, it seems reasonable to expect your tax rate to come in below the 22% you guided to today, but just trying to get a feel for what you're thinking there this coming year.","Michael Smith","David, this is Mike. I'll take this one. We generally -- we don't -- sorry, Ken. I was saying David. Yes, we have been favorable on our tax, but a big part of that is we don't forecast discrete tax items. But if you think about this -- I'll talk about this year first before I talk about next year. I mean, before the tax act, we might have an underlying rate of 28% to 29%. And we said guidance at the beginning of this year after the tax act was about 24%, and we came in slightly below 20%, so about a 400 basis point favorability. 300 basis points of that was the stock option exercises, which, one, we don't forecast for and we don't know when it's going to happen. So there's another 100 basis points of other stuff, tax settlements, things like that, but we really don't forecast discrete tax items. ","For '19, underlying tax rate is about 24%, similar to this year. As we've kind of gone through an exhaustive process recently going through the regs that were just released by the Department of Treasury, we did some tax planning. That's why we said, look, this is a significant discrete tax item that's hitting early in the year. We're calling 22%. There could be some stock option exercises. There could be some other discrete tax items, but we want to give you at least a benchmark of what we see is there. And hopefully, it is favorable, but we believe there's some judgment there.","Kenneth Goldman","That's helpful -- no, very helpful, Mike. And my follow-up is -- you talked about low single-digit raw material cost inflation for the year. Forgive me, I don't think that includes transportation costs. And correct me if I'm wrong, but you're one of the first food companies to really provide detailed guidance for the upcoming calendar year. And I'm just curious if -- on that front, whether it's transportation, logistics, however you want to sort of define it, things that are not raw material necessarily, if you're seeing any sort of easing of pressure on that area.","Michael Smith","No, we throw it all in there. Yes, we throw it all in, yes.","Kenneth Goldman","And then, if I could ask just a quick clarification then within that just to get a better sense of transportation. Are you seeing the easing in that particular part of it?","Michael Smith","Well, we've seen -- we know '18 was a significant increase from '17. And we've had a lot of activities in North America primarily through our CCI program to mitigate the costs as we see going into 2019. But we do -- we still do see inflation there, which we've built in.","Lawrence Kurzius","We're not seeing an easing there.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs.","Adam Samuelson","Maybe a question just on the trajectory, first on organic, both in the fourth quarter and then into '19, on the Frank's and the French's business because they're now in the organic base. Just trying to make -- disaggregate the inventory trade reduction in the quarter, which clearly impacted the consumers Americas business, but would have thought that the Frank's and French's now coming into organic would have been -- would have helped your business or your perform -- reported performance more. Just help me think about how those businesses are performing on an underlying basis. It sounded like the trade reductions were more legacy McCormick items.","Lawrence Kurzius","Adam, I'm glad you asked that question because in answering a couple of the earlier questions about inventory reduction, we didn't talk about the other side of the -- of what was happening, which is that our consumption has been incredibly strong. We came out of the year with the strongest consumption performance for a fourth quarter in the last 5 years. It's one of the strongest quarters for a period of time, and that's part of what gives us optimism around 2019. The Frank's and French's items were no exception to that. So our consumer offtake as measured through scanner data on Frank's was up 9% in the quarter. Our offtake on mustard was almost flat. And if you recall, our goal that we announced when we bought this business was that we were going to drive growth on Frank's and we were going to stabilize the French's mustard, and I think we're making great progress on that. And so I think that, that consumption trajectory on both the acquired brands and also on our core business gives us confidence in the sales numbers for 2019. Mike, you wanted to comment on the inventory...","Michael Smith","Well, yes. Let me talk, too, about -- in the fourth quarter, some of that advertising investment was driving Frank's. We talked about how it was the first time we've advertised in Frank's in 7 years. We have new advertising which just dropped this week that's going to support the first quarter, a lot of new products coming in the first quarter. Frank's and French's was impacted, as Lawrence said, by the trade inventory reductions, though. And -- but we expect a strong first quarter from both brands because of the consumption we're seeing.","Adam Samuelson","Okay, that's helpful. And then just on the guidance, between the sales and margin expansion goals that you've laid out, is there any notable delineation between the consumer and the flavor solutions business and -- i.e. is the base expectation that there's faster growth in flavors or consumer, more margin expansion in one versus the other?","Michael Smith","No, we generally feel they're pretty comparable between the two.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Driscoll with Citi.","David Driscoll","I've got two questions for you. You talked about the ERP system. We're sensitive to changes in ERPs. Can you just walk us through kind of the risk points on when we need to be focused on, on the big modules and kind of when they come into play? And I think you called it out in the fourth quarter, a part of it. I don't know what's already taken place versus what has to take place on the ERP system change.","Michael Smith","Well, Dave, as you know, this is like a 2 to 3 year process. We're kind of in the early days here. So anything -- I wouldn't -- our guidance considers any expense that we're going to occur on ERP. A lot of it is capital. And we've talked about in the call we're going to have an increase in capital versus this year. Our capital this year, we had a target of $200 million. Due to a lot of timing issues, it came down to about almost $170 million. We don't see it -- we see some incremental capital investment next year, but I wouldn't ascribe a large impact. I mean, our guidance is our guidance, and it incorporates all those impacts.","David Driscoll","And let me clarify...","Lawrence Kurzius","As we get more detail, David -- I'll commit to giving you more detail. But as I said before, we're pretty early days on this, but we have made some investments in the fourth quarter to help jump start that.","David Driscoll","Yes. It wasn't really a question on the capital spending. It was a question on ERP systems and the disruption that they sometimes cause when the execution doesn't go well. There's always certain modules within these ERP systems that are far more sensitive than other modules. And I was just looking for a piece of information related to when the significant modules go into play.","Lawrence Kurzius","Well, I would say -- if I could just pick this up. So as you know, this -- it sounds like you understand exactly what's involved with these projects. So there is a long period of scoping, of code writing, of building before you get your first go-live on anything. So we're in that upfront stage of it right now. Our first go-live is not until 2020. But this year is the year when we do all of the work getting ready. And I'll just add to it that we're due for it. We did our first SAP go-live in 2002. We still are -- have done some go-lives on SAP. Even this year, it's been a long and drawn out process. What was the new system has now become the legacy system. SAP, as you know, goes out of maintenance. It becomes obsolete in 2023. We want to be ahead of the curve on getting -- migrating to the next generation of ERP and not be doing it at the last minute. ","So everybody's going to have to make this -- anybody that's on SAP is going to have to make this transition over the next several years, and we're getting started on it. We did incur some expense but we got -- in the fourth quarter and will throughout 2019. But we really won't -- we won't get to our first actual go-live until 2020. I'll add that it is our plan to move quickly. It's taken almost 20 years to roll out SAP across our whole company. We're not going to take 20 years to do the refresh, which will still be an SAP product, the SAP HANA.","David Driscoll","I like the 20-year comment. My second question relates to your flavor solutions. It's a follow-up to one of the earlier questions, but I want to think a little bit longer term. Flavor solutions margins went from about 7.5% 5, 7 years ago to over 14%, a massive increase. When I look at just the pie breakdown, your ingredients proportion of the flavor solutions is kind of small now, so I think that was the low-margin stuff that you've slowly but surely been exiting and then adding other high-margin pieces like flavors. Lawrence, what I don't get a sense on, but I get this question a lot from investors, is how much more is there to go. Can you double the size of the flavors portion of flavor solutions? And is that high enough margin to keep pushing the segment margin significantly higher over some course of time? This isn't a next-year question.","Lawrence Kurzius","I understand. This is a great long-term question, and I appreciate the opportunity to talk about something besides the inventory reduction in the fourth quarter. This is, in fact, our strategy that you just described for our flavor solutions segment. We are migrating the portfolio to more of the flavor and seasoning end. We certainly still see value in some of the customer foodservice products and condiments that we do, but away from that more commodity ingredient end of the spectrum. And we see a long runway of opportunity for enhancing our margin from this migration of our portfolio to value-added products. You see from the public company competitors who are more pure play on flavor, their margins are significantly higher to us -- than us. We aspire to move more in that direction. And I'm not sure how high up is, but it's a long way from where we are now. And there are parts in the other slices of the pie, too. For example, in condiments, there's low-margin condiments and higher margin. So obviously, we would optimize this as we go.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Growe with Stifel.","Christopher Growe","I had just two questions, if I could. So the price was a little less than I expected in the fourth quarter. I know you talked about some new products and spending around those new products. I'm sure it was more -- the factor that weighed on pricing is more promotional driven. So my question is, does -- did pricing line up with cost inflation in the fourth quarter? Do you expect that in '19? Or maybe are more new product costs going to weigh on that pricing line overall?","Michael Smith","Chris, this is Mike. I'll take that. I mean, if you look at the split by region -- and I'll focus on consumer. I mean, pricing for total consumer is only up 0.2%. But in the Americas, it was up 0.6%, and that was covering the cost of inflation, some of the pricing we took early in the year on recipe mixes; Asia Pacific, 1.5%. EMEA, where we had really strong overall sales performance from kind of the relaunch of our first choice spice line, we had obviously some trade promotional slotting fees, things like that, which is negative price. So EMEA was negative 2.2%. So that's what drove the whole consumer down. So that -- and that was a significant restage for that region. So we don't see -- we see in '19 our pricing actions ramp from last year, and anything we need to do to cover for low single-digit cost inflation, we see those covering all of it.","Lawrence Kurzius","Right. Other than the cost of new distribution, we don't see any extraordinary pressure on promotion expenses. I think it's revenue management that's been net positive for us.","Christopher Growe","And would pricing offset cost inflation in your view, from a high level, for 2019? Is that your expectation?","Lawrence Kurzius","I'm sorry, I'm not sure I got the question. Can you repeat that?","Christopher Growe","Would your price -- do you expect your price realization to offset cost inflation in 2019 from a high level, not quarter-to-quarter, that kind of thing? But do you expect that you'll be able to price to your cost inflation in 2019?","Lawrence Kurzius","Yes. We also have CCI programs, things like that, too. There's a broad basket of tools.","Christopher Growe","Okay, yes. And just one final one. In the fourth quarter, I think you had a gain on the sale of a building. You also had some costs related to moving into the new facility. Were those costs spread out over the quarters and this fourth quarter had that benefit of that gain? And I'm just curious how this applies to the comps for 2019.","Michael Smith","Generally, Chris, they were in the second half. We think our -- we moved most of the people July, August, September time frame and had the grand opening actually in October. So a lot of the expenses were second half.","Christopher Growe","And then the gain, did that more than offset the costs or...","Michael Smith","Yes, it does. We said that on the call.","Lawrence Kurzius","Yes. I think we said that on the call. It was -- between them, they net to two.","Michael Smith","Net to two, yes. The $4 million spend hurt operating expense. There is a geography difference there, obviously. The gain was below the operating profit line. All the expenses were above.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rob Dickerson with Deutsche Bank.","Robert Dickerson","I have two really quick, really different questions. The first question is just any color -- I know you don't always -- obviously, don't guide quarter-to-quarter, but just any color around kind of cadence for '19 really just with respect to organic sales trajectory sequentially and then also just the margin, right? It looks like your guidance is -- implies, call it, about 100 basis points operating profit margin. I know you said earlier in response to a question that it's not hard to get there just given -- keeping the media spend flat. But I'm curious like -- obviously, just every year as you report Q4, you're already through half of Q1. And given this holiday issue and some of the replenishment piece was -- let's say your quarter ended in November but then you also had December baked in Q1. Did some of that kind of -- did some of the replenishment issues flow through into Q1? And then is more of the margin expansion more back-half loaded just given timing of '18 spend and then also the inventory issue you had in Q4? Sorry if that's a little wordy. I think you get my point.","Michael Smith","I think we got the concept, Rob. This is Mike. I'll start this with we do not provide guidance by quarter, as we always say. However, we talked about 2% FX unfavorable during the year. That's really first half loaded, so there's going to be some negative FX there. First quarter is our smallest issue. As Lawrence said...","Lawrence Kurzius","Smallest quarter.","Michael Smith","The smallest quarter, right. No, our first quarter is our smallest quarter of the year. We are still working through some of the replenishment issue. But we also talked about how there's first quarter discrete tax items, so that's going to help our tax line. We'll make some investments. As we talked about before, it's really like an IT and other things early in the year. Being the smallest quarter of the year, there may be more impact on that. But again, for the full year, the 100 basis points increase in operating profit, we're comfortable with that.","Lawrence Kurzius","And I'll say there may be -- as we look ahead to some events that might happen in this volatile environment such as Brexit, we may -- depending on how they are unfolding, we may have to incur some expense to prepare us for managing our risks through a Brexit, for example.","Robert Dickerson","Yes. I guess I would just mean potential outside tool manufacturing, sourcing or...","Lawrence Kurzius","Yes, inventory build, things like that.","Robert Dickerson","Yes. Okay, fair. And then second question, just more focused on RB Foods. I realize some additional growth coming from non-tracked channels and tracked channels. It looks like year-over-year growth, definitely so strong or better even with Frank's. So that's a net positive. It looked like it peaked more in that August-September period year-over-year. And then French's, as you said, is stabilizing but still a drag. So I'm just curious with respect to '19. I didn't hear a lot or anything on potential innovation around the growing season. How do you actually increase momentum behind French's? And then secondly, just the international opportunity, which you didn't -- discussed upfront on the acquisition, I think, the last call or two but didn't hear much about today. I don't know if that's more CAGNY related.","Lawrence Kurzius","Yes, Rob, exactly. I think we'll cover this more thoroughly at CAGNY. We'll look at our -- and we'll talk more about our 2019 plans and beyond at CAGNY. But we're really pleased with the performance of RB Foods. I don't want to let this go without saying that. And you mentioned a peak around August. Actually, our consumption on these products increased sequentially quarter by quarter throughout the entire year. The fourth quarter consumption was the strongest that we've had, but there was some impact from that inventory issue on the French's and Frank's brands. So I'm not -- I actually don't have it at my fingertips, what the shipment was, but the consumer offtake was the strongest that we've had. And we think we've got great momentum going forward into 2019 on those brands, which we are now not really -- we're not breaking them out because we're treating them just like any of our other major brands in terms of our reporting. But when I say major brands, these are the second and third largest brands in our portfolio after McCormick so they certainly get a lot of attention. Mike, did you want to...","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Feeney with Consumer Edge Research.","Jonathan Feeney","A couple of questions. First, I guess, following up from your conversation with Rob and your comment that -- Rob Moskow, I should say, and your comment on consumption. It sounds like non -- because I'm looking at the measured data. It sounds like non-measured -- this was a record Q4 for you. Non-measured continues to grow terrifically for you. If you could just comment about non-measured, especially online, how that's going at least third -- fiscal third versus fiscal fourth. And then second question is, what are the big sources of gross margin mix? And within that, what impact on gross margin specifically -- how big of an impact could this one set of seasonal high-margin items have had on your gross margin broadly? It seems like there's other gross margin mix items that are more structural. And maybe comment on how those play into your hope -- your plans for gross margin expansion in 2019.","Lawrence Kurzius","So I'm going to start, and then I'm going to pass it over to Mike. The strong consumption includes unmeasured channels, but we're specifically pointing to the measured channels so that everybody can see it. So if you looked at the IRI data in aggregate over the last -- going back 5 years, you'd see that, through measured channels, this was the strongest fourth quarter in the last 5 years. And then on top of that, we had good performance in our unmeasured channels as well that contributed to the growth. I think I tried to cover that in my prepared remarks, but I want to really underscore that you can see it in the measured data when you look at -- for us, IRI. The impact...","Jonathan Feeney","Lawrence, would that also be true -- would that comment also be true of your non-measured channels, that same acceleration there?","Lawrence Kurzius","I'm not sure that the growth rate was higher, but it was definitely a contributor to the positive growth.","Michael Smith","Incremental.","Lawrence Kurzius","And at a higher rate than the scanned sales. So I just want to put that out there. Now the margin impact from the -- again, I can't underestimate the -- and Mike will talk about this a little bit. This happened at the worst possible time for us. And the items that we have at the holiday time are very seasonal in nature. They are among our highest-margin part of the portfolio. If you follow -- Jon, you followed us for a long time. You see the difference in our margin structure quarter by quarter. That's driven by that sort of holiday items. And when we don't have that, that's a big impact on the bottom line.","Michael Smith","Yes, that's basically why. I mean, these are high-margin items. Even Frank's and French's, some of the trade inventory hit them. That's high-margin item, as we talked about, too. Things like the recipe mixes, core herbs and spices, those are -- if you look at quarter by quarter, as Lawrence said, fourth quarter is always our highest quarter, and actually, late in the quarter is usually higher.","Jonathan Feeney","Mike, could I say that was the primary contributor then to gross margin contraction, that one issue?","Michael Smith","Yes, definitely, definitely.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, our final question for this morning will come from the line of Akshay Jagdale with Jefferies.","Akshay Jagdale","So one follow-up, goes back to, I think, Andrew's first question. So I know you don't give quarterly guidance, but for the fourth quarter, we have the benefit of quarterly guidance given how you guide, right? So the sales growth in the quarter was about 300 basis points below what you had expected. So the inventory stuff is about 100, 150 bps. It does imply that something else was weaker, but it -- from everything you've said, it sounds to me like the main issue really is still the inventory issue, right? So can you just help me bridge that? Because it does look like, from a purely quantitative standpoint, there are some other factors that have -- might have been weaker than you had expected.","Michael Smith","Akshay, this is Mike. And for the year, we gave guidance of 12% to 14%. And we came in basically at the bottom of that, 11.9%. The implied guidance for the fourth quarter was 0.9% to 7.4%, a pretty big range because we don't take the year guidance down to a 1% spread. We came in at 0.6% reported. So we were right at the bottom. The trade inventory programs were 1.5% impact or so. You think about $20 million to $25 million of net sales. That would have put us up in that 0.9% to 7.4%. So I think we're comfortable with the guidance we were giving for the fourth quarter implicit in our full year guidance. So a little bit at the low end of the range, but we would have been well within the Q4 implied guidance.","Akshay Jagdale","Got it. So overall, the main standout is this inventory issue and what gives you confidence is, clearly, the consumption trends are very, very strong and accelerating in many areas. That's the main takeaway from your perspective on sales, right?","Lawrence Kurzius","Akshay, that's exactly right because, in the long run, sales are going to follow the consumer. And that's why we spent so much time in our remarks today on the consumption trends. And while the trade inventory reduction happened at the worst time for us and we're very disappointed on the impact that it had on the end of the year, our consumer consumption is strong and our international business is strong and our flavor solutions business continues to power on. We believe this is a short-term challenge, and a long-term upward trend fueled by the alignment with really long-term consumer trends is a sound strategy. And I'll add a talented and engaged workforce, and that gives us a lot of confidence in our 2019.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our question-and-answer session today. I'll turn the floor back to Mr. Kurzius for any final comments.","Lawrence Kurzius","Thanks, everyone, for your questions and for participating on today's call.

Wilson","Thanks, Joyce. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. I'm pleased to report we achieved a fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit sales growth and delivered a solid profit performance for the second quarter of fiscal 2012. These results demonstrated our progress with a number of key growth initiatives: product innovation, brand marketing, customer intimacy and expanded distribution as well as acquisitions.","Through the first half of 2012, we generated $144 million of cash flow from operations. Importantly, we have turned the corner on our gross profit and material costs. After posting decreases in gross profit margin for the past 4 quarters that ranged from 120 basis points to 270 basis points, gross profit margin in the second quarter was down just 20 basis points. This was right in line with our expectation, and we expect to maintain this leveling out for the next 2 quarters as we're now lapping these deep material cost increases that began to impact us in the second quarter of 2011.","By no means are we predicting an end to the volatility in material costs. However, we believe that we're now better positioned for the benefits of our Comprehensive Continuous Improvement program and our long-term shift in business mix to positively impact not only our gross profit dollars but our percentage margins.","While the second quarter produced solid results, we continue to operate in a challenging environment with customers and consumers under pressure in many of our markets. The macroeconomic situation is also having an impact on our business and was most pronounced this period in our income from unconsolidated results, which is being impacted by the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the Mexican peso.","We continue to manage through these challenges, adapting our growth initiatives and resources to maintain our momentum and effectiveness. In that regard, I'd like to share with you our latest activity in each of our 3 regions.","In the Americas, we have grown Consumer  business sales in a 6% to 7% range for the first 2 quarters of 2012. As you recall in the first quarter, our sales growth came mainly from pricing and our acquisition of Kitchen Basics in mid-2011. First quarter volume and product mix were down a bit on the heels of our fourth quarter 2011 pricing action. In the second quarter of 2012, as consumers adjusted to higher pricing, we have seen an improvement in volume and product mix, which was more on par with the year-ago period. We're helping consumers adjust and driving sales with value programs and driving category interest with new products.","We have seen early signs of success with a number of items, including Zatarain's Frozen Meals for Two, Grill Mates blends, marinades and barbecue sauces as well as new McCormick Gourmet and McCormick Recipe mixes that allow consumers to easily prepare wholesome traditional meals for their families. In Canada, we've gained great retail acceptance for over 35 new products.","As for the latest category growth, 52-week sales of spices and seasoning at grocery were up 3% in dollars. While our branded sales trailed this rate of growth in the grocery channel, our retail takeaway is up 5% across all channels for the latest 52-week period. We believe that this reflects some consumer channel migration as well as our own success in expanding our distribution in warehouse clubs, dollar stores and other alternate channels.","The sales increase from our Industrial business has been even greater in the Americas, with 11% growth in the first half without any benefit from acquisitions.  We have pricing in place to cover higher material costs and have had increased demand, particularly from customized flavor solutions to food manufacturers.","Let's turn to Europe, the Middle East and Africa, our EMEA region. In Europe, consumer confidence is low. Austerity measures are adding pressure, and economic and political uncertainty persists. Given this backdrop, our business in EMEA has been performing quite well. Category growth is robust, driven in part by people eating more at home as a way to economize.","In our 2 largest markets, the U.K. and France, spice and seasoning category sales were up 8% and 4%, respectively, in the latest 52 weeks. Category sales for homemade dessert category in France rose 5% in the latest 52 weeks. In each of these categories, we're also achieving growth which approaches or exceeds that of the category.","While private label growth in dollars remained strong, a lot of this increase in the latest quarter came from price increases which are finally being taken on these products, closing the price gap a bit with branded products. Underpinning our sales growth is product innovation, including Recipe Inspirations, Slow Cookers and limited-edition recipe mixes, along with a number of new dessert items. We're supporting these new items with brand marketing. In EMEA, we are also growing sales and profit with some new distribution gains.","Consumers are also economizing when eating out, and on the Industrial side of our business, this has been driving demand for our products in quick-service restaurants. We are also supporting the expansion of food service customers and food manufacturers in areas like Eastern Europe and South Africa.","While effectively growing our business in established markets, our team in EMEA simultaneously integrated the Kamis business with all of our goals met. We are now beginning to implement several key initiatives, such as the conversion to SAP and the back up -- our facility expansion. Going forward, we're well positioned in Poland as consumers continued their shift from traditional trades to modern grocery where Kamis is strongest, and we're seeing accelerated sales growth for this business in markets like Russia and Romania.","Turning to the Asia\/Pacific region. I'll begin with Kohinoor in India, which we also acquired about 9 months ago. This business comprised about 20% of year-to-date sales in this region and accounted for about 2\/3 of our sales growth. We completed the integration of this business in the first quarter and are excited about pipeline of value-added rice products that we developed and have prepared for launch by the end of 2012.","In China, while we continue to experience quarter-to-quarter variability due to seasonality and customer promotional activity, the underlying growth is strong. On the Consumer side of our business, category growth was at least 15% for herbs and spices, recipe mixes and for a number of the condiments where we have a share, including salad dressings and jams. Our Industrial business is growing in step with the leading quick-service restaurants and food manufacturers that we serve in China. And across both business segments, we continue to expect double-digit sales growth in this market.","In our other large market in the region, Australia, we're driving growth with new distribution for our Consumer business as well as product innovation, particularly in customized flavor solutions for Industrial customers. Across each of our 3 regions, it's clear that McCormick is achieving sales and profit growth in our developed markets, and our increasing presence in emerging markets is accelerating this growth, both organically and through acquisitions.","To summarize, our strategy, our passion for flavor and especially our people are delivering high performance. We're effectively building and growing this business while overcoming the challenges of a tough environment. I'm confident that 2012 will be a year of success and record financial performance for McCormick.","Let me turn it over to Gordon for more insight into our second quarter financial results and our latest 2012 guidance. Gordon?","Gordon M. Stetz","Thanks, Alan, and good morning, everyone. Alan provided some of the headline results for the second quarter. I'd like to begin with a closer look at each of our 2 segments, starting with our Consumer business.","As seen on Slide 9, we grew Consumer business sales 15% in local currency. In a period of increased pricing, our volumes held up well, and we had another strong contribution from our 2011 acquisition this period.","In the Americas region, we grew second quarter Consumer business sales 7% in local currency. As seen on Slide 10, sales from Kitchen Basics added 1% to our growth this period. Pricing was up 5% as a result of an increase taken in the fourth quarter of 2011. For the second quarter of 2012, volume and product mix were about even with the year-ago period. This is an improvement from the fourth -- first quarter of 2012, when we reported a 1.4% decline in volume and product mix in the period immediately following our pricing action.","As consumers continue to adjust to the higher prices, we look for this stabilization in our core business to continue. We are helping this along with our brand marketing activity in the U.S. behind everyday cooking and baking items as well as programs for Hispanic consumers. Our new products are another important growth driver, and we are seeing early success with a number of items, as Alan highlighted.","In Europe, the Middle East and Africa, EMEA, we grew Consumer sales 32% in local currency. Sales from Kamis, our acquisition in Poland, added 27% to sales this quarter. This was another period of improved top line results in our base business, which we grew by 5%. The increase was primarily from higher volume and product mix in France, the U.K. and smaller markets. Our initiatives behind new products and incremental marketing along with distribution gains are growing the sales of our brands and helping drive the positive category growth that Alan discussed.","Consumer business sales in the Asia\/Pacific region rose 64% in local currency. Kohinoor, our acquisition in India, added 59% to second quarter sales. The base business grew 5%, mostly from pricing actions. Those of you who follow us closely know that both our Consumer and Industrial businesses in the Asia\/Pacific region tend to have more quarter-to-quarter variability, due in part to the timing of holiday seasons, marketing programs and, on the Industrial side, customer promotional activity and new product rollouts.","If you recall, we had a very strong performance in the first quarter with Consumer sales in this region up 21%, that's excluding the impact of Kohinoor and currency. On this basis, sales for this first half increased 13%, with stronger sales from China and growth in Australia as well.","Across all 3 regions, second quarter operating income was $89 million for our Consumer business, up 15% from the prior year, including the impact of a $4 million increase in brand marketing support. This is a significant improvement from the first quarter when the year-on-year increase in material costs led to a decline in operating income. Through the first half, we have increased operating income by 4% with the impact of higher sales and our Comprehensive Continuous Improvement program, CCI.","Let's turn now to our Industrial business and start with a review of our sales performance. For this segment, we grew sales 10% in local currency. About 2\/3 of the increase was pricing and 1\/3 volume and product mix. This gross -- growth was all organic as the 2011 acquisitions impacted only our Consumer business.","On Slide 15, Industrial sales in the Americas rose 10% in local currency with a 7% contribution from pricing actions and 3% from volume and product mix. This period, the increase was led by new products and increased demand for customized seasoning blends for snacks and other products in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. For food service customers, volume and product mix was comparable to the year-ago period.","Our second quarter Industrial sales results in EMEA was the fourth consecutive quarter of strong sales growth. We grew sales 12% in local currency with a 9% increase in volume and product mix. Demand from quick-service restaurants remained robust, and we are meeting this demand with product supply from our operations in the U.K., Turkey and South Africa.","As indicated, our Asia\/Pacific region has a fair bit of quarter-to-quarter variability, and we certainly saw it in the first 2 quarters of 2012 for the Industrial business. In local currency, we grew sales 22% in the first quarter, followed by a 1% increase in the second quarter. Year-to-date, sales in local currency are up 10% with increases in both China and Australia of sales for our multinational customers, including quick-service restaurants that continue to expand in this region.","Operating income for the Industrial business was $33 million in the second quarter compared to $32 million in the year-ago period. While we delivered strong sales growth and CCI cost savings, these gains were offset in part by factors that included a less favorable mix of sales and higher benefit costs. Through the first half, we grew operating income for this part of our business by 14%, and operating income margin was 30 basis points higher than the first half of 2011. For the full year, we expect to achieve increases in both operating income and operating income margin for our Industrial business.","Across both segments, we grew second quarter operating income 11% to $121 million, mainly due to higher sales and our CCI program. Gross profit improved sharply from the first quarter. If you recall, gross profit margin in that period declined 270 basis points from the year-ago period as we continued to face steep year-on-year material cost increases. As indicated, we expected this year-on-year comparison to improve as we headed into the next 3 quarters of 2012.","Gross profit margin in the second quarter was 39.5%, down just 20 basis points from the prior-year period. Pricing actions and CCI cost savings are not only offsetting the impact of higher material cost dollar for dollar but also leading to a more stable gross profit margin result, and we expect this to continue into the second half of the year.","Also affecting operating income was our selling, general and administrative expense, which was down 10 basis points as a percent of net sales in the second quarter. As stated, incremental marketing spending was $4 million. When added to the $9 million increase in the first quarter, it is clear that the investment behind our brands has been skewed through -- to the early part of 2012 to support new product launches and seasonal activity. Heading into the second half of the year, our marketing spending is expected to be more comparable to the second half of 2011.","Moving below operating income, interest expense was up from the year-ago period with the increase related to debt from our 2011 acquisitions. As a result of a discrete tax item, our tax rate for the second quarter was 28.7% compared to our guidance of 30% and the prior-year period at 31.1%.","Income from unconsolidated operations was one area that came in below our expectations. We are being impacted by the exchange rate between the Mexican peso and the U.S. dollar, not only in the translation of earnings from our McCormick-to-Mexico joint venture but in the transaction impact for the purchase of soybean oil.","Across all joint ventures, income from unconsolidated operations ended the quarter at $3.9 million, down from $6.1 million in the year-ago quarter. As this year-on-year declined again in the fourth quarter of 2011, we expect income from unconsolidated operations to also be down from the year-ago period, at least through the third quarter of 2012, bringing our outlook for the full year to a decrease of at least 20%.","At the bottom line, we reported earnings per share of $0.60, a 9% increase from $0.55 in the second quarter of 2011. Higher operating income was the primary factor behind our product growth, as shown on Slide 22.","Let's turn next to our cash flow and May 31 balance sheet. Year-to-date, cash flow from operations was $144 million compared to $36 million in the first half of 2011. The improvement was mainly due to a much lower increase in inventory this period. It also included the unfavorable impact of a $16 million increase in pension plan contributions made in the first quarter of 2012.","Through the first half, we used $69 million of cash to repurchase 1.3 million shares. At quarter end, we had $201 million still available on our $400 million authorization.","Our balance sheet remains strong. Inventory was about even with our November 30 balance and was lower sequentially from $640 million at the end of the first quarter. I am pleased to see this moving in the right direction as we begin to work down some of our strategic inventory and gain traction with our new inventory management processes in North America.","As a final topic, I want to review our latest 2012 guidance, as shown on Slides 24 and 25. With strong sales results through the first half, we reaffirm our expectation to grow sales 9% to 11% in local currency for the fiscal year. Based on prevailing foreign currency rates, we are still estimating an unfavorable currency impact of 2% for the year. I want to point out that this implies a sales headwind of about 3% in the second half, given that the currency impact in the first half was a negative 0.9%.","We are increasing our 2012 plans for incremental brand marketing support to approximately $15 million from our prior guidance of at least $10 million. With our heavier spending in the first half behind new product introductions and other programs, marketing activity in the next 2 quarters will be more consistent with the second half of 2011.","At the operating income line, we are reaffirming a 9% to 11% increase, and we continue to project earnings per share of $3.01 to $3.06. Keep in mind that we expect the 2012 increase in earnings per share to be more significant in the fourth quarter than the third quarter. As I indicated, we are expecting another decline in income from unconsolidated operations at least through the third quarter of 2012.","In addition, we anticipate that some items in the year-ago comparison that will affect our 2012 EPS growth rate for the third and fourth quarters. First, we reported acquisition-related transaction costs in the fourth quarter of 2011, which lowered earnings per share by $0.05. And second, we had an estimated $10 million of customer purchases in advance of our fourth quarter 2011 price increase, shifting sales from the fourth quarter 2011 into the third quarter of 2011. If anyone needs more details on these year-ago items, Joyce can help you after the call.","To summarize, we have good momentum as we head into the second half of our fiscal year. While the global operating environment remains difficult, McCormick employees are up to the challenge, and together, we are executing effectively in our operations around the world.","Let's turn now to your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Ken Goldman of JPMorgan Chase.","Kenneth Goldman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I jumped on a little late, so forgive me if you addressed this. But can you talk a little bit about the environment in China, both on the Consumer and Industrial side for you right now?","Alan D. Wilson","Yes, the environment is still pretty healthy in China. What you saw in the second quarter was -- what had looked like a slowdown from first quarter, the reality is we were up against a price increase from last year in the Consumer business which kind of impacted it. As I talk to people about China, what I'm hearing from people that are in heavy industry is that they're seeing some slowdown in the Chinese economy, but people in the consumer space are still seeing pretty robust growth. And that's what we're seeing.","Kenneth Goldman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then in the U.S., I mean, you are able to maintain volumes despite taking price increases. Do you attribute that more to the category that you're in right now or more towards some actions that you're doing or a combination of both? Because it is unusual in packaged food to sort of see that environment right now. Most companies are reporting volume declines. Just curious how you think about that.","Alan D. Wilson","We saw a short-term volume decline, as we always do, when we took pricing, and I think what we're seeing now is a little bit of a return to -- as consumers have gotten used it. And as they lived out of their pantries for a little while, we're starting to see some return to volume. We're also continuing to put pressure on with new product innovation. We're advertising and have increased our spend. And I think we're fortunate that we're in a good business. There's no question about that, but we're also being proactive as we -- just to make sure that we give consumers reason to continue to buy our products. I think another thing that we're seeing is private label pricing has kind of started to close some of these gaps.","Kenneth Goldman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then lastly, is there anything we should be aware of in terms of pepper pricing, or cost, rather, or anything that may force you to take your prices up or down in the near term?","Alan D. Wilson","Yes. There's -- we have -- pepper pricing is continuing to flatten but still is above last year. And so we have taken some additional pricing, but it's a lot more stable than it has been.","Operator","Our next question is from Thilo Wrede from Jefferies & Company.","Thilo Wrede - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","You've owned Kamis for 3 quarters now, I think. Can you give us a little bit more details on how plans are working to, for example, introduce more of traditional McCormick products, expanding more into other markets outside of Poland? Just a little bit more detail there.","Alan D. Wilson","I'm sorry, Thilo. Could you just repeat the question? It's a -- we had a little trouble online.","Thilo Wrede - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Yes. So you've owned Kamis for 3 quarters, and I was just hoping for a few more details on how the plans there are progressing, the plans are to introduce traditional McCormick products, expand into other countries and so on.","Alan D. Wilson","Yes. With the Kamis business, what we're doing is, one, we think there's a lot of leverage in the Polish market from good category management. So we're doing that. We're bringing product innovations that are working well in other markets under the Kamis brands in Poland, and we're continuing to expand distribution across Russia. In fact, we're very encouraged by what we're seeing with sales growth in Russia. So we think the Kamis brand -- we'll continue to market it as Kamis in Poland and Russia at this point, but we see it as offering a lot of opportunity for growth for us. We're very, very pleased with that acquisition.","Thilo Wrede - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","What kind of organic growth are you getting from Kamis right now?","Gordon M. Stetz","I don't have those numbers in front of me, but I know that we're right on our acquisition plan. But I don't have yet the numbers in front of me. I think Joyce can help with that.","Joyce L. Brooks","Yes, historically, it's been sort of a mid-single-digit rate.","Gordon M. Stetz","Yes.","Thilo Wrede - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay, and then last question, just about your guidance. So you're taking up your marketing spending to -- compared to what you had before. I think your JV income decline is more than what I would have thought previously, yet your EPS guidance is unchanged. Where is that money coming from?","Alan D. Wilson","Well, we just increased our CCI, obviously, as well. So we're reinvesting behind our businesses. We're generating more CCI. So that's obviously, giving us an opportunity to continue to invest behind our brands.","Operator","Our next question is from Alexia Howard of Alliance Bernstein.","Gretchen Guo","This is Gretchen calling in for Alexia. Just a quick question on Kohinoor. You guys mentioned that you have some new product launches that you're hoping to put through at the end of this year. I'm just wondering when would you expect that to start benefiting the top line, and how much benefit should we expect.","Alan D. Wilson","I don't know that we projected a top line result. But because that business is growing through a combination of expanded distribution and new products, that the products that we're introducing are products that are similar to our Zatarain's rice mixes. We're calling them Rice and Spice, and they're Biryani-type products that's -- that make it easy for Indian consumers to prepare staple kinds of meals. But we -- this is kind of a first foray into those value-added products in India, and so we're excited about it, but I think it's too early to project what we think the benefit's going to be.","Operator","Our next question is from Akshay Jagdale with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Akshay S. Jagdale - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Just one clarification regarding your guidance. So you maintained EPS guidance despite lower unconsolidated income is because you now expect higher operating income for the year, right?","Gordon M. Stetz","Yes, we're still reiterating our operating income guidance at 9% to 11%. We obviously had a little bit of a benefit from the tax rate as well in Q2. As you saw, that helped to offset that weakness on unconsolidated. But given the fact that we are maintaining our range, you could imply that perhaps our operating income would trend towards the upper end, but we're still comfortable at that 9% to 11%.","Akshay S. Jagdale - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just regarding the U.S. consumer and more generally on your brand marketing spending. I mean, what -- you obviously increased your marketing budget for this year.  That talks to the confidence that you have in the returns you'll get on that investment. Where -- from a regional basis, is it more skewed to one area versus another? And can you talk about what you're seeing in those regions where you're investing that makes you feel confident that investing more will generate at least the same returns you've been getting in the past or more?","Alan D. Wilson","Yes. I mean, we continue to change our marketing mix to see -- to work on things that hit. So we're moving more of our money into digital. And some of that digital is regional, where we're working with specific customers on promotions to really hit consumers. By and large, our marketing spend is national. What we saw in the last quarter, as we're heading into the third quarter, is a pretty heavy spend behind our new products, for our new grilling products. We do have some regional promotions. We've got a big Old Bay focus going on right now in the Baltimore area. There's 50-plus restaurants that have special menu items, and we've got billboards all over the place that kind of tie into the 18 -- War of 1812. We are relaunching our dry seasoning mix products and have a number of new products behind that. So we have a fair amount of activity. Again, as you'll look at how we've increased our marketing spend, this is a consistent story that we've had over the last 5 or 6 years where we look to invest, but we continue to manage our mix so that we're getting the highest returns that we can.","Akshay S. Jagdale - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Just one last one on gross margins. Longer term, I mean, obviously, you've -- you had this long-term target of increasing gross margins every year, but last couple of years because of input costs, we haven't gotten there. So what's the potential for gross margins longer term?","Gordon M. Stetz","Well, we still believe on a long-term basis and the key event would be a less volatile commodity cost environment, because that's what you just alluded to. In the past 2 out of 4 years, we've seen commodity cost 5 -- 2 out of 5 years. So -- but in a more stable environment, we would continue to believe the higher mix of the Consumer business would favorably impact that gross margin as well as the others that we have within the Industrial business, on focus on higher value-added products should favorably impact that as well.","Alan D. Wilson","Yes. The stable environment with our CCI efforts, a lot of that -- a lot of the CCI will find its way back into margins in a volatile environment like we've been in. We haven't priced to fully recover our cost. So we've used that combination of pricing and CCI to try and moderate the impact on margins.","Operator","Our next question is from Chris Growe with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I just wanted to ask you 2 questions. The first one, just in relation to the cost inflation for the year. I think you had indicated it was going to sort of step down sequentially each quarter. I just want to get a sense, this is a good gross margin performance in relation to that cost inflation. Do we -- should we expect the second half gross margin to be up, then, for the business?","Gordon M. Stetz","Well, we're still looking at stabilization of the gross margin. A lot of things play into that, product mix, portfolio mix, but we're not looking for a big rebound. I mean, you could see slight improvement as we progress through the year. But generally, the way we're looking at it is that it would be comparable to the prior year and be flattish.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then I just wanted to ask in relation to the U.S., you've had some pretty solid growth overall. Just in kind of studying some of the IRI and Nielsen trends, it's shown that your branded sales have softened a little bit, and private label has picked up by a little bit. I know we're looking at just kind of some unique channels. You're not looking at the all channel data. Have you seen that -- any kind of sequential weakening, basically, between branded and private label in your business?","Alan D. Wilson","I don't know that sequential weakening -- what we've actually seen is private label growing faster in grocery, and our brand growing faster in unmeasured channels. And so I think the consumer is going to some other places. Certainly, we're not happy about the results that we've seen in core grocery, and we're working -- we've got a lot of efforts to make sure that we're not losing share there. But what we're seeing is that we're holding share across the board, and private label is growing in grocery.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just the last one. Gordon, what sort of tax rates should we look at for the year? If you said it, I'm sorry I missed it. But is it around 30% for the year?","Gordon M. Stetz","The underlying rate, we continue to expect to be around 30%. Obviously, as you saw in this quarter, there can be a discrete item that pops up that can either be positive or negative, depending on the fact and circumstances. But the underlying rate, we're still looking at 30%.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Eric Katzman of Deutsche Bank.","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I guess -- we just had our conference in Europe. A couple of companies preannounced their worse-than-expected trends, but you had very respectable results in France, the U.K. Maybe you could talk a little bit about why the outperformance and why investors should think that can continue. And then I have a follow-up.","Alan D. Wilson","Well, what we've seen in this year is good results behind the investments that we've made in the business with a combination of new products and supporting those with pretty solid advertising. Our homemade dessert item, the Vahin\u00e9 brand in France, continues to perform pretty well. And so while we recognize -- and I was in Europe last week, too, unfortunately not at your conference, Eric, but there is an underlying sense of a lack of confidence across the board and, I think, uncertainty. So we're just going to continue to do what we do with our products. But I do -- I absolutely acknowledge that it's a tough environment. One thing that is helping us is Kamis continues to grow pretty well in Poland. While the currency's weakening a little bit, it seems to continue to be a pretty robust economy for us.","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. Well, the invitation to next year's conference is still open. But in terms of the M&A environment, obviously, this type of landscape makes for winners and losers. You're winning, and there's been a lot of companies over the years that are private that you've had your sights on. And I'm just kind of wondering, are you seeing a little bit more interest on their part, whether it's family-run businesses or parts of other larger companies where there's been an approach and maybe we should expect a little bit more activity?","Alan D. Wilson","Well, we have an active pipeline. And in our business, we know the businesses that are attractive to us, and we generally know the people that own them and nurture those relationships. I'd say, we still have a pretty active pipeline.","Operator","Our next question is from Robert Moskow of Credit Suisse Group.","Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","But I wanted to ask around the edges here. At the Industrial business, you said that there's higher demand for customized seasoning blends, and it's across a variety of geographies. Is that one customer introducing a new product across a variety of geographies?  Or what is that specifically?","Alan D. Wilson","Well, it is -- it certainly -- our expertise and focus is on savory seasonings. A lot of those end up in snacks, but a lot of companies are investing behind new product innovation in snacks. But it's not specific to one customer. We're -- we are seeing a fair bit of activity from a number of customers. I'd also say, though, that while we have a robust pipeline, there's a continued focus from a lot of our Industrial customers on productivity initiatives. And in a lot of cases, we can help with those with our products and help them deliver great flavor with reduced costs. But where we really like to play is in the new product innovation.","Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","So are you in both of those things right now? Is that what you mean, Alan?","Alan D. Wilson","Yes. I think our efforts are pretty split.","Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, okay. Can you talk a little bit more about Kohinoor? Are you on plan in India as well as Poland? We heard from Hershey's saying that they've had troubles there, and they aren't the first. What are you finding about -- that's unique about that market? It just seems that selling spice and seasonings in a more value-added way would be a challenge, particularly in India.","Alan D. Wilson","We're pretty much on plan with our business in India. Certainly, the environment is a little more volatile, and the way we think about India is really as a long-term, great, growing market. And we know it's not going to be smooth. There'll be some bumps along the way, but we're pleased with where we are so far in that business and excited about the prospects as we invest in new products. But remember, our core business in India isn't selling spices to Indians. We're selling higher-value-added rice products, and we're selling through our joint venture in Southern India more value-added blends. So it's less about selling those core spices, which are available on every street, and more about selling value-added products.","Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, all right. And lastly, CapEx. Your CapEx spend is flat versus a year ago for the first 6 months. I think I would expect it to be a little bit higher, I think, because now you have those acquisitions. What is your CapEx guidance again for this year? And at some point will you need to increase capacity and CapEx spending for those deals?","Gordon M. Stetz","Yes. Actually, we are still forecasting in $100 million to $110 million in CapEx spending. I know it's not reflected yet at the beginning part of the year, but we're still projecting that. And it does reflect what you just said, Rob. To some extent, it's organic growth in some of our emerging markets, where we actually are adding capacity because of the growth that we've experienced in places like China, and in other cases, it is through the integration of our new acquisitions and just by virtue of the fact that these acquisitions themselves had a CapEx budget that we now have included.","Alan D. Wilson","Yes. We've got a new technical center and a plant expansion in Guangzhou that will be online later in the year. We're starting to work on plant expansion in Poland. So there's a fairly good investment program that we expect it'll be right in line with our capital forecasts.","Operator","Our next question is from Ann Gurkin of Davenport & Company.","Ann H. Gurkin - Davenport & Company, LLC, Research Division","Just want to follow up a little bit on a couple of items. One, you've mentioned strong trends in the QSR channel. Has that changed at all? Has that trend either accelerated or changed?","Alan D. Wilson","I don't think it's changed very much. I think there was -- within QSR, there are companies that are doing well and companies that are struggling a little bit. Remember, we're pretty well invested in QSR in most of our major markets in the U.S. and Europe and in China. So we're continuing to see good growth in China. We had some volume wins in the U.S. which we're seeing that are reflecting. So it's not necessarily that the customers are growing as much as we had some share gains. So I don't think that there's a major change in that trend.","Ann H. Gurkin - Davenport & Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then when we attended your Investor Day, I thought the discussion about your global management board was interesting. Are there other any new developments coming out of that global management board?","Alan D. Wilson","Well, we're continuing to invest in -- we really use that as our key source of executive development, and we're continuing to invest in that. Our boards are ongoing, and they bring us projects that either help us grow our business or reduce our costs. So it's an -- it really is an ongoing effort, and they're working on some of the big strategic projects for the company.","Ann H. Gurkin - Davenport & Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then finally, I always ask about the fall bake season. How is it -- how's the selling going?","Alan D. Wilson","We're pretty encouraged. We really feel like we're locked for a good fall season. Obviously, we need the -- a return to more traditional weather. But I would say that we feel like our plans are well in place.","Operator","Our next question is from Mitch Pinheiro of Janney Montgomery Scott.","Mitchell B. Pinheiro - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Yes. A couple sort of follow-ups. Just regarding brand marketing support. Where is that focused for the upcoming quarter and maybe the second half? And then how does that -- are we talking above the line or below the line or both?","Alan D. Wilson","Well, it's a little bit of both. I mean, we certainly, as we always do, are looking at some value programs. Some of that is what we would call, I guess, below the line, where we're investing in advertising, reminding people the value of our products. There are some promotional activity. There always is. I would say the promotional activity is much higher than it is in previous periods. But the real effort is in -- is making sure that we're communicating about our new products. And as we head into the fall season, we've got a good campaign on Grill Mates right now. We've got a good campaign on Old Bay and Zatarain's and the new products for Zatarain's in the U.S. And then in the fall, we'll be emphasizing the baking products and then as we head into Christmas, more of the holiday meal kind of products.","Gordon M. Stetz","Just to add to that, Mitch, last year, if you recall, we incrementally spend in the fourth quarter against holiday, and it was approximately about a $10 million increase versus the prior year in advertising and promotion. And that was a function of the good result that we saw from the holiday programs in prior years. So we're going to be hitting holiday again hard this year.","Mitchell B. Pinheiro - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","But it will be -- will it be sort of at the same rate as last year?","Gordon M. Stetz","Yes. The back half would be generally at the same spending levels as last year, up slightly.","Mitchell B. Pinheiro - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Okay. How did -- I mean, you sort of mentioned this earlier. But how did your alternative channels perform versus the traditional food-drug en masse?","Alan D. Wilson","Well, a little stronger than the traditional grocery.","Mitchell B. Pinheiro - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then in -- when you look at within your core spice business in the U.S., how did the -- your traditional single spice business do compared to your seasoning blends and those sort of higher-value-added products?","Gordon M. Stetz","Over the last 13 and 52 weeks, volume was down a bit in grocery on core items. Dry seasoning mixes were also down a bit. In spices, we made that up with the other channels. In dry seasoning mixes, that's a category that we're in the process of refreshing and, we believe, need some renewed investment. Now dry seasoning mixes are coming off a couple of years of really strong growth as the economy weakened. So we may be reverting a bit to the mean, but we're continuing to invest. That's an important business for us, and we get a lot of great new products and new packaging that we're in the process of introducing.","Mitchell B. Pinheiro - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Okay. Last question is also -- if you could just remind me sort of where -- in your CCI cost-savings program, where you're focused, where you're seeing the incremental savings emanating from.","Gordon M. Stetz","As you may recall, back in March, we took it up, this year's to $45 million. And generally, what we're still seeing is about a 60-40 split between Consumer and Industrial on those, and still about 75%, 80% would hit the cost of goods sold line, and the rest would be hitting SG&A.","Operator","Our final question is from Andrew Lazar of Barclays Capital.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I know we're up against the time. So just a quick follow-up. You had mentioned already about some of the trends you've seen around alternate channels and your performance there versus private label and others. We all get the expanded outlet coverage data this coming week, or Monday, basically. Anything you would basically tell us to sort of look for, insight do you think we should be looking for out of that expanded coverage data? And if it's really the same as what you've already said, that's fine. But if there's anything else we should be looking at in general, I would love to hear it.","Alan D. Wilson","Yes. I think we've been pretty transparent on what we do expect to see. I mean, I think from our -- I can't speak to any other category but ours, but I would say that we would see a little stronger performance as you see that expanded data versus what you're currently seeing.","With no other questions, I want to thank everybody for participating in the call. I'm really confident that we're doing the right things and executing effectively to succeed in a difficult environment. McCormick has a great portfolio of products across both our business segments and our operations around the world, where we bring our passion for flavor to customers and consumers.

We\u2019re driving growth in sales and profit and in 2015 are stepping up our cost reduction activities to fuel our growth. During the fourth quarter of 2014, we made progress on a number of fronts, with the successful launch of new products, additional investment in brand marketing to drive growth and building customer intimacy.","For the fiscal year, our cash flow exceeded $500 million and we returned a record amount of cash to shareholders, employees throughout McCormick delivered $65 million in cost savings from our Comprehensive Continuous Improvement program, CCI and we have embarked on a more aggressive cost savings plans for 2015.","Fourth quarter earnings per share exceeded the guidance we provided back in October with a lower tax rate and an excellent result from our joint venture in Mexico. For our consolidated businesses, sales and operating income were below our projections for this quarter, as we continue to face a competitive environment in several markets and in China, where we were impacted by weak sales to major quick service restaurant customers. Gordon will go into more details in the fourth quarter financial results.","I want to comment more specifically on our U.S. consumer business. Our main challenge in this market has been fragmentation in the spice and seasoning category. With U.S. retailers bringing smaller brands on the store shelves, these items included value priced products, ethnic brands and premium as well as organic items. As we head into 2015, this pressure continues. However, we\u2019re in a much better position than we were a year ago, with accelerated innovation, brand equity building and our actions to win at retail. Among our top performing U.S. launches in 2014 were Grill Mate\u2019s burger seasonings, gluten free recipe mixes and McCormick skillet sauces. We increased our U.S. brand marketing by 7% to support these launches, as well as fund an expanded holiday campaign and reinforce our Taste You Trust message with adds that feature our product quality.","Organizationally, we have new leadership in place and more category management resources close to our customers. And working with our retail customers and category management, our objective is to improve their sales and profit, as well as sales and profit for McCormick, a win-win solution. While we\u2019ve made good progress there is still work to be done.","Taking a look at 2014 IRI retail consumption data for recipe mixes, the category rose 1%. Sales of our brands grew 3% and we gained 2 percentage points of category share. We're pleased with the strong response to our product innovation and marketing programs. The same data showed a 3% increase in spice and seasoning category sales and 1% sales growth for McCormick products. These are good results and ahead of many other food categories. However, we saw some share gains by smaller brands, none with a category share greater than 3% and both McCormick brands and private label brands lost share.","As we head into 2015, we're pleased with the category growth rates and we're working to extend our success with recipe mixes to the spice and seasoning category. We said at the offset of 2014 that we expected improvement in our U.S. consumer business to take some time. I believe we have the right team in place and the right actions underway to drive the growing demand for flavor in this important market.","Next I\u2019d like to provide a broader perspective on our 2014 performance, our growth initiatives and our 2015 outlook. Across all of our businesses, we grew sales in local currency for fiscal year by 3%, within our 3% to 5% target range. The strongest contribution towards this growth was in our China consumer business, driven both by the strong growth from WAPC and an 18% increase in the base business. For 2015 we're setting a goal to grow sales 4% to 6% in local currency. With about a 2% sales increase from pricing expected this range is in line with our long-term goals, even without the impact of an acquisition. However, based on the prevailing exchange rates currency is expected to lower the sales growth range by 3 percentage points.","As you look across the food industry, a 4% to 6% sales growth may seem ambitious, but it's based on several factors that are in our favor. First is the rising demand for flavor. On Slide 6, spice and seasoning category growth was strong in 2014 and is projected to grow at a mid single-digit rate globally in 2015 with roughly 4% growth in developed markets and nearly a 10% increase in emerging markets. For recipe mixes, the projected global growth is also at a mid single-digit rate.","Flavor is well aligned with the broader changes in the way that people are eating today, whether it's spicier food, eating more fresh produce and protein, simple ingredients are the move towards healthier eating. We think that these changes are here to stay and that each of them drives demand for flavor. This is a catalyst, not only to our consumer business but also to our industrial business. As an example more than one-third of our 2014 industrial new product breeds had some type of health and wellness attribute. Second, we're continuing to increase our investment in brand marketing. Our current level of marketing is up more than 50% from five years ago. In our latest campaigns, we're emphasizing new products, quality and freshness, everyday cooking and holiday celebrations. We're planning to further increase in 2015.","Digital marketing has a particularly high ROI and we're making it a greater part of the mix. This year it's planned at one-third of our total advertising, up from 11% in 2010. As we develop our marketing programs, a leading audience is millennials. In the U.S. a recent study shows that household penetration of our brands with millennials is right in line with other age groups. We also conducted an attitude study, this work revealed that 46% of U.S. millennials regard the McCormick brand as the best spiced brand in the market and another 37% categorized it as one of the best. Again these metrics are similar to what we see with other age groups.","Third our 2015 sales growth projection includes a strong impact from innovation. With 16 innovation centers in 12 countries around the world, we continue to invest in product development. Earlier this month, we opened a new product development facility for our U.S. consumer business. In 2014 we had particular success with our squeeze pouch package that led to a 25% increase in ketchup sales in China and in North America with gluten-free mixes and skillet sauces. In France our Vahin\u00e9 premium vanilla has driven category growth.","In the first half of 2015, we have a great line up of innovation and are particularly excited about the re-launch of our entire U.S. gourmet line featuring greater variety of flavor sealed technology that locks-in flavor, color and aroma and packaging that has a more premium fresh appearance. We're introducing flavored sea salt grinders across North America and Indian range of seasoning blends in the UK and further extension of our Vahin\u00e9 dessert items in France.","For our industrial business, much of our growth in 2014 came from innovative seasoning through snack chips, crackers and snack bars, as well as beverage flavors and we have more in the innovation pipeline in 2015. With our foundation in spices and herbs industrial customers continue to view McCormick as the go-to supplier to help grow their range of healthy and flavorful products. Across both businesses 8% of 2014 sales came from new products that were launched in the last three years.","The fourth factor to drive 2015 sales growth is customer intimacy. For retail customers our share of voice, social media presence, digital marketing initiatives, product innovation, and category analytics distinguished McCormick from the competition in just about every market where we participate. As discussed during 2014, we\u2019re using our category analytics for optimized sales and profitability for us and our customers achieving a win-win solution. For industrial customers, a vital part of customer intimacy is support for our global growth, in this regard we opened a small R&D center in Brazil during 2014 and by 2016 we expect to establish a footprint in the Middle East to support our customers\u2019 expansion into this region.","Clearly our business at McCormick is well aligned with healthy category growth and we have strong initiatives underway to drive sales. Along with these factors an integral part of our long-term success has been our cost savings activity. As depicted on Slide 10, for the past decade a combination of our CCI program and streamlining actions have generated significant cost savings. We\u2019ve used these savings to fuel our growth through brand marketing and product development, offset material cost inflation and drive profits. In 2013, we began to go at this more aggressively with the announcement of reorganization activities in our EMEA region. This was followed in 2014 by the realignment of certain manufacturing operations in our U.S. industrial business and some additional SG&A streamlining in the fourth quarter.","In 2015, we\u2019ve set a goal to generate at least $85 million in cost savings, led by our CCI program. We expect additional cost savings this year as we wrap-up previously announced streamlining actions. We\u2019re also taking the next step in our North American effectiveness initiative that began in 2014. Following the formation of our North American organization and leadership team, we\u2019re undertaking cost savings and productivity improvements in this part of our business. Through these actions, we expect to achieve annual cost savings of approximately $25 million by 2016. As demonstrated in previous years, we have the ability to offset the impact of material cost increases, minimizing the profit impact on both consumer and industrial businesses. For 2015, pricing actions and anticipated cost savings will be a major offset to the higher material costs.","Let's move from sales growth and fuel for growth to our profit performance and outlook. We met our fiscal year 2014 sales objectives and exceeded the cost savings target. However, adjusted operating income growth at 3% was below our initial range of 6% to 8%. A major reason was the more rapid growth in international markets, but slower growth in more profitable U.S. businesses. As a result, we had a lower contribution to operating income, although there were some offset at the net income line through a more favorable tax rate. At the bottom-line, adjusted earnings per share rose 8% to 3.37. This was above our initial target largely due to the favorable tax rate and strong growth from a unconsolidated McCormick to Mexico joint venture.","As you know, our long-term goal is to grow earnings per share 9% to 11%. On a comparable basis, we\u2019ve achieved a five year compounded annual growth rate of 8% just below our long-term goal. While we\u2019ve had solid sales growth, we\u2019ve managed through a number of headwinds during this period, including higher than normal material cost inflation and retirement benefit expense. In recent years, we\u2019ve taken actions to reduce retirement benefit costs including a lump-sum payout and closing our pension plans. In 2015, we expect both the retirement expense and material inflation to once again cause profit pressure along with the unfavorable impact to currency exchange rates.","We\u2019re responding to these cost pressures with more aggressive cost savings actions while continuing to invest in marketing programs and innovation. We\u2019re committed to building our brand equity and competing effectively in each of our markets. Consumer demand for flavor is increasing and we want to help drive this growth.","Let me summarize, I\u2019d like to recognize employees throughout McCormick and our leadership team for their engagement and accomplishments. As we navigate through this period of competitive activity and cost inflation, we are pursuing attractive category growth opportunities in a very robust environment for flavor around the world. One of our strategic imperatives is growth to win share with global focus and that\u2019s driving focus for me, as well as the entire organization in 2015.","At this point, I am going to turn it over to Gordon for a closer look at the fourth quarter and our 2015 guidance. Gordon?","Gordon Stetz","Thanks, Alan and good morning everyone. As Alan indicated our fourth quarter earnings per share exceeded our projection with a favorable tax rate and higher joint venture income. These favorable variances more than offset a greater than expected decline in adjusted operating income mainly in our consumer business.","I\u2019d like to comment on our sales and operating results for each segment. As seen on Slide 15, we grew consumer business sales 3% in local currency. The impact of pricing actions taken in response to higher material costs and higher volume and product mix contributed to this increase. Sales in the Americas rose 4% in local currency with the benefit of a 2% increase in volume and product mix, as well as higher pricing. In the third quarter, we discussed the timing of retailer purchases under our holiday display program.","In 2014 versus the year ago period, we had fewer purchases in the third quarter and more of these purchases in the fourth quarter. A look at Americas\u2019 consumer business sales for the second half eliminates the impact of this year-on-year shift in sales between the third and fourth quarters. For the second half of 2014 we grew sales in local currency 2%, with pricing up 1.5% and volume and product mix up about a 0.5%. This was a significant improvement from the first half when sales in local currency declined 4% due to lower volume and product mix.","In EMEA, consumer business sales in local currency were comparable to the fourth quarter of 2013. We had sales pressure from competitive conditions in several markets along with a favorable impact from higher pricing, product innovation and expanded distribution. In local currency, consumer business sales in the Asia Pacific region were comparable to the year ago period. In this region we grew sales 5% in China, offsetting weakness in Australia and India. In total for the consumer business adjusted operating income declined 4% from the fourth quarter of 2013 excluding special charges and last year's loss on voluntary pension settlement. While we grew sales and achieved CCI cost savings we funded a $5 million increase in brand marketing support and business mix was unfavorable.","Turning next our industrial business, fourth quarter sales were down slightly from the year ago period in local currency with lower volume and product mix largely offset by higher pricing as seen on Slide 20. In the Americas region we grew industrial business sales 1% in local currency. Throughout 2014 snack seasonings have been a source of strong growth, this increase along with higher sales of branded food service products more than offset continued weakness in sales to quick service restaurant customers.","In our EMEA industrial business we grew sales 2% in local currency driven by pricing actions taken in response to higher material costs. Weaker sales of branded food service product led to the decline in volume and product mix in this period. Industrial business sales in the Asia Pacific region declined 9% in local currency compared to the fourth quarter of 2013. Given the news of weak sales from the large quick service restaurants in China we were appropriately cautious in our fourth quarter outlook. Even with this weakness in the latter part of 2014 we grew Asia Pacific industrial sales 2% in local currency for the fiscal year.","We were extremely pleased with the profit results for our industrial business in fiscal year 2014 with adjusted operating income up 13% from a difficult 2013 and up 10% on a two year comparison to 2012. We achieved higher sales and increased margins from CCI cost savings and a more favorable business mix. As we anticipated in our previous earnings call, fourth quarter adjusted operating income declined mainly due to the lower volume in China as well as a year-on-year increase in incentive compensation. Across both segments adjusted operating income for the total business declined 6% from the fourth quarter of 2013.","Gross profit margin was up 20 basis points due in large part to our cost savings efforts. During the quarter we funded $5 million of additional brand marketing programs. We recorded $3 million in special charges this quarter related to streamlining activity in EMEA and other regions. Below the operating income line the tax rate was 26%, this was above the 24% tax rate in the fourth quarter of 2013, but below our guidance due to discrete tax items. Based on our outlook we expect a tax rate of 27% to 28% in 2015, this range is an increase from the 26.3% tax rate for fiscal year 2014.","Income from unconsolidated operations rose to $9 million this quarter from $7 million in the fourth quarter of 2013. This performance was led by our joint venture in Mexico which grew sales 8% and is operating in a new more efficient manufacturing facility. We expect this 2014 performance to lead to higher cash dividends paid by this joint venture to McCormick and expect further profit growth as well in 2015. At the bottom-line, adjusted earnings per share for the fourth quarter was a $1.16. As you can see on Slide 28, this was a year-on-year decrease of $0.04 compromised of lower adjusted operating income and a higher tax rate offset impart by the favorable effects of higher joint venture income and lower shares outstanding.","Turning next to Slide 29, we've summarized highlights for cash flow and the year-end balance sheet. Our cash flow from operations in 2014 exceeded $500 million for the first time and increased $38 million from fiscal year 2013. This improvement included higher adjusted net income and the lower pension contribution in 2014. During 2014, we used $244 million of cash to repurchase 3.6 million shares of McCormick stock. At quarter end we had $116 million still available on our $400 million authorization.","Our capital expenditures were approximately 3% of sales. Some of the larger 2014 projects included a plant expansion in Poland and plant modernization for Zatarain\u2019s production in Louisiana. For year-end, we purchased a new office facility in Shanghai to accommodate our growth in China. In 2015, we expect capital expenditures of $130 million to $140 million. This projection includes a new facility to accommodate the growth of our Shanghai manufacturing operations, as well as construction of a production facility in the Middle East to support the expansion of our industrial customers.","Our balance sheet remains sound. We are close to our target debt level and well positioned to fund investments to drive growth including acquisitions. I\u2019ll wrap-up our remarks with McCormick\u2019s 2015 financial outlook. As Alan described, we expect solid growth in sales and profit from our consolidated operations, higher income from unconsolidated operations and the benefit of lower shares outstanding. We expect to grow sales 4% to 6% in local currency to include higher pricing and a 2% to 4% volume increase. Based on prevailing rates foreign currency exchange is expect to lower the sales range by three percentage points. We anticipate a 4% to 5% increase in adjusted operating income from $608 million in 2014 with the projected increase driven by higher sales and at least $85 million of cost savings from both CCI and streamlining actions.","Offsets include projected mid single-digit material cost inflation, unfavorable currency exchange rates, increase retirement benefit expense and an increase of at least 5% in brand marketing. Those of you who have followed us in recent years are aware of fluctuations in retirement benefit expense driven by the actuarial assumption for the discount rate. In 2015, we expect a $10 million increase in this expense due to a lower discount rate along with new U.S. mortality assumptions that reflect a longer life expectancy.","Keep in mind that although we expect an increase in retirement benefit expense, the cash contributions to our plans are expected to be approximately $16 million, which is close to 2014\u2019s low level of contributions. Our projected range for adjusted earnings per share is $3.51 to $3.58. This is an increase of 4% to 6% from adjusted earnings per share of $3.37 in 2014. Along with higher operating income, we anticipate continued growth in joint venture income and further reduction of shares outstanding in the absence of acquisition activity.","At the EPS line, higher retirement benefit expense and unfavorable currency are expected to lower our year-on-year EPS growth rate by about 3% and excluding these factors, our 2015 adjusted EPS guidance is a 7% to 9% increase. For the first quarter of 2015, we expect earnings per share to be up slightly from the year ago period, while our tax rate should be lower than the 31% we recorded in the first quarter of 2014, we expect operating income to be under pressure from currency rates, higher brand marketing, increased retirement expense and the timing of material cost increases versus our pricing actions. For fiscal year 2015, we expect another year of strong cash flow. This will provide funding for the higher dividend approved by the Board in November, as well as capital expenditures and share repurchase activity.","Let's turn now to your questions, then some closing remarks from Alan. Operator, we\u2019re ready for the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Alexia Howard of Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead with your question.","Alexia Howard","So, can I just turn to the U.S. consumer business there seems to be a bit of confusion about the pricing strategy there and what we\u2019re seeing in the Nielsen data versus the price increase I think you mentioned this time around. We\u2019re seeing fairly sharp reductions in price per pound to the tune of about a mid single-digit rate some of that might be negative mix which I think you mentioned, but we\u2019re also just kind of curious about what is actually happening there not just in the quarter, but as we look out to 2015 as you take that next price increase. Are you worried about further share losses to some of those smaller brands and are you confident that the innovation that you\u2019ve got in place is going to allow you to drive that mid single-digit top-line growth overall? Thank you.","Alan Wilson","Sure, there is a couple of things going on there. To first reiterate, we\u2019ve made no changes in list prices in our U.S. business. We increased prices at the end of 2013 and in 2014 we've made no changes in list prices. So a couple of things were happening, one is, what we've seen is that more of our promotional spend in 2014 ended up in the second half of the year. The second is, there is a sizable controlled label which is an extreme value product which we've had in the market with one customer for a long period of time that was pretty heavily promoted in the second half of the year and it shows up as a McCormick brand and it is a brand that we own in the data and so that is driving some of it.","And then in another case we actually took the number of units in our recipe inspirations from six spices in the line to three and reduced the price of that offering, so there is a good bit going on there. We don't plan any price increases at this point in our U.S. consumer business. We're dealing with some commodity inflation with our cost reduction activities and as you saw being more aggressive on that, but we expect to see more stable pricing in our U.S. business. Now we are taking pricing in our industrial businesses to help offset some of the commodity increases and in some of the other markets but in our U.S. business our plan is to hold pricing more stable.","Alexia Howard","Can I just follow-up quickly on that control brand, do you expect that intense promotional activity to continue as we go into 2015 and then I will pass it on? Thank you. ","Alan Wilson","We don't expect it to continue at the level that it has in the second half of the year.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Jonathan Feeney with Athlos Research. Please proceed with your question.","Jonathan Feeney","I wanted to dig in on the consumer volume side, because I was looking at this quarter and I know there was a sort of a seasonal shift last year but the comparison even for the half as a whole got, was relatively easy and the fourth quarter versus third quarter was easier. So I guess my first question on that is, did these sort of volume numbers particularly in the U.S. consumer and Asia-Pac consumer meet your expectations going into the quarter? And secondly I guess as we go into next year you have expressed confidence about sort of a comeback in that top-line like what gives you that confidence within consumer what regions make you feel like presumably that\u2019s going to be -- I think that sales growth is mostly volume driven why there would be that sort of inflection point? Thank you.","Alan Wilson","A couple of things in the U.S. business we did see a better momentum in the second half of the year than we had in the first half to the year and that's a combination of getting traction with some of our category management efforts as well as some of the new products kicking in which we're pleased to see. We actually grew share in recipe mixes that's driving some of the momentum there. And then the number of our markets around the world in France for instance we grew share both in spices and seasonings, as well as in desserts, and so we're pleased with the momentum we have there. UK is a little bit of a tougher competitive market and in China even without the acquisition that acquisition far exceeded expectations but our consumer business in China has continued to grow at double-digit, so we feel pretty good about that. The key effort and the thing that we have to do in order to make this plan is really to get core growth in our U.S. business and in spices and seasonings and that's where a lot of the effort is in this year both in terms of category management as well as innovation.","Jonathan Feeney","So I am interested just to follow-up on that, you felt better versus your plan in the second half versus the first half and I know the headline numbers were better but there is a significant -- I mean the first half of '13 and even if we go back to first half of '12 was stronger at least in U.S. consumer is a lot stronger but you are saying versus your plans second half was stronger than first?","Alan Wilson","I didn't say versus our plan, I said versus the actuals certainly we're -- we believe we have got a lot of work to do still in our U.S. business and we're encouraged by what we saw in the second half but we still believe we've got a lot of work to do.","Operator","Our next question is in line of Robert Moskow, Credit Suisse. Please go ahead with your question.","Robert Moskow","A kind of a follow-up to Jon's question, your guidance for 4 to 6 sales growth and organically the Company hasn't done better than 2 for the last two years. So I guess you are right Alan I mean you need to get big market share gains in order to achieve this plan and it has to come in from the U.S. Can you give us an update on how many of your customers have adopted this category management strategy that you have rolled out, I think last quarter you said that you were targeting 60% of the ACV you thought you were half way there, have you made any progress in that regard? And then also have there been any losses in that kind of metric, have there been any customers who have moved further towards private label?","Alan Wilson","I wouldn't say we've seen and actually what we've seen in the recent periods is that private label has actually declined a bit and the traction has come from some of the smaller brands but really small brands. And I would say that we're continuing to tell that story, I don\u2019t have a number in terms of is it -- and we are now at 70% of ACV, but what I would say is we\u2019re continuing to gain traction with the story to get sharper price points on the shelf, again that sharper price points not because we\u2019ve taken reduction, but because we\u2019ve applied trade promotions more tactically and because we\u2019re working with the customers to make sure we have the right mix of pricing on the shelf. We\u2019re continuing to see the category fragment, there is lots of competition and we\u2019re continuing to work to build our share of shelf along with our share of voice in advertising.","Gordon Stetz","The only thing I would add Rob, this is Gordon is in the discussion we talked about healthy category growth rate. So it's not even necessarily true that we\u2019ve got to have large market share gains, we just need to continue to grow with category growth rates and we hit those numbers.","Robert Moskow","But the category you said is growing about 1% right now in the U.S.?","Gordon Stetz","No, about 3%.","Alan Wilson","We said overall the category on a global basis is going to be growing in mid single-digits.","Robert Moskow","Okay, so 3% in the U.S. is the expectation?","Alan Wilson","Yes.","Gordon Stetz","Yes.","Robert Moskow","Okay. And then one follow-up just, I think you mentioned a value brand that you control and is showing up in the Nielsen data as being very heavily promoted, but what caused that heavy promotion on that brand, was it the retailers doing it and you do have any control in the future over whether they continue to do that? It can\u2019t be helpful to your core McCormick business when that happens.","Alan Wilson","Yes, it was a specific retailer strategy that implemented and we\u2019re working with them on making sure that we\u2019re maximizing the category.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Growe with Stifel. Please go ahead with your question.","Chris Growe","Hi, just had a question for if I could, in relation to the cost inflation coming through this year you gave some of the inputs where that\u2019s going through pepper being about half of the increase that would cut across both consumer and industrial. I think you said you're not going to take some pricing in U.S. consumer, so should we expect the balance of 2% pricing across the remaining divisions, I mean Europe consumer, Asia consumer as well as the industrial business or is there one division that\u2019s more heavily influenced by that?","Alan Wilson","Now it's going to be pretty balance between the industrial and consumer segments and given the fact that we\u2019re not taking it in the U.S., you\u2019ll see pricing elsewhere in the world and the other markets on the consumer side.","Chris Growe","Okay. And then just to go back to the question Alexia asked about the promotional spending being higher at least in the data that we see. I know there were some timing elements both to prior year and to this year should we expect any incremental promotional spending to continue? And I guess if I could ask the related question, if you look at your spending this quarter on marketing being up around $5 million I think you\u2019ve been talking something closer to 11 million or more, was there any shift more so to promotion versus to advertising and would that continue in '15?","Alan Wilson","No, we expect - we\u2019re going to continue part of our promotion is volume driven and so that of what you saw a little bit was a reduction in volume versus expectation, so we didn\u2019t get the volume hit, so we didn\u2019t take the spending. But we\u2019re not expecting a change in how we balance it. In fact what we\u2019re trying to do is drive more efficient promotion spending than we have.","Gordon Stetz","And I\u2019d just point out for fiscal year '14 the advertising component of the increase was the vast majority. We were up 15 million year-on-year on an advertising basis. So a lot of the activity is still continuing to drive innovation in the brand equity.","Chris Growe","It was less than expected in the fourth quarter though, is that correct, is there any change to your views on advertising in the quarter?","Gordon Stetz","No, we pretty much around the advertising campaigns that we\u2019re planned, we execute it against those to Alan\u2019s point some of the more volume-related promotional events fell out of the quarter, but the advertising programs were left intact.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Ken Goldman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question.","Ken Goldman","Hey thanks for the question and Lawrence congratulations on a promotion.","Lawrence Kurzius","Thank you.","Ken Goldman","So Alan you talked about in the U.S. getting prices on shelf more in line with where you think is ideal for the category. And I think you\u2019ve touched on this a little bit, but are we where we need to be or do you think customers still need to make some adjustments either up or down to kind of get an ideal revenue and profit dollar point at this point?","Alan Wilson","No, there is still work to do on the shelf and some of it is driven by the fact that there is an awful lot of value priced product. That isn\u2019t necessarily doing anything for the category, it\u2019s creating more fragmentation and so what we want to do is make sure that we are telling the story that we\u2019re giving consumers what they are looking for and that we\u2019re getting our absolute price points to the level that makes the most sense.","Ken Goldman","Okay. And then following up is the M&A environment is it a bit more challenging than usual for you, I maybe wrong but I can\u2019t recall McCormick really talking this aggressively about share buybacks in the past. And I think usually your target is 1% to 2% this year it\u2019s 2 you're being vocal about returning cash to shareholders. So, I guess I am just wondering are you maybe suggesting that alternate uses of cash are not as attractive at the moment or am I, I guess just reading too much into that?","Alan Wilson","No, I would say that we do have a very active pipeline and we're working hard as we always do on acquisitions just like we always have when we don't have an acquisition eminent, we will continue our share buyback and if it's a small acquisition we will continue it but if it's a larger one we may curtail it for a bit, but we're not signaling anything at all with that, we've got some very attractive acquisition candidates that we're continuing to work on.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from the line of Eric Katzman with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Eric Katzman","I guess I want to follow-up on the inflation question. Gordon you highlighted that material cost inflation was up I guess mid single-digit and I just assume you are talking about the pure raw spices and seasonings but it would seem that there is a lot of other things that are actually beneficial whether it's just pure energy or derivatives such as like the bottles and the packaging. So when you look at I guess overall inflation for fiscal '15 what's your expectation?","Gordon Stetz","Well just to remind the Group of 80% of our cost of goods sold is raw and packaging, so it's an overwhelming factor as we -- relates to our overall cost structure. So the mid single-digit really is the driver on our margin. There will be obviously some benefit in freight rates we classify that more down in SG&A but it's not going to material enough to really offset what approximates $100 million increase in our raw material cost. So I wouldn't -- and that's why we're leaning heavily into our old CCI programs to try and help offset all this.","Eric Katzman","Okay. And then I guess the -- it sounds like at this point Alan that you are very reluctant, you are willing to take some pricing on the back of that inflation whether it's a consumer outside the U.S. but there is some industrial pass-through, I guess at what point in the U.S. do you feel that you need to, we don't really have a lot of visibility into some of those kind of more esoteric crops I mean is pepper -- I guess is the bias on pepper and vanilla and some of these other things up and that we have to worry about you taking pricing I just don\u2019t have a lot of visibility into those crops?","Alan Wilson","Well it's more around what drives the elasticity of our volumes. And so typically what we've been able to do is pass-through the commodity inflation but because we've seen such extreme volatility and especially with pepper that\u2019s the one drives McCormick more than anything else, over the last five years it's up by a factor of five. And so we feel like we're getting to a price point where it's pretty stretched and so we're looking at other tools to try to offset that and it's largely behind our cost reduction at this point. Now we don't think that we aren't going to be able to take pricing forever and ever but where we're at this point with the category and the competition is we feel like it's prudent that we're not taking pricing at this point.","Eric Katzman","Okay. And then last quarter on the U.S. retail strategy I think in the past you had alluded to some of the competition that had made gains they were finding space in other parts of the store such as like the produce aisle, is part of your strategy and are you having success in kind of getting your items out of the or in addition to the center of the store but getting placement in other areas and is that one of the reasons why you think you can maintain or recover share in fiscal '15?","Alan Wilson","We're getting products off this -- not just in the spice set but into other parts of the store where we have found competition and I will ask Lawrence to kind of weigh in a little bit on this.","Lawrence Kurzius","And well of course from a merchandising standpoint this has always been part of our program and it has received a particular emphasis. And in light of this competitive situation and certainly if you go into any retailer in the U.S. during the holiday season you will find that McCormick products are scattered throughout the store and then are pretty prominent. A great deal of our innovation efforts also in this second half of last year and into 2015 are targeted towards getting us into some of those other parts of the store as well or really negating the reason for being for those brands those minor brands that have found their way into some of the niches. A big part of our win at retail effort and category management effort also is to bring this presence of other small brands in other parts of the store to the attention of the category buyer who often doesn't have the full picture from a profit standpoint of the impact of those brands on the spice category in total for the store because those small brands go through other cost profit centers and the retailer.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The next question is from the line of Rob Dickerson, Consumer Edge Research. Please go ahead with your question.","Rob Dickerson","Just a couple of questions, the first question I guess is just Q4, I know in Q3 you gave down the operating profit income for the year but then you said, you missed the original guidance for the year and that was partially because of just a mix shift and faster growing in some of your markets and the margin differential in both et cetera. But then what was the real the miss in Q4, because it seems like in Q4 you grew consumer more quickly than industrial and within consumer you grew the Americas more quickly than what I would pursue to be your lower margin international business. So then -- and you also seemed as if you also pulled back a bit relative to reach the expectations that we had on the marketing side. So I am just trying to bridge the gap between expectation in Q3 for the year for operating profit growth and then what you actually reported?","Gordon Stetz","Yes, as we said in the remarks, we\u2019re very pleased with the progress we made in the U.S. consumer business but it was not up to the expectation we had in thinking when we gave you the guidance at the end of Q3. And obviously that\u2019s a big profit generator in Q4 and as a result that was one of the main factors impacting the results versus what we were guiding to.","Rob Dickerson","And then the second question is just, I know in your Q3 call and I may have missed it. [Technical Difficulty] I just said on the Q3 call you had mentioned ACV or there was an acceptance rate of the new pricing program or the new strategic dynamics so to speak for the business and it seems like we\u2019re only just in the Americas from the retailers. And I guess the one question I just had was what is the push back from the ones that haven\u2019t accepted it, what\u2019s the reluctance for not accepting the new program?","Alan Wilson","Some of it\u2019s just timing and our programs and our selling proposition is really different in the fourth quarter than it is the rest of the year because it's so promotionally driven and making sure that we have the holiday execution. And so we\u2019re back in with that whole category management discussion. Now the push back hasn\u2019t been aggressive because we\u2019ve a pretty rational story to tell, it's more as Lawrence said getting the category managers to understand where things are eroding in other departments not necessarily their cost centers.","Rob Dickerson","And then just, I mean it's a question, I am not sure again if you mentioned on the call, but was there a I guess two targets one on gross margin for fiscal '15 and then two was there a target for incremental marketing spend? Thank you.","Alan Wilson","We did not provide any gross margin targets and the incremental marketing target is at least a 5% increase year-over-year.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Akshay Jagdale with KeyBanc. Please go ahead with your question.","Akshay Jagdale","My question is on cost savings, obviously on the CCI side you\u2019ve done a great job and you have aggressive targets for '15 and I know in the past you\u2019ve done some studies on your SG&A as well, because optically it looks pretty high relative to the average for the industry. Can you talk about just the cost savings opportunity that lies perhaps potentially in the SG&A line because given the current environment obviously there is a lot of focus on cost savings in general? Thank you.","Alan Wilson","Sure, we recognize the opportunity that lies there, I mean some of the drivers on the line in general is our global scale which adds complexity and we have joint ventures below the line which require management resources. So those are factors we do want to remind people that require management resources and don\u2019t end up in a percentage in net sales because it's all below the line. But having said that, we continue to look at how we can become more efficient as well as effective through a faster streamlining of our decisions and more consolidation of back offices. In the more recent activities you are well aware of what we talked about for our European organization last year that is part of the guidance that we have this year as we continue into a shared service environment there, as well as more recently announced North American actions that align more effectively under the structure that we have now which again results in efficiencies in our decision making there. So it's a balancing act to make sure that we are being aggressive on that line, but at the same time we are growing categories and we want to make sure we\u2019re putting proper resources behind the growth that these categories enjoy.","Akshay Jagdale","That\u2019s helpful, just one follow-up. Can you give us an update on India and where you stand with that acquisition and the plans that you had in place?","Alan Wilson","Yes, we\u2019re building our supply chain capabilities there, we\u2019ve introduced some of the value-added products and we\u2019re seeing those getting traction in the marketplace. Obviously, we\u2019d like to see progress faster, but we\u2019re doing the things that we laid out when we made the acquisition and feel like we can see a positive path forward\u2026","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen please stand-by we're experiencing technical difficulty, so once again please stand-by.","Alan Wilson","I am sorry actually, are you there?","Akshay Jagdale","I am there, yes.","Alan Wilson","Sorry somehow our phone disconnected, so I am not sure how much of my answer you got. What I was saying you is we believe that India is a long-term investment and a long-term growth engine for McCormick. We\u2019d like to see progress faster but we've done the things that we laid out in the acquisition which is moving the more value-added products, getting our supply chain and our supply base in good order to be able to grow the business and service the customers but we're not pleased with the progress and we believe that we can do better there.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of David Driscoll with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.","David Driscoll","I wanted to ask a little bit more, I know this has been talked about quite a lot, but in the United States you have seen a 70 basis point share loss in the spice category but more broadly going back over the last four years of our new AOC plus the Nielsen data it\u2019s a 330 basis point decline in market share for McCormick. The question is when I see share losses that large and ongoing share losses there is just a concern that fundamentally these price gaps really need to be put into a different place and that you should take a price decline. Can you respond it out and how do you think about these share losses, am I too concerned about this multi-year stretch of share losses?","Alan Wilson","No, we're concerned as well and that's why we're taking the actions that we are and we feel like we're doing a lot of the right kinds of things, we're driving innovation, we're talking to customers, we're talking to consumers and so we take this very seriously. We're in a growing category and through history we've always been the driver of growth in the category and we expect that we're going to do that. But we're not happy with the performance that we've had the last couple of years and we're doing things differently.","David Driscoll","Maybe just a final question is that on the long-term guidance the 9% to 11%, so including the 2015 expectations that you laid out you will have three straight years of missing the long-term EPS of 9 to 11 compounded rate in these three year period it would be about 5.5% I think you said in your prepared script the five year historical number was 8%. Why not reduce the long-term guidance, do you give much thought of that, is the long-term guidance just kind of a flag pole out there or how hardcore are you about that stuff?","Alan Wilson","What we really do is focus on what we need to do in the current year and as you know it's been pretty volatile. And as we think about where we're very long-term, we believe that this business should generate that kind of growth. We should be able to do the sales growth that we talk about with an acquisition or with a steady stream of acquisitions. Our acquisition record over the last couple of years has not been as consistent, so we've had -- the acquisitions we've made have been good but we haven't done one every year as our long-term guidance would suggest.","The second thing is we've had so much volatility over the last five years in cost. As I said earlier pepper is up 500% basically in the last five years and so we've had to deal with a lot of volatility. And then the other pieces are the ups and downs of things like pension expense and those sorts of things. What we're really focused on is making sure that we're running the businesses the right way that we're driving the category and driving growth to be able to perform that way.","So we do discuss the long-term goals, we lay out plans that we believe will hit it and then we adjust year-on-year based on what's actually happening in our, both our cost structure and with our customers. I will say the two changes that I think you are seeing for McCormick right now is we're being more aggressive on cost because we recognize we have to do that and secondly we're being aggressive in the marketplace with our customers. And in terms of bringing them ideas and bringing them lots of programs to help drive growth in the business.","David Driscoll","I think bringing comfort to the shares situation is critical for your investor base, it's very hard to see these kinds of share losses and then to know how the Company can achieve those long-term guidance targets and I just say that for maybe future calls. I will leave it there and thank you for the comments.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Andrew Lazar","Just to two quick questions on some of your smaller brands that you have talked that have been gaining share, just so I am clear on it. I guess first is what is the selling point or proposition do you think that they are using with retail customers to actually get this space on the shelf. And then I guess more importantly, once they have gotten some of that placement and we see that in the shares, what\u2019s the velocity of those items off of the shelf, are they actually delivering anything for these retail customers at the end of the day or does that make your case ultimately easier once you have the data to be able to go back to your customers with?","Alan Wilson","Yes, the selling proposition is a couple, one is, either an ethnic brand that will appeal to a different customer. I was in stores this weekend and walking through and I saw a Caribbean brand, I saw more of a Southern ethnic style brand, I saw Hispanic brands, I saw things that had meat rings that are for the ring goes to the meat department as opposed to the core category. So there is a lot of those sorts of things that people are using as selling propositions. Typically the velocity of those individual SKUs or even of those brands is much lower than what we see at McCormick and so that\u2019s a big part of our category story is to the trade you don\u2019t necessarily need all this fragmentation. There is certainly some, there is a value consumer, there is a premium consumer and then there is a consumer who is looking for things in the middle, we serve all those needs and so what we\u2019re trying to help them with is, understanding the impact on their inventory levels and the velocity of what is actually happening in the category. So, we are telling that store, but there is a lot of different stories as to why brands are finding their way into the market.","Andrew Lazar","I guess just I guess from your perspective you believe you have enough of those options if you will for consumers and the retailers in terms of what they are looking for, so it's some much easier as we all know to create brands now and create disruptive sorts of brands whether it's social media and all that, and I guess wanted your perspective on do you feel you have enough of those sorts of options out there or do there need to some additional activity from you even if it's outside to sort of standard McCormick brand proposition?","Alan Wilson","And we are doing some of that kind of thing, as for instance with our bag brand, seven of the 10 that grew share in the last period were bagged spices. We have a bag brand with our Mojave Foods line and so we are using some of those as well as these controlled value players to as fighter brands to some of those. So there is a strategy there, but it\u2019s not unique to the spice and seasonings category, we\u2019re seeing it across food.","Alan Wilson","Since there is no further questions, I want to thank everybody who participated in today\u2019s call. Consumer demand for flavor remains strong, our geographic presence and our product portfolio are aligned with the move towards healthy eating, fresh ingredients, ethnic cuisines and bold tastes. We\u2019re investing in marketing and innovation to drive sales and in a competitive environment working with our customers to win at retail. We\u2019re stepping up our cost reduction activities and plan to use these savings to offset higher costs and invest in our brands. In 2015, we expect to deliver solid sales growth, higher profits and strong cash flow. We look forward to reporting to you on our continued progress in the upcoming quarters.","Joyce Brooks","Thanks, Alan and I\u2019d also like to thank those who joined us this morning.

Thank you for joining today's Second Quarter Earnings Call. To accompany this call, we have posted a set of slides at ir.mccormick.com. Currently, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following our remarks, we will begin a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] We'll begin with remarks from Lawrence Kurzius, Chairman, President and CEO; and Mike Smith, Executive Vice President and CFO.","During our remarks, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. These include information in constant currency as well as adjusted operating income, adjusted income tax rate and adjusted earnings per share that exclude the impact of special charges; and for 2018, transaction and integration expenses related to the acquisition of our Frank's and French's brands as well as the net non-recurring income tax benefit associated with the December 2017 U.S. tax reform legislation. Reconciliations to the GAAP results are included in this morning's press release and slides.","In our comments, certain percentages are rounded. Please refer to our presentation which includes the complete information. In addition, as a reminder, today's presentation contains projections and other forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those projected. The Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statement, whether because of new information, future events or other factors. As seen on Slide 2, our forward-looking statement also provides information on risk factors that could affect our financial results.","It is now my pleasure to turn the discussion over to Lawrence.","Lawrence Kurzius","Thank you, Kasey. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Our solid second quarter results were in line with our expectations, and as we enter the second and most significant half of our year, we are confident in our growth trajectory and that we are well positioned to deliver strong results in 2019.","Our successful execution of our strategies and engagement of employees around the world have driven sales, operating profit and adjusted EPS growth, as well as operating margin expansion in both the second quarter and year-to-date.","Starting on Slide 4, our broad and advantaged global flavor portfolio continues to position us to meet the demand for flavor around the world and grow our business. Among our second quarter highlights across our portfolio, we drove growth in our Consumer segment base business and through new products in all regions, including Zatarain's meal solutions and frozen entrees and UK rapid recipe mixes. The Americas Frank's RedHot sauce continues its strong performance and we're also gaining momentum with Frank's internationally.","In our Flavor Solution segment, our Americas and EMEA regions drove significant growth in flavors, branded foodservice and condiments with strong contributions from both new products and the base business. We are confident our breadth and reach will continue to differentiate McCormick and will be the foundation of our sales growth as consumers demand for flavor continues to rise.","Now let me go into more detail on our second quarter performance as seen on Slide 5, as well as provide some business comments before turning it over to Mike, who will go more in depth on the quarter end results and discuss our 2019 financial guidance. ","Starting with our topline for the second quarter. Second quarter sales were comparable to the year ago period, including a 3% unfavorable impact from currency. In constant currency, sales grew 3% for the total company, with both segments growing sales in each of our three regions. This growth was attributable to higher volume and product mix as well as pricing and it was entirely organic driven by the base business and new products as we had no acquisition impact in the quarter.","In our Consumer segment, sales declined 1% including a 3% unfavorable impact from currency. In constant currency, sales grew 2%. In our Flavor Solution segment, sales grew 1%, and in constant currency grew 4%.","In addition to our topline growth, we grew adjusted operating income and expanded our adjusted operating margin. With our higher sales and cost savings led by our Comprehensive Continuous Improvement program, CCI, we grew the second quarter's adjusted operating income 5% or 8% in constant currency and expanded our adjusted operating margin 80 basis points.","At the bottom line, our second quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.16 was 14% higher than $1.02 in the second quarter of 2018, driven primarily by our adjusted operating income growth and a lower adjusted tax rate, and this 14% adjusted earnings per share growth includes an unfavorable impact from currency.","Our second quarter results were solid and we continue to expect another year of strong performance in 2019. We are reaffirming our sales outlook and as Mike will explain in detail, we are updating our operating profit outlook and increasing our earnings per share outlook.","I'd like to turn now to some business updates, with the focus this morning on highlights from our Consumer and Flavor Solutions segments and update on our business transformation activities and our business momentum that reinforces our confidence in the remainder of the year.","Starting on Slide 6 with our Consumer segment. As I just mentioned, we grew constant currency sales 2% with increases in each of our three regions. In the Americas, we grew constant currency sales 2%, driven by higher volume and product mix. A late Easter which delayed the start of grilling season tempered sales growth for the quarter. We estimate our consumption growth for the quarter, including both measured and unmeasured channels was 2%.","Our IRI data indicates U.S. spice and seasoning scanner sales through multi-outlets grew 2% for the category and 1% from McCormick branded. While the late grilling start slowed the category growth, it had a greater impact on our consumption. We again had strong growth in unmeasured channels, including club, e-commerce and Hispanic retail chains.","Our category management initiatives, effective marketing support, merchandising the execution, expanded distribution and new products contributed to drive consumption growth across our Americas Consumer Portfolio. McCormick branded dry recipe mixes and Stubb's barbecue continued their momentum of consumption and share growth.","Zatarain's frozen items, both base business and new products drove growth. Frank's RedHot sauce continued strong performance with distribution gains with total distribution points hitting a record high and with our category management initiatives and focused marketing support French's Mustard grew consumption and share. We believe these actions will continue to drive consumption and sales growth in the second half of the year.","Now turning to Europe, Middle East and Africa, the EMEA region. Constant currency growth was driven by very strong promotional programs and targeted brand marketing across the region. Expanded distribution and new products were also growth drivers.","We had broad based growth across most of the region, including strength in Eastern Europe. We're excited by our continued momentum on new product launches and the successes we've realized to date with more flavors and varieties to come as well as further distribution expansion.","In the Asia-Pacific region, we've built further momentum with Frank's and French's, particularly in China, India and Australia. The foundation we continue to establish while still early days is driving the results. Although growth in the region has been partially impacted by recent macroeconomic pressures in China, our fundamentals across the region remain strong.","Turning now to Slide 7. In our Flavor Solution segment, our sales performance was strong. Our constant currency sales growth was 4% driven by higher volume and product mix on base business as well as new products. We're continuing to win with our customers through new products, expanded distribution and promotional activities.","In the Americas, we drove constant currency sales growth of 3%. We had strong sales growth to quick service restaurants as well as in our flavor product category. Our flavor sales were driven by snack seasonings, partially due to new products at our customers\u2019 promotions and by products that deliver the clean label and better-for-you attributes our customers are seeking.","We also had strong branded foodservice growth, driven by increased distribution with national and regional customers, promotional activity with operators and expansion in emerging channels. In branded foodservice, we continue to realize the benefit of leveraging our full portfolio of McCormick spices and seasonings and Frank's French's and Cattlemen\u2019s products across operators.","Our strong momentum in EMEA was once again reflected in our second quarter results. Sales growth was outstanding, 9% in constant currency, and it was broad based across the portfolio both from a product category and customer perspective. We drove sales growth to quick service restaurants, partially due to their strong promotional activities and to packaged food companies with new products being a key driver.","Turning now to Slide 8. As we've previously discussed, most recently at CAGNY, we are making investments to build the McCormick of the future, including in our Global Enablement organization to transform McCormick through globally aligned innovative services enabling the business to grow. As technology provides the backbone for this greater process alignment, information sharing and scalability, we're also making investments in our information systems.","We have progressed our ERP replacement program and accelerated the transformation of our ways of working. This will enable us to realize the benefits of a scalable platform for growth sooner. We have estimated the total cost of our ERP investment to range between $150 million and $200 million from 2019 through the anticipated completion of our global rollout in fiscal 2021. The capital spend portion is estimated to be $90 million to $120 million, and program expenses $60 million to $80 million. Mike will discuss this further in his remarks.","Next, as we are at the midpoint of the year, I'd like to share a few comments about the momentum we are carrying into the balance of the year. Our largest quarters are ahead of us and as we have remarked previously, our operating profit growth is weighted towards the second half of our year.","As seen on Slide 9, our confidence for the second half has bolstered first buyer plans for a strong Americas fall and holiday season, partially driven by a significant increase in brand marketing. We continue to optimize our brand marketing spend, both in terms of working and non-working mix, as well as in timing, increasing our effectiveness and getting more value out of each marketing dollar. We've intentionally skewed our brand marketing spend to be heavier later in the year to maximize our ROI and support the key holiday period.","Additionally, we have robust brand marketing investments planned in support of the significant array of new products we've launched across all regions during our first half and are now gaining momentum in distribution, and we have exciting additional new product launches in our second half.","This new product line-up includes in the U.S. street tacos, following the successful UK street food launch, complete meal seasonings, a package of complementary seasonings for our consumers' protein, vegetables and starch, and Thai Kitchen coconut milk in a resealable tetra package.","In EMEA, in addition to flavor and geographic extensions, we'll be launching premium grinders, and in China, we're launching a full range of big texture salad dressings and light meal sauces. Our confidence is also driven by new distribution we've successfully secured, realizing the benefits of distribution gain throughout the first half of the year across both our Consumer and Flavor Solutions segments. And in Flavor Solutions, we expect continued momentum and wins with our customers through new product and promotional activities.","Finally, as we've mentioned previously, we will be lapping several one-time items which impacted us unfavorably in late 2018, such as the unusual fourth quarter impacts we had in the Americas Consumer business and our move to a new global headquarters. We're excited about our plans and confident in delivering strong sales growth in our second half as well as significant profit realization, while continuing to invest in the business.","Now I'd like to provide a few summary comments as seen on Slide 10 before turning it over to Mike. At the foundation of our sales growth, which is the rising consumer demand for flavor, we are aligned with the consumers increased interest in bolder flavors, demand for convenience and focus on fresh, natural ingredients, as well as with the emerging purchased drivers such as greater transparency around the sourcing and quality of food.","With this increased interest, flavor continues to be an advantage to global category which combined with our execution against effective strategies will drive strong results. We have a solid foundation in an environment that continues to be dynamic and fast pace. We are ensuring we remain agile, relevant and focused on sustainable growth. Our experienced leaders and employees are executing against our strategies which are designed to build long-term value for our shareholders.","Our second quarter financial results across both our Consumer and Flavor Solutions segments contributed to a great first half of the fiscal year. Our fundamentals are strong and we're confident the initiatives we have underway position us to continue our growth trajectory.","We're balancing our resources and efforts to drive sales for the work to lower cost to build fuel for growth and higher margin, while making the investments in our future. We have confidence in our updated fiscal year outlook and we are well positioned to deliver another strong year for 2019. We remain excited as we enter our second half and continue to drive results. Around the world, McCormick employees are driving our momentum and success, and I thank them for their efforts and engagement.","Thank you for your attention, and it is now my pleasure to turn it over to Mike for additional remarks on our second quarter financial results and our updated 2019 outlook.","Michael Smith","Thanks, Lawrence, and good morning everyone. As Lawrence indicated, we delivered a solid second quarter results in line with our expectations. I'll begin with a discussion of our results and then follow with details of our full year 2019 financial outlook.","Starting on Slide 12, we grew sales 3% in constant currency, and as Lawrence mentioned earlier, this was entirely organic growth driven by the base business and new products, as we had no acquisition impact in the quarter. Both our Consumer and Flavor Solutions segments delivered topline constant currency growth in each of our three regions. The Consumer segment grew sales 2% in constant currency. This growth was driven by all three regions and was attributable to expanded distribution, new products and pricing.","On Slide 13, Consumer segment sales in the Americas rose 2% in constant currency versus the second quarter of 2018. This increase was driven by higher volume and product mix, including the Zatarain's products, Frank's RedHot sauces, branded extracts and our branded Hispanic products, partially tempered by the delayed grilling season start.","In EMEA, constant currency consumer sales were up 1% from a year ago. Higher volume and product mix were driven by new products, distribution gains and promotional activities. This growth was partially offset by a decline in private label as well as pricing actions, including those related to plans, trade, promotional activity for new products.","We grew consumer sales in the Asia-Pacific region 3% with growth in India and Australia driven by our marketing programs, as well as expanded distribution. Additionally, China pricing actions were partially offset by related volume impacts, as well as the macro economic pressures Lawrence mentioned earlier.","Turning to our Flavor Solutions segment in Slide 16. We grew second quarter constant currency sales 4%, with growth in all three regions led by strength in EMEA. In the Americas, Flavor Solutions constant currency sales increased 3%, with broad-based growth across the portfolio, excluding a decline in bulk ingredients. New products, expanded distribution and our customer promotional activities all contributed to the sales increase.","In EMEA, we grew Flavor Solutions sales 9% in constant currency across both packaged food companies and quick service restaurants, partially due to their promotional activity. This growth was driven by new products, pricing and base business volume growth and spanned all categories.","In the Asia-Pacific region, Flavor Solutions sales in constant currency grew 2% versus the year ago period, as higher sales to quick service restaurants were partially driven by the timing of the promotional activities. Across both segments, adjusted operating income, which excludes special charges, and for 2018, the transaction and integration costs related to the acquisition of our Frank's and French's brands rose 5% in the second quarter versus the year ago period and excluding the impact of unfavorable currency rose 8%.","Adjusted operating income in the Consumer segment rose to $138 million, a 7% increase. Adjusted operating income in the Flavor Solutions segment rose to $77 million, a 2% increase. In constant currency, adjusted operating income increased 9% in Consumer segment and 5% in the Flavor Solutions segment. In both segments, the increase was primarily driven by CCI-led cost savings, higher sales and lower brand marketing expenses.","The impact of these drivers in the Flavor Solutions segment was partially offset by an unfavorable transactional impact of foreign currency exchange rates, as well as unfavorable mix related to a sales shift in quick service restaurants from limited time offers to core menu items. As seen on Slide 21. In the second quarter, we increased gross profit margin 30 basis points year-on-year, driven by CCI-led cost savings.","Our selling, general and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales decreased by 50 basis points from the second quarter of 2018. This decrease was primarily driven by lower brand marketing investments, which is more as mentioned earlier is partially driven by timing. And through our new marketing excellence organization, we are increasing our efficiency and speed, as well as realizing brand marketing CCI through the creation of in-house services and consolidated media buys.","As a reminder, while our first half brand marketing is lower than last year, we are planning to spend brand marketing comparable to 2018, partially by reinvesting our continued marketing excellence cost savings and non-working media spend reductions into working media. Therefore, we are planning brand marketing increases in our second half.","SG&A leverage gain from CCI-led cost saving initiatives and a one-time global benefit plan alignment was offset by business transformation expenses driven by our ERP platform replacement. In fiscal year 2019, we expect the ERP expenses to be concentrated in our second and third quarters. The combination of the gross margin expansion and the overall SG&A leverage resulted in an adjusted operating margin expansion of 80 basis points for the second quarter of 2019.","Turning to income taxes on Slide 22. Our second quarter adjusted effective income tax rate was percent 18.9% as compared to 22.2% in the year ago period. Our second quarter adjusted rate was favorably impacted by discrete tax items, principally due to stock option exercises.","As we have discussed in previous quarters, favorable tax rate impacts of option exercises are partially offset by payroll and social related taxes which unfavorably impacted operating profit. Considering the year-to-date favorable impact from discrete items, we now expect our full year 2019 adjusted effective tax rate to be approximately 21%. There can be volatility in that rate quarter-to-quarter due to the unpredictability of discrete items, changes to our forecast and mix of earnings, and interpretation of regulations continuing to be released clarifying the impacts of the 2017 U.S. Tax Act.","Income from unconsolidated operations was $10 million compared to $7 million in the second quarter of 2018, a 28% increase, driven by excellent performance by our McCormick de Mexico joint venture. For 2019, we now expect a high single-digit increase in our income from unconsolidated operations.","At the bottom line, as shown on Slide 24, second quarter 2019 adjusted earnings per share was $1.16, up 14% from $1.02 for the year-ago period, primarily due to growth in our operating performance, including from our joint ventures and a lower adjusted income tax rate and this increase included an unfavorable impact from currency.","The Company continues to generate strong cash flow. On Slide 25, we summarized highlights for cash flow in the quarter end balance sheet. Our cash flow provided from operations was $314 million through the second quarter of 2019 compared to $235 million in the first half of 2018. Our strong operating cash flow was driven by higher operating income and our continued working capital initiatives.","As we execute against program to achieve working capital reductions, including inventory management programs, we continue to see improvements in our cash conversion cycle, finishing the second quarter down six days versus our fiscal year-end. A portion of this cash was used to pay down $88 million of acquisition debt as the Company continues to focus on paying down debt.","As we have maintained our disciplined acquisition strategy with a focus on paying down debt, we finished the second quarter with a debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio below 4x, which is pacing us ahead of our target of 3x by the end of 2020.","So as Lawrence mentioned during the first quarter earnings call, while our priority is paying down debt, it is also time for us to start exploring acquisition opportunities, which represent a key part of our long-term growth strategy. In the first half of fiscal 2019, we returned $151 million of cash to shareholders through dividends and used $54 million for capital expenditures this period.","We expect 2019 to be another year of strong cash flow driven by profit and working capital initiatives, and our priority is to continue to have a balance use of cash, making investments to drive growth, returning a significant portion to our shareholders through dividends and to pay down debt.","Let's now move to our current financial outlook for 2019 on Slide 26. We continue to expect another year of strong performance in 2019 with our broad and advantage flavor portfolio, effective growth strategies and focus on profit realization. We are reaffirming our sales outlook and updating our operating profit and earnings per share outlook.","We continue to estimate based on prevailing rates, a 2 percentage point unfavorable impact from currency rates on net sales, adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share. We also continue to expect the unfavorable currency will be greater in the first half of the year than in the second half.","At the topline, we reaffirm our guidance to grow sales 1% to 3%, which in constant currency is a 3% to 5% projected growth rate. As a reminder, this will be entirely organic growth, driven primarily by higher volume and product mix as well as the impact of pricing to offset an anticipated low single-digit cost increase. We continue to project our 2019 gross profit margin to be 25 basis points to 75 basis points higher than in 2018 in part driven by our CCI-led cost savings.","We're now expecting our adjusted operating income growth to be 6% to 8% from $930 million in 2018, which in constant currency is an 8% to 10% projected growth rate, remaining above our long-term objective, and reflects our continued focus on profit realization. Our cost savings target remains approximately $110 million and we expect brand marketing to be comparable to 2018.","Our updated adjusted operating income growth rate continues to reflect expected strong performance. The decrease from the outlook last year during our March earnings call reflects the impacts of the classification shift in our ERP spending, the operating expense headwind related to option exercises which partially offsets the tax benefit and global developments including trade and economic conditions in selected countries.","As Lawrence mentioned, we have progressed in our ERP replacement program and while our estimated total 2019 project investment related to this business transformation has remained unchanged.","We now expect a lower 2019 capital spend component and higher operating expenses than we had originally expected for 2019. Resulting from this classification shift, we are lowering our 2019 capital spend outlook to approximately $200 million, and our 2019 updated operating profit outlook reflects the increased expense. We are excited about this investment to enable us to transform our ways of working and realize the benefits of a scalable growth platform.","We are increasing our guidance for 2019 adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $5.20 to $5.30, which compares to $4.97 of adjusted earnings per share in 2018 and represents a 5% to 7% increase, or in constant currency, 7% to 9%. This increase reflects the impact of changes I previously mentioned, our updated adjusted operating income outlook, the expected increase in income from unconsolidated operations and the projected lower adjusted effective tax rate.","In summary, we continue to project strong growth in our 2019 constant currency outlook for sales, adjusted operating profit and adjusted earnings per share, following record double-digit performance across each objective in 2018 and while continuing to invest for future growth.","I'd like to now turn it back to Lawrence for some additional remarks before we move to your questions.","Lawrence Kurzius","Thank you, Mike. Now that Mike has shared our financial results and outlook in more detail, I'd like to recap the key takeaways as seen on Slide 27. We are delivering against our plans, both for sales and profit realization and are confident in the momentum of our business. With our year-to-date results, we have a strong start to the year.","Moving into our second half, we're confident in our plans, including brand marketing support, new product launches and new distribution which will drive further growth. Our 2019 outlook continues to reflect strong operating performance. And finally, we are sustainably positioned for growth and are continuing to deliver differentiated results while also investing to build the McCormick of the future.","Now let's turn to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. At this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Andrew Lazar","Hi. Good morning, everybody.","Lawrence Kurzius","Good morning, Andrew.","Michael Smith","Good morning.","Andrew Lazar","Lawrence, I know that last quarter was one of the first in \u2013 and probably a couple of years where McCormick actually gained share in the core spices and seasonings business in the U.S. I know that's something that, obviously you've been narrowing the gap quite a bit with the category and then flip to gaining some share.","I think your comment in 2Q was that the delayed \u2013 the Easter delay around grilling season. I think you worded it hit McCormick or affected McCormick at a greater rate than, let's say the category. And so it look like a little bit of a share loss. I'm trying to get a sense of why that dynamic would have played out for McCormick differently then, let's say the category, and if there is any change in sort of the cadence of continuing to feel better about share gains going forward?","Lawrence Kurzius","Right. Sure, Andrew. Well, first of all, it's not that Easter \u2013 it's not Easter. It's the grilling season that was the issue. Easter fell later in the calendar, we actually had a great Easter season, but the late Easter did compress the grilling season and that compression of the grilling season impacted our grilling products and seasonally our grilling season items, particularly our Grill Mates seasoning blends are a big part of our business at this time of year.","We didn't mention it in our prepared remarks, but it's also an exceptionally wet season. So the quarter was, I think the fifth wettest on record and May was the second wettest on record, and just the combination of the slow \u2013 of the late grilling season, the compression of the grilling season and some unfavorable weather was a headwind to our Grill Mates range. So that caused us to pace behind the category.","I think the whole category was somewhat depressed by the compression of that grilling season, we're not the only ones who have a grilling range. And so \u2013 but we are the market leader and the Grill Mates range is a big part of our business at this time of the year. So the category was only up about 2%, we were only up about 1% in terms of spices and seasonings for the quarter, and we lost about 30 basis points of share.","Although we are getting into a stronger position from a share gain standpoint, they're going to be some moving parts. I'd say that 30 basis points is not something that we are concerned about that we've had a good strong underlying trend. And I also want to point out that the unmeasured channels are not captured in that and we continue to have very strong growth in the unmeasured channel area that does not come through that consumption data.","I'll also point out that private label also lost share. So there been a lot of concerns about private label in the market. Private label is becoming less and less of a factor. So that's not where that came in.","Andrew Lazar","Great. I really appreciate the added color. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Driscoll with Citi Research. Please proceed with your question.","David Driscoll","Great. Thank you, and good morning.","Lawrence Kurzius","Hi, Dave.","Michael Smith","Good morning.","David Driscoll","Two questions for me. Just on the operating profit guide down, can you just talk about the environment outside the United States and the impact to your operating profit guidance?","And then just a longer-term question Lawrence, wanted to just to get your sense as to the in-home cooking trends, I think they are quite positive right now, but wanted to get your sense as to, as the U.S. unemployment rate remained very, very low, how do you see those in-home trends continuing over the course of the kind of medium term? Do you think that the low unemployment would drive people out to the restaurants or do you really see in-home cooking as a sustainable driver even with this very, very low unemployment rate?","Lawrence Kurzius","I'm going to let Mike to take the front end of that.","Michael Smith","Yes, I'll talk about - the change in operating profit guidance was really driven primarily by the shift from capital to expense in the ERP side of things. In the global economic environment, as you mentioned, it was a small piece of that, but I would just characterize things as volatile right now. I mean, we've talked about how we have mitigation plans for Brexit and EMEA. That's on-again, off-again. It's been longer than we would have thought at this point.","We had the Mexico scare about a month ago, we have significant business down there, and we have a China slowdown and China had the slowest growth from a GDP perspective in 20 years in their first quarter. So it's really volatile now and we kind of consider that for our ongoing operating profit guidance for this year, but the real change versus our previous guidance is due to just a classification shift on ERP. ","Lawrence Kurzius","Right. As far as eating out trends, because this is a long-term trend, unemployment has been very low for quite a long time. I think that this cooking at home trend is more a characteristic of the millennial generation and is not being driven by economic factors, it's being more driven by a desire for more fresh food and a different kind of lifestyle. And so I think that the unemployment rate and I think that trend continues intact in the short, medium and long-term.","David Driscoll","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ken Goldman with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Kenneth Goldman","Hi. Thanks. Good morning, everybody.","Lawrence Kurzius","Good morning, Ken.","Kenneth Goldman","Two questions from me, and if you addressed this, forgive me, I have a couple earnings this morning. But number one, you're looking for a very big jump in the tax rate in the second half, but historically you've consistently, I think it's fair to say over guided when it comes to taxes, just to be conservative perhaps and which is great, but just to be aligned with history, why shouldn't we model a little bit of a lower tax rate than what you've guided to for the second half?","And then my second question is, I wanted to get a sense, the economic conditions you mentioned in China was that more on the foodservice side, on the retail side? I just wanted to get a little bit more color on exactly what the headwind is there? Thank you.","Michael Smith","Hey, Ken. It's Mike. I'll talk about the taxes. I mean, we've talked about this in the past, I mean you're right. Generally, we guide to an underlying tax rate based on regulations and things. It has got a bit volatile, the last couple of years when the accounting rules changed around stock option \u2013 discrete item, stock option exercises. And what we try to do is, lay out the underlying, and if there is discrete items like that happened that is a favorable to us and we've seen that through the first half of the year.","I mean one of the things with our stock appreciation over the last couple of years, there has been significant stock option exercises, a lot by retirees, and that does also drive some unfavorable from an operating profit perspective and it puts more shares out there too. So isn't all something to drop to the bottom line from a tax perspective.","But in the second half, you do the squeeze, 24% to 25% that is the underlying tax rate. And as we know with the guilty tax and other things that are still uncertain from the federal government, it could go either way. But I look to the past a bit, but we've had in the last year, real significant discrete items from stock options which may or may not continue.","Lawrence Kurzius"," And the retiree stock option exercises. I\u2019ll add some color to that. So on China, that's a really good question, Ken. The slowdown \u2013 there is an economic slowdown in China as we all know. We suspect that the official figures are probably optimistic and that maybe the slowdown in China is even greater than it would appear from the government statistics that are released. I'm saying that as nicely as I can. And it is the case that we're seeing, the biggest impact in the restaurant sector.","In China, our consumer business includes foodservice component, because they share a common distribution channel, particularly in the traditional trade and in the smaller markets and that foodservice related items are where we're seeing some impact, and anecdotally, we're certainly getting a lot of feedback from our organization in China that foodservice and restaurant sales that are slow. Over in our Flavor solution side of the business, our customers are more focused on core products as a result, because they're trying to drive value through the restaurant and bring people in.","So I think that the economic conditions are having a greater impact on foodservice and restaurant consumption than on the true retail part of the business where our retails related items continue to show very strong growth and our e-commerce business, which is consumer-oriented continues to show really strong growth in that area.","It was another compounding factor and that is this African swine fever, starting to show up as a meat shortage and rising meat prices in China, which puts cost pressure on the whole foodservice sector there, because of course that leads over to all the alternative and meats as well and with the resulting price impact to the consumer who is going through different foodservice outlets. So a little bit of a longish answer, but it is a more foodservice than retail.","Kenneth Goldman","Very helpful as always. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alexia Howard with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.","Alexia Howard","Good morning, everyone. So two questions. The first one on the Consumer Americas business and the fact that it was, I guess, negatively affected by the shorter grilling season, maybe the wet weather hit things a little hard this time as well. Does that mean we would expect to go back to a more normal level if sales growth starting next quarter? Is there anything sort of out there that would say it wouldn't sort of start to get back to a more normal level next time?","And then a more specific question on the EMEA Flavor Solutions business, obviously very strong this time around. Was that largely based on \u2013 you mentioned the QSR promotions, but with also new contract wins, I just wanted to get an idea of whether that strength is likely to be sustainable? Thank you and I'll pass it on.","Lawrence Kurzius","Okay. Thanks, Alexia. Good morning. You just started your question, before we can say, hi. The Consumer Americas specifically, first of all, I don't want to apologize too much for organic growth that we're having there. Some of our peers are reporting right around us and see quite a differential between what we're reporting and what they are and I think that we did have solid organic sales growth and I don't want us to lose the thread \u2013 thought on that.","But we are expecting a stronger second half to the year than the first half and I think that we've been trying to signal that all year along right from the guidance that we gave at the beginning of the year and even in our remarks at the end of first quarter.","Our marketing spend is deliberately skewed to the second half of the year, where it has the strongest ROI. Our new product launches in the first half, we get the benefit of that in the second half. We have more new products that we're launching in the second half of the year as well.","We are going to be lapping some Americas anomalies in the fourth quarter that we don't expect to repeat. So overall, we are expecting higher organic sales growth in the Americas as we go through the second half.","If I could shift gears over to the EMEA Flavor Solutions business, it's both. So this is a continuation of the strong trend that we saw in the first quarter. I mean that business \u2013 in terms of the constant currency growth, it's actually exactly the same as it was in the first quarter and it's driven by the same factors. We do have some new customer wins, but we also have strong growth with our existing customer base there.","Alexia Howard","Great. Thank you very much. I'll pass it on.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Robert Moskow","Hi, good morning.","Lawrence Kurzius","Hey, Robert.","Robert Moskow","So the guidance for the year has always involved or required a lot of operating leverage a little bit less now with the operating income down 1%. Can you talk a little bit more detail about the transformation spending that you're doing the ERP? And how \u2013 can you give us some specific details on how that can release more cost savings going forward? You mentioned some efficiencies, but are there any headcount implications heading into the next few years from what you're doing with ERP? Thanks.","Michael Smith","Hey, Rob, this is Mike. I mean, this is a three-year initiative and we're in year one of the three years. And we laid out the capital and expense portions of that that we'll realize over the three years. We did talk about the shift and it's really primarily a lot of our expense is happening in the second and third quarter of this year then it will shift to more of a capital side of things.","But really we're focusing on this business transformation of ERP as it really a growth initiative. And it will give us efficiencies, no question as we standardize processes around the world, as we do things one way around the world. It's really to make sure we can focus our resources on growing business, bringing in acquisitions much easier.","In the past as we brought in acquisitions, it's been tough and it takes a lot of effort from the organization. So I think that's something I just focus from a growth perspective as we continue to get more and more scale to be a bigger company. This is really in investment in our business to get us to the next level.","Lawrence Kurzius","I'll add to that a little bit, Rob and that is that this is linked also to our Global Enablement program, where we're simplifying our processes, aligning them globally, so we can centralize and definitely both enables us to be more agile and grow and then also does absolutely result in cost savings as we do get a benefit from that scale. So this is a technology enabling part of that Global Enablement project.","As part of this, we're also \u2013 as a technology upgrade, we are making a migration to the next-generation of SAP S\/4HANA. The whole industry is going to have to go to that. Some of us have, but most of us have not yet started that journey. It is if you doing it on a pretty brisk pace as we are in a minimum of a three-year project. SAP goes out of service in 2025. We want to be well ahead of that curve and see this as an opportunity rather than as a cost that we have to bear it down the road.","Robert Moskow","Okay. A quick follow-up though. I thought I heard you say that you're in a better position to make acquisitions now? Did I hear that correctly, and if so what capabilities are you focused on acquiring?","Michael Smith","As we move down towards the 3x debt-to-EBITDA, I think that's what we were saying, as we get closer to our commitment that allows us to start looking at acquisitions.","Lawrence Kurzius","Exactly, and so we're not \u2013 and the kind of acquisitions that we would look for would be consistent with what we've done and messaged in the past, great flavor businesses, great consumer brands that build our consumer flavor business, flavor solutions businesses that add flavor capability and capacity, and those would be the main areas and business that grow.","Michael Smith","And of course businesses that grow.","Lawrence Kurzius","Obviously, we don't do without growth.","Robert Moskow","Got it. So 3x is really the trigger?","Michael Smith","I wouldn't say that's a trigger, but we've said we've always committed is that we're going to get to 3x by the end of 2020. And as we get \u2013 as we're closing in on that, we're not going to start working on deals once we get to 3x. Right now, we've got a debt-to-EBITDA ratio that starts with 3x, and we're on track to end up with \u2013 the back-end of the year, Rob, is a heavy cash flows. By the end of the year we'll be \u2013 we will be insight.","Robert Moskow","Yes, so I thought. Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Adam Samuelson","Yes. Thanks. Good morning everyone.","Michael Smith","Good morning Adam.","Lawrence Kurzius","Hey, good morning, Adam.","Adam Samuelson","So question on the Flavor Solutions business and really centered on the margin side. And just \u2013 can you maybe quantify the transactional FX headwinds that you're facing there? Just in the spirit of the question is, first half organic growth in the business is a little bit north of 5% and margins on a year-on-year basis are up 10 basis points, 20 basis points.","And I'm just trying to think about the operating leverage within that mix. It doesn't seem like it's a headwinds, especially if you talk about the bulk ingredients business being down. So I'm just trying to make sure I'm understanding kind of some of the cost or margin pressures that are hitting you there and how do you think about that going forward?","Michael Smith","No, I think about it in a bit of a couple of factors that are actually hitting us in the Flavor Solutions side. The transactional FX as you said, which has been hitting us in the last six months of last year and the first six months of this year. We'll get into more favorable FX comparison in the second six, so there should be an acceleration there.","We're also as Lawrence mentioned in Asia, particularly China, as we're kind of a negative mix issue right now as the QSR's focus is more on their core products versus LTOs, Limited Time Offers. We make more margin obviously on Limited Time Offers. So \u2013 but we see that, again that ebbs and flows and as the economies recover, we think they will go back to more LTOs and we're actually seeing a little bit of that in some of the areas. So I see an acceleration of our operating margin on the Flavor Solutions side in the second half as this clouds go away.","Lawrence Kurzius","Particularly that FX is going to be less unfavorable in the second half now. We tempered both of our remarks with the caveat that this is really kind of volatile environment and we're \u2013 but the FX outlook that we have right now, we should be getting into comparisons that are pretty closed year-on-year.","Adam Samuelson","Okay. And then just quickly on the JV, you took up the range for earnings growth in that line item. Is that just a reflection of the first half performance where you're above the high end of the kind of upper single-digit growth or is the full-year \u2013 it's the back half actually improving there too?","Lawrence Kurzius","Yes. If I can jump in on that, so we're having really strong sales growth in our mix JV, and that's falling through to profitability. So the performance year-to-date there has been really good and we have a positive outlook on that. So we've \u2013 so originally our outlook on our JVs as a group was flat.","We're in a pretty strong place right now and so we have a \u2013 it's a little bit of both. We have great results year-to-date and we expect that to continue and we also wanted to really call this out, because a lot of times we don't talk about the unconsolidated operations, but those are real operating results. We are not passive operators of our unconsolidated JVs, and just in the last few weeks, both Mike and I up and down there multiple times. These are businesses that we're actively engaged, and doing very well.","Michael Smith","And doing very well.","Adam Samuelson","Okay. I appreciate the color. I'll pass it on. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Growe with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.","Christopher Growe","Hi, good morning.","Lawrence Kurzius","Hey, Chris.","Michael Smith","Good morning.","Christopher Growe","I just had two questions if I could. I want to follow-up on an earlier discussion of, obviously a bit of a delay in the grilling season. I guess I wanted to be clear. Is that something you think you can back \u2013 you get those sales back, say, starting in Q3 that this is sort of pent-up demand by consumers that got pushed out a bit? Is that the way to look at it or is it more of the potential for lost sales given promotional changes there?","Lawrence Kurzius","No, I think that if I could, I know you said you had two parts. I'm going to just jump in and answer. I think the consumption that didn't happen, it didn't happen. It was that compression \u2013 this is also something that we've had discussions about with our customers as well so \u2013 and so there was a lost merchandising activity, the customers couldn't get their Easter promotions down fast enough to get the grilling promotion display materials up and \u2013 what the consumers didn't consume, because remember we talked about through the scanner that the Grill Mates, the grilling part of our seasoning business is the part that is slow. That's consumption that is \u2013 that's really lost.","Christopher Growe","Okay.","Michael Smith","But it's something we planned internally everyone knows when Easter was going to hit. We've moved some advertising into the third quarter. You're going to see a nice up spend in the third quarter, which will continue to drive good consumption.","Christopher Growe","Okay, great. Thank you. And then in relation to the gross margin, how would you characterize cost inflation and pricing, those two roughly offset each other. You did mention that CCI was the main driver of your gross margin improvement. And maybe related to that, in terms of the CCI savings, are they more gross margin focus this year versus SG&A or if there are any color there just would be interested in that?","Lawrence Kurzius","Yes. I wouldn't say from CCI perspective, we have seen a large shift between costs of goods sold CCI or SG&A CCI. I think from a pricing perspective and a cost perspective, as we said in beginning of the year, this is a relatively benign environment for us, low single-digit cost inflation, and we've taken some pricing where we needed to do that this year, but it's a relatively benign side. So the CCI is able to work for us better to drop through to the operating profit margin.","Michael Smith","And we have some ongoing discussions on price on specific items as well that are always in progress.","Christopher Growe","Yes. Okay, got it. Thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rob Dickerson with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Robert Dickerson","Great. Thank you so much.","Lawrence Kurzius","Hi, Rob.","Robert Dickerson","Good morning. Just kind of overview question on guidance in the back half given all the questions that have already been asked, so it seems like \u2013 what you're saying and kind of what I'm hearing is, there is maybe a little bit extra spend on the ERP system upgrade, I guess, right, but I guess the shift to...","Lawrence Kurzius","It's the shift Rob. It is going from capital to expense. If you notice and we talked about in the script, our capital range was $200 million to $220 million. We've shifted that down to $200 million now for the year. So capital is down, expense is up. Think about it that way.","Michael Smith","It's the same money.","Lawrence Kurzius","Same cash.","Robert Dickerson","Right. So and I mean at times, I actually am very ignorant. I do a admit that? So could you just explain that simplistically so everybody on the call can understand...","Michael Smith","Yes. Okay, that's fine. I mean, I can talk for hours about the accounting around this, but I won't. But it's \u2013 one of the things when we came into the year and as Lawrence talked about in the January call, we were starting to engage our system integrator to look at the scope of the project, the timing and we had an estimate of what the total cost would be over those couple of years.","And based on what we knew at the time, based on the phases of the project and what is capital, what is expense from an accounting perspective. We took our best crack at it. Once the system integrator got it and put the plan together, we realized that, okay, there is a little bit more expense upfront than we thought a little less capital based on the work that they're doing on the ERP design, the implementation, all that sort of stuff. So that's what you see here. Total cost is going to be about the same. It's just the shift between the two based on the accounting rules and better [indiscernible].","Robert Dickerson","Okay. Good answer. And then just secondly and simplistically, it sounds like what you're saying is in the back half, right given sound like there's still margin mix pressure and a lot, but like you said and kind of restaurants relative to kind of base core retail and Asia, let's ignore the ERP piece for a second, but then in the back half, maybe some of that loosens we'll see, but it's also \u2013 there is a FX reversal, not a full reversal, but less of a headwind.","And then it also sounds like may be as you're coming out of this kind of fit of late, wet, post Easter grilling season that maybe marketing dollars, you can improve velocities and then hopefully also improves the margin mix, because when I just look at the guide, right, we did talk about some of the shift in the grilling season in the quarter or what happened in China.","But quite frankly, your topline is actually still pretty strong and you're exactly in line for the most part where you were relative to Q1 on a two-year stack basis. So it is \u2013 it seems like it's more of a margin expansion \u2013 expectation in the back half versus a big topline acceleration relative to the first half. Is that a fair summary?","Michael Smith","Yes. I think you've got the right, Rob. Remember the fourth quarter and the challenges, we're going to have really favorable mix in the back half over compared to 2018 based on what we saw last year. And the other thing that someone mentioned CCI \u2013 before CCI build during the year, so that does help margin also.","Lawrence Kurzius","And Rob, probably you made a point about the sales growth being solid and look \u2013 took just to step back on the whole \u2013 overall picture, because like last quarter, this was really a solid, no drama quarter, we put together. Two pretty un-dramatic solid performances year-to-year.","We had solid sales growth in this quarter, nearly 3% in constant currency, which compares very strongly to our peers and through the first half, a little over 3.5% on all of sales growth, constant currency, all of it organic.","And as we've signaled all year, we expect a stronger second half. We've had good operating profit and growth and margin expansion. It's actually in line with our algorithm. And quarter-by-quarter, we're putting together a strong 2019. We're very confident in our outlook of the second half. I think \u2013 those are some really good points you raised.","Robert Dickerson","Guys, thank you very much. I appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I'll turn the floor back to Mr. Kurzius for any final comments.","Lawrence Kurzius","Great. Thank you everyone for your questions and for participating on today's call. McCormick is a global leader in flavor and we're differentiated with the broad and advantaged portfolio, which continues to drive growth, growing in profitable business and operates in an environment that's changing at an ever faster pace.","We're responding readily to changes in the industry with new ideas, innovation and purpose. With a relentless focus on growth performance and people, we continue to perform strong globally and build shareholder value. Our second quarter financial results both across our Consumer and Flavor Solutions segment was strong. We have confidence in our fiscal year outlook and we're well positioned to deliver another strong year in 2019.","Kasey Jenkins","Thank you, Lawrence and thanks to all for joining today's call.

This is Kasey Jenkins, Vice President of McCormick Investor Relations. Thank you for joining today's Third Quarter Earnings Call. To accompany this call, we have posted a set of slides at ir.mccormick.com. Currently, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following our remarks, we will begin a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] We'll begin with remarks from Lawrence Kurzius, Chairman, President and CEO and Mike Smith, Executive Vice President and CFO.","During our remarks, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. These include information in constant currency, as well as adjusted operating income, adjusted income tax rate and adjusted earnings per share that exclude the impact of special charges, as well as the net non-recurring income tax benefit associated with the December 2017 U.S. tax reform legislation and for 2018 transaction and intervention expenses related to the acquisition of our Frank's and French's brand.

As seen on Slide 2, our forward-looking statement also provides information on risk factors that could affect our financial results.","It is now my pleasure to turn the discussion over to Lawrence.","Lawrence Kurzius","Thank you, Kasey. Good morning everyone. Thanks for joining us. Our solid third quarter and year-to-date results reflect the successful execution of our strategies and engagement of employees around the world. We've driven strong sales, operating profit and adjusted EPS growth, as well as operating margin expansions, while continuing to make targeted investments and fuel future growth. As we enter the last quarter of our fiscal year, we're confident in our growth trajectory and that we're well positioned to deliver strong results in 2019.","Starting on Slide 4, our broad and advantaged global flavor portfolio continues to position us to meet the demand for flavor around the world to grow our business. The breadth and reach of our portfolio across segments, geographies, channels, customers and product offerings, creates a balanced portfolio to drive consistency in our performance in a volatile environment. This quarter, our particularly strong consumer sales growth in the Americas and Asia Pacific regions outweighed flavor solution softness in those same regions.","Within our Consumer segment, our third quarter highlights include broad based U.S. and China growth, with strong contributions from both base business and new products. In our Flavor Solutions segment, our EMEA region drove growth in flavors, branded food service and condiments, driven by new products and the base business. We're confident our breath and reach will also continue to differentiate McCormick, and be the foundation of our sales growth as consumers' demand for flavor continues to rise.","Now let me go into more detail on our third quarter performance as seen on Slide 5, as well as provide some business comments before turning it over to Mike who will go in more depth on the quarter end results and discuss our 2019 financial guidance. Starting with our top line for the third quarter. Third quarter sales increased 1% from the year ago period, and constant currency sales grew 2% for the total company, led by our Consumer segment with growth attributable to higher volume and product mix, driven by both base business and new products.","In our consumer segment, sales increased 3%, including 1% unfavorable impact from currency. In constant currency, sales grew 4%, representing an acceleration from the first half trends. In our Flavor Solutions segment, sales decreased 2%. In constant currency, sales were flat following the strong first half growth of 5%. Those who follow us closely know that the Flavor Solutions segment tends to have some quarter-to-quarter volatility, largely attributable to customer activity.","In addition to our top line growth, we grew adjusted operating income and expanded our adjusted operating margin. With our higher sales, cost savings led by our Comprehensive Continuous Improvement program, CCI and favorable product mix, we grew the third quarter's adjusted operating income 9% or 10% in constant currency and expanded our adjusted operating margin 160 basis points.","At the bottom-line, our third quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.46, was 14% higher than $1.28 in the third quarter of 2018, driven primarily by our adjusted operating income growth and the lower adjusted tax rate. And this 14% adjusted earnings per share growth includes an unfavorable impact from currency.","Our strong third quarter performance is a continuation of the results we achieved in the first half of 2019. Year-to-date, through the third quarter, we've grown ourselves 1%, which is 3% in constant currency and adjusted operating income 6%, or 8% in constant currency. We continue to expect another year of strong performance in 2019.","With one quarter remaining in the fiscal year, we've increased our adjusted earnings per share guidance to $5.30 to $5.35 from our previous guidance of $5.20 to $5.30. This updated guidance reflects a 7% to 8% growth rate and importantly, includes continued investments to drive growth. We are confident in our updated 2019 outlook, which Mike will provide more details on in a few moments. I\u2019d like to now turn to some highlights from our Consumer and Flavor Solutions segments.","Starting on Slide 6 with our Consumer segment. As I just mentioned, we grew constant currency sales 4%, driven by the strong performance in the Americas and Asia-Pacific regions. In the Americas, we grew constant currency sales 4%. This growth was entirely organic and attributable to higher volume and product mix, driven by both our base business and new products. Our category management initiatives, effective marketing support and merchandising execution, expanded distribution and new products, all contributed to drive consumption growth across our Americas consumer portfolio.","For the third quarter, our IRI data indicates our McCormick U.S. branded spices and seasoning scanner sales grew in line with category, and we again had double-digit growth in unmeasured channels. And our McCormick branded dry recipe mixes continued their momentum of consumption and share growth. Our new products, including One Dish and Street Tacos dry recipe mixes, co-branded tasty products and Zatarain's frozen entrees bowls continues to gain momentum and contribute to growth.","We won with our grilling season despite the delayed start with our strong merchandising execution, driving significant consumption growth on Grill Mates, Stubb's barbecue sauce, Frank's hot sauce and French's Mustard. As we continue to accelerate our condiment leadership, Stubb's barbecue consumption continues to outpace the barbecue category. Frank's hot sauce continues to outperformance with distribution gains and record high household penetration.","Broadening to the entire Frank's portfolio, including frozen wings, seasoning blends and dry recipe mixes, we drove double-digit consumption growth as we continue to find opportunities to expand this brand. And French's mustard again grew consumption and share. In fact, the mustard category has returned to growth and year-to-date, we have driven 100% of that growth through our category management initiatives and focused marketing support.","Our French's National Mustard Day campaign is a great example of how our marketing excellence organization continues to optimize our brand marketing spending and get more value out of each marketing dollar. The campaign earned 15 times more media value than our actual investment and created quite a buzz around mustard flavored ice cream with over 1 billion impressions. We're making brand marketing investments like this across our entire portfolio, and their effectiveness was particularly evident in our third quarter consumption and sales growth.","Now turning to Europe, Middle-East and Africa, the EMEA region. Growth was tampered by unusually warm weather in Europe, particularly in France and Italy, which unfavorably impacted consumption. Extreme high temperatures were recorded during the first half of the quarter. And as they moderated, our second half performance also improved. Our success with the new products has continued, particularly in the UK, where they with our other initiatives, drove growth.","In Asia-Pacific region, our sales growth rate has accelerated from the first half of the year, driven by our effective merchandising execution, as well as new products and expanded distribution. Last quarter, I mentioned recent macroeconomic pressures in China were impacting growth in this region. And although, there is still pressure, we delivered strong third quarter growth. As evidenced by our overall sales growth this quarter, our fundamentals across the region remain strong.","Across all regions, our strength in e-commerce is again evident with third quarter double-digit e-commerce growth. Our investments in content development, resources to support acceleration, as well as programs and items tailored to the e-commerce channel are paying off. Our digital presence includes not only e-commerce but advertising as well, which is beating the ROI norms in consumer products. And as I mentioned earlier, as we continue to optimize our brand marketing spend, we're increasing our digital effectiveness.","We're not only winning through our growth, but our digital leadership was again recognized in 2019 by Gartner L2 research. McCormick has ranked number one on their Digital IQ Index for food released in late August, and the only food brand to earn the title of genius, their top distinction. This marked our sixth consecutive year in the top five ranking of over a 100 food and beverage brands on the effectiveness of our Web site, digital, social media, e-commerce and mobile platforms.","Turning now to Slide 7. In our Flavor Solutions segment, our constant currency sales were comparable to last year with strengths in EMEA being offset by declining sales in Americas and Asia-Pacific regions. In the Americas, our third quarter sales declined compared to last year. We experienced planned decline this quarter from the timing of our customers' promotional activities and new products, following a strong first half.","Additionally, due to the significant demand we've seen in this business and continue to project, we needed to increase our warehouse capacity. During the third quarter, we began a transition to a larger raw material warehouse and this briefly constrained our growth. Our growth momentum in snack seasonings has continued, as well as our strong performance in branded food service. Overall, the demand from our Americas flavor solution customers remained strong.","Now turning to EMEA. We drove strong constant currency sales growth. We grew sales to quick service restaurants, partially driven by their strong promotional activities and new products, and to packaged food companies attributable to both new products and base business growth. We're continuing to win with our customers through new products, expanded distribution and promotional activity.","And finally, in the Asia-Pacific region, our sales were impacted by both the timing of our customers' initiatives, including a lower level of limited time offers in this year's third quarter, as well as the exit of some low margin business in the region. As I already mentioned, sales in our Flavor Solutions segment can be volatile from quarter-to-quarter, and we've seen this in our quarterly results so far this year. Our third quarter performance was impacted by several factors, which we anticipate will not impact us as significantly in future quarters. In constant currency, we've driven 3% total Flavor Solutions sales growth year-to-date and are confidence in our expectations for fourth quarter growth.","Now, I would like to provide a few summary comments as seen on Slide 8 before turning it over to Mike. At the foundation of our sales growth is the rising consumer demand for flavor. We're aligned with the consumers' continued interest to bolder flavors, demand for convenience and focus on fresh natural ingredients, as well as with emerging purchase drivers, such as greater transparency around the sourcing and quality of food. With this increased interest, flavor continues to be an advantaged global category, which combined with our execution against effective strategies, will drive strong results.","We have a solid foundation. And in an environment that continues to be dynamic and fast paced, we're ensuring we remain agile, relevant and focused on sustainable growth. Our experienced leaders and employees are executing against their strategies, which are designed to build long term value for our shareholders. Our strong third quarter financial results were a continuation of the great results we achieved in the first half of 2019.","Our fundamentals are strong. And we're confident the initiatives we have underway position us to continue our growth trajectory. We're balancing our resources and efforts to drive sales with our work to lower cost to build fuel for growth and higher margin, while we're making investments in our future. We have confidence in our updated fiscal year outlook and are well positioned to deliver another strong year in 2019. Around the world, McCormick employees are driving our momentum and success, and I thank them for their efforts and engagement.","Thank you for your attention. And it's now my pleasure to turn it over to Mike for additional remarks on our third quarter financial results and our updated 2019 outlook.","Mike Smith","Thanks, Lawrence, and good morning everyone. As Lawrence indicated, we delivered strong growth in the third quarter. I'll begin with the discussion of our results followed with details on our updated full year 2019 financial outlook. Turning at Slide 10. We grew sales 2% in constant currency. This growth was driven by the base business and new products, and was led by our consumer segment. The Consumer segment sales rose 4% in constant currency. This growth was driven by the Americas and Asia-Pacific regions, and was attributable to higher volume and product mix of both base business and new products.","Turning to Slide 11. We grew consumer segment sales in the Americas to 4% in constant currency versus the third quarter of 2018 due to higher volume and product mix. New products, category management and strong brand marketing drove broad based growth across the portfolio, both from a brand and a product category perspective with private label also contributing to the growth.","Constant currency consumer sales in EMEA were down 2% from a year ago. Sales growth in the region was impacted by extreme high temperatures as Lawrence's already mentioned, as well as a decline in private label sales and unfavorable pricing actions related to planned trade promotional activity for new products.","In the Asia-Pacific region, we grew constant currency sales 15% led by China, higher volume and product mix, as well as pricing drove the increase with strength in herbs and spices, world flavor sauces and chicken bouillon. The earlier timing of a China national holiday versus last year partially contributed to the third quarter's increased sales volume.","Turning to our Flavor Solutions segment on Slide 14, third quarter constant currency sales were comparable to the year ago period with growth in EMEA, offset by declines in the Americas and Asia-Pacific regions. In the Americas, Flavor Solutions' constant currency sales declined 2%. As Lawrence mentioned, this decline was driven primarily by the timing of our customer promotions and new products, which was stronger in the first half of the year, as well as warehouse transition activities, which temporarily constrained growth. These declines were partially offset by growth in snacks seasonings and branded foodservice.","In EMEA, we grew Flavors Solutions sales 4% in constant currency. This growth was driven by new products, pricing and base business volume growth. In the Asia-Pacific region, Flavors Solutions sales in constant currency were down 1% versus the year ago period driven by both timing of customer activities versus the year ago period, as well as the exit of some low margin business.","Adjusted operating income, which excludes special charges, increased 9% in the third quarter versus the year ago period. And excluding the impact of unfavorable currency rose 10%. Adjusted operating income in the consumer segment rose $177 million, a 16% increase. And in the constant currency, the increase was 17%. In the Flavor Solutions segment, adjusted operating income declined 2% to $85 million, which in constant currency was 1% decline.","Growth in our Consumer segment was primarily driven by higher sales, while the decline in our Flavor Solutions segment was primarily driven by lower sales. Both segments were favorably impacted by CCI-led cost savings, a one-time 2019 global benefit plan alignment and favorable product mix with partial offsets from business transformation expenses, driven by ERP replacement and higher planned brand marketing investments. An unfavorable transactional impact of foreign currency exchange rates versus the year ago period also impacted the Flavor Solutions segment.","As seen on Slide 19, we expanded our third quarter gross profit margin 100 basis points year-on-year, driven by CCI-led cost savings, as well as favorable product mix. On a year-to-date basis, we expanded 40 basis points. And for the 2019 full year, gross profit margin is expected to be 50 basis points to 75 basis points higher than 2018, which narrows our range from our previous expectations.","Our selling, general and administrative expense, as a percentage of net sales, decreased by 60 basis points from the third quarter of 2018. This decrease was primarily driven by higher sales, as well as the net impact of the other adjusted operating income changes I just mentioned a moment ago. These changes include a 5% increase in our brand marketing versus the third quarter last year.","As a reminder, while our year-to-date brand marketing is lower than last year, we are planning to spend brand marketing comparable to 2018 partially by reinvesting our continued marketing excellence cost savings and non-working spend reductions into working media. Therefore, we are planning further brand marketing increases in the fourth quarter.","And in the fourth quarter, we're projecting further increases in business transformation investments relating to our ERP replacement program, which we expect to continue to ramp up in 2020 correlated to our most essential global deployment activity. The combined impact of the gross margin expansion and SG&A leverage resulted in an adjusted operating margin expansion of 160 basis points in the third quarter of 2018.","Turning to income taxes on Slide 20. Our third quarter adjusted effective income tax rate was 17.6% as compared to 18.8% in the year ago period. Our third quarter adjusted rate was favorably impacted by discrete tax items, with the largest contributor due to stock option exercises. As we have discussed in previous quarters, favorable tax rate impacts of option exercises are partially offset by payroll and social related taxes, which unfavorably impacted operating profit.","Considering the year-to-date favorable impact from discrete items, we now expect our full year 2019 adjusted effective tax rate will be approximately 20%. There can be volatility in that rate quarter-to-quarter due to the unpredictability of discrete items, changes to our forecasted mix of earnings, including currency impacts and interpretation of regulations continuing to be released, clarifying the impacts of the 2017 U.S. Tax Act. Income from unconsolidated operations was $10 million compared to $8 million for the third quarter of 2018, a 14% increase.","At the bottom line, as shown on Slide 22, third quarter 2019 adjusted earnings per share was $1.46, up 14% from $1.28 for the year ago period, primarily due to growth in our operating performance, lower interest expense and lower adjusted income tax rate. And this increase included an unfavorable impact from currency.","The Company continues to generate strong cash flow. On Slide 23, we summarize highlights from cash flow and the quarter end balance sheet. Our cash flow provided from operations was $495 million through the third quarter of 2019 compared to $389 million through the third quarter of 2018. This increase was primarily driven by higher operating income. We continue to see improvements in our cash conversion cycle, finishing the third quarter down nine days versus our fiscal year-end. A portion of this cash was used to pay down $206 million of acquisitions debt as we continue to focus on paying down debt.","And we have now paid down almost 70% of our term notes related to our Frank's and French's acquisition, which along with the lower interest rate environment, has lowered our interest expense versus last year, as well as our debt leverage ratio. We finished the third quarter with a debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 3.7 times, which is pacing us ahead of our target of 3.0 times by the end of 2020.","As we have mentioned previously, while our priority is paying down debt with a clear line of sight to our 2020 leverage target, we are continuing to explore acquisition opportunities, which represent a key part of our long-term growth strategy. Through the third quarter of 2019, we returned $226 million of cash to shareholders through dividends and used $107 million for capital expenditures. We expect 2019 to be another year of strong cash flow, driven by profit and working capital initiatives. And our priority is to continue to have a balanced use of cash, making investments to drive growth, returning a significant portion to our shareholders through dividends and to pay down debt.","Let's now move to our current financial outlook for 2019 on Slide 24. We continue to expect another year of strong performance in 2019 with our broad and advantaged flavor portfolio, effective growth strategies and focus on profit realization. We are narrowing our projected growth rate ranges for sales, operating profit and earnings per share and increasing our earnings per share outlook.","We continue to estimate, based on prevailing rates, a 2 percentage point unfavorable impact from currency rate on net sales, adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share. At the top line, based on our year-to-date results through the third quarter, we are narrowing our sales guidance range to grow sales 1% to 2%, which in constant currency, is 3% to 4% projected growth rate.","As a reminder, this will be entirely organic growth, driven primarily by higher volume and products mix, as well as the impact of pricing. We're also narrowing our adjusted operating income growth to be 6% to 7% from $930 million in 2018, which in constant currency, is an 8% to 9% projected growth rate and reflects our continued focus on profit realization. Our adjusted operating income growth rate reflects our expected strong performance, while also making investments for growth, as well as our continued focus on profit realization.","Following an increase in our second quarter earnings call, we are again increasing our guidance for 2019 adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $5.30 to $5.35, which compares to $4.97 adjusted earnings per share in 2018 and represents a 7% to 8% increase or in constant currency, 9% to 10%. This increase reflects the projected lower adjusted tax rate I mentioned earlier as well as the narrowing of our adjusted operating profit range.","In summary, we are projecting strong growth in our 2019 constant currency outlook for sales, adjusted operating profit and adjusted earnings per share following record double-digit performance across each objective in 2018 and while continuing to invest for future growth. I'd like to now turn it back to Lawrence for some additional remarks before we move to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from line of Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Andrew Lazar","I guess first off, when we look at the new full-year guidance on sales and EBIT, I guess they both imply a 4Q that looks a bit below at least where sort of current Street models would be. I'm just curious if there are any sort of discrete issues that you'd point out for that. You did mention some increased marketing investment, which obviously would impact EBIT a bit, but just because also the comparison, obviously, year-over-year gets a quite a bit easier given the inventory issues of last year.","Mike Smith","Andrew, I'll start. And if Lawrence has anything -- I mean year to date, we're really happy with our performance of 3% constant currency growth. And once you start looking at the math, if we would have kept our guidance at the original 3% to 5%, we would have to grow sales growth almost 9%. So we tightened the range a bit on those sales and operating profit. We have some -- you talked about EMEA weather in the third quarter. That's not going to be recovered. There's a few things like that, that happened. But 3% to 4%, we still feel like that's really good net sales performance, and we do see the underlying strength in Americas consumer continuing, which we talked about on the last call.","Andrew Lazar","Thank you for that. Appreciate that. And then I guess one follow-up would just be, it doesn't sound like this was a benefit much at all because you didn't mention it, but the acceleration you saw in consumer Americas, you talked about it being broad-based. And so I just want to make sure there wasn't, didn't seem to be because you talked about takeaway and shipments being in line broadly, but I'm assuming there is no pull forward, if you will, in consumer Americas that would have benefited shipments just given the easier comparison or the fact that with a replenished inventory, if you will, going into fourth quarter it doesn't like sound like that was a benefit, but I just wanted to make sure.","Lawrence Kurzius","No. Andrew, this is Lawrence. There was really, I mean, we really ship to consumption in the third quarter and would expect to ship to consumption again going into the fourth quarter. We signaled that we'd have, on our last call that we'd have an acceleration as we went to the second half of the year, and so we're starting to see that read through in our consumer business.","So we feel very confident in our results, in our outlook for the fourth quarter. One of the reasons that the third quarter might have looked stronger on our shipments than in, I think, some of the scanner data, which was actually pretty good, is that, again, unmeasured channels were really strong for us. And so that was a bit of a benefit in the third quarter. But that's been a consistent thing, where that group of customers has been growing faster than the general market.","But in terms of whether there was any kind of unusual inventory activity or any kind of pull forward, that wasn't the case. If you look at last year third quarter, we grew about 4% in Americas consumer, so roughly about the same. Actually, we feel really good about the third quarter because it's up against a pretty tough comparison a year ago.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ken Goldman with JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question.","Ken Goldman","My first question is, in your slide deck, you called out a onetime benefit from the global benefit plan alignment. I don't think you quantified this for us. I'm just curious how much was it? And I don't think it was included in that net special charges of $7.7 million, but I just wanted to make sure for our modeling purposes.","Mike Smith","No, we haven't quantified it, Ken. We've talked about it, I think, pretty much every quarter. But we're not going to quantify that. Every year...","Lawrence Kurzius","We say something like this every year as we've looked at our benefit plans with an eye to cost.","Ken Goldman","That's not going to stop me from asking every quarter though.","Lawrence Kurzius","You got one more -- one quarter left, Ken, one quarter left.","Ken Goldman","When you guys do well, it's hard to find questions, so we got to figure some out here. I guess my next question would be a couple of U.S.-based staples companies that have multinational businesses, they have highlighted maybe some modest softness in demand from emerging markets lately. It doesn't sound like you're experiencing this, but are there any, I don't want to call them red flags, maybe yellow flags that you're seeing that would indicate some consumer slippage in terms of their demand in some developed markets or developing, rather? Or is this not really something that you're experiencing yet?","Lawrence Kurzius","Yes. So I think the comparison between us and some of our peer companies might just be the mix of markets that we're in. We're cautious about China. We just had a great quarter in China, but we are aware of the volatile environment that we're in. The consumer results that we've had in China have been pretty good. We had a slow start to the year. We expected a strong second half there as well, and we're experiencing it.","So I'd say that with our international business, if there was an area that was slow for us over the third quarter, it was -- EMEA was a little slow, and that was strictly related to the tremendous heat wave that impacted cooking, and that's where a lot of our consumer products are used. So we don't see anything general in the emerging markets. With that said, we're not taking it for granted. We're one tweet away from more volatility.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alexia Howard with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.","Alexia Howard","Good morning, everyone. So two quick questions, I guess, on the top line guidance I know you trimmed it down a little bit for the full year this quarter, but it still kind of implies that things will get sequentially better next quarter. I'm wondering if that's particularly on the flavor solutions side of things that you've got -- have you got visibility into things picking up on that side? That's my first question. And the second one on a very different topic, you mentioned acquisitions as something that you're keeping a close eye on. Could you talk to us a little bit about where you're fishing at the moment, I guess? Given that the RB Foods deal was very U.S.-centric, is it likely that if you do another deal of scale that, that would be maybe more overseas-focused and that you're likely to be looking at consumer versus flavor solutions? Just any guidance or any thoughts on that front will be helpful.","Lawrence Kurzius","Sure. Well, I'll start on the first one. And yes, we do expect an acceleration in the flavor solutions part of the business. It was impacted in Q3 by some relatively short-term factors. There's some customer activity differences, and we're also comparing to an incredible third quarter a year ago, which you may recall had a 6% growth in the third quarter of last year. So it was up against a particularly strong comparison. And then we had, just as an operating matter, a transition to a new warehouse in the U.S. that also was a very brief constraint on growth in the quarter.","And so I think that as we've got -- so we're confident that the fourth quarter will be strong in flavor solutions. And I think we've been messaging for the last couple of quarters that we expect second half to be good on our consumer business, and our outlook for that remains that way. Mike, do you want to add anything to that?","Mike Smith","No, thank you.","Lawrence Kurzius","I'll say on acquisitions. So we don't want to get overly granular in the discussion of acquisitions. But as we've shared previously as we've deleveraged and you just heard from Mike that we finished Q3 at 3.7 and you know we're going into our highest cash time of the year, so some additional deleveraging would happen as we go through the fourth quarter. We've got very clear line of sight to getting to the 3.0 target that we set for the end of 2020 early.","And as a result, it's just time to start considering -- we've got more financial flexibility now than we had a year ago, and it's time to look at new things. And I'd say that, as you noted, the RB Foods acquisition did skew us more to the Americas than we were, and it also skewed us a bit more to the consumer business than we were pre-acquisition. And we would hope to, over time, balance that.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Robert Moskow","The thing that really stood out to me was the operating leverage in the consumer division. I mean you had high-teens operating income growth in the quarter and, obviously, some strong sales, too. Can you kind of help us break down though like how much of that growth was from operating leverage from the volume, how much of it was from maybe cost reductions related to the special charges?","Mike Smith","Well, I'd say -- this is Mike. It's really not related to special charges at all. We have underlying CCI program which continues to accelerate during the year. However, we have really good product mix and category mix. The brands that did really well such as French's and Frank's, our core business have very high margins. So I think you're getting a bit of product mix, I know you're getting a bit of product mix in there as well.","Lawrence Kurzius","I think, if anything, there may have even been some operating cost headwinds related to our ERP program that would have run through both segments.","Robert Moskow","And then on the fourth quarter -- or actually, just on flavor solutions in general, can you be a little more specific about the constraints you had in the warehousing? Is that for raw materials for spices and seasonings? Or is it for the liquid filled part of your business that was growing so strong? And then a follow-up would be, you mentioned a customer that had some timing issues. Is that in the restaurant sector or the consumer sector? Could you be more specific there?","Lawrence Kurzius","Well, the warehouse, it was a move to raw material -- a new, larger and I would say more functional raw material warehouse. It actually was on the higher-margin side of the business that had a bigger impact on our flavor and seasoning business where we've had a lot of growth. So in addition to our overall growth that you've seen in our flavor solutions business over the last several years, there's also been a shift in the portfolio toward that higher-margin end of the business.","And so the growth in that part has been particularly strong, and we've just outgrown the space and needed to make a move. And so just the logistics of physically transferring the goods and coming up with a new warehouse put short-term constraint on our growth that we'll get -- we're really, at this point in time, almost through. So I think that gives a lot of confidence in the Q4 number over there. Rob, remind what was the second part of the question?","Robert Moskow","You mentioned a customer that had some timing issues.","Lawrence Kurzius","It's not a customer. This is just broad-based ebb and flow in the business. I mean there is some customer concentration, but I wouldn't read into this any particular new customer...","Mike Smith","It was timing of new promotions and things like that. You saw year to date roughly 5% in Americas, so good strong performance through the first half. So good underlying performance still and strong demand.","Robert Moskow","Can I assume that's the restaurant channel or is this ...","Lawrence Kurzius","No, I would not...","Mike Smith","Both sides, yes, do not assume.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Growe with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.","Chris Growe","Thank you. Good morning. I just had a question for you, if I could. Just to make sure I get it straight around the upcoming fourth quarter. You got that shipment timing factor in the prior year. Have you said what that adds to the fourth quarter this year? And we've talked about this, but have you given some dynamics around what it's likely to be for revenue growth in the fourth quarter?","Mike Smith","We haven't specifically called that out. We know it's a tailwind to us in the fourth quarter, assuming those things don't have, but we knew there's always trade deloading and things like that happen during the year, about 100 basis points. But we haven't quantified the bounce back, but it should be positive to growth and margin.","Chris Growe","And especially in the consumer division, correct, that's the main area where we said we've missed the fourth quarter a year ago?","Mike Smith","Yes.","Chris Growe","And then I just had a question. You had pricing down in two of the consumer segments and two of the flavor solutions segments. I'm just curious, I guess from a higher level, how much inflation was up in the quarter. And did pricing not fully offset the cost inflation? And was this promotional-driven by any chance? Just have you seen any kind of change in promotional dynamic in your categories, I guess, especially in the consumer side?","Mike Smith","No, I think what -- no, that's a good question. What you're saying -- we've said at the beginning of the year cost inflation was low single digits, and we have taken specific pricing in markets. What you're seeing, in some of the markets, such as EMEA or even in the Americas a bit. As we've talked a lot about new products on this call, as you see. As they roll out, there are some promotional activities to drive them, so that has a bit of a negative on price, but we have taken pricing this year. And so we've gotten that through, and we're actually talking to customers now about pricing for next year as some of the tariffs and things become more solid. So we're in those discussions right now.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steven Strycula with UBS. Please proceed with your question.","Steven Strycula","So first question, just wanted to kind of drill into the revised guidance and focus in on what you're really implying for the fourth quarter outlook. As I think about the midpoint of what you're saying for organic net sales to be around 5%, then kind of what are the key drivers of that? That would be question 1, and I have a follow-up.","Mike Smith","I mean based on our math, Steve, we're implying about 2% to 5%, so somewhere in the middle there, which is a bit up versus the first three quarters. But we talked about before some of the tailwinds go into the fourth quarter. And that's reported by the way. So continuing strength, as we saw in this quarter and a little bit of acceleration with flavor solutions in the fourth quarter, as Lawrence just discussed.","Lawrence Kurzius","Yes. The change in the guidance for the full year reflects more that we've only got one quarter to go and we've got three in the bag and we know where we are. And the high end of the old range, the previous high end of the range implied a number that you guys would laugh at.","Mike Smith","Which you did last year.","Lawrence Kurzius","And so we wanted to narrow it.","Steven Strycula","It takes a lot to make me laugh, Lawrence, but -- no, just moving along though. What would you say, if anything, not to pick at it, because I know you guys have good results here year to date. But what if anything came in like a touch lighter to kind of like nudge it down, the full-year guidance, a touch on the sales? Is it a reflection of maybe just EMEA weather? Is there anything else you'd kind of like call out for the first nine months or maybe something that you see in line of sight for the fourth quarter?","Mike Smith","Well, definitely EMEA weather. That was not. Back in June, we weren't thinking that it was going to be that hot it impact consumption. I mean the warehouse transition that Lawrence talked about did impact a bit, but I wouldn't call it one big thing specifically.","Lawrence Kurzius","Right. As far as looking ahead, I'd say that our -- I think that we've got a balanced view of our risks and our opportunity. That narrowed range does include all organic growth, and it's primarily volume and mix. So it's pretty strong versus peers, and we understand that.","Now we've got a lot of reasons to be confident that we can deliver that. And the kind of surprise will be something that we just, would be something that we don't know. I think if there was a surprise anywhere, maybe it might be more on the cost side than on the sales side, where there could be some issue. It's possible that we have a little bit more ERP expense in the fourth quarter than we've been guiding...","Mike Smith","Than we've had in the third.","Lawrence Kurzius","Than we had in the third quarter, but I think we would take that in stride, and if that were the case, we would certainly highlight it.","Mike Smith","Yes. And even our underlying guidance implied, reported is 5.5% to 9% almost, so it's good underlying operating profit performance still.","Lawrence Kurzius","Good point. We've got a pretty good idea of customer performance for the holidays. It's all pretty well lined up.","Steven Strycula","Okay, Lawrence. And then one quick strategy question, and then I'll pass it along. On private label, at any given quarter, you guys are -- it's a smaller piece of your business, and the next quarter, it's growing again. How do we think about it strategically? And did the growth that you see in private label in Americas this quarter, is that mainly coming from measured channels, unmeasured channels? How do we think about how you guys think about it within your total customer solution set?","Lawrence Kurzius","Yes. So first of all, generally, private label growth, not just for us but for our category, for herbs and spices, the category has moderated significantly. And we talked about it in the last couple of years that we thought the numbers were inflated by a couple of factors that I'm not going to review. So the growth in private label has moderated.","In the current time frame, the growth that we're seeing in private label is more in the unmeasured channel than in the measured channel. We think about private label in terms of its profitability in terms of the customer relationship and in terms of offering a customer a full solution for the category. And so there aren't any customers that we are just providing private label, it's always in conjunction with a branded program as well. Did I get at your question there?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Adam Samuelson","Yes. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. So a question not so much about the quarter but just thinking about the outlook and ramp into 2020 on the flavor solutions side, which, in the last couple of years, has been a really important contributor to the margins and earnings algorithm for the Company. Margins year to date have been basically flat and I'm just trying to think about kind of how drivers of why that margin expansion has slowed down as it has. And I know this quarter the growth, you had some lumpy growth and you had the warehousing expense. So not necessarily this quarter, but thinking about nine months in totality kind of how do we think about that into next year?","Mike Smith","Yes. I think if you kind of step back and think about the progress we've made over the past four, five years, I mean, we've increased, and this is both organic and acquisition based, about 500 basis points in the operating profit line. I mean this year has been a little lumpy. We're up in one quarter, even in another quarter and down in this quarter. Some of the discrete items that happened this quarter really around some really negative FX trends that hit EMEA primarily versus what we were thinking back in June...","Lawrence Kurzius","Probably transactional...","Mike Smith","Which goes through transactional, goes through the cost of goods sold as you reevaluate your balance sheet, so we see those, I mean those are risks that you always have based on world economies and things like that. But we continue to look at taking our portfolio to a higher-margin business. Some of the other things that hit us this year that hopefully will turn next year, you think about APZ where a lot of -- we talked about our flavor solutions business with limited-time offers.","I mean with some of the economies in China and APZ, they really shifted away from limited-time offers and we make higher-margin business to more base business which is lower margin. So that was some of the challenges we've had this year that hopefully, as economies and companies realize they need to drive LTOs to drive consumer traffic, will reverse.","Lawrence Kurzius","We continue to believe that, over time, we have significant runway for margin improvement in our flavor solutions segment.","Adam Samuelson","And then just a clarification. Just any way to quantify how much ERP has been year to date? And do we think that, any way to quantify kind of how big a step up, if any, there is into next year from ERP?","Mike Smith","Look, I mean, we'll talk about that more at our earnings, when we give guidance in January. But we have had some ERP expenses, as Lawrence alluded to. Last call, we said mostly second and third quarter. There's been a little bit of a shift out into the fourth quarter from the expense perspective. But we do see 2020, that's where a lot of our big go-lives are going to be, so there will be a significant step up in ERP. But we'll give you more clarity in January.","Adam Samuelson","I appreciate the color. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our question-and-answer session. I'll turn the floor back to Mr. Kurzius for any final comments.","Lawrence Kurzius","Great. Thanks, everyone, for your questions and for participating in today's call. McCormick is a global leader in flavor, and we're differentiated by the broad and advantaged portfolio, which continues to drive growth. We have a growing and profitable business and operate in an environment that is changing in an ever faster pace.","We are responding readily to changes in the industry with new ideas, innovation and purpose. With a relentless focus on growth, performance and people, we continue to perform strong globally and build shareholder value. I'm pleased with the strength of our year-to-date results, and as we enter the last quarter of our fiscal year, I'm confident in our fiscal year outlook and are well positioned to deliver another strong year in 2019.","Kasey Jenkins","Thank you, Lawrence. And thanks, everyone, for joining today's call and navigating through some of the technical call issues we've had at the beginning. If you have any further questions regarding today's information, please do not hesitate to reach out to me. This concludes this morning's conference call."]}}
