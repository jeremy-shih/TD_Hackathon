My name is Rachel, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Third Quarter Earnings -- 2013 Earnings Release Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Thank you.","I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Brady Parish, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin your conference.","Brady Parish","Thank you, Rachel. Good afternoon everyone, and thank you for joining us for Apache Corporation\u2019s third quarter 2013 earnings conference call. On today\u2019s call, we will have three speakers making prepared remarks prior to taking questions. I will start by giving a brief summary of the third quarter results, and then we will hear from Steve Farris, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, followed by Tom Chambers, our Chief Financial Officer. In addition, joining us for the question and answer session which will follow the prepared remarks are Roger Plank, President and Chief Corporate Officer; Rod Eichler, President and Chief Operating Officer; Tom Voytovich, Executive Vice President for International Operations and John Christmann, Region Vice President for our Permian region.","We prepared our quarterly financial supplemental data package for your use, which also includes the reconciliation of any non-GAAP numbers that we discuss, such as adjusted earnings, cash flow from operations, pre-tax margins or cash margins. In addition, we have prepared an operations supplement which summarizes our activities, includes detailed well highlights across the various Apache operating regions. These can both be found on our website at www.apachecorp.com\/financialinformation or financial info.","Today\u2019s discussion will contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions based on our current views and most reasonable expectations. However, a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from what we discuss today. A full disclaimer is located with the supplemental data package on our website.","This morning we reported third quarter 2013 earnings of $300 million or $0.75 per diluted share, cash flow from operations before changes in working capital totaled over $2.7 billion. Adjusted earnings, which excludes certain items that impact the comparability of results, totaled $932 million or $2.32 per diluted share. During the third quarter, total net production averaged approximately 784,000 boe per day with liquids production constituting 54% of the total. This represents an increase over the 771,000 boe per day reported in the third quarter of 2012 and a decrease from the 790,000 boe per day reported in the second quarter of 2013.","Production in the third quarter of 2013 was negatively impacted by a decrease in North Sea production 6,100 boe per day predominantly due to a planned turnaround at 40s as well as natural field declines in the offshore Gulf of Mexico and Australia, all of which we guided to on our second quarter earnings call.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Steve.","Steve Farris","Thank you, Brady, and good afternoon, everyone. And thank you everybody for joining us. As Brady mentioned, we\u2019re delighted to have Tom Voytovich and John Christmann, join Roger and Rod and Tom Chambers and me on the call. And although Tom and John are not officially assuming their new Co-COO positions until the beginning of 2014, in typical Apache fashion they\u2019re burning the candle at both ends rapidly getting up to speed with respect to their new responsibilities.","As Brady pointed out, Apache reported another solid quarter generating $932 million of adjusted earnings and $2.7 billion of cash flow from operations before changes in working capital. On the operational results I\u2019d highlight one number, Apache\u2019s North America onshore liquids production grew by 49,000 barrels of oil a day or 35% from the third quarter of 2012 reaching nearly 190,000 barrels. Our North American onshore oil production grew by 26% during the same period to 129,000 barrels a day. During this time those regions made no acquisitions, so this is a 100% drill bit generated growth and it puts Apache in the top-tier of North America onshore liquids growth generators among all our peers. Apache continued to be most active US onshore driller in the third quarter running an average of 77 rigs and completing 306 gross wells.","Importantly, we coupled our production growth with a relentless focus on operation and cost efficiency to ensure that our wells are not only increasing production but doing so at attractive returns. In all our onshore regions, we continue to drive down drilling and completion costs. And I\u2019ll give you a couple of examples. Year-to-date we reduced our drilling and completions costs by $1.5 million per well in Tonkawa play in the Anadarko Basin and over $1 million per well in the Wolfcamp and Cline Shale plays in the Permian Basin. And we expect to further reduce these well costs as we optimize our development activities in these plays.","You can read more details about our operational performance this quarter in our quarterly operation supplement which has been posted in the Investor Relations section of our website.","Commensurate with building a deep asset base in North America onshore and delivering leading liquids growth performance, we set about restructuring our portfolio to focus more around this North American onshore resource base. We\u2019ve successfully completed the lion share of that portfolio review. We\u2019ve already announced in excess of $7 billion of divestitures aimed at rebalancing our portfolio to include the right mix of assets capable of generating strong returns, driving more predictable growth and enhancing shareholder value.","As a result of these efforts North American onshore production was 56% of our production in the third quarter pro forma for the transactions we have announced year to date. That\u2019s up from less than a third in 2019, the year before we embarked on our strategy to substantially bolster our North American onshore resource base. This was achieved through a number of key steps during the third quarter. We exited our production operations in the Gulf of Mexico Shelf. This transaction closed on September 30 and generated $3.6 billion in cash proceeds. We expect another $200 million of cash from prep [ph] properties to be received in the fourth quarter.","In addition, with this transaction, we removed $1.5 billion of P&A obligations and given the maturity of the Gulf of Mexico Shelf, this step strengthens the production growth profile and reserve life visibility of our portfolio. It also goes a long way in eliminating a significant historical volatility factor in our production profile, hurricanes and other Gulf of Mexico offshore weather events. Those of you who have followed us for many years will understand that this was a big step for Apache but it was a right time for us because of our expanded visible and profitable opportunity base in North American onshore.","We have retained half of the deep rights exploration across our divested properties. So while we have exited that production, we are still very much exposed to the value of the upside in hydrocarbon rich region, especially in the sub-salt play. The other thing that it\u2019s done for us is it\u2019s given us an opportunity to grow without the significant declines we have seen on the shale or the P&A liability.","The second major step in the quarter was our partnership with Sinopec in Egypt. We are taking a one-third interest in our Egypt business in exchange for $3.1 billion in cash. We are on track to close this transaction in the fourth quarter.","As we indicated for some time we have been looking for a way to validate the value of our business in Egypt and I think we delivered on that. The transaction allows us to continue grow at attractive rates of return in Egypt, without Egypt being excessively largely component of our portfolio.","","In joining forces with Sinopec, we\u2019ve gained a very well suited partner who will add value to our operations and positioning in Egypt, and we expect to pursue a number of future growth projects jointly in different geographies around the world.","A third component of our portfolio of focusing steps in the third quarter was high grading our Canada properties. We have divested in excess of $300 million of properties there, primarily consisting of maturing gas properties. Having captured a very large resource base there, we are turning Canada into our horizontal drilling growth region that we can expect, or we do expect to compete with the Permian and the Anadarko basin, and rationalizing some of our legacy assets has been an important step in that process.","With these strategic steps, we are now positioned to drive more predictable growth through our enlarged North America onshore resource base and we also have the financial strength to fund that growth from our international free cash flow, the diversity of opportunities to complement it with very profitable international projects. We are still actively pursuing additional divestitures. We continue to be disciplined in our approach and we will only execute transactions that contribute to our overall strategic and financial goals.","With respect to capital allocation, on prior calls, we stated we would use proceeds that we receive from these divestitures to reduce debt and repurchase shares under our 30 million share authorization from our board. Using a portion of the sales proceeds received, we paid down almost $2 billion of debt during the third quarter and have repurchased approximately $700 million of stock, putting us well on our way of achieving our stated use of proceeds objectives.","Regarding the remaining proceeds from the Gulf of Mexico Shelf and the expected proceeds to be received from the Egypt partnership, we have been evaluating the most tax efficient way to fund international capital investment, pay down additional debt, repurchase shares and fund capital investments in our onshore U.S. regions.","We are currently running an accelerated pace in our Permian and Central regions. At our current pace, we will drill over 800 wells in the Permian versus 700 originally planned and over 375 wells in the Central versus the 300 that were originally planned there. This will increase our capital investment in those two regions by a combined $700 million to $800 million this year. Based upon this increased drilling activity we would expect onshore North American liquids to grow nearly 35% during 2013 versus the 25% growth rate we previously guided.","With that, I would like to turn the call over to Tom Chambers.","Tom Chambers","Thanks, Steve. This morning we reported third quarter earnings of $300 million or $0.75 per share, adjusted earnings of $932 million or $2.32 per share. 784,000 barrels of equivalent of net daily production and over $2.7 billion of cash flow from operations before working capital items. Overall, our bottom-line results reflect another solid financial performance for this quarter.","Oil and gas revenues totaled $4.4 billion, a $300 million increase over the second quarter driven primarily by higher oil prices with oil comprising 80% of total revenues despite only accounting for 46% of our total production on a boe basis. Including the impact of hedging, third quarter oil prices averaged $107.50 per barrel, up $9.57 per barrel from the second quarter, while gas prices averaged $3.49 per mcf down $0.38 from the second quarter.","For the quarter, oil continued to sell for more than 30 times the price of North American natural gas. Our total cash operating expenses were down slightly for the quarter to $17.53 per barrel of oil equivalent, primarily as a result of lower lifting cost and G&A expenses as we continue to focus on reducing costs.","As a result of our commodity mix and reduced cash operating costs, Apache\u2019s cash margin increased by over 7% versus the second quarter to a healthy $42.74 per boe.","Turning to earnings, we had several adjustments which impacted our results. Earnings for the quarter were negatively impacted by $478 million after-tax adjustment for non-cash property write-downs, including one in the US, predominantly related to our restructuring efforts, one in Argentina, relating to expiring concessions and one in Kenya, following our decision to exit the country.","These were offset somewhat by $28 million deferred tax benefit for foreign currency fluctuations and other deferred tax benefits totaling $31 million. In addition, we recorded an unrealized non-cash after-tax commodity derivative mark-to-market loss of $213 million primarily related to our 2014 oil hedges. We hedged 62,500 barrels per day of WTI accrued at almost $91 per barrel and 62,500 barrels a day of Brent crude at just over $100 per barrel versus realizations which were roughly $5 and $3 per barrel higher for WTI and Brent respectively as of the end of the third quarter.","When we remove these non-cash items for comparability purposes, we earn $932 million or $2.32 per share for the third quarter versus $2.16 a year ago and $2.01 in the second quarter of this year. In the third quarter Apache generated $2.7 billion of cash flow from operations before working capital items demonstrating our ability to generate consistent operating cash flows to support our robust drilling program and other planned capital expenditures.","Turning to taxes, the third quarter effective tax rate primarily reflects the impact of the adjustments just mentioned, excluding these items our effective tax rate would have been 42%. Similarly, these adjustments impacted our percentage of deferred taxes in the quarter. We would expect the deferred rate of approximately 28% for the year after these adjustments.","I would like to emphasize, as Steve just mentioned, we utilized a portion of the cash proceeds from the Gulf of Mexico Shelf sale and our first Canadian asset sale to reduce debt by $1.85 billion from the second quarter of this year. This decreased our debt-to-capitalization ratio to 25% at the end of the quarter from 28% at the end of the second quarter. We also utilized these proceeds to repurchase an additional $450 million of stock in October bringing the repurchased total to $700 million to date and nearly eight million shares.","Also, as Steve mentioned, regarding the remaining proceeds from the Gulf of Mexico Shelf sale and the expected proceeds to be received from the Egypt partnership, we are evaluating the most tax efficient way to fund international capital investments, pay down additional debt, repurchase shares and fund capital investments in our onshore US regions. Utilizing these proceeds will allow us to further enhance our debt maturity profile, preserve our balance sheet flexibility to fund operations and growth and enhance shareholder value.","This now concludes our prepared remarks and I will turn the call back over to Brady.","Brady Parish","Thanks, Tom. Operator, we are now ready to open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","","(Operator Instructions) And your first question comes from the line of Arun Jayaram [Credit Suisse].","Arun Jayaram \u2013 Credit Suisse","Steve, I wanted to get your comments around international. I think in the press release you talked about how going forward these regions will primarily be a source of excess cash flows, and I assume that the incremental cash flows would be reinvested in North America. But how should we think about international growth going forward?","Steve Farris","Well, we would like to be able to at least keep it flat \u2013 that regions that we keep we would like to be able to either keep flat or grow a little bit. For sure we\u2019d also like them to be able to generate significant cash flow with our capital program for the year. For Egypt, for example, I think generated about $900 million of cash flow in the first three quarters. So \u2013 and it has \u2013 and basically stayed flat.","Arun Jayaram \u2013 Credit Suisse","But Steve, by this comment, essentially you are communicating that relative to maybe Apache a year ago that you\u2019re going to be investing more of your cash flows in North America versus internationally? Is that fair?","Steve Farris","You bet. When \u201813 ends, you will see that in 2013 and certainly 2014 \u2013 a much stronger than that.","Arun Jayaram \u2013 Credit Suisse","And my second question is for Tom. You produced 784,000 barrels for this quarter, your pro forma run rate that you show on page four of the supplement, is that 625 which is \u2013 with all the asset sales gone. So my question as we think about the fourth quarter, it would just reflect, I assume, for the fourth quarter just the Gulf of Mexico Shelf and Canadian assets and then going forward as we think about the first quarter of \u201914, that\u2019s when we start thinking about 625 and maybe some growth on top of that, as that being kind of what you do next year; is that fair, Tom?","Tom Chambers","That\u2019s fair. That\u2019s exactly right. Go ahead.","Arun Jayaram \u2013 Credit Suisse","And can you just quantify -- overall I know you have done several transactions in Canada, what the impact will be in terms of the fourth quarter?","Steve Farris","Depending on we still have some pending transactions it should be around 22,000 barrels a day, or thereabout equivalent a day, predominantly gas.","","Operator","","And your next question comes from the line of Pearce Hammond [Simmons & Co.]","","Pearce Hammond \u2013 Simmons & Co.","","Steve, in your prepared remarks, you were talking about Canada and the ability to maybe have that asset compete with the Anadarko basin and the Permian basin assets for capital. Are you referring to your Duvernay and Montney assets and is this a foreshadow in that we should see an increased amount of CapEx for this region next year?","Steve Farris","Duvernay, Montney, also we have Bluesky and also some of our Viking stuff that we are doing, all of it going horizontal, I think we will have by the end of November we should have 12 rigs running out there, all 12 will be sideways. We will spud our first Duvernay well. We\u2019ve got an acreage position right in the heart of the play. So we will spud our first Duvernay well this winter. The rocks looks very similar to what they look like in the Anadarko basin there, they are called something different but that whole \u2013 western sedimentary basin looks an awful lot like the Anadarko basin.","Pearce Hammond \u2013 Simmons & Co.","Do you think the economics could compete because of the \u2013 it seems like with the differentials being a little wider up there, it might make a disadvantage?","Steve Farris","Well, I would tell you North American capital is going to have to compete with each other, so our program up there is going to have to compete with the Permian and Anadarko Basin in order to get funding.","Pearce Hammond \u2013 Simmons & Co.","Great. And then my follow-up question is when you look back at the BP transaction from a few years ago where you bought some assets in the Permian and Canada and Egypt, but specifically in Permian, sort of, an after-action review on that particular acquisition. What do you feel like you picked up and how has it helped your asset base and especially in light of all the de-risking that\u2019s going on in the Permian right now, how does that transaction look a couple of years on?","Steve Farris","Well, I\u2019ll give you a broad overview. I mean, honestly it\u2019s been a home run but John Christmann is sitting here, who runs our Permian and is getting ready to run all our North American onshore. So, John, do you want to comment?","John Christmann","I mean, I think when you look at \u2013 there is really two transactions, you can\u2019t just talk about, you know, BP without talking about Mariner, both those transactions really help change our whole program, I mean, you now look we\u2019ve got over 1.1 million acres in the Midland Basin, you know, we\u2019ve been in a transition out there, really an evolution into \u2013 in fact, in this quarter we now have, you know, across, we\u2019ve got more horizontal rigs running than vertical rigs and we\u2019ve got a lot of acreage contributed from, both, BP and Mariner. So I think it\u2019s really helped the region put it where it is today.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of John Herrlin.","John Herrlin \u2013 Societe Generale","Yeah. Hi. Steve, you mentioned that you had well cost savings. How much of it was hedge related and how much of it was well completion, onshore?","Steve Farris","How much is what now, John.","John Herrlin \u2013 Societe Generale","You mentioned that you hedge for wells, so just wondering \u2013","Steve Farris","Yeah, the Tonkawa is really not been too affected by pad drilling right now because we\u2019re just not going to that, frankly. The biggest cost savings in Tonkawa is number of days drilled and the completion cost. And the completion cost because we\u2019re self-sourcing all our chemicals, all our sand and our horsepower now.","John Herrlin \u2013 Societe Generale","Okay. And didn\u2019t you also mention that Permian as well or was it just the Tonkawa?","Steve Farris","No, I also mentioned the Cline. It\u2019s many of the same thing. That is pad drilling. Certainly in the Wolfcamp in our Barnhart area. It also is associated with self-sourcing all our services.","John Herrlin \u2013 Societe Generale","Okay. Next one for me is in the Permian you built a very large organization quickly. How automated are you going to make your operations just given the fact that infrastructure is so critical?","Steve Farris","John, do you want to \u2013","John Christmann","Yeah, I mean, I would say we have, you know, in a matter of three years, we\u2019ve now got over 330 folks in Midland and I would stack that organization up against any. I think the thing we\u2019ve got with the mid-40, 44 rigs running right now, when we are \u2013 you know, as I mentioned we\u2019ve now got more horizontals than verticals, the beauty that we\u2019ve got is, we\u2019ve got multiple plays and that we\u2019ve got the ability to kind of time these where we can work around our infrastructure both on the processing side as well as having facilities built for water handling, you know, the pads built and the sourcing for the fracs. So, I think it actually puts us in a position where we\u2019ve got the ability to plan. We\u2019ve been working on getting further ahead so we can do an even better job doing that. But I think that\u2019s why you see such strong performance from the Permian in the third quarter and it looks good going forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Freeman.","John Freeman \u2013 Raymond James","Good afternoon. Have you all made a decision yet on when you do get those Egyptian proceeds whether or not you\u2019re going to lead it offshore versus you lead in places like Wheatstone next year or if you bring it back and try to use your inner wells to kind of shield your tax hit?","Steve Farris","Well, you\u2019ve pretty well outlined the alternative. Certainly, we are looking at it, you know, we\u2019ve made some commitments to pay down debt and to buy shares back which we expect. One of the things that I said \u2013 I think I said on the last call is is that we have so more producing assets than the $4 billion which means we\u2019re going to have to pay down the debt than the $2 billion that we paid down so far. And we also have repurchased 8 million shares, which we intend to continue.","John Freeman \u2013 Raymond James","And then my other question \u2013 looking at Australia in Australia, if I am looking at this rate, the current production there that is at is 56 million a day, which is about 60% higher than what you all said, you thought the net daily production was going to be last quarter, I was just wondering if you could add any color.","Tom Voytovich","This is Tom Voytovich. I think that we are pushing more gas through Macedon earlier than we thought we did and it\u2019s a nameplate gas plant of 200 million, we are up to around 225 million. So arithmetic I think is fairly self-explanatory.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Charles Meade [Johnson Rice].","Charles Meade \u2013 Johnson Rice","I recognize that, that if you are all ready to give guidance and talk about 2014, volume growth you would have come out and done that. But I was wondering if I could get you to talk a little bit more about how you are internally thinking about what 2014 would look like, this year. Doing some of the same math that Arun did earlier, it looks like to me that you have been having kind of year-over-year growth of around 2% and just the denominator effect from the sold volumes will get you more like 2.5%. But I think there will also be some effect from the fact that the Gulf of Mexico Shelf was declining and that might add a bit more to your growth. So is there any discussions or thoughts that you have had internally that you can share?","Steve Farris","Yes, I can\u2019t quite \u2013 depending on how you calculate the math, the way that we look at 2014 is 2013 based on a pro forma, we should be able to increase our production growth rate for 2014. We\u2019ve got a lot of moving parts in 2013; to peg a number it\u2019s pretty difficult right now other than looking at it on a pro forma basis.","Charles Meade \u2013 Johnson Rice","And is there a pro forma number that you have in mind, Steve?","Steve Farris","No, we are going to have analyst day in February and we will come out with a 2014 production growth and capital plans for 2014.","Charles Meade \u2013 Johnson Rice","That will be great. I can wait till then. And then if I could follow up on the Permian, I notice that I have asked about this horizontal on the Central Basin platform you guys a few times. It seems like you are the only operator that\u2019s really doing it. And when I look at your operations report, if I am interpreting correctly, I think you\u2019ve got a few more in there, horizontal Wichita Albany, and horizontal Australia I think it was. And so those are quite impressive wells and they look like they have had great economics. And am I right in that and how does this stack up with some of the more industry wide plays that are happening in the Midland basin?","Tom Voytovich","I would say you are exactly right and those are, three of our wells right now are some of the best economics we\u2019ve got in the region for sure. The beauty we\u2019ve got is having a big position on the Central basin platform, we\u2019ve got a lot of assets, we\u2019ve got areas where we can go in and target and use horizontal drilling, and we\u2019ve done it quite successfully. And we have been doing that since 2010 in the Grayburg, Squire 4 [ph], [indiscernible] and obviously Wichita Albany has been a big story for us this year.","So I think the beauty of it there is you\u2019ve got your areas where you come off of main units, you\u2019ve got on the flanks, you\u2019ve had units performed on paycuts and parameters that were little better than what you are drilling horizontally and it makes for really, really economic wells. But the big deal is you\u2019ve got to have the assets in the acreage and positions in those deals and the infrastructure to drill. They are very good economics.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of David Tameron [Wells Fargo Securities].","David Tameron \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities","Hi, just back to the Permian. Can you give us a breakdown \u2013 you have -- I think it\u2019s 45 operated rigs running, can you just ballpark that for Central, Midland and Delaware?","Tom Voytovich","We\u2019ve got roughly 3 in the Mexico, handful of them in Central basin platform. If you look at the Wolfcamp alone right now, we\u2019ve got about 9 horizontal wells running in the Wolfcamp, I have got another 3 or 4 in other plays down in the central \u2013 or in the Midland basin. So you\u2019ve got over half of the rigs indefinitely in the Midland Basin and that over half of the rigs are horizontals. We\u2019ve got a couple down in the Delaware and they\u2019ve kind of scattered out in some other areas.","David Tameron \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities","Okay. John. And if we think about, just a year ago or year-and-a-half ago when you guys had your Analyst Day you kind of rolled out what your plans were for the Permian and what you knew at that time. Looking back, any areas you\u2019re more excited about, less excited about, kind of what\u2019s changed, I know there\u2019s been a lot going on the last year-and-a-half, but kind of what\u2019s changed in the last year-and-a-half that you could summarize that for us.","John Christmann","Well, I mean, I think, you know now the \u2013 obviously there\u2019s a lot of momentum, you\u2019re seeing a lot of these plays are real. They\u2019re getting more legs underneath. If you look back at what we guided to it was kind of 13% growth, I think with where we\u2019ve been the last two years, we\u2019ve well exceeded that. So, I think we\u2019re very excited about what\u2019s in front of us. I think you\u2019re seeing the cost come down significantly as we alluded to, you know, with the use of pad drilling and the completion side and starting to go that direction you\u2019re seeing multiple landing zones, so there\u2019s more to be excited about today as we see that it\u2019s starting to really prove out and we\u2019re being able to deliver on what we said we\u2019ll do to you back in June of 2012.","Operator","And your next question is from the line of Matt Portillo.","Matt Portillo \u2013 Tudor Pickering & Co.","Good afternoon.","Steve Farris","Good afternoon.","Matt Portillo \u2013 Tudor Pickering & Co.","Just two quick questions for me. The first in regards to the Permian. I know that you guys have really focused a lot of your drilling activity, initially, around the Barnhart area for the Wolfcamp but you do have a very big footprint in Reagan and [indiscernible] and Upton in Midland County. And I was curious, as we think about the program progressing forward, especially given some industry results we\u2019ve seen in all the various areas, how should we think about the expansion of your Wolfcamp program in the Midland Basin. And I guess, alongside that I did see that you had a very good Wolfcamp well, Loving, and I was curious how you guys are thinking about the Wolfcamp drilling program in the Delaware Basin?","John Christmann","Well, you got, you know, three different areas we\u2019re talking about there. You know, we\u2019re running six rigs in the Barnhart area, which is Irion County. You know, I think one of the legs up we\u2019ve got on industry right now is we\u2019ve probably drilled more concentrated wells in an area. So, we\u2019re probably further ahead in terms of understanding spacing lateral lengths and really moving into development mode. So, we\u2019ve been working hard there to understand that and actually doing a lot of field test to help us optimize wells. So, we\u2019re excited about Barnhart, I think you\u2019ll see us run a similar number of rigs as we start the plan for next year in that area. The one thing we\u2019ve done this year is we\u2019ve picked up two rigs, now we\u2019ve got three rigs actually in Reagan and Upton. We\u2019ve got two wells here, the Miller that are in the ops report that both are very strong wells. You know, I think an early look EURs will be north of our type curve that we put out in June of last year. And I think as you see us going into next year that will be an area where we will expand the rigs going forward as we get into those areas.","The other area you allude to is in the Delaware, that actually is a third Bone Springs well, a horizontal, but it\u2019s really close to the Wolfcamp which is why we tagged it that way. Very, very good well, you know, we\u2019ve got some room to drill some more over there as we just kind of start to understand our Delaware position. The big difference in the Delaware and the Midland is you\u2019ve got higher pressure, you\u2019ve got little more water volumes to deal with over in the Delaware but right now all three programs look very, very compelling.","Matt Portillo \u2013 Tudor Pickering & Co.","Okay.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Leo Mariani.","Leo Mariani \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Hey, guys, just wanted to follow-up on a comment you made regarding asset sales. It sounds like there could be some more coming from you folks, just wanted to get a sense, I mean, do you think there is anything really large are we kind of talking about small pieces of portfolio to clean up?","Steve Farris","Well, I think we\u2019ve done the lion\u2019s share. I think I said in my prepared remarks, we\u2019ve done the lion\u2019s share. We do have some other assets that we\u2019re looking at as part of our review. And I think it\u2019s important to note that if we can\u2019t get good value from at this point that we probably won\u2019t sell them but we are actively pursuing some of those.","Leo Mariani \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Alright. I guess in terms of cost, you guys obviously talked about a concentrated effort to reduce LOE and G&A, certainly showed up in the numbers this quarter. You know any sense of continued improvement, any kind of magnets that you can give us, I mean, could we see another 5% to 10% per boe come at a cost going forward and how should we think about that.","Steve Farris","Well, I think certainly that if you look at our operating costs on the shelf, our fourth quarter operating costs are going to go down, because if you put in that much production at $21 a barrel and average that over the rest of our property base, your operating costs are going to come down.","Certainly on the G&A side, obviously we\u2019ve gone down quite a bit on the product side and also \u2013 mentioned that when we talk about our sales in Canada, that\u2019s about 52% of our well count up there. So it wasn\u2019t just about getting rid of the dry gas, it\u2019s also getting rid of well count. So overall our G&A ought to continue to come down also.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Jeffrey Campbell [Tuohy Brothers Investment Research].","Jeffrey Campbell \u2013 Tuohy Brothers Investment Research","I noticed in your operations supplement that you mentioned that drilling fewer wells per section is 18, to better find well performing, I was wondering if you could provide some updated spacing for acre and will this be continued throughout your Cline areas?","Tom Voytovich","Well, I mean one thing about these shales is they are homogenous. So different areas, you got to attack them different ways but we have found in the class, especially in Glassglow [ph], we are right now kind of looking at four wells per section, we are seeing better results, so it\u2019s all a function of within that area but as you move into other areas, it changes. But I think that\u2019s one of the advantages we\u2019ve got as getting into some areas where we have got in the pads and drilling more laterals and get more wells down, we are going to have more data we can understand how to optimize this.","Steve Farris","On a broader scale, one thing I think that \u2013 and not just for Apache, I mean truthfully with the number of zones and the amount of oil in place in the Permian basin, we just scratched the surface. I mean I truly believe that. I think the Permian is going to have years of surprises in it, most of them are going to be good.","Tom Voytovich","Kind of follow up on that, if you take the Wolfcamp down and Barnett, we have tested four different zones in there, we\u2019ve now placed two in the upper some would call the Wolfcamp but we\u2019ve got a buffer, the lower portion of the upper are an upper. So there\u2019s going to be more laterals stack in all these fields. So they will walk in on just how many per section for sure.","Jeffrey Campbell \u2013 Tuohy Brothers Investment Research","Let me ask one further question, regarding the inherent risk of all exploration wells, maybe it\u2019s too early but I was just wondering having gotten to a 100 feet pace, that\u2019s efficient to commercialize the well, your announcement of the follow up drill kind of on the hill, it\u2019s very positive.","Tom Voytovich","Right, I think you can presume that we reached total depth on that well and we are about waiting selection options or evaluating options to conduction some appraisal drilling, so I think that will happen before the end of the year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Hall [Heikkinen Energy Advisors].","Michael Hall \u2013 Heikkinen Energy Advisors","I guess circle back on few things, number one, on the international production front, trying to little bit better understand that commentary about holding things flat, would that be from kind of current and or 2013 exit rate levels or should we think about that more as a flat year on year average?","Steve Farris","I think it\u2019s important that we articulate that plant \u2013 Egypt, we made that transaction for a number of reasons. Obviously validate the value of it. But the other thing, it also gives us an opportunity to grow that region because it won\u2019t be as big as part of our portfolio. So we can \u2013 it truly still have tremendous upside, we are drilling our first horizontal, actually we are going to drill seven horizontal wells this year but our first one is just about completed. And in the North Sea that is a matter of how much capital and how much cash you want to take out. In terms of our profile for 2014 versus 2013 more like an exit rate of 2013 than it is at average for the year.","Michael Hall \u2013 Heikkinen Energy Advisors","And I guess the other from my end is on the spending side, I am just trying to think about \u2013 what in the current, let\u2019s say quarterly spending rate would be non-recurring, if you will or should we \u2013 you know, why would though you do not think about just taking the roughly $3 billion spent this quarter and kind of annualizing that next year?","Steve Farris","Oh, you mean your capital \u2013 annualizing capital, I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t quite.","Michael Hall \u2013 Heikkinen Energy Advisors","Yeah.","Steve Farris","You know, we haven\u2019t allocated capital for 2014 yet. Certainly we\u2019re very active in the Permian, the Anadarko right now but I think we got to be careful about just annualizing the third quarter\u2019s capital numbers, that\u2019s probably a little strong.","Michael Hall \u2013 Heikkinen Energy Advisors","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate.","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Thanks and good afternoon, everybody. So, you guys gave us a pro forma production number for the quarter, I\u2019m just trying to think in light of the strength of your balance sheet with the disposals coming in, can you give us a pro forma cash flow and CapEx number for the quarter? And maybe opine a little bit as to whether you expect to start out spending cash flow given that you\u2019re going to have basically $6 billion of cash in your balance sheet when all disposals are done? And I\u2019ve got a follow-up, please.","Steve Farris","Brady, you \u2013","Brady Parish","Well, I don\u2019t think \u2013 I think it would be premature to put out a pro forma cash flow and CapEx number for the quarter. You know we did breakdown capital by region within the financial supplement. Obviously you know the two major items that we've sold which is really the source of the pro forma number that we have in the operation supplement. So, you can assume even though ultimately we're going to \u2013 we\u2019ll record 100% of Egypt on a non-controlling interest for the third that we don't own as the way we\u2019ll account for it, but if you assumed a third of the capital for Egypt is not ours, we\u2019re spinning two-thirds there and if you assume the Shelf obviously is not in those numbers, that would give you a sense for what our capital reduction would have been for the quarter.","As far as cash flow, you know, Egypt is pretty easy to figure out what our cash flow is, when you look at historical financials you get a good sense for what kind of cash flow we generate there, even on a quarterly basis. And with respect to the Shelf, the one guidance we had given around the date of the divestiture when it was announced is that we were roughly going to get about $500 million of excess cash flow out of the Shelf with about $900 million of capital, so that obviously implies about $1.4 billion per year at least for 2013 that we thought we might do this year.","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","So, that\u2019s helpful, Brady. Thanks. I guess what I\u2019m really trying to figure out is you guys have got enormous opportunities there, obviously in the Permian. And I know you don't want to talk about 2014 guidance but historically, Steve, you\u2019ve always talked about Apache will spend its cash flow but that was before you had potentially $6 billion on the balance sheet. So I\u2019m just wondering should we anticipate some of those disposal proceeds accelerating some of that value? And I'll leave it at that, thank you.","Steve Farris","Well, I think, a little bit you\u2019re seeing that this year. We're going to make the best capital decisions we can. And certainly we would like to have a growth profile for 2014 that\u2019s stronger than 2013.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Richard Powest [ph].","Unidentified Analyst","Hey, good afternoon, everyone. Steve, just going back to the sub-salt play on the Gulf of Mexico shelf, with the success at the Heron well, do you have a reserve estimate on that well at this point and well cost?","Steve Farris","You know we've got one well down. So, it's a little premature to talk about reserves. In terms of \u2013 the one thing I will say about that is, it is probably the next big play that\u2019s going to come on the shelf. I mean all you're doing is taking that same rock and coming up on the shelf and looking for the same things you were looking in Deepwater, the only difference is we've got infrastructure across the Gulf because of our relationship, our negotiations with Fieldwood, we have rights to go through platforms on all those wells we drilled, including Main Pass 295. So, you should expect us to drill quite a few sub-salt wells, exploration wells, next year. And I think it has tremendous room.","Unidentified Analyst","Are you currently drilling any additional sub-salt wells?","Unidentified Participant","There are two additional rigs that are running on the shelf right now. And we will continue program at that pace probably.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Joe Magner [Macquarie Research].","Joe Magner \u2013 Macquarie Research","I was wondering if you could provide us with an updated production number for the Barnhart area.it looks like you added 10 more wells from the last update that was provided a couple of months ago and just kind of curious what the trajectory looks like there?","John Christmann","We have not come out on with anything external yet but we continue to run on active program out there. We were well above 8000 oil and gas has gone up nicely as well too. So I mean I think you will see more of that in February of next year when we walk through the analyst stuff.","Joe Magner \u2013 Macquarie Research","Just I wondered if you could give us an update on, I think the length of the well being drilled up there has moved around a little bit, just current economics and costs and well performance.","John Christmann","I think we are pretty all in line with type curves that we disclosed back in June of \u201912. We have drilled some longer laterals as long as 9300 feet, where it makes sense with the land we seem to be \u2013 drill a mile and half, so we\u2019re just kind of setting that up right now. Our well costs have come down significantly as Steve alluded to. We are well under $7 million, the mid to high 6s right now. And so \u2013 and that\u2019s for the 7500 foot laterals.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of John Malone [Global Hunter Securities].","John Malone \u2013 Global Hunter Securities","I\u2019ve just two quick questions about BC, any update you can give us on status of Kitimat and then on Liard basin, you talked about these 10 new wells, can you give us some idea of what the production capacity of those Liard wells are?","John Christmann","So for Kitimat, things are progressing on a number of fronts there. From the regulatory standpoint, we are currently working with BC government to work out their desire for their LNG tax scheme. We are moving forward on the environmental approvements in areas that are concerning our pipeline occurrence right away. Of course, the downstream portion is operated by Chevron, in the upstream area we are completing our conceptual engineering for the placement of facilities that will support the rental drilling program.","As far as the second part of your question on the yard, the one well that we have which is a premier well which is outlined is the D-34-K well which we think is one of the most productive shale gas wells drilled to date in North America, if not the world, that well probably may cost 20 Bcf, it\u2019s been in production now for over year and a half, it\u2019s the current \u2013 exactly as we forecasted at the analyst day last year.","Unidentified Participant","The number of fracs are slight compared to what we will do on a development plan.","John Christmann","Exactly that particular well we only had six frac stages applied to at a very limited lateral compared to the design fracs for the wells going forward with the development plan which will be much longer laterals at a many frac stages we apply at it in Permian and Anadarko area. The 10-year program itself beginning in 2010 as we will mention more detail in February at our analyst day, is principally to hold acreage and less sulphur production, only a few of those wells like to see production in 2014 and 2014.","Operator","(Operator Instructions) There are no further questions at this time.","Brady Parish","Okay, thank you Rachel. Thank you everyone for participating on the call. We obviously greatly appreciate your interest in Apache. If you have any additional questions, please reach out to the IR department and will be happy to help you out. Thank you.

My name is Christie, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Apache Corporation First Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","I will now turn the call over to Gary Clark, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Clark, you may begin your conference.","Gary Clark","Good morning and thank you for joining us on Apache Corporation's first quarter financial and operational results conference call. We will begin the call with an overview by CEO and President, John Christmann. Tim Sullivan, Executive Vice President of Operations Support, will then provide additional operational color; and Steve Riney, Executive Vice President and CFO will summarize our fourth quarter and full-year financial performance. Also available on the call to answer questions are Apache Executive Vice Presidents, Mark Meyer, Energy Technology, Data Analytics and Commercial Intelligence; and Dave Pursell, Planning, Reserves and Fundamentals.","Our prepared remarks will be approximately 25 minutes in length, with the remainder of the hour allotted for Q&A. In conjunction with yesterday's press release, I hope you've had the opportunity to review our first quarter financial and operational supplement, which can be found on our Investor Relations website at investor.apachecorp.com.","On today's conference call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the differences between these non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the supplemental information provided on our website.","Consistent with previous reporting practices, adjusted production numbers cited in today's call are adjusted to exclude non-controlling interest in Egypt and Egypt's tax barrels.","Finally, I'd like to remind everyone that today's discussions will contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions based on our current views and reasonable expectations. However, a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from what we discuss today. A full disclaimer is located with the supplemental data on our website.","And with that, I will turn the call over to John.","John Christmann","Good morning and thank you for joining us. On today's call, I will provide an overview of Apache's first quarter results, discuss our production outlook and comment on our first exploration well in Suriname, review our upstream capital budget and Apache\u2019s commitment to return incremental cash flow to investors and highlight our progress on non-core asset sales.","Apache had an excellent first quarter in terms execution, well performance and delivery against our production and capital guidance. We exceeded our U.S. production target, my 5,000 BOEs per day and our international target by 7,000 BOEs per day, on a capital budget of less than $600 million.","In the Permian basin, we maintained oil production near fourth quarter levels despite placing one of our two completion crews on a frac holiday for the entire first quarter. At Alpine High, where we also had a relatively low number of completions, production was up significantly from the fourth quarter and was in line with our guidance of 70,000 BOEs per day.","Overall, we delivered a 5% sequential quarterly increase in Permian basin volumes. This is an impressive accomplishment given that we placed only 39 wells online in the first quarter compared to 60 wells during the fourth quarter. Strong operational execution and well performance coupled with minimal facilities downtime drove these results.","International production was up 6% compared to the fourth quarter. In the North Sea, we benefited from strong early production rates from two wells at Gartner and Callater. A continuation of good results from our revamped Waterford program in the Forties field and high facilities uptime across our operations. In Egypt, gross production was down slightly in the quarter but adjusted production net to Apache was up primarily due to the timing of cost recovery around year end.","Looking ahead, second quarter Permian oil production is projected to be down slightly due to completions timing with growth anticipated in the back half of the year is the number of completions increases significantly. At Alpine High production volumes will be impacted in the second quarter by the voluntary gas deferrals we discussed in our press release last week. I would note however, that temporary deferral of this production is expected to improve our short-term net cash flow.","Construction of Altus Midstream\u2019s first two cryogenic plants is proceeding ahead of schedule with the first plant currently commissioning and expected to flow gas this month. The second plant is expected to be fully in service during July and the third plant remains on schedule for the fourth quarter. By year-end, Altus will have a total 600 million cubic feet of nameplate rich gas processing capacity, capable of producing more than 60,000 barrels of NGLs per day.","Kinder Morgan's GCX pipeline is also expected to be in service beginning in October, which will give Apache access to Gulf Coast pricing on 550 million cubic feet per day of gas from the Permian. These processing and transportation catalysts will drive a significant uplift and Alpine High liquids production revenue and cash flow on which Steve will provide more detail in a few minutes.","On the international side, production will decrease in the second quarter as planned. The North Sea will experience natural declines from high production wells at Gartner and Callater while only one new well is being brought online during the quarter.","In Egypt, we expect gross oil production to increase as we ramp up activity and our new East Bahariya concession. However, the impact of higher oil prices on our production sharing contracts coupled with natural gas production declines will result in lower volumes net to Apache.","Looking out to the end of the year, our projected growth rate guidance from fourth quarter 2018 to fourth quarter 2019 is unchanged. We continue to expect 6% to 10% growth on a total company adjusted basis consisting of 12% to 16% growth in the U.S. and a 2% to 4% decline internationally.","Permian oil production is still expected to grow 5%. In Suriname, we have contracted the drillship and continue to anticipate spreading the first well on Block 58 in Suriname around mid-year.","The Noble Sam Croft, which is working in the Gulf of Mexico will deploy to Suriname upon completion of its current assignment. We have secured this drillship for a one well commitment and have an option on three additional wells. While Apache is preparing to drill the first well on block 58 at 100%, we have received and are evaluating numerous proposals from potential partners.","Turning now to CapEx. Our first quarter upstream capital investment was below guidance and was down 27% from fourth quarter levels. We began preparing for an activity reduction back in November, which was critical to enabling such a material change in our activity pace in less than one quarter.","As planned, our second quarter CapEx will increase slightly from the first quarter as a result of increased completion spending in the Permian associated with the return of our second frac crew in the Midland basin and the timing of large pad completions of Alpine High.","The timing of exploration spending mostly on Suriname, but also related to some activities in the lower 48 and lease payments at Alpine High where we are exercising some extension options due to the slower drilling activity.","Despite some inflationary headwinds related to the rise in oil prices. We remain on track to deliver our 2019 planned activities set for $2.4 billion. We were experiencing cost increases in labor, trucking, fuel and chemicals, but have thus far been able to offset these through efficiency gains.","We previously stated Apache's commitment to returning at least 50% of our incremental cash generation from all sources to investors before increasing our planned activity set. In keeping with this commitment, our 2019 planned capital activity and budget remains unchanged and we will began returning incremental cash to investors in the coming months.","This is of course in addition to our current regular dividend. Steve will elaborate further. With the success of our organic growth and exploration program, we find ourselves with some assets in the portfolio that we do not envision funding over the next several years. These assets will be more valuable in the hands of different owners. Accordingly, we recently entered into sales agreements totaling approximately $300 million, most of which is related to an exit of the SCOOP\/STACK which will close in the second quarter.","In summary, 2019 is progressing very well. Overall production was strong in the first quarter and we are demonstrating excellent capital discipline and cost control. The North Sea and Egypt continued to deliver robust free cash flow with their leverage to premium Brent crude prices and higher natural gas and NGL net backs.","In the Permian, we are poised to deliver attractive oil growth in a substantial cash flow uplift at Alpine High in the second half of the year. We will also be advancing our differential exploration initiatives most notably in Suriname.","In closing, Apache continues to deliver on the strategy we established four years ago, which is to fund the capital program, capable of delivering long-term returns and sustainable growth, live within cash flow at reasonable oil prices, and continue to return meaningful capital to shareholders. We can accomplish this due to our high quality drilling inventory and attractive exploration portfolio, relatively low base decline rate and continuous focus on improving capital productivity and efficiency.","With that, I will turn the call over to Tim Sullivan who will provide some operational details on the quarter.","Timothy Sullivan","Good morning. My prepared remarks on this call will cover first quarter 2019 region highlights and a review of the excellent progress we are making at Alpine High on cost reduction initiatives and rich gas pad optimization. Operationally, we are off to a very good start with all regions performing well. Companywide adjusted production was up 4% from the fourth quarter 2018 and up 19% from the same period in the prior year. The Permian was the largest growth driver with production up 5% and 36% respectively over the same time period.","As John noted, these results are particularly impressive giving our reduced activity during the quarter. Our well completions in the U.S. were down 35% from the fourth quarter, which was the result of timing and a frac holiday in the Permian Basin. We have recently added back a cleaner, cheaper natural gas field hydraulic frac fleet.","In the Midland Basin where we continue to drill high productivity oil wells, our primary activity in this quarter was an 8-well Wolfcamp B pad at Powell and a 6-well Lower Spraberry pad at Wildfire. In the Delaware Basin, we completed and brought on line a 4-well Wolfcamp pad at Dixieland, and at Alpine High, we brought on line 17 wells with the primary focus on rich gas in the Northern Flank.","In Egypt, as a result of our recently awarded concessions and our ongoing broadband seismic acquisition program, we have generated several hundred leads and prospects in both legacy and new concession areas. In the New East Bahariya concession, we brought on line three exploration wells that achieved the combined peak rate of nearly 4,500 barrels of oil per day and have cumed more than 125,000 barrels of oil. These are low cost, short-cycle wells that typically payout very quickly.","We also continue to have exploration success on our legacy acreage. One notable well on our Seawall concession in the Faghur Basin achieved a 30-day average flow rate of 5,200 barrels of oil per day. In the Matruh Basin, our Tango North exploration well tested at a rate of 4,000 barrels of oil per day and will go on line around mid-year. We also had a very successful Q1 development drilling campaign in Egypt with 14 producers, nine of which have tested in excess of 1,000 BOE per day.","As we continue our G&G work, we expect to identify and drill many low-cost high rate oil prospects throughout the Western Desert, such as the ones we drilled this quarter.","Turning to the North Sea, we drilled our first development well at Storr, which was the site of our 2016 exploration discovery. This well encountered 232-feet of net pay in the Nansen and Eriksson formations similar to the results from the discovery well. As we explored deeper, this well also encountered an additional 84-feet of net pay in the Kahraman formation, which is the same sand that is highly productive at Callater. First production at Storr is expected late in the fourth quarter.","At Alpine High we will reach a significant milestone this month to start up of Altus first cryogenic plant in the next two to three weeks. Before Steve walks you through the significant cash generation in margin uplift we will receive. I wanted to highlight the significant progress we have made with both costs and our rich gas optimization initiatives on the upstream side.","Since Alpine High is delineation phase began in 2017, Apache has made steady efficiency gains, drilling costs per foot or down approximately 20% from 2017 through the end of the first quarter. Over the same time period, we realized that 30% reduction in completion costs per lateral foot. These costs improvements have come with only a modest increase in average lateral length.","We expect to generate further efficiencies as lateral links increase over time and the average number of wells drilled per pad increases. Multiwell pad optimization has now begun at Alpine High. We are evaluating optimal pattern and spacing relationships within a section to recover larger volumes of hydrocarbons with fewer wells and less capital.","As an example, we recently conducted spacing and pattern tests on two rich gas pads on the Northern Flank situated in adjacent sections. By adjusting the horizontal spacing between wells, the vertical location within target zones, and an improving our frac design. We are seeing cumulative recoveries from our 6-well Mont Blanc pad significantly outperform our 8-well Blackfoot pad.","6-wells producing from the Woodford A&B formations on the Mont Blanc pad achieved 150 days gross cumulative production of 10.5 Bcf of rich gas compared to 9.7 Bcf and the 8-well Blackfoot pad in the same Woodford A&B formations. In combination with cryogenic processing each pad was also have cube in excess of 800,000 barrels of NGLs.","With 2 fewer wells, the Mont Blanc pad has not only outperform but has also realized cost savings of $12.7 million as a result of fewer well bores. Capital efficiency is vital to success in resource play development and the trends are certainly positive for Alpine High. We believe there are substantial additional cost savings to be realized through ongoing optimization initiatives which include longer laterals and larger pads.","Apache has also made considerable upfront investments in water handling and reuse facilities at Alpine High, which will drive cost savings for many years to come. Our primary target formations, the Woodford and the Barnett produced very little institchu water, thereby eliminating the need to contract costly water handling trucks and salt water disposal services. We believe the Alpine High is well on its way to being the lowest cost, most efficient and most environmentally friendly rich gas play in the country.","With that, I will now turn the call over to Steve.","Stephen Riney","Thank you, Tim. On today's call, I will review first quarter financial results, update the status of gas production deferrals at Alpine High. Provide a few guidance changes for 2019, highlight the cash generation capacity of our rich gas production at Alpine High following cryo startup later this month and GCX startup later this year and outline our current thinking around capital return to investors.","As noted in the press release issued last night under generally accepted accounting principles. Apache reported first quarter of 2019 consolidated net loss of $47 million or $0.12 per diluted common share. These results include a number of items that are outside of core earnings, which are typically excluded by the investment community and their published earnings estimates.","On an after tax basis the most significant items include a $35 million unrealized loss on derivatives, a $31 million tax adjustment related primarily to evaluation allowance on deferred tax assets and $18 million of leasehold impairments. None of these items impacted cash flow in the quarter. Excluding these and other smaller items adjusted earnings for the quarter were $38 million or $0.10 per share.","Highlights for the quarter include upstream capital investment of less than $600 million, which demonstrates our commitment to running a discipline program and meeting our full-year upstream capital budget of $2.4 billion. For 2019, we have locked in pricing on much of our capital costs such as drilling rigs, pressure pumping services in sand.","However, as John indicated, trucking, labor, fuel and chemical costs are trending higher with oil prices. First quarter operating costs, we're generally in line with guidance. LOE per BOE costs came in a bit higher than expectations, primarily driven by Egypt. Offsetting this gathering, processing and transportation costs were less than guidance.","As we look at the remainder of 2019, let me first discuss our temporary production deferrals at Alpine High. Beginning in late March, for a variety of reasons, Permian Basin natural gas dipped to extremely low, and at times negative pricing. In response, Apache chose to defer a portion of our guest production at Alpine High. In the month of April, these deferrals averaged approximately 230 million cubic feet per day of gross wellhead gas.","The deferred volumes are comprised of both lean and rich gas. And now we anticipate a continuation of week gas prices, until more transport capacity comes online later in the year. We currently plan to restore all of our rich gas production as we commissioned our first two cryo facilities over the next eight to 10 weeks.","Apache is cognizant of the impact that gas deferrals have on Altus Midstream Company and has agreed to reduce certain shared overhead costs. We believe this is in the best interest of both companies. It has a negligible net impact to Apache and ensures that Altus remains in a good position to deliver on the critical near-term infrastructure build out at Alpine High.","With this situation and other impacts in mine, we have updated our forward looking guidance on a number of items. Taking into account, a range of potential production deferrals for the remainder of the quarter, our second quarter Alpine High production outlook is 45,000 to 55,000 BOE per day. This is projected to increase to 85,000 to 95,000 BOE per day in the third quarter, which still includes the potential for some deferred volumes.","Our 2019 rig schedule and completions activity is not impacted by the deferrals. As a result, we still expect that fourth quarter and year-end exit rates from Alpine High will exceed 100,000 BOE per day.","In addition to issuing at 2019 quarterly guidance at Alpine High, we have also introduced quarterly Permian oil guidance and international guidance. The details of which can be found in the supplement on our website.","For upstream capital investment, we are expecting the second quarter to be in the $650 million to $700 million range and full-year capital investment remains at $2.4 billion, as originally planned. For LOE, we are increasing our guidance to recognize some additional costs in Egypt as well as the impact of lower volumes in Alpine High. Our full-year LOE is now expected to average around $8 per BOE.","Next, I would like to review some upcoming changes, which will significantly improve the cash flow generation from Alpine High. While we have been clear that Alpine High is a diversified resource with all three hydrocarbons phases at its core, it is an enormous rich gas play and the key to value creation is full recovery and monetization of the NGL stream.","Today we'd process rich gas through mechanical refrigeration units, which are not very efficient, so we don't recover the full NGL stream. The resulting small volumes of NGLs are currently truck to a facility where they can be transported to Mont Belvieu and fractionated.","This temporary setup is relatively high costs and significantly squeezes the cash margin. Finally, we are selling most of the residue gas at Waha, which as we spoke about previously, prices at around zero today.","The result is extremely low margins and minimal cash flow net to Apache. That is the reality of Alpine High today. But that is all about to start changing because of the preparations that have underway for nearly two years.","By the end of this quarter, we will generate much higher NGO yields as we transitioned to cryo processing. We will receive much better NGL margins through transport and fractionation under our long-term fixed price contract with enterprise.","And in a few months, when GCX is placed in service, we will transport residue gas out of the basin and receive Gulf Coast pricing. And our supplement, we have included a slide illustrating the cash generating potential at Alpine High, assuming full utilization of a single cryo unit with 200 million cubic feet per day of nameplate processing capacity.","To summarize the key takeaways, 200 million cubic feet per day of gross wellhead gas process through Altus\u2019 cryo facilities is capable of generating $270 million to $300 million of annualized revenue under a very reasonable range of commodity price assumptions.","Note this is net revenue to Apache after royalties. After further netting out all gathering, processing, fractionation and transportation fees as well as projected operating costs and state severance taxes, Apache\u2019s annualized net cash flows from a single cryo facility are expected to range from $135 million to $165 million. So this transition will begin in the next few weeks and will carry on through the rest of 2019. By the end of this year, we will have three of these cryo facilities in service with all three of them expected to be operating at full capacity sometime in 2020.","Before moving to Q&A, I would like to address our thoughts on returning cash to investors. Coming into 2019, we committed to returning at least 50% of excess free cash to investors, before increasing capital activity. With the stronger than planned year-to-date oil prices and the coming proceeds from asset sales, we will soon be in a position to begin that process.","We will accomplish this through debt reduction, share repurchases or most likely a combination thereof. To the extent we choose to include some debt reduction that would likely begin with retiring $150 million of debt that matures in July, all of this is of course in addition to our ongoing dividends. Also, just to be clear, we have no plans to change our capital activity set.","In conclusion, we have began the year well, building on the momentum from 2018. We continue to execute on our strategy of delivering returns-focused short cycle growth in the Permian Basin, sustaining our international businesses for long-term free cash flow generation in building growth opportunities for the long-term through exploration.","2019 will be a promising step forward. Alpine High is on the doorstep of generating significant cash flow with the startup of cryo processing and transported gas to the Gulf Coast, and we will commence exploration activities on Block 58 in Suriname this summer. While we are prepared to proceed on a sole risk basis, we are actively considering proposals from numerous would-be partners.","And with that, I will turn the call over to the operator for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from Bob Brackett of Bernstein Research.","Robert Brackett","Hey, good morning. I had a question on Block 58 in Suriname. It looks like the lease expires the initial exploration term June 24 of next year. Can you talk about the renewal process or the extension process on that lease?","John Christmann","Bob at this point, we've worked with the government of Suriname. We've got a one rig or one well, commitment kicks us into the next phase. And obviously we will commence that well ahead of that time schedule, so it'll kick us into the next phase and that's all we've shared publicly at this time.","Robert Brackett","And the next phase is a \u2013 it\u2019s two to three-year extension, and is there any relinquishment involved?","John Christmann","It kicks us well into Phase II and at this point, we have not given any more color on Phase II.","Robert Brackett","Okay. Appreciate it.","John Christmann","Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from John Freeman of Raymond James.","John Freeman","Hi, guys.","John Christmann","Good morning, John.","John Freeman","Following up on Suriname, given the unsolicited sort of interest you've had from potential partners, and you all talked about, you'd be willing to proceed on an individual basis. Does this in any way sort of possibly delay when you spread the well while you kind of review all these proposals before you spread it?","John Christmann","Not at all. I mean, we're on a path. We're prepared \u2013 we\u2019ll be prepared to drill multiple wells, and we\u2019ve said we\u2019ve got a one well commitment with the rig and three optional wells, and we're prepared to head down the path we're on. So not at all.","John Freeman","Okay. And then just on \u2013 the follow-up for me on Slide 11 on Alpine High and the cost improvements that you all broke out when you look at sort of pad development versus the other wells. Can you remind me what percentage of the activity right now is on pads versus the rest of the wells?","John Christmann","I mean the bulk of it is shifting to pads. What you've got in there is just the quarter numbers. It was kind of 194 versus what it would have been in terms of the pads at 153 type numbers. So we're shifting in the pads, but it's some of the testing and some of the other wells would drive that. But you're seeing us move predominantly into pad development with some larger pads coming.","John Freeman","Great. Thanks guys. Appreciate it.","John Christmann","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Douglas Leggate of Bank of America.","Douglas Leggate","Well, thanks. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. John, I wonder if I could pull this a little bit on Suriname. I would understanding is that when the well was drilled in the adjacent block, there was down or on up dip oil well that was tied by that well, which obviously bodes very well for your blog? So my question is, how have you chosen the location of the well and given that - assuming not correct. Why wouldn't you drill the location right up against the Guyana border?","John Christmann","Well, I mean, the first thing is we know we've got an active hydrocarbon system Doug. We've got seven plays when you look at our block, I mean it's just an unbelievable walk and as we've said more than 50, very large prospect. So we obviously have chosen our first well location. We have not disclosed that. But clearly we've taken into account any information we have through public means that's out there.","Douglas Leggate","Would it be reasonable to assume that would be, how can I put it one of the top two or three targets on the block to basically try and make sure your side of it?","John Christmann","I wouldn't want to assume anything about the top three targets on the block, but clearly you've got a discovery a that is on the lease line and that's your bodes well for us. But I hate you assuming anything.","Douglas Leggate","Understand. My follow-up is also about Suriname if you don't mind that. It really goes to your point about 100%. These wells and the adjacent block are quite an expensive relatively speaking $50 million to $100 million given the potential impact on farmed and value in the block. Why wouldn't you drill it 100%?","John Christmann","Well, I mean, as of today we still on the block 100% and that's the path we're marching down. So I mean the reason we wouldn't is because somebody talked us out and doing that.","Douglas Leggate","Fair point. Forgive me. I was going to try one final one. Out of sign beat on the road, talking a little bit about this on the prospect backlog and just share with everybody what you see as your risk prospect by lock in the block. And I will leave it there. Thank you so much.","John Christmann","I mean I just think it's a phenomenal block. Our timing and when we picked it up, we were just fortunate that we picked this at the middle of 2015 when there was not a lot of activity, a lot of interest. We were able to do it but before Exxon drill laser and before we drilled our first well and it was a really, really low price in terms of the commitment at the time and it is very well-positioned as we've said. There's multiple plays. We've got both shallow and deepwater targets that we can get to. And I mean, when you look at the size of this 1.44 million acres, I mean, that's larger than range county just for perspective. And there's more than seven different plays and 50 plus very large prospect. So we're anxious to kind of get going.","Douglas Leggate","Good luck, John. Appreciate the answers. Thank you.","John Christmann","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Gail Nicholson of Stephens.","Gail Nicholson","Good morning, everybody. Can you talk about where the decline rate is at the 40 field now in North Sea with the Waterford management that you were doing and how that has changed maybe any near-term PNA you would have it Forties?","John Christmann","Gail, I mean, I think what you've seen as we've changed philosophically how we approaching that and we really are managing the Waterford. I do not have the particulars off the cuff, but we are seeing long-term trends that are flattening that decline. If you look at the abandonment timeframe, even prior it's been in the 2032 to 2035 time reframe, I think this pushes that back","And most importantly, it just provides stability, to the rights out there. So but I don't have those \u2013 we\u2019ve not what's been done. I would say you could look at some of the work that would Mac I think recently updated some of their work that is starting to reflect some of that. But I don't even think their report captures all of what we see.","Gail Nicholson","Okay. Great. And then just looking at the improvement you guys have seen in the Alpine High well cost. You've only done a slightly longer laterals. Can you just talk about how you envision lateral link progression over them, the next I guess several years and what you think that the farther I do from a cost improvement standpoint on the drilling aspect?","John Christmann","Well, I mean the big thing we've got down there as you don't have a lot of shallow production you're having to deal with. We also don't have a lot of chirrup and hard rock like you have up in the Oklahoma area.","So you can get down quickly. We've been able to eliminate some casing strings. Clearly, the land position will dictate some are lateral lengths. The other big factor we've got in the source interval as you do not have water. And so with your longer laterals, you're going to get the productivity increases on a relative as you increase your lateral foot basis.","Most of our wells have been shorter in the north because that's where our land, retention has been. And so that's what you're saying. But clearly, as we get the opportunity to drill longer laterals, you'll see, us transitioning mayor and I think you're going to continue to see costs come down.","If you look at our numbers, we've had great progress and we continue to see progress is those programs have continued this quarter, so a lot of really good things happening on \u2013 at Alpine High.","Operator","And our next question comes from Mike Scialla of Stifel.","Michael Scialla","Yes. Good morning. Steve, walk us through some pretty good detail on the uplift you expect to see with the cryo plants coming on Slide 12. Just wondering with Waha Hub gas prices where they are, was there any discussion with all this to maybe potentially delay a ramping up that first cryo plant until the GCX a line goes into service in October? Can you just talk about that and if not, how does that ramp at the first cryo plant look in terms of the timing?","John Christmann","Yes. So the back part of your question first, the cryo number one is \u2013 it is being commissioned now, and it should be a \u2013 it should be full by the end of May. In terms of \u2013 well cryo number two will be \u2013 it's actually moved up in the schedule and be commissioning in June. It will be full by the end of July.","In terms of considering the possibility of moving those back in the schedule, no, we did not consider that at all. We want to get those things up and running. We want to get the rich gas flowing again and we want to get those things working to the full extent possible of extracting that NGL content out of that rich gas stream.","We've got enough gas today or fill cryo number one, and we will have enough gas, by the end of July to fill cryo number two. So those will be fully functional and full of rich gas, on the day they're ready to go full.","The primary reason why we didn't, as you can look at that that slide, in the pack that we gave out, you can see the gas is certainly an important part of the full operating cash margin from the rich gas at Alpine High, but it's not the dominant piece. There's some oil content in those rich gas wells and there's the NGL yields.","And there's \u2013 even if gas is selling at zero, you can see that that's still above a breakeven cash flow situation. Once we get those things fall. So we want to get them operational. We're going to get them up and running and GCX is not far away. Its official startup date is October 1 and that's not that's not too long away.","Michael Scialla","Thanks for that. And maybe a follow-up, can you just talk about your outlook for NGL prices over the next couple of years, obviously a key component as you said to the economics at Alpine High?","David Pursell","Yes. Hi, this is Dave Purcell. If you look at wide grade today and you look at Slide 12, we're running about current spot prices in the strip. It's about $24 a barrel that's really suppressed mainly by the light ends, particularly ethane. If you look at the ethane fundamentals going through the end of this year and into 2022, two things are going to happen. There's going to be more cracker capacity added on the Gulf Coast. There also be more dot capacity for exports added.","So as you look through the next 18 months, we think there's much more upside and downside to the current ethane price and we think that will start to move the overall wide grade higher.","Michael Scialla","Thank you.","John Christmann","Thanks, Mike.","Operator","And your next question comes from Charles Meade of Johnson Rice.","Charles Meade","Good morning, John to you and your whole team there.","John Christmann","Good morning, Charles.","Charles Meade","If I could ask two questions on Alpine High. One just the quick one, real quick is to clarify. So when you have this cryo startup in July, you may still have some issues with the natural gas pricing. But your NGL pricing at that point you're connected at the tail pipe to get Gulf Coast pricing at that point for your engine.","John Christmann","Yes. It will start moving to Mont Belvieu through our enterprise agreement. So we'll start see an immediate uplift.","Charles Meade","Got it. And then the second question, this gets more on the well spacing and those kind of intriguing results you guys put out with the Mont Blanc and the Blackfoot pad. I recognized this early, but does this suggest that there's going to be any changes to the type curve \u2013 individual well type curve in the number of locations that you guys have in the Woodford or is this perhaps instead just something that's going to be localized to these areas?","John Christmann","No, I mean, I think it shows the process, and the methodical process we've taken to kind of break the rock down and get to what we think is the optimal development scenarios. In both cases, we drilled some Woodford C because we needed to see as thick is the column is as much rock as we have to deal with, we needed to see how the A's, B's and C's performed together. We clearly went a little wider spacing, a little larger fracs at the Mont Blanc, you're seeing some pretty impressive results. So some of that's also about changing.","So as we've said, in the future you're probably going to see us drop the A's a little deeper, drop the B\u2019s a little deeper or eliminate the C\u2019s and a little wider spacing and then we'll continue to learn on the fracs. But I think, the big thing is the last location count we put out was fall of 2017, I think, October, 2017, and we're still in a position where location count would go up given the assumptions we've got in place. And that's why we've been very careful to do our testing and understand it. We never assume more than two in the Woodford or the Barnett. And we're very confident in those numbers. And you're seeing some strong performance. ","Charles Meade","That's helpful context. Thank you, John.","John Christmann","You bet, Charles.","Operator","And your next question is from Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs.","Brian Singer","Thank you. Good morning.","John Christmann","Good morning, Brian.","Brian Singer","I wanted to touch based on a couple of items, the first on exploration outside of Suriname. Can you just give us an update on how that's progressing and any expectations for making any of the ideas you're pursuing open to the public market? And then also a follow-up on the comments you made on assets sales to what degree are you pursuing and how meaningful could further assets sale will be?","John Christmann","Well, I mean, I think from the get-go, we've always said we were going to differentiate ourselves through exploration. And we do have a Lower 48 program, it\u2019s focused DUS, it's focused more oil, it's focused more on conventionally, and our strategy has always been to try to build positions of scale and size where there was an opportunity \u2013 and low cost, where there was an opportunity to try to do in order to create meaningful value for our shareholders. So we have a program there. With the appropriate time, we'll talk more about that.","As far as your second question on the asset sales, clearly we have over $300 million now that's under contract. As we said, the bulk of that is our SCOOP\/STACK position. And I think the point there, Brian, as we look at our portfolio and we look at the things that we will be funding to the extent there's things that we will not fund in the future and if there's an opportunity for somebody else to own those and create value by purchasing those then we're not afraid to do that. And that's where we find ourselves today with the success we've had through our organic expiration program. We continue to take a long-term view through our portfolio model at our areas and what's going to attract capital. And we did not see the SCOOP\/STACK is an area where we would be putting capital and therefore, we have it under contract.","Brian Singer","Great. Thanks. And if I could ask one more. On Slide 8, you highlight a trajectory in the Permian relative of the timing of completions and as you show in both 2018 and 2019, you've had a couple of quarters of frac holidays? Is that's kind of the way you're planning going forward to achieve desired growth there to basically try to batch completions into two quarters of the year or is that just the way it's ended up?","John Christmann","No. It's just really coincidental with the way - the programs is lined up. When you go to larger pads, it becomes a little more lumpy. I think the key here for us is early in 2018, we had to put a crew on a frac holiday because we'd had the drilling efficiencies and picked up and in terms of the \u2013 on the - well I'll say the completion efficiencies and picked up and they're drilling rates hadn't caught up yet.","And so we had to set up frac crew down and what\u2019s you saw as the timing of that. The one going into this year was really his prices dropped in November. We anticipated that we needed to drop a couple of rigs. We put a frac crew on holiday, that's really so we could deliver the capital budget that we have set for this year.","So I think those were actions we've taken to level low the activity set to where we need to be for this price environment. And so we dropped a couple of rigs and put a crew on holiday. The trade-off there is as your second quarter production. We'll dip a little bit. But we think in the grand scheme of things, I would rather have more of a level loaded program throughout the year, which is how we positioned ourselves.","Stephen Riney","Just adding to that a little bit, Brian. John commented on the lumpiness of the activity said. That just becomes a lot more visible when your capital program is reduced to the size of what we're \u2013 where we are today. The lumpiness of an efficient drilling and completion had level activity set just becomes a bit more visible. That's all.","Brian Singer","Okay. Thank you. ","Operator","And your next question comes from Scott Hanold of RBC Capital Markets.","Scott Hanold","Thanks. My first question, hopefully pretty quick on the NGLs. Once a cryos are on, could you remind us what the product breakdown of that NGL basket is going to be for you guys? ","Stephen Riney","Yes. I don't think the NGL yield in Alpine High is going to be any different than the NGL yield anywhere else. We have an operated these types of cryo units before. So that would probably be a good question for a second or third quarter results when we've actually operated a couple of them for a bit.","Scott Hanold","Okay. I understand. Thank you. And that sort of the \u2013 so just certain average barrels which you're basing that $24 a barrel assumption right now that you put out there?","Stephen Riney","Well, we just stuck an assumption out there on the pricing at $24. We just said 40% of WTI, that's about where it's trading today. That's a reasonable assumption. We think that's conservative for the long-term for multiple reasons that Dave Pursell laid out earlier. And just on a mixed NGL barrel basis, 40% of WTI is probably especially if you look back in time it moves around a lot obviously, but 40% is probably a conservative assumption.","Scott Hanold","Okay, fair enough. And my follow-up question is regarding the free cash flow, you all talked about ones these cryos start coming on online or at least the cash flow generation and also the asset sale proceeds and utilizing that. When you step back and look at him in a Apache stock is compared to say the last call it five years, it's at a pretty low point? Does it make sense to like, as you look to return cash to shareholders to be a little bit more focused on share buybacks right now or in how does that's potential Suriname well sort of play into that decision?","Stephen Riney","Well, I don't think that Suriname well plays into that decision for 2019. Let's get the transactions close, which will happen in the second quarter. We'll proceed slowly, but we said we would return the excess free cash at least 50% of that shareholders before we changed our activity level.","I think we said it a couple times in the prepared remarks. We'll say it again. There's no change in activity level for 2019. We're still on the 2.4 billion capital program. And I just remind everybody that the startup of the cryo facilities and the cash flows from those were in the plan for this year.","So those aren't necessarily delivering excess free cash flow. They're delivering the plan free cash flow to the extent they start early, to the extent that NGL prices improve. To the extent that they give us a greater yield than we may have planned. And those types of things deliver excess free cash flow, but not just the startup from them.","And we will look at I think as we get to the second half of the year, which is a going to be upon as pretty quickly, that's when we'll get into the discussions about how do we use that excess cash flow. And I could assure you that both the debt reduction and a share buybacks will be on that agenda. And in that conversation you were likely to do some of both there's some debt maturing 150 million of debt maturing in July. If we choose to paydown any debt, then that would probably be where we would start.","Scott Hanold","Understood. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question is from John Aschenbeck from Seaport Global.","John Aschenbeck","Good morning everyone and thank you for taking my questions.","John Christmann","You bet, John.","John Aschenbeck","Thanks John. So there's been a lot of commentary around 2019 spending. So I apologize if I missed this. But just thinking about the remainder of the year, if I run and admittedly over simplified exercise and take your Q1 spend and your Q2 guidance, it would just indicate that spendings coming down in future quarters. So is that an accurate assessment? And then secondly, it just \u2013 how should we think about the cadence of spending and the second half of the year? Thanks.","John Christmann","Well, I mean, I think the first thing is we're down 27% over fourth quarter and we actually came in right at 25% of what we guided for the year. So first quarter was pretty evenly run for how the year would pan out. We walked through in the prepared remarks, some things that could cause second quarter would be a little higher, which is kind of why we guided there, but there are more exploration driven.","So I think from our perspective, we took the bigger decision in November and December to drop some rigs and put a crew on holiday to kind of do that now. And it puts us in a nice position for the back half of the year. So we're very confident in the capital number. We will come in under \u2013 or at the $2.4 billion for this activity set and feel really good about it.","John Aschenbeck","Okay, great. That's helpful John. So just to make sure I clarify there Q2 has some one time spending a lot of it exploration activity that you just wouldn't expect to repeat and future quarters. Is that fair? ","John Christmann","I would just say that in terms of the timing of how we \u2013 what we have budgeted for a Suriname and the exploration, a big chunk of that is in Q2 and the other thing you need to look at is if you look at our first quarter numbers, we do have some assets sales. We've had a couple of rigs running up there too. So our run rate for Q1 would have even been a little lower on what are going our existing asset base remaining will be.","John Aschenbeck","Okay, great. I'll go ahead and leave it there. Thanks for the time.","Operator","And your next question comes from Richard Tullis with Capital One Securities.","Richard Tullis","Thanks. Good morning, John. Two quick questions.","John Christmann","Good morning.","Richard Tullis","Going back to the M&A, I know you touched on this a bit little earlier, but as you look at the North Sea, I know the market there seems a little more active. How do you view those assets in your portfolio today? Given the healthy margins there, but balancing that with maybe a more healthy M&A market in the North Sea?","John Christmann","Well, I mean I think the big difference with us is, as opposed to what's being divested by some of the other parties is we invested in the infrastructure. If you look at our efficiency and our up times and our run rates and our LOE, we're very competitive.","I mean we typically lead in production efficiencies and low cost and it's because, we were fortunate that after we bought these properties in the 2003 with BP for 40s and then 2011 with Beryls. We invested heavily in rebuilding the infrastructure, which really puts us in a nice position.","So you look at those two assets. They're fantastic assets. They're different. 40s, we've just got a massive 5 billion barrel in place. Field is produced over 2.5 and it just continues to give. And so it's real easy to manage that for the long-term with the water flood work we're doing, and we love the Brent pricing. We love the margins and it's not like we have a lot of stuff looming that would require you to want to move out of it.","If you look at Beryl, it's a totally different asset, very prolific in its own right as you've seen. The way we've been able to leverage the infrastructure with the subsea tie backs by bringing on Callater and bringing on Beryl or Gartner.","And now you into the Beryl facility and now you look at the Storr well, we just announced, I mean, we found a whole another section there in the cormorant that we were not expecting.","So there's a lot to do up in the Beryl area and we've got nice infrastructure. It's been invested in. It's in great shape and it gives us a differential advantage. So we love the cash flow. We love the Brent pricing exposure. Your gas receives a higher price. So it's an asset that we quite frankly, I liked the cash flow profile from.","Richard Tullis","Good insight John. Appreciate that. And just lastly, what's the current outlook for Alpine High natural gas to be sold into the Mexican market, say, over the next year or two?","John Christmann","Well, I mean, I think the first thing is, if you look at how we're positioned physically for gas to flow, we couldn't be better. But I think we recognized from the get-go that, you don't want to be trying to develop a resource play and waiting on Mexico or dependent on Mexico for your gas deliveries.","And so that's why we work the options to the Gulf Coast and what you'll find is Mexico will be an option for on down the road, which I think can become a premium. But today it's not something we're counting on. I mean, that's why we work the Gulf Coast options. We will be mainly insulated from Waha here pretty quick, which is going to put us in a differential advantage on our gas.","And, and really it's the NGLs that really make this thing fly. The NGLs cost structure and the lack of water or the things that really differentiate the rich gas played at Alpine High.","Richard Tullis","Very good. Thanks John. Appreciated.","Stephen Riney","Yes. Richard, if I could just add to that. I don't know the exact numbers, but today Mexico takes about 4 Bcf a day from the U.S. via pipeline. And 3 to 3.5 of that comes along the Gulf Coast. And so while we've got these great pipelines running by Alpine High, those are for the future more than the current. And so I think your question was related to the near-term. The near-term is we get gas to the Gulf Coast with the startup of GCX this year and Permian Highway next year. You can easily access the Mexican market and you might imagine that we probably have been considering that are working on that.","Richard Tullis","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from Jeoffrey Lambujon of Tudor, Pickering.","Jeoffrey Lambujon","Good morning. Thanks. First question is just on gas coverage with Gulf Coast Express. Once that system comes online and thinking about your capacity there, can you speak to how long you are able to receive Gulf Coast pricing for 100% of your Alpine High volumes?","Stephen Riney","Sorry, Jeff, can you just repeat that question?","Jeoffrey Lambujon","Yes. So once GCX comes online, just trying to get a sense for how long you expect to receive Gulf Coast pricing for your Alpine High production?","Stephen Riney","How long before we receive it or how long will we receive it?","Jeoffrey Lambujon","How long will you receive coverage for 100% of your production?","Stephen Riney","Well, with Gulf Coast Express, we will pretty much be selling all of the residue gas at Gulf Coast pricing with the startup of GCX and then Permian Highway comes a year later. So Gulf Coast Express, we have 550 million a day of capacity, and then with Permian Highway, we have another 500 million.","Jeoffrey Lambujon","Got it. And then just a follow-up on the liquids front. Appreciate the color on ethane, Dave, and sorry if I missed any follow-on comments on the LPG outlook, but could you just speak to what you're seeing there over the near-term?","David Pursell","Yes. So Jeoffrey, you're talking about \u2013 define near-term for me?","Jeoffrey Lambujon","Next 12 to 18 months.","David Pursell","Yes. Again, if you think about the NGL barrel, the bottom end of the barrel is going to trade with crude and gasoline and gasoline has been much improved over the last three or four months. So we're really thinking about butane and pentane, that's a call on crude and gasoline. So I'll leave that to you. Propane and ethane, we're going to see improvements in the fourth quarter in dock capacity through this and really through the summer and we think that'll help relieve some of the congestion with better exports.","And then on ethane, in addition to better export capacity, we're seeing later this year and into 2020 more cracker capacity coming on line, and significant percentages of total \u2013 of current capacity. So at least in the next 18 months, I can envision a much more robust NGL pricing environment, particularly given improvements in ethane and propane.","Jeoffrey Lambujon","Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from Arun Jayaram of JPMorgan.","Arun Jayaram","Hi, good morning. Just a couple of quick questions. One, have you guys quantified the production impact from the planned SCOOP\/STACK asset? So I was just wondering to know and does that already included in the guidance?","John Christmann","Arun, it\u2019s not included, once it closes \u2013 but if we look at the first quarter numbers, it would've been about 10,000 BOEs a day, and about 13% oil, it's mainly gas.","Arun Jayaram","Mainly gas. Okay, that's helpful. And just a question\u2026 ","John Christmann","And more importantly, Arun, our lease up income was about 14, we spent half of that just in CapEx. So I mean it's a\u2026","Arun Jayaram","It's not a big free cash flow again. ","John Christmann","It\u2019s not a big impact on the EBITDA. ","Arun Jayaram","Fair enough. And just a question for the participation on the equity on the pipes, do you guys have an estimate of what the cost would be to Altus to participate in the pipes? Just the CapEx.","John Christmann","I think at 1 o'clock when the Altus is called is on Arun, you got to pop on and you can get Mr. Bretches at that time and you\u2019ll feel that one, so.","Arun Jayaram","Okay. All right. Fair enough. Thanks a lot, John.","John Christmann","Appreciate it.","Operator","And we have passed the top of the hour. I'll now turn the call back to John Christmann for closing remarks.","John Christmann","Well, thank you for joining us. So just want to end on a couple of points. We're executing extremely well, delivering on both capital and production and are reiterating our $2.4 billion capital budget for the year. Alpine High will hit at an inflection point in the very near future as the three Altus cryos come on line and we'll generate a substantial cash flow uplift. And lastly, we're looking forward to the initiation of our exploration program at Suriname very soon.","Operator","And thank you all for joining today's Apache Corporation first quarter 2019 earnings conference call.

Sir, the floor is yours.","Gary T. Clark - Apache Corp.","Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us on Apache Corporation's first quarter 2017 financial and operational results conference call. Speakers' making prepared remarks on today's call will be Apache's CEO and President, John Christmann; Executive Vice President of Operations Support, Tim Sullivan; and Executive Vice President and CFO, Steve Riney.","In conjunction with this morning's press release, I hope you've had the opportunity to review our first quarter Financial and Operational Supplement, which can be found on our Investor Relations website at investor.apachecorp.com. Please note that the details of our 2017 production guidance increase can be found on pages 21 through 24 of the supplement.","On today's conference call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the differences between these non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the supplemental information provided on our website. Consistent with previous reporting practices, production numbers cited in today's call are adjusted to exclude non-controlling interest in Egypt and Egypt tax barrels.","Finally, I'd like to remind everyone that today's discussions will contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions based on our current views and reasonable expectations. However, a number of factors could cause results to differ materially from what we discuss today. A full disclaimer is located with the supplemental data on our website.","And I will now turn the call over to John.","John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.","Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. On today's call, I will discuss our strategy for delivering returns-focused growth, review our first quarter 2017 accomplishments, provide an overview of our international operations, and conclude with an update on the progress of our Permian Basin growth initiatives in the Midland Basin and at Alpine High.","As I reflect over the last two years, I see tremendous progress at Apache. We've streamlined our portfolio, allowing us to focus our capital and allocate it more efficiently to organic growth opportunities in North America and toward free cash flow maintenance in Egypt and the North Sea. We are benefiting from actions taken to strengthen the balance sheet, budget conservatively, and manage to cash flow neutrality.","We've realigned our overhead and operating cost structures to achieve profitability in a lower commodity price environment. We've demonstrated an ability to grow organically by bringing forward a differentiated, low-cost, unconventional play in the Delaware Basin at Alpine High.","And finally, we have a much deeper understanding of each hydrocarbon system within the portfolio, which has led to a significant improvement in well results and a larger, higher-quality drilling inventory with greater resource potential. As a result, we are a different company today. One that is capable of delivering highly competitive per share growth rates and double-digit returns, while living within cash flow in a $50 oil price world.","As we stated last quarter, Apache's overarching objective is to deliver long-term returns-focused growth. Key components for achieving this include: budgeting conservatively and maintaining the flexibility to accelerate activity, if warranted; increasing capital allocation to the Midland and Delaware basins to fund Apache's very attractive growth areas; preparing for long-term development at Alpine High by completing our resource appraisal program, conducting optimization and spacing tests, and installing necessary infrastructure; investing to sustain long-term free cash flow generation from Egypt and the North Sea; relentlessly focusing on cost and well optimization to achieve the highest returns and net present value from our assets; and actively managing our portfolio with a long-term perspective and strategically redeploying capital to our highest value opportunities. We continue to make excellent progress on all of these objectives.","Before moving into the first quarter, I would like to touch briefly on oil prices. As a reminder, Apache's 2017 capital budget assumes flat oil prices of $50 per barrel WTI and $51 per barrel Brent. You will recall that we've protected these prices for the second half of the year with put options on most of our anticipated oil volumes.","Oil prices have been volatile year-to-date, with WTI ranging from a high around $55 to a low of $47 per barrel. As the process of working off historically high worldwide crude oil inventories unfolds, we anticipated significant volatility and planned accordingly. We have both the capital budget and the price protection we need for this environment. Regardless of where oil prices go for the remainder of the year, our capital program is well protected and we have maintained full upside leverage to any price improvement.","Now, let me highlight our first quarter accomplishments. After an extended downturn, Apache returned to profitability on both a reported and adjusted earnings basis. It was also the fourth quarter in a row that our cash flow from operations, before changes in working capital, exceeded capital expenditures as we continue to exercise spending discipline with oil in the $50 range.","We significantly increased activity in the Permian Basin, with roughly two-thirds of our first quarter capital focused in the core Midland Basin and Alpine High. Our midstream buildout at Alpine High is ahead of schedule and under budget. This enabled us to bring the first phase of production online two months early, which is providing two important benefits. First, as a result of this week's startup of Alpine High production, we are raising our full-year 2017 North American production guidance. Our Financial and Operational Supplement issued this morning describes this increase in more detail.","Second, we're accelerating some of our planned 2018 infrastructure build into 2017, with no corresponding increase in our capital budget. Also, during the quarter, we continue to make good progress on the cost side in the face of inflationary pressures, delivering capital costs and lease operating expenses below plan. And lastly, we closed two non-core Permian acreage transactions for cash proceeds of $440 million, receiving a very attractive per acre price.","Turning now to some of the operational details for the first quarter. Internationally, Egypt and the North Sea produced approximately 147,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day on an adjusted basis; and, together, are tracking in line with our expectations. Lower-than-expected gas production in the North Sea was offset by better-than-expected production in Egypt.","Together, these regions contributed strong free cash flow during the quarter, underscoring their strategic fit in our portfolio. Our strategy in Egypt and the North Sea is to continue to invest at a level that sustains free cash flow generation. Both regions have extensive infrastructure in place. Our capital programs look to leverage that infrastructure through a robust inventory of development drilling and step-out exploration prospects.","In Egypt, we continue to have success drilling high-rate exploration and development wells, which are generally offsetting natural field declines. This year, we will initiate a new, high-resolution 3-D seismic survey in the Western Desert. This will include our two new concessions, which add nearly 40% to our acreage footprint in the region. We believe that the new seismic program and acreage additions will yield additional attractive growth opportunities.","In the North Sea, we currently have two platform rigs running and one semi-submersible. As discussed in February, our second quarter production will be down, primarily due to accelerated annual maintenance activities to accommodate the installation of subsea tieback facilities for our Callater discovery. Callater remains on schedule for first production in the third quarter of 2017 and should drive a material uptick in second half production levels.","During the first quarter, the North Sea benefited from premium natural gas and Brent oil prices, and the region continues to generate Apache's highest cash margins per BOE.","In Suriname, the Kolibrie 1 exploration well in Block 53 reached TD in April and was deemed non-commercial. Well costs were significantly below our budget as we drilled the well very quickly and efficiently. We gained valuable information about the basin from this well, and are evaluating our next steps in Block 53.","On Block 58, where we hold 100% working interest, we are currently processing 3D seismic and are seeing positive early indications of very significant potential. We remain enthusiastic about our prospects in Suriname.","Turning now to North America, production averaged approximately 252,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, with each region performing in line with expectations. Total oil and gas capital investment in North America was approximately $500 million, which was below budget. In 2017, we plan for an average well cost increase of 10% to 15%. However, proactive measures taken to contain inflationary pressures on certain services are helping to sustain some of the lower cost structure we worked so hard to achieve.","In the Midland Basin, our performance was very good this quarter and production is on track despite some changes to our pad completion schedule to accommodate frac operations on offsetting leases. We operated an average of six rigs during the quarter and brought online a six-well pad. The production impact from our increased rig count will be more fully reflected through the remainder of the year as we complete and flow back multiple pads.","Two years of well cost improvement initiatives are clearly evident. On our recent Connell 47 and Connell 48 pads, we drilled a total of 12, one-mile laterals at an average completed well cost of approximately $4.6 million. Tim Sullivan will provide more details on our Midland Basin well results and future activity plans. We have a large position in the core of the Midland Basin, and I look forward to this area contributing returns-focused growth for a long time.","Now, let me turn to Alpine High. We announced our discovery of Alpine High in an Investor Conference eight months ago. At that time, we described the extensive geologic and seismic analysis used to discover the play and the detailed reservoir evaluation we had initiated to characterize the potential of this massive hydrocarbon system.","As you all know, we have been delineating Alpine High with what we call test wells. Test wells are designed for the purpose of minimizing the cost of delineating the resource base and maximizing learnings. They demonstrate the potential of the rock, but do not represent the productive capacity of an optimized development well or pad.","When we announced Alpine High, we released data on nine test wells. The results of these wells, coupled with the geologic and reservoir evaluation work completed at that time, confirmed a world-class unconventional resource with an estimated 75 Tcf of gas and 3 billion barrels of oil in place in the Woodford and Barnett formations alone.","Resource estimates were confined to these two formations, because they had been the focus of the work to that point in time. The performance of our first batch of test wells at Alpine High was on par with or better than longer-lateral, fully-optimized wells and analogous shale resource plays, such as the SCOOP and the Marcellus. This has since been supported by an independent third-party in their review of EURs per well.","Since our original announcement, we have continued to delineate the play. The test wells drilled to-date have proven much of what we anticipated for Alpine High, but this is a multi-dimensional hydrocarbon system with five distinct formations extending across a 60-mile fairway.","The Woodford, Barnett, Pennsylvanian formations are a true unconventional shale sequence characterized by excellent reservoir quality, minimal to no in-situ water, strong EURs, low F&D costs, low operating costs, and high expected rates of return at current commodity prices. There are at least eight potential landing zones within the Woodford, Barnett, Pennsylvanian, four of which we have confirmed to-date.","We've also confirmed that the entire source rock sequence is over-pressured and contains all three hydrocarbon phases: oil, wet gas and dry gas. And that the depth and temperature at which the source rock is encountered varies across Alpine High and determines the dominant hydrocarbon phase.","And lastly, we've established that the Wolfcamp and Bone Springs formations are present oil bearing and perspective and significant portions of Alpine High. With the knowledge gained from our appraisal work, we are confidently building a comprehensive, long-term, full-field development plan.","In parallel, we are constructing a large scale infrastructure system to ensure the ability to process and market the full stream of hydrocarbons and to optimize the value of Alpine High. We have already begun the transition from the test well program. The majority of our wells going forward will begin an optimization program that will entail longer-laterals, larger fracs with more stage density, vertical and horizontal spacing density, and lateral wellbore placement within highly targeted zones.","This morning, in our Financial and Operational Supplement, we provided results on three new test wells. Two of these wells, the Chinook 101AH and the Blackhawk 5H were drilled to the Woodford and Barnett formations, respectively, in an area where the source rock sequence is quite shallow. These wells achieved higher 24-hour oil IP and higher oil cuts than any of the wells drilled, completed and disclosed (15:46) to-date. This further validates our geologic and thermal maturity models, which predicted that the source rock would produce more oil and higher BTU gas at shallower depths.","The third well we announced today, the King Hidalgo 3H in the southern portion of Alpine High, was an offset to our previously disclosed 9H well. You may recall from the disclosure in February that we did not believe the 9H well was drilled on an optimal azimuth, as it was drilled before our 3-D was fully processed and interpreted. In the 3H well, we reoriented the lateral and more than doubled the IP rate of the 9H.","Tim Sullivan will provide more detail on all three of these wells. I would just reiterate that these wells are still representative of our testing program. And while we believe they are economic as drilled, the rates do not represent the capability of optimized Alpine High development wells. You can expect future disclosure to contain well results with more optimized completions.","To-date, we've drilled more than 40 wells at Alpine High. We currently have four wells producing and 22 wells shut-in or curtailed awaiting infrastructure. Additionally, there are a number of wells in flow back, completion or drilling. We look forward to bringing these wells online, optimizing liquids recovery and demonstrating their potential.","I would now like to transition briefly to Alpine High infrastructure. Our midstream facility construction represents a strategically important investment and has proceeded extremely well. Delivery of the initial phase of the buildout was significantly ahead of schedule and under budget.","We first broke ground on our infrastructure at Alpine High in November, and since that time have installed approximately 14 miles of 30-inch trunk line for gas delivery, 11 miles of gathering systems, five centralized processing facilities which are in various stages of completion, one water recycling facility, and 10 central tank batteries in various phases of construction.","Initial gas sales began this week at a rate of around 20 million cubic feet of gas per day. This volume should ramp up to more than 50 million cubic feet of gas per day by the end of June. We're also making good progress on drilling operations at Alpine High as we continue to climb the learning curve. Tim will have more details on our recent well costs, and how that will change as we transition to more optimized wells in the future.","Finally, we recently strengthened our organization on the midstream and marketing side. Last week, we announced the appointment of two highly experienced executives to the team. Both of these individuals bring a deep understanding of midstream and marketing activities in North America, broad business development experience, and extensive end user relationships to complement our team. These additions will significantly strengthen our commercial capabilities as we ramp up production at Alpine High and continue to evaluate future alternatives for the midstream business in Apache.","To sum up Alpine High, this is a massive hydrocarbon resource and we believe we control the vast majority of it. A play of this size takes time to properly delineate and optimize, but our progress, since the initial announcement eight months ago, has been exceptional. To-date, we've confirmed a highly economic wet gas play with a minimum of 3,000 locations.","The economics of the wet gas portion of Alpine High are greatly enhanced by its oil content and the high-quality NGLs demonstrated in many of our test wells to-date. As we complete our delineation, we believe the wet gas location count will rise significantly. And as we test shallower zones and geologic settings, we believe that oil locations will also be added.","In closing, we hit the ground running in 2017, and we are delivering on the production, capital spending and LOE targets we established in February. We're pleased with the early start-up of Alpine High, our under-budget delivery of the midstream side, and the associated increase in production guidance. We look forward to providing further updates in the near future.","I will now turn the call over to Tim to provide more operational details.","Timothy J. Sullivan - Apache Corp.","Good afternoon. In my remarks today, I will highlight operational activity and key wells in our focus areas. I will also provide an update on service and supply costs, along with the actions we're taking to address inflation.","Our first quarter results reflect the impact of reduced CapEx and development activity during 2016. These effects will linger into the second quarter of 2017. Then, we begin our shift to a growth trajectory that you will see in the third quarter and subsequent periods.","We began expanding our drilling program in the Midland Basin beginning late in the fourth quarter, increasing from two rigs to the current count of six. These operations feature pad drilling, which can take longer to see production results than with the single well, but is a more efficient way to produce hydrocarbons and helps us preserve the lower cost structure we achieved last year.","During the first quarter, North America production averaged 252,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, a 3% decline from the fourth quarter 2016. Most of this decline comes from lower volumes in the Midcontinent, Gulf of Mexico and Canada regions, where we limited investment.","We continue to build momentum in the Permian Basin, where production of 148,000 Boe per day in the first quarter was nearly flat with 149,000 Boe reported for the preceding period. The Midland\/Delaware basins contributed approximately 85,000 Boe per day to this total in the first quarter.","The main highlight from the Midland Basin this quarter is the start-up of production from the six-well Connell 48 pad at Powell Field in Upton County. These wells have oil cuts of approximately 80% and have produced at very strong initial 30-day average rates 6x wine-rack spacing in two landing zones in the Wolfcamp B formation.","The Connell 48 pad features mile-long laterals as we're conducting spacing tests on the pad. The flow rates on a per thousand foot basis are impressive. They are outlined in our first quarter Financial and Operational Supplement. Going forward, in the core of the Midland Basin, we expect two-thirds of our wells to have extended laterals of approximately 1.5 miles or longer.","Following Connell 48, the rig moved to the Connell 47, a six-well pad where we'd be testing tighter 8x wine-rack spacing in two Wolfcamp B landing zones. We are in very early flow back on the Schrock 34 pad in the Azalea area on the border of Midland and Glasscock counties. This includes nine wells drilled with 6x wine-rack spacing in intervals of the Wolfcamp A1, B1 and B3 formations.","Turning to Alpine High, included in our first quarter Financial and Operational Supplement are results from three recent test wells at Alpine High. The Chinook 101AH produced at a peak 24-hour rate of approximately 8.5 million cubic feet of rich 1,300 BTU gas and 620 barrels of oil. At a depth of 10,100 feet, the Chinook is our shallowest Woodford test to-date. This is an excellent result, particularly when considering that it is an unoptimized test well with a 4,500 foot lateral and a smaller standardized frac.","The Blackhawk 5H was completed at a depth of 9,760 feet and is our shallowest Barnett well disclosed to-date. This well produced at a peak 24-hour rate of 742 barrels of oil and 5.3 million cubic feet of rich 1,300 BTU gas. Like the Chinook, this was an unoptimized test well.","Moving to the southern end of Alpine High, we drilled the third well disclosed this morning, King Hidalgo 3H in the Woodford formation. This was an azimuth test well offset to the previously disclosed King Hidalgo 9H well. The 3H, at a depth of 13,000 feet, recorded a 24-hour peak rate of 7 million cubic feet of 1,200 BTU gas and 72 barrels of oil. The much stronger performance of the 3H proves that azimuth is critical in optimizing flow rates.","Because our initial test wells have been quite deep in the Hidalgo area, we didn't expect to encounter a cooler temperature regime. This enabled liquids production and indicates that there will be significant amount of up-hole zone with potential for higher liquid cuts. For comparison, recall that we encountered dry gas in the Redwood unit at a similar depth in the northern portion of Alpine High.","The cost story at Alpine High is also very positive. We recently drilled a pacesetter well with a 4,600 foot lateral in just 13 days, from spud to TD, at a cost of approximately $2 million. Regardless of the ultimate completion size and technique, all-in costs for this type of a well should fall comfortably in our targeted range of $4 million to $6 million.","The result we see in our test wells at Alpine High continue to give us confidence that this will be one of the lowest cost, wet gas plays in North America. We look forward to demonstrating this later in the year with optimized drilling results.","I will turn now to our international assets. Adjusted production in Egypt declined approximately 2% from the fourth quarter 2016 to 88,000 Boe per day. We drilled 18 wells in Egypt during the first quarter with a 72% success rate.","Highlights from this program include development wells at Berenice 6 in the Faghur Basin with a 30-day average IP of nearly 3,760 Boe per day; the Phiops 11, which achieved a peak rate exceeding 3,400 Boe per day in the Shushan Basin; the Ptah 7, which achieved a peak rate of more than 3,330 Boe per day in the Faghur Basin; and the Herunefer 3, which achieved a peak rate of more than 3,100 Boe per day in the Matruh Basin.","In the North Sea, our production declined to 58,000 Boe per day as operations were impacted by a mechanical issue on the Beryl Alpha platform during the quarter. We also experienced some underperformance on a few gas-prone wells in the Beryl area. Oil volumes were generally in line with expectations. Progress on the Khalda Development continues on schedule for start-up in the third quarter.","We have moved up our North Sea facilities' annual turnaround activity to accommodate hookup and commissioning with the new subsea tieback. While this turnaround and facility work will impact second quarter production, it should help reduce overall planned downtime at Beryl for the year. Please refer to our Financial and Operational Supplement for more details on our first quarter production.","I'll move now to service costs. We continue to see pricing pressure for certain services and supplies, which we planned for in our 2017 capital budget. Cost escalation is most apparent for pressure pumping, premium drilling rigs, and sand in the Permian Basin. Anticipating this, we implemented a number of strategies to keep our cost structure low and minimize the impact of inflationary pricing. This includes leveraging our size as one of the most active drillers to achieve volume discounts, and we've also unbundled services.","We're working with a wider assortment of vendors who want to work with Apache as we can provide a more continuous, steady program than other operators with smaller footprints. We have also signed agreements for pressure pumping services and sand that index prices to WTI, providing a win-win outcome for us and our vendors as commodity prices improve. In these agreements, we have seen very little cost increases thus far.","On the sand side, we're self-sourcing product by buying almost exclusively native sand, mined close to the operations. Our test indicates that we are achieving effective results with this product, and it significantly reduces our transportation costs. Vendor competition is good for Apache and healthy for the industry. We found that we can achieve good results safely and economically, sourcing more work to new and different providers.","I will conclude by noting that we are pleased to be increasing activity in North America at a measured pace with the focus on generating strong fully burdened returns. As indicated by our guidance, growth will follow in the second half of 2017. Despite industry cost pressures, we believe our 2017 North America operations will be more productive and capital efficient than in previous years.","I will now turn the call over to Steve.","Stephen J. Riney - Apache Corp.","Thank you, Tim, and good afternoon, everyone. On today's call, I will review our financial results for the first quarter, update a few 2017 guidance items, and discuss Alpine High midstream and marketing activities.","Beginning with the first quarter financial results, as noted in our press release, Apache reported net income of $213 million or $0.56 per common share. Our results for the quarter include a number of items outside of our core earnings that are typically excluded by the investment community in published earnings estimates. These items include a $222 million gain on sale after taxes for the recent non-core asset divestitures John mentioned earlier.","When excluding this gain and other smaller items, our adjusted earnings for the quarter were $31 million or $0.08 per share. Note, this adjusted earnings amount still includes dry hole costs which amounted to $40 million or $0.10 per share after tax, which Apache does not include in its guidance and is not typically modeled by analysts.","Cash flow from operations in the first quarter was $455 million. Before working capital changes, Apache generated $730 million in cash flow. The significant working capital used this quarter is primarily related to the payment of expenses accrued at year-end 2016. With the proceeds received from non-core asset sales, we increased our cash position to $1.5 billion at quarter-end and reduced net debt to just under $7 billion.","Our Oil and Gas capital investment for the quarter was $646 million. This was below our expectations due to capital activity being delivered under budget, as well as movements in the timing of certain spending to later in the year. For reasons outlined by John, our full year capital investment guidance remains unchanged at $3.1 billion.","Turning to costs, lease operating expenses in the first quarter were $7.76 per barrel of oil equivalent, approximately 8% lower than the fourth quarter of 2016. We made tremendous progress on LOE over the last two years, and we are focused on retaining as much of that improvement as possible despite inflationary pressures. These efforts, combined with increasing low-cost Alpine High volumes, are bringing LOE expectations down. As a result, we are revising our full-year 2017 guidance range for LOE per Boe down to $8.25 to $8.75 per barrel of oil equivalent.","Lastly, exploration expense in the first quarter was $92 million. $67 million of this was attributable to dry hole expense and small amounts of unproved leasehold impairments. For the full-year 2017, we previously guided to $150 million of exploration expense excluding dry holes and unproved impairments. This guidance remains unchanged. For all other expense items, our first quarter and full year results are generally on track; and thus, our full-year 2017 guidance is unchanged. Please reference the quarterly supplement for a summary of our guidance.","Next, let me turn our midstream and marketing activities at Alpine High. On the midstream side, we are well into a multi-year infrastructure buildout to serve the long-term needs of Alpine High. While there are significant industry infrastructure around the Permian Basin, Alpine High requires extensive in-field processing capacity and transport to market access. Last year, our early testing demonstrated the enormous resource potential of Alpine High.","As plans for full-field development materialized, we made the decision to build the infrastructure ourselves. It is strategically important to control the scope and pace of the buildout, and we are confident we have the capability to manage a project of this scale. The start-up of gas processing this week ahead of schedule and under budget reinforces that confidence.","Looking ahead at our future infrastructure buildout plans, a high-pressure gas trunk line system, through our acreage, should be mostly complete by the end of 2018. We will have a 30-inch line that connects to three market pipelines to the north, and a 30-inch line that connects to one market pipeline to the south. To accommodate longer-term volume growth, completion of the third line, running from Alpine High to the Waha Hub, is anticipated during 2019. The size of this line has yet to be determined.","Ultimately, Alpine High gas will have access to multiple markets, providing significant optionality for gas flow in the future. The remaining infrastructure, including gathering lines, separation, treating, compression and processing facilities will be built out over time as the pace of upstream development dictates. In the longer term, we will explore the option of installing cryogenic gas processing to extract more NGLs.","In terms of liquids infrastructure, oil and NGLs are currently being trucked, which will continue for the near term. We anticipate the completion of an NGL pipeline, the size of which has yet to be determined, during 2019. We are evaluating options for the NGL line to extend beyond the Waha Hub to access further market optionality. Finally, there are many options for oil pipeline access, and we are exploring those for future consideration.","As we look further into the future, the need to continue owning the Alpine High infrastructure assets should become less important. We see the possibility of a partial or full monetization and are planning accordingly. In the near term, we are confident this infrastructure project is a compelling investment, both strategically and financially, as these types of assets are generally monetized at very attractive multiples.","On the gas marketing side, we are advancing discussions on many fronts and have begun implementing a contracting strategy. At this point, we have contractual assurance for the sale of most of our Alpine High gas for 2017, and have begun to contract for 2018.","We are developing a portfolio of market solutions for Alpine High gas production. This will include targeting end users across a wide variety of industrial users, such as petrochemical complexes, utilities, and L&G exporters. It will also include access to gas markets that can deliver higher net backs. Specifically, this will require the ability to move gas away from the Waha Hub to places such as the Texas Gulf Coast and Mexico.","Today, we are receiving a Waha base price for our natural gas. Since Apache announced the Alpine High discovery, more than 10 pipeline projects have been proposed and\/or under review to expand takeaway capacity out of the Permian Basin. We expect at least two of these pipelines will be constructed with estimated in-service dates of mid-2019 to early 2020. While there has been some recent volatility in widening in the Waha base's differentials, additional transportation capacity to the Texas Gulf Coast should help alleviate the situation.","In closing, it was a good first quarter for Apache financially, and we are demonstrating excellent capital cost and operating cost discipline. We've made great progress with our planning and execution on the midstream and marketing side at Alpine High, and I look forward to future updates.","With that, I will turn the call over to the operator for questions and answers.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question is from the line of Bob Brackett with Bernstein.","Robert Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Alpine High gas takeaway, is that connected to all of the pads or is it focused on some of those pads in the north? How much of those pads can access that market right now?","John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.","Bob, good afternoon. Right now, the first connections have been to the north. We've got one central processing facility up there that's up and running. So we've got just a handful of wells that we're bringing on initially. We're significantly ahead of schedule. And so, we've started in the north, but it will expand pretty quickly.","Robert Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","So that 50 million cubic feet a day by end of June is coming from a handful of wells?","John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.","It will be a pretty small number. I mean, actually, right now, we're curtailed by what we nominated. We are flowing close to 20 million cubic feet a day and we'll ramp pretty quickly to the 50 million cubic feet.","Robert Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Ed Westlake with Credit Suisse.","Edward Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","A question on Alpine High and balance sheet. So, again, congratulations on the work you're doing there. You talk often about stages per well, longer laterals and optimizing liquids recovery. I mean, the longer lateral math is pretty easy to understand in other plays. But maybe just some color in terms of where you are in terms of current stages and where you think you will get to? And then, what yield uplift you think you might be able to get as you optimize the equipment on the liquids?","John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.","Ed, we've taken, as you know, a very disciplined approach and all of our wells have been specifically designed to kind of mirror each other in terms of the completion. So they've been, what we call, test wells. They've had relatively strong small fracs, very few stages. And we've done that purposefully, so that with the changes we can see what the rock was telling us, not as you start getting real fancy on your completion.","So the nice thing is, we said earlier, this year we were transitioning. And by getting the infrastructure on it, it lets us flow gas early and start to sell some liquids as well. But more importantly now, we're not going to be limited by flaring and other things. So we've transitioned. As we start to bring some of those wells on and start to disclose some of those rates, we'll start to give some of the comparisons. But we expect a pretty material uptick from what we've been using as our standard completion.","Edward Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","And then, just on the balance sheet. I mean, obviously the whole sector's down, oil is down. Therefore, we don't have a real view on the commodity, but you've still got $1.5 billion of cash. You've spoken about capital flexibility, but also perhaps disposals, maybe just what is the rainy day plan?","John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.","Well, I mean, if you look at what we did this year, we (41:04) for the back half of the year to protect us at $50, which is our plan. So we feel really good about this year's capital program because we've got a lot more exposure to oil price than we do gas price. We do have $1.5 billion of cash on hand. We sold $440 million of predominantly non-producing acreage, some things that we weren't going to get to for a long time, probably five, six years, if ever. And so, that's helped us.","I think the big thing is, is we've taken a very measured approach. I mean, we've got a very robust inventory and our guys are chomping it a bit to do more on the capital side, but we've just taken a pretty measured approach. We want to be focused on the cost side, focused on the discipline and ramp up slowly, which is kind of the approach we've taken. So we feel good about where we sit right now with where commodity prices are. Again, there are some other things we can do as we continue to look at the portfolio, but we feel really good about where the balance sheet is. I don't know, if you want to add anything, Steve? Okay.","Edward Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. Good afternoon.","John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.","Hello.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","A couple of questions on Alpine High. The first is, you've talked about that comprehensive development plan. Can you give us a little bit more color on what that looks like? Specifically, if it includes the Wolfcamp and Bone Springs zones? And then, what the milestones are in those zones to get from today to developing more oilier areas?","John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.","The thing I would say, Brian, is it's a live product for us. As we continue to get more data, it becomes more expansive. The best thing I would say is, look to the guidance. If you go back to the start of the year, we gave you Midland and Delaware and we gave you a look through the fourth quarter of 2018. And, obviously, we've got a lot of wells that we're drilling. We drilled over 40 wells. With the three we announced today, we've now disclosed I think 19 results. And we're starting to bring some of those on, and we've got a lot of wells that are in the queue. They're either flowing back now, shut-in and waiting to be produced, being completed, or drilling.","So I think it's going to be an exciting next couple quarters for us as we bring forward a lot more information. But we are very optimistic, as we stated, about the parasequences, the Wolfcamp and the Bone Springs. We've done a lot of integrated work on the geology, the modeling, integrating 3-D seismic; done a lot of work. And I think we've done our homework and we've got some exciting appraisal wells that are in progress.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks. And then, if we look back on some of the older Alpine High wells, what are you seeing on the decline rate side? And because some of these wells are constrained, would we expect a lower decline rate than the decline rate that we would see in the development plan?","John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.","Brian, most of the wells that \u2013 after we've kind of stabilized test rates on them, we shut most of the wells in. So we have not been producing those. I mean, when you're flaring gas without the ability to sell the gas, then you'd be paying royalty that did not make sense. So we shut most of those wells in. And, obviously, this week we've started to open some wells back up. So we're very anxious to produce. I can tell you, the early responses look really good. A lot of flush liquids and some exciting stuff.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Scott Hanold with RBC Capital Markets.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks. Good afternoon. On the Chinook and the Blackhawk wells that had the oil condensate rates, can you give us a little color in terms of the gravity of the oil? Did that fall in line with your expectations or was that a little bit higher than anticipated?","John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.","No. Well, first of all, Scott, it's oil; it's not a condensate. It's very stable. And, yes, it fell in line with our models. So no surprises. The gas BTU content gets heavier as we move up and the oil gravities are getting lower as well, which is a really positive sign. I think one of the keys for us will be getting things into the processing facilities. When you're catching (45:45) on those, it's hard sometimes and there is room for error within those test samples. But everything really, really fits our maturity model and our geologic models very tightly. So we're very excited about the predictability in the transgressive source intervals.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. And, outside of the test rate, were you able to flow those wells a little bit or are those shut-in like you mentioned due to the infrastructure constraints?","John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.","No, those wells have been flowing over the last several days. And so, we have been flowing those wells. And, quite frankly, we will be able to move the into facilities pretty early this quarter.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Any color on some of the productivity, post the initial test rates?","John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.","No, it looked good. I mean, we're very excited about it. So one of the keys is, we need to get the facilities, get everything tied in and run them through properly, because then we can really start to dial down in what these things are going to do. But we're very encouraged, and it was predictable to see as we moved up the column with the lower temperature. We knew they were going to get more oily, which is the case. And there's a lot of real estate above us and a lot of other zones to test as well. So, I mean, it's very exciting.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. And if I could just quickly on the gas sales contracts. I think you all said that you had most or all of 2017 locked up and looking at 2018. Who are you signing up the contracts with for 2017? What type of end users, not maybe specifically, but if you can generalize that for us.","Stephen J. Riney - Apache Corp.","Yes. No, we're not at this point disclosing exactly who we're contracting with, but there are lots of player in that area. So you can count on the fact that we're \u2013 as I said in my script, we're looking to have a pretty good size portfolio of various solutions on the contracting side, both in terms of transporting product, as well as marketing it to various forms of users. And we do have contractual assurance, as I said, for the vast majority of our volume for 2017, as much as we think we can be capable of producing this year. And part of that contract goes into \u2013 or part of the contracting that we've done so far goes into 2018 as well.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Appreciate that. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of John Herrlin with Soc Gen.","John P. Herrlin - Societe Generale","Thank you. With respect to the cryogenic units at Alpine High, can you give us a sense of how big you're contemplating? Or you're going to do skid units or you're going to do some large centralized units?","John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.","Yes. John, it's early. We've got some time. I mean, it's really an option for us. So as we start to pull the processing facilities, get them all up and running, that's one of the things we've got tabled to make a decision on. Really, we could pull the trigger on it at any time, but we will look at what's optimal. I mean, the nice thing about this resource play is we've got a wide range from pretty much dry gas in some areas up to the north, to very, very wet gas. So I don't envision it being an all-or-nothing decision on the cryo, and it's just one of the things we've got tabled to do later.","John P. Herrlin - Societe Generale","Okay. That's fair. And then, in terms of monetizing this down the line, I would assume that this is several years out because you want to control your growth right now of the infrastructure in terms of going in a healthy route or whatever?","John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.","I mean, I think if you look at what some of the transactions that have been recently done out there, they're significant value. I mean, I think clearly right now as we're ramping up, now would not be the time. But I think as you get out past a year from now, you could easily be in a window where you could consider doing something. I don't know, Steve, if you want to add anything further?","Stephen J. Riney - Apache Corp.","Yes. John, I think ultimately the answer to that is going to be both a strategic answer and a financial answer. I think John is exactly right. By the time we get into \u2013 well, into 2018 financially, we'd certainly be capable of monetizing this at a pretty attractive price. And then, it'll come down to the question of strategically is it the right time. And you're exactly right, there's \u2013 as I said in my comments, it's strategically important for us to control this at this point in time and the ability to start it up two months early and the flexibility that we have around constructing. It's a pretty sizable project. It's proven to be pretty important that we had complete control over that. So we'll continue to monitor that both strategically and financially, and combined, we'll make the decision as to when and if we monetize it.","John P. Herrlin - Societe Generale","Okay, great. Thanks, Steve. One last one for me. Do you have any sense of the notional value of what your hedges are right now for the oil?","Stephen J. Riney - Apache Corp.","I haven't looked at them today, but they're probably worth more today than they were last week.","John P. Herrlin - Societe Generale","Okay. That's fair. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Phillip Jungwirth with BMO.","Phillip J. Jungwirth - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Good afternoon.","John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.","Hello.","Phillip J. Jungwirth - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","We're starting to see industry activity, whether it's permits or rigs, into Jeff Davis County. And I know this isn't an area where you guys lease. But curious as to your view on how the play changes as you move west of your position? And why this wasn't an area that, had you focused on when you initially built this position?","John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.","Well, I mean, what I would say, Phillip is, is obviously since we put the play together grassroots, did a lot of work upfront, went out and leased what we felt like we wanted, shot a massive 3-D over the entire area. I think we like our position. As I said in our comments, we think we've leased the lion's share of the Alpine High. So, clearly, there's a lot of other targets and a lot of things, and you see a lot of activity picking up around us. But we like where we are and consciously leased what we wanted to lease.","Phillip J. Jungwirth - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay, great. And then, in Suriname, just curious as to your thoughts on farming down some of your 100% interest in Block 58. And then, given that dry hole costs in this area are relatively inexpensive, how would that factor into your consideration?","John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.","The Kolibrie well was a well we needed to drill. We've learned a lot about the basin from that well and gained some very, very valuable information. Right now, I am also glad that we drilled that well with, what I'll call, 45-cent dollars as we had a 45% interest in it. And our dry hole cost was significantly lower. It came in around $20 million versus a budgeted number of around $37 million, so relatively much cheaper. What I would say is, is we're working on next steps at Block 53. We've got time on Block 58. We've shot the 3-D, we're processing it, we'll have that done sometime this year. We're very encouraged by what we see on Block 58, and we'll just leave that for another date.","Phillip J. Jungwirth - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Great. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Arun Jayaram from JPM. Challenge...","John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.","Hey, Arun.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","How are you doing?","John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.","Good.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","I was wondering if you could help us think about, on a go-forward basis, what the cost structure is going to look like at Alpine? I am just trying to think, your cash flow per Mcfe kind of margins, as you start getting into 2018 and start to dial the volumes up. So can you help us think about the cost structure for Alpine High?","Stephen J. Riney - Apache Corp.","Yes, Arun. This is Steve. I think the best place to go and get that would be in our Barclays pack that we used, the slide deck that we used. Go to that one slide on economics. I think from there you can get the cost per barrel. It's in the fine print on that slide, but be sure you add $500,000 per well for infrastructure costs, because it's included in the economics that we ran, but not included in the well costs that we published on that day. It does give you the $4 million to $6 million per well on the high-end and low-end. Add $500,000 to that, you've got estimated EURs and, therefore, you'll have estimated production mix from that.","Today, we're selling oil basically at WTI. We are selling NGLs at about \u2013 we've been selling it anywhere from 45% to 50% of WTI. And you could probably use Waha Hub as pricing for the gas. So you'll get a mixed price per barrel equivalent. And I think you can use your typical gas field type of cash costs on the operating side. And I think when you do that, you're going to find a pretty darn attractive ratio of the cost per barrel to cash margin per barrel. That would probably compete with anything you're doing on a more oily basis in the rest of the Permian Basin. You'll see from that why we're so excited about the economics of this wet gas play.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. But maybe details on \u2013 your thoughts on the LOE versus the GPT on Alpine High?","Stephen J. Riney - Apache Corp.","No. We're not really sharing any of that right now. But I think you can count on the fact that the LOE per Boe is going to be low, especially for the next several years, as we drill some fresh wells, get some flush production going. And it's going to be, I think, a typical LOE on a robust gas field.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Fair enough.","John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.","One of the pluses, Arun, is you don't have a lot of water in the lower source intervals, which is all we've talked about in the economics. So we're not going to have the water handling challenges that you have in northern parts of the basin. Now, if we start to bring forward some of the parasequences, there may be some more water with some of those. And so, that's one of the reasons why we'll bring some of that data forward in the future.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Fair enough. And just switching gears a little bit, in terms of the new concessions in Egypt, at what point, John, do you think you'll be able to drill some wells on these new concession areas?","John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.","Well, we expect those to be awarded some time pretty quick, this month or next month most likely. I think we could be actively planning to drill this fall, is the plan. So we're very, very excited about those concessions. A big uptick. We have not got two new onshore concessions in the Western Desert since 2006. And we see a lot of low-hanging fruit and a lot of really neat stuff to go after. So we're chopping it a bit to get our hands on those concessions. We're going to do a lot for our Egypt inventory.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","All right. Thanks a lot.","John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Bob Morris with Citi.","Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks. John, it wasn't clear on the processing or the handling of the NGLs, when you would have that processing capacity in place to begin moving and selling NGLs. And if you're initially going to be installing cryogenic plants or just going with cheaper lean oil plants to start with on that?","John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.","We will have refridge in the processing facilities. We've got one up, it's up and running now, that we are working through, kind of lining it out. So we will be selling NGLs. Have been selling some off to some of these skid-mounted units we've had in the field as well. So, as Steve said, we've kind of been receiving anywhere from 45% to 50% of WTI for those NGLs. And, right now, our plans are for refridge in the field. And with the decision to be made on cryo, as I said, when Mr. Herrlin asked the question, later this year, early next year, sometime in the future on the cryo decision.","Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Charles Meade with Johnson Rice.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Company L.L.C.","Good afternoon, John, to you and the rest of your team there. I wanted to ask a question about the Hidalgo pad, the King Hidalgo pad, and the uplift you guys saw on the 3H versus 9H. As I adjust for lateral length there, it looks like there's an uplift of about 60% just from adjusting your azimuth. And I am curious, is that indicative of the uplift you think is available through most of Alpine High by optimizing your azimuth? Or is there more something visible particularly to this area that made the azimuth more important down here?","John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.","Well, what I would say, Charles, is targeting is always critical in the productivity side, especially when you have rock like this. I mean, we've got a very provable area down there. We knew the azimuth, because we spud that well. We had done some before we had gotten our 3-D processed and really worked through it. So we knew it was on the wrong azimuth. We disclosed that back in February when we disclosed it, and we knew it would make an impact. So it is one of the key things.","And when we talk about \u2013 even mentioned it in the press release today \u2013 when we talk about moving into more optimization, that's one of the things we're going to be doing, too, is tweaking the targeting. And it matters a lot. And getting things on the right azimuth, that's one of the big pluses to having such a blockey acreage position because we can do this the right way, not trying to drill down lease lines and so forth, like you do in a lot of other plays.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Company L.L.C.","Got it. So is the stress field pretty tricky across the whole play, or is it more just kind of \u2013 as you get more structurally complex that it becomes an issue?","John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.","It will change based on the geologic setting and it changes within the setting. So it's one of the things that you have to do a lot of integrative work to fully understand, like anything else. But the 3-D is pretty helpful to understanding that and seeing what some of the substructure is doing, is pretty key to understanding that.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Company L.L.C.","Right, right. And then one last quick one. The pace of your divestitures, how are you thinking about that? Is that something that we should expect an ongoing kind of steady pace on that? Or is that more opportunistically driven in that case may be attached to oil prices?","John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.","No, I mean, it's more opportunistically driven. We continue to look at our portfolio. As we build out more optionality and more inventory, there are things that we look at today that in the past we might have thought we would've funded that we won't get to. And so, we don't have anything set out there that we're saying here's what's going to be next. But I'll just say we're actively looking at our portfolio and managing it, and it would be more opportunistically in terms of what we decide to put out there.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Company L.L.C.","That's great detail. Thanks, John.","Operator","And our last question comes from line of David Tameron with Wells Fargo. David, your line is open.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you. I was on mute. A couple of questions, John. North Sea, can you just talk about the production? I think there were some outages, but can you talk about the production quarter-to-quarter and what happened there?","Stephen J. Riney - Apache Corp.","Yes, David. In January, we had an upset at Beryl Alpha and the whole platform went down. We lost about 18 million cubic feet a day for the month of January. And then, we drilled a couple of non-commercial wells, and then we had a couple of wells that under-performed in the first quarter and that's what's causing our issue. But keep in mind we've got a calendar coming online start of the third quarter. We're very excited about that.","And then, we had really a tremendous quarter in Egypt with a lot of successes not only in our development program, but in our exploration program. Got 13 wells online there and we've got a number of wells that will be coming online in the second quarter. So as a result of all that, we did not have to do anything with our guidance. We left guidance unchanged for international.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. That's helpful. Thanks. And Alpine High has been (01:03:56). John, so just a comment you made about service contracts, I don't know if that was you or Steve that made the comment, but about linking those to WTI. What percentage would you say \u2013 is it something that you envision going meaningfully higher like structural change and the way prices are set going forward? Or is this just kind of a one-off? Or how should we think about this in the big picture context?","John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.","No, I mean, I think there's an opportunity in some cases to turn it from a win-lose into a win-win. And we've sat down and had some pretty grownup conversations with some of our bigger service providers that do a lot of different things for us and have tried to find ways where you tie things more to the oil price rise, where both sides are happy than you are directly with demand. Because, as you know, as we saw in late-2014 and demand can oftentimes outrun the rise in terms of what the commodity price is doing.","So I think we're trying to do some things more in a way that's going to create a win-win or we can put some equipment and crews in place and let them work for a long, long time for both companies and be happy with it.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","All right. Thanks. That's all I've got.","John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","That is all the time we have for questions today.

(Operator Instructions)","Thank you, at this time I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Castlen Kennedy. Please go ahead ma\u2019am.","Castlen Kennedy","","Thank you, Sia. Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us for Apache Corporation\u2019s second quarter 2014 earnings conference call. On today\u2019s call, we will have three speakers making prepared remarks prior to taking questions.","I will start by giving a brief summary of results and then we will hear from Steve Farris, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and President; followed by Alfonso Leon, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. In addition, joining us for the question-and-answer session are John Christmann, Executive Vice President and COO of North America; and Tom Voytovich, Executive Vice President and COO of International.","We prepared our quarterly financial supplement for your use, which includes the reconciliation of any non-GAAP numbers that we discuss such as adjusted earnings or cash flow from operations. In addition, we have prepared our quarterly operation supplement which summarizes our activities and includes detailed well highlights across the various Apache operating region. These can both be found on our website at apachecorp.com\/financialdata.","Today\u2019s discussion will contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions based on our current views and most reasonable expectations. However, a number of factors could cause actual results to defer materially from what we discuss today. A full disclaimer is located with the supplemental data on our website.","This morning we reported second quarter 2014 earnings from continuing operations of $505 million or $1.31per diluted share. Adjusted earnings which excludes certain items that impact the comparability of results, totaled $644 million or $1.67 per diluted share. Cash flow from operations before changes in working capital totaled $2.2 billion during the quarter.","Total reported net production averaged 635,814 barrels of oil equivalent per day, with liquids production constituting 59% of the total. On a pro forma basis, adjusting for recent sales and excluding the non-controlling interest and tax barrels from Egypt second quarter production was 550,357 barrels of oil equivalent per day, with liquids production constituting 60% of the total.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Steve.","G. Steven Farris","","Thank you, Castlen and good afternoon, everyone and thank you all for joining us. I want to apologize everyone, I\u2019ve got somewhat of a summer cold, so I sound a little \u2013 my sounds a little deeper than it usually does I apologize.","Our second quarter results provided I think additional evidence of our strong North America position, and our ability to continue to profitability grow our production. And before I jump into the details of the quarter, I want to provide an update on Apache\u2019s ongoing repositioning of profitable and repeatable North American onshore growth. Over the last five years Apache has greatly enlarged and enhanced its North American onshore resource base and I believe that it is capable of driving our growth and performance over the next several years.","During the last 18 months, we\u2019ve been increasing the focus on our North American onshore business, by divesting of around $10 billion of property. In addition, we\u2019ve launched an aggressive stock repurchase program and we\u2019ve also made it clear there are no sacred cows and our efforts continue. There has been recent discussion regard Apache\u2019s potential future steps and focusing our portfolio, and today\u2019s call gives me an opportunity to provide an update to our shareholders on our direction and the work that it\u2019s been underway.","First, let me state at the outset, the Apache\u2019s future will be centered on our tremendous North American onshore resource base. Second, I\u2019d like to make it clear, that Apache intends to completely access the Wheatstone and Kitimat LNG project.","And third, in light of our expanding opportunity set in North American onshore, we are evaluating our international assets and are exploring multiple opportunities including the potential for separation of some or all of them through the capital markets.","And one additional note regarding our North American onshore portfolio, over the past year, we deepened our understanding of our North American properties. We\u2019ve elevated our capabilities in advanced emerging plays and in that regard this fall we intend to hold an update presentation on North American onshore highlighting our $1.7 million net acres in the Permian basin.","So, with that out of the way, let me move to the details of our performance in the second quarter. This morning we announced second quarter results of $644 million or $1.67 per share of adjusted earnings, and $2.2 billion of cash flow from operations before changes in working capital.","During the quarter our operational focus in extensive acreage position across our best hydrocarbon region rich basins allowed us to drive production growth in North American onshore liquids. On a pro forma basis, we averaged 201,000, 395,000 barrels of oil per day, which is up 18% year-over-year.","North American onshore liquids represented nearly 61% of our total worldwide liquids production and 37% of our overall production. A corner stone of our North American onshore success has been the outstanding performance in the Permian basin. And through the first half of the year, the Permian region\u2019s performance is ahead of our plan. In fact we surpassed the significant milestone earlier this year as we celebrated reaching 150,000 barrels of oil equivalent and a day net.","We have come a long way since we launched the regions just over four years ago. And have grown production nearly 200% since that time. In fact, we have grown production 17 out of the last 18 quarters, and the last 11 quarters consecutively.","Cash flow from the region is coming in ahead of plan. And we anticipate the region will fully fund its capital program for the year. We expect to deliver over 23% liquids growth and more than 20% Boe growth for the year. And this performance demonstrates our focus on operational excellence and are driving out of cost from the system. And it underscores Apache\u2019s leading position in the Permian.","In the Anadarko Basin, our Central Region has experienced several challenges over the last couple of quarters. And as a result production growth has been disappointing. Our total wells drilled to-date for the year is 26% behind plan due to weather slowdowns as well as mechanical difficulties in both drilling and completion.","We\u2019re retooling the region in addition to recently making personnel changes or scaling back the Anadarko Basin activity and reducing capital and rigs. We continue to believe in the growth opportunities in the Anadarko Basin, we just need to slowdown and assure our selves we\u2019re making good investment decisions over the long term.","We do intend to ramp up our drilling activity in our Central Region Canyon mine play and Oldham and Potter County of Texas Panhandle. And I\u2019ll touch on this in more detail a little later.","As we said in the past, we view North American onshore business as one large resource comprised of several different plays and we will allocate capital and resources to the best opportunities within that portfolio. Despite the challenges we had in the Anadarko Basin, I want to reiterate our 15% to 18% North American onshore liquids guidance. And I also want to reiterate our 5% to 8% increase in our production, overall production guidance. We have a significant opportunity before us in North American onshore and the ability and expertise to continue to execute and deliver growth in the years to come.","I\u2019d like to specifically mention a few highlights from the quarter and share some of the results we are most excited about. I want to start in North American onshore Permian Basin, we have averaged 37 rigs, 24 of which were horizontal, and we grew production 4% over the previous quarter. Year-over-year we\u2019re seeing total production growth of an impressive 26%.","We had a strong Wolfcamp shale results in Regan County in Southern Midland Basin. For example, our SRH 1335 had a 24-hour rates of 1,184 barrels of oil equivalent a day. We also had impressive results in the Bone Spring of the Delaware Basin, with several new wells coming on in Reeves and Loving County, including the Robin 8 with 24-hour rate of nearly 1,200 barrels of oil per day.","And our East Texas Eagle Ford play in Brazos and Burleson counties, we continue to be very excited about our opportunity in this emerging play. We\u2019d recently added additional acreage and now hold over 2,000 net acres in the play.","We\u2019re shifting to more of an appraisal mode in our drilling from pads to further reduce cost and enhance returns. We have spud 26 wells during the quarter, with most scheduled to come on line frankly in the third quarter, the Reveille 8H was completed during the second quarter in a 24-hour IP of 987 barrels of oil equivalent a day.","We also have early test on wells coming on in first part of the third quarter, including the nearby Reveille 10H and 14H which had 24-hour IPs of 906 barrels of oil equivalent per day and 1,220 barrels of oil equivalent per day, respectively. With these strong results and our tremendous land position we decided to further ramp our activity up and should be running 10 rigs by year-end in this play.","In the Canyon Lime play in the Texas Panhandle, we also have seen strong results, specifically our most recent well the Bivins 94-1H at a 30-day IP of 1,718 barrels of oil equivalent a day. We hold approximately 100,000 net contiguous acres in this play and are planning to drill a total of six wells this year to further delineate the play and we should have four rigs running active in this play by year end.","Turning to Canada, in our first quarter call, we disclosed that we had drilled the Duverney and Montney wells. The initial production rates has been encouraging. For an example, in the Duverney in the first quarter we completed well 24-hour rate of 1,963 barrels of oil equivalent a day. And in the Montney our first well was completed in the first quarter, had a 30 day IP of 926 barrels of oil equivalent a day.","And with these positive results, we\u2019re looking to increase activities in these plays and plan to spud 10 wells in the Duverney and two wells in the Montney by year-end 2014. We\u2019ve also been adding to our acreage position in both these plays, we now have 146,000 net acres in the Montney and 177,000 net acres in the Duverney.","I want to take a second and shift to our international region. Production was in line with expectations as we held it flat over the previous quarter. We remain on track to generate significant free cash flow for the year from our international regions.","In the North Sea second quarter production was up 7% quarter-over-quarter, as we recovered from a difficult winter. We drilled eight new wells during the second quarter including a new well in the Beryl field that achieved 30-day IP of 4,500 barrels of oil equivalent a day. And our (indiscernible) well that achieved an average 30-day IP of 1,500 barrels of oil per day.","During the quarter in Egypt, we had additional exploration success, we had notable tests in the AEB, Safa, and Paleozoic reservoirs as well as the horizontal test in Upper Bahariya.","Following Phase I of our (indiscernible) development project the field is now producing at peak productions and we\u2019ve also seen record oil and gas production from successful work on the BP acquired call to two properties at Abu Gharadig and Razak.","And finally, in Australia we continue to make progress on several of our new projects. Our Balnaves project is expected to come online in the third quarter, in fact we expect first of all in the next few weeks.","I want to point out our Coniston development project which is originally scheduled for first oil during the third quarter of 2014 is now going to be delayed until early 2015. Our FPSO, the Ningaloo Vision were delivered to the shipyard in Singapore early part of this year to undergo process upgrades and capacity expansion, which will require to bring on our new Coniston wells.","During a deep hole inspection coincident with the upgrade, it was discovered that it had significant structural steel replacement problem that was necessary to ensure its long-term safety and integrity of production up time for this FPSO. The repair work is well underway; it should start up later than initially planned. However, and this delayed start up does not, but I want to point out this delayed start up does not impact our overall production guidance.","As I mentioned earlier, we are on track to deliver our production guidance for 15% to 18% North American onshore liquids growth and our global BOE expected growth of 5% to 18%, based on our 2013 production on a pro forma basis.","Finally, before I turn the call over to Alfonso, I want to briefly touch on our buyback program, utilizing proceeds primarily from divestments during the quarter Apache bought back an additional $780 million worth of stock. This brings our total expense the launch of our buyback program through the end of the second quarter to nearly $2.3 billion or 26 million shares.","As a reminder during the second quarter our Board increased our authorization by 10 million shares to 40 million shares. And we continue to be Apache shares at compelling value at current prices.","With that, I would like the turn the call over to Alfonso","Alfonso Leon","","Thank you, Steve. I\u2019m going to cover some balance sheet highlights and provide production and financial expectations for the remainder of the year. First, with respect to our balance sheet, during the second quarter we completed three significant portfolio focusing steps. The monetization of our major deepwater development projects, the divestment of dry gas properties in Canada, and the focusing of our asset base in south Texas. These three things actions close during the quarter yielding $1.8 billion of cash proceeds.","This brings the total cash proceeds generate before portfolio focusing steps over the last year to $10 billion. As Steve mentioned, we continue to actively repurchase Apache common shares during the quarter. In the second quarter we bought back $780 million in stock. To put that number in context I should note that the $1.4 billion proceeds from our deepwater divestment were only received on the very last day of the quarter, 30th of June.","Our balance sheet remained strong, our total cash position as of June 30 is nearly $1.9 billion. Debt remains unchanged at $9 billion which puts us at 22% debt to cap.","Now I\u2019m going to make some comments regarding your expectations for the remainder of the year, starting with production. As Steve said, we remain on track to deliver our production growth expectations for the year, consistent with our 15% to 18% North American onshore liquids growth expectations, and the third and fourth quarters we anticipate 2% to 4% sequential North American onshore liquids growth, driven by our horizontal development, programs continuing to build on their momentum.","In line with our 5% to 8% global BOE production growth, we anticipate our global gas production to drop 1% to 2% sequentially in the third quarter. And for global BOE production to be flat to 1% up sequentially for the quarter. This is driven primarily by our regularly scheduled third quarter maintenance turnaround in the North Sea, where production is expected to be 12% to 14% down sequentially in the third quarter with that production returning in the fourth quarter.","As a final production note we currently expect Australia production to rise 6,000 to 8,000 BOEs per day sequentially in each of the third and fourth quarters, driven by oil from Balnaves ramping up.","Going to turn now to realizations. We currently expect North American oil realization discounts to WTI of $5 to $8 barrel. On the international oil side we expect to shift to a realization discount to Brent of $1 to $2 per barrel as our mix of production evolves with Australia ramping up.","We continue to expect North American natural gas realization discounts to NYMEX for the full year in line with first quarter or a $0.40 per Mcf discount. And we now see global NGL realizations at 28% to 30% of WTI for the remainder of the year, which is slightly lower than our previous expectation, driven by North America now being expected to be at 25% to 27% of WTI.","Now I'm going to move to the expense side. Starting with LOE. Second quarter unit LOE was up sequentially to $10.59, this is in line with expectations we set out in our previous call, of an increase form first quarter levels by 10% through year-end, driven by the ongoing shift in our portfolio balance and general cost increases.","Going now to DD & A, unit recurring DD & A was up $0.70 sequentially in the second quarter. This is in line with our expectations to see it rise this year by as much $2 per BOE from first quarter numbers, as we focus our capital on liquids projects.","Going to taxes other than income, we expect an increase for the remainder of the year primarily driven by the initiation of Australia PRRT expense. Based on current strip prices, we currently expect taxes other than income to increase sequentially by $40 million to $70 million in the third quarter.","Going to G&A, second quarter G&A expense reflected the timing of third-party reimbursements, we expect a sequential increase of $20 million to $40 million in G&A expense in the third quarter.","And finally, on the Income Statement, going to income taxes, our adjusted income tax rate was 40.3% in the second quarter, which is in line with our expectations of 40% to 44% for the year. On an adjusted basis, our deferred tax percentage was 30% which is broadly in line with our previously stated expectations for the year.","Finally, capital for the first half of 2014 was in line with our plan for the year. We have updated the format of our capital table on Page 10 of financial supplement to facilitate the tracking of our investment.","This concludes our prepared remarks. I think we\u2019re now ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","","(Operator Instructions) Please note that during the Q&A portion of the call, you are allotted one question and one follow-up question. Please hold for the first question. First question will come from Bob Bracket with Sanford Bernstein.","Robert Brackett \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC","Hi, good afternoon. Question on this international asset separation, and it has two parts. In terms of Egypt, does the JV partner have any preemption rights or any ability to restrict what you might do there? And the second is you talk about North America growth as opposed to U.S. growth. What\u2019s the role of Canada in the portfolio, and is it a target for the international asset separation?","G. Steven Farris","Well, let\u2019s start with the international certainly the way that we are looking at it, we would just spend out or set up a company that was not was above any of the relationships Apache had at the joint venture level. So that would not require votes of other parties.","With respect to Canada, we have said for some time that Canada was a part of our North American onshore portfolio, certainly we have two businesses up there. I think we have a business which is a big business that we have with respect to Duvernay Shale, the Montney Shale and some of the other things that we are working on there and then we also have Kitimat, Horn River, Leard.","Kitimat, Horn River, Leard is part of our LNG projects that we indicated and re-indicated today that we intend to exit.","Robert Brackett \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC","And then a follow-up on the East Texas Eagle Ford, if you\u2019re ramping the 10 rigs, does that you\u2019ve de-risked it and this is a commercial project that competes for capital.","","G. Steven Farris","","We feel very comfortable we\u2019d de-risk and it also is going to compete with capital and today what we are trying to do is refine it and it increase the rate of return and the EURs and lower the cost.","Robert Brackett \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC","Great, thanks.","Operator","The next question will come from Michael Roe with PPH.","Michael Roe \u2013 PPH","","Yes, good afternoon. I just had a quick question on the central region. So I know you all picked up some rigs in Q2 to try to catch up based on your slowdown in Q1. So I was wondering when you\u2019re decelerating in that region this year, are there particular zones that we will see less capital relative to others?","John J. Christmann, IV","This is John. Yes, I mean we are planning to drop some rigs and slowdown and retool in the central region so we will dropping some capital back half of the year.","G. Steven Farris","I apologize because you were very almost inaudible on this end but \u2013 right now we got two parts of the central region, we got the Anadarko Basin, which we are going to drop some rigs on and we also got the Canyon Lime down in Texas Panhandle, we are going to be increasing but net-net we\u2019ll be reducing our capital in the overall program for the central region.","Michael Roe \u2013 PPH","","Okay, yes, so my question didn\u2019t come through clearly, I was just curious, if there is any specific zone in the Anadarko Basin that will see less capital unlike is it the Cleveland or the Granite Wash, they will see less capital or will it just be kind of uniform across the board.","G. Steven Farris","In general, we still remained very bullish or excited about the basin we just need to slowdown and we\u2019ve had good wells in all those zones. We just need to kind slowdown take a deep breath and pause and regroup.","","Michael Roe \u2013 PPH","Okay, great, and then I guess just shifting really quick to the Permian Basin, looks like the well results you all had in the Bone Spring look pretty strong in the Pecos Bend area. I was wondering if you could help provide color on how much acreage you have in Reeves, Loving and Ward Counties of the Delaware Basin? Just trying to get a sense of your running room there.","John J. Christmann, IV","","When you look at our Delaware basin acreage we\u2019ve got over 500,000 gross for that 215,000 net. So we\u2019ve got good running room in all three of those counties. But I don\u2019t have a break down specifically just to those three. But that is how you kind of look at the whole Delaware basin.","Michael Roe \u2013 PPH","Okay, thanks for the color.","Operator","The next question will come from David Tameron with Wells Fargo. David your line is open. Can you hear me your line is open.","","Castlen Kennedy","You can go ahead and move to the next question, please.","Operator","The next question will come from Pearce Hammond with Simmons & Co.","Pearce W. Hammond \u2013 Simmons & Co.","","Hi, good afternoon guys.","G. Steven Farris","Good afternoon.","Pearce W. Hammond \u2013 Simmons & Co.","","Regarding potential international divestitures, how do you balance the need to simplify the company and placate some shareholders in the near term versus the challenges of receiving fair value for those international assets and what is best for the company in the long-term.","","G. Steven Farris","Well I think number one if you look at what we\u2019ve done over the last five years and what we\u2019ve said today they are consistent we \u2013 in the past we haven\u2019t said what we\u2019re going to today, we thought like we \u2013 with all the discussion out there we felt like we had to discuss some of this.","With respect to what we have sold in the past and the way I feel about the future is, I think we\u2019ve have gotten very fair prices from what we have sold and frankly they are like Heidelberg and Lucius, we started selling that over a year and what we ended up selling it for, because we weren\u2019t going to sell it at prices that don\u2019t make sense. And that\u2019s the way I feel about our international assets. But I do think there is a potential for a capital market solution for a number of these assets and we\u2019re working on that, have been working on that for some time.","Pearce W. Hammond \u2013 Simmons & Co.","Thank you, Steve and then my follow up relates to Kitimat. Does the sale of Kitimat impact the value of the Leard and Horn River assets. Or do you \u2013 if you\u2019re going to sell down your interest in Kitimat, do you in turn sell down the Leard and Horn River so that goes with that package and does it stay with the Canadian assets that might be at a part of your onshore North America go forward company?","G. Steven Farris","Yeah, I have to honestly say I don\u2019t think the complete exit by Apache has a impact on the value of Kitimat going forward one way or the other. I said frankly whether we\u2019re in it or not is a world class project with world class reserves and frankly Chevron and Apache at this point are a way head of anybody else in that arena. So, and we\u2019ve always been in a position frankly that we felt like we could not be in these LNG projects. And I just think it\u2019s important that we stayed back.","Pearce W. Hammond \u2013 Simmons & Co.","Thank you, Steve.","Operator","The next question will come from Joe Allman with JPMorgan.","Joseph David Allman \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC","","Thank you. In terms of Apache post these transactions, what\u2019s your hope in terms of, say a growth rate, what do you think is an appropriate growth rate for a North America onshore focused Apache? What kind of growth rate would you think is competitive? How would you see spending, would you think you would be free cash flow positive, or free cash flow neutral, or would you accelerate and actually be deficit spending? And then also what kind of returns would you be looking forward in the post-transaction Apache?","G. Steven Farris","Well, I think if you look at, frankly if you look at what our growth rate is today, and you compare it with most of the companies of size, our long term forecast is 5% to 9%. Regardless of whether we say that is our forecast, that is competitive in the market, I think our liquids growth are competitive in the market at 15% to 18%. With respect, do we live within our cash flow? I think we have been very open over the last several quarters about what our view of our capital structure is. Our capital structure should be in a position that is competitive in the market, and gives us flexibility in the financial arena, so that\u2019s all I\u2019m going to comment about that.","I think we have the potential frankly with the asset base that we have, and the expertise that we are building the capabilities for, frankly. Really have the potential to have significant growth over the next several years.","Joseph David Allman \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC","","Got you. And then a follow-up, so just a follow-up to that question, and then another one. So just in terms of returns, do you think that the post-Apache or the post-transaction Apache will yield better returns than the existing Apache? And then off question is, like what\u2019s your thinking behind the sale of international and what kind of iterations have you thought about, have you thought about spinning out the Permian for example, or have you thought about spinning and selling everything except keeping Egypt and North Sea, which currently generate free cash flow, and also keeping the Permian, but selling everything else. So just trying to think about what iterations have you thought about, and what does selling international really do for you?","G. Steven Farris","","Well, we thought about a number of reiterations. I don\u2019t know that I could mark off each one of the ones you went through in terms of the consideration. I see North American onshore sales as a different business than what we are doing internationally. They take different expertise, they take different time frames, they take different really scientific skill sets.","And I think that it is important for us to recognize that, and recognize if we\u2019re going to be the best we can be, we need to concentrate on the things that we have the most of, and I think has the highest \u2013 the greatest growth future.","Joseph David Allman \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC","","Got you. And just on returns do you think, you'll have higher returns post transaction or is there\u2026","","G. Steven Farris","","Yes, I do. I think overall when you say returns, I\u2019m talking about future returns on invested dollars. As we look at our discretionary spend going forward, where we can spend dollars for the highest rates of return. I think what we\u2019re doing now, certainly in the Permian what we\u2019re doing in Eagle Ford compete with anything else we\u2019re doing investing across the Company. Certainly Egypt is a great rate of return, but we also got to recognize that it\u2019s a situation that fits into international portfolio also.","Joseph David Allman \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC","","Got you. Very helpful. Steve, thank you.","Operator","The next question will come from John Herrlin with Societe Generale.","John Herrlin \u2013 Societe Generale","","Yes, hi. Two quick ones for me, Steve. What was the condensate yield out of the Duvernay well you mentioned?","G. Steven Farris","John, I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t\u2026","John J. Christmann, IV","","Yes, John. Hang on just a second here. On our Duverney well, the 734-barrels of oil a day, 200 barrels are condensate and about $4.4 million. Those are actually 30-day average.","John Herrlin \u2013 Societe Generale","Great. Thank you. With respect to the international spin, Steve, what about tax efficiency? Is it easier to do a spin versus an outright sale? How could you shield your basis for a lot of the sales proceeds?","Alfonso Leon","John. Hi, it\u2019s Alfonso. We have been working on this for quite sometime now. Based on our work to-date, we believe that we can effect the separation of our international business in a tax efficient manner. We still have obviously significant work ahead of us as we move this forward. So based on everything that we have seen thus far, we believe we can get this done efficiently?","John Herrlin \u2013 Societe Generale","Okay, great. Thank you, very much.","Operator","","The next question will come from Doug Leggate with Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch.","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","","Thanks everybody for getting me on. Steve, Egypt when you sold it last year, I think one of the arguments for keeping the two thirds that you retained was about, you may get a better option to see a recovery in the political environment there, and obviously you took a fairly hefty discount on it. I\u2019m just curious therefore, is a separation via a spin preferred to trying to take cash out of Egypt, because obviously you'd end up suffering the same fate I imagine? And if so, would you be thinking an international listing for the international business or would you be thinking about two U.S. listed companies, I know it\u2019s a bit conceptual, but just trying to get understanding how you\u2019re thinking about it, I\u2019ve got a follow-up, please?","G. Steven Farris","","Well, certainly if we do it in the capitals market, we spin it, certain of our shareholders will still own it. I mean, and they have the benefit of it. And maybe Alfonso, I didn\u2019t understand the complete question frankly.","Alfonso Leon","","Hey, Doug. Look, we are looking at all alternatives, and that\u2019s why we\u2019ve outlined that we are evaluating a number of different alternatives. We need to get to the best possible outcome, the one that maximizes value for our shareholders. So we are progressing different alternatives. Now, when you look at the profile, the profitability the competitive position of our international businesses, they are each of them the leader in their respective competitive space. So obviously, they have a very attractive profile for a portfolio capital markets positioning. So that\u2019s certainly a very compelling opportunity.","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So my follow-up, maybe it\u2019s just for you, Alfonso, but the value of your onshore resources obviously going to be depended on the pace of drilling, and Wheatstone for sure, and certainly North Sea in each of \u2013 would have generated on both \u2013 currently generated substantial free cash flow. So how do we think about giving that up in terms of the ability to accelerate the onshore using that international free cash flow as you did separate businesses, and I\u2019ll leave it at that. Thank you.","G. Steven Farris","Let me just start with respect to \u2013 you\u2019re not really taking it away, let\u2019s assume that we \u2013 if we were to divest of it, obviously, we\u2019d also \u2013 we\u2019d just bring in the value forward. If we do spin it, we also have debt associated with those assets that are spun out, so in either way you\u2019re not giving up that assets, you\u2019re just separating them.","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So Steve would we expect then to \u2013 Apache has always kind of talked about living within cash flow, so in that situation, are you seeing you reduce your balance sheet to accelerate the growing in the lower 48?","G. Steven Farris","","Well, I think what I\u2019ve said, and I'll say it again, and because I said it earlier. We look at our financial position based on what we think is a competitive in the market, and also in such \u2013 in a position that we can continue to grow. We're in a different space than we were in when we were acquiring and exploiting. We're in a different space in terms of what our go-forward opportunities are. So how we look at our balance sheet is going to change a little bit.","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it, understood. Thanks very much fellows.","Operator","The next question will come from Brian Singer with Goldman, Sachs.","Brian Singer \u2013 Goldman, Sachs & Co.","Thank you. Good afternoon. A question on the Permian. Relative to your Analyst Meeting in late February, what is evolving in your Permian strategy or assumptions, and how are you looking at potential and drilling opportunities in your central Midland Basin position in Midland, Martin and Howard Counties?","","John J. Christmann, IV","","Well, I mean what we laid out, we\u2019re pretty much in line. We\u2019ve run six to seven rigs at Barnhard. We\u2019ve been taking those learnings and applying them. We\u2019ve now got 18 rigs running horizontally in the Midland Basin. So we\u2019re starting to announce some results in our Scottish rights and our pile area and so forth. So we\u2019re taking those learnings that we\u2019ve had in Barnhard.","In general, though, we\u2019re still working. I mean, when you look at what we\u2019re doing right now on the completion side, we\u2019re looking at more clusters, more stages, more sand loading per linear foot, all of those things and I think it\u2019s helping wells holdup longer and so forth. So we continue to take those learnings that we\u2019ve had and progress them into other areas as well as into the Eagle Ford and those things.","Brian Singer \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great, thanks. And then, what is the timing for a greater decision on the separation of the international assets? Is there a specific time you expect to have that, and does that decision need to be made prior to selling Wheatstone, Kitimat, or other international assets individually?","Alfonso Leon","Brian, we haven\u2019t set a specific timeline. We are working on a number of different opportunities and have been working on them for quite some time at the moment. Each of them has a different timeline associated with it, and we will make decisions as we get to decision points. Specifically on the separation workflow, I\u2019m sure you\u2019re very familiar with, those are multi core processes. So that is not something that is executed on an imminent basis. The work has been underway, but there is still significant work ahead of us.","Brian Singer \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","The next question will come from Michael Hall with Heikkinen Energy Advisors.","Michael Hall \u2013 Heikkinen Energy Advisors","","Thank you. A number of mine have been asked on the portfolio repositioning, so I\u2019ll leave that be, but on the Permian, just a couple questions. The oil growth in the quarter kind of slowed a bit on a quarter on quarter basis. Anything in particular driving that, and is this kind of a timing issue or how should we think about that going forward?","John J. Christmann, IV","It\u2019s clearly timing issue. We pulled a few pads forward into the first quarter. That\u2019s why you had bigger first quarter numbers relative to second quarter. So it\u2019s an issue on the timing and so forth. But we remain optimistic and encouraged with our asset base.","Michael Hall \u2013 Heikkinen Energy Advisors","","Okay. And I guess in that context, are there any surface constraints that you\u2019re working through at present that might help restructure?","John J. Christmann, IV","We don\u2019t have anything backed up right now. I mean, that\u2019s the nice thing about our portfolio is we plan our schedule, we plan our completion timing, we stay ahead on the facilities. So that\u2019s the big advantage we\u2019ve got, which has really let us have such a track record, 17 out of 18 quarters up. So we remained executing the plan we\u2019ve got out there.","Michael Hall \u2013 Heikkinen Energy Advisors","Great, and then just as a reminder, can you remind me what your protection on differentials looks like out of the Permian Basin and in the context the royalty revenues coming from the mineral ownership you have in the basin?","John J. Christmann, IV","In terms of our volumes we do have the ability to take Gulf Coast pricing or WTI or NYMEX. We\u2019ve got protection on the differentials. We have not disclosed anything on our mineral royalties out there. We do have a nice position, but a lot of that is future acreage to be developed and it\u2019s not something that\u2019s contributing a great percentage right now.","Michael Hall \u2013 Heikkinen Energy Advisors","Thank you.","Operator","The next question will come from Charles Meade with Johnson Rice.","Charles A. Meade \u2013 Johnson & Rice Company L.L.C.","","Good afternoon, everybody. I want to go back to the issue of the international assets. It seems to me that a lot of the conversation questions contain the assumption that all of the assets or the whole set of international operations will all go out in one transaction. I wanted to test that assumption a bit because it seems to me that some of the assets would have a better reception in the capital markets and then others maybe belong with you or belong in some other international company\u2019s portfolio. So can you may be shed a little light on whether there\u2019s going to be multiple transactions or just one?","Thomas E. Voytovich","","That\u2019s a very good question. Honestly, we truthfully have been working on a number of opportunities. One is a complete capital market solution. But we also have other solutions that you point out that could take place and could take place quicker than a complete capital market\u2019s exit. So, yes, it could be some combination of each one of those.","Charles A. Meade \u2013 Johnson & Rice Company L.L.C.","","Great, thank you, Tom. And then going back to the Permian, I know you guys have fielded a lot of questions on your royalty position in the last month or so. And I wonder if you could give anymore breakdown of maybe by Midland Basin, central Basin platform, Delaware Basin or by county on where those royalty acres lie.","John J. Christmann, IV","","They\u2019re scattered. We\u2019ve got a big position in the very, very southern portion of the Delaware is where a big chunk of it sits, which is really below where the activity has been, but we think it could ultimately move there. But that\u2019s where a lion\u2019s share of it sits. We\u2019ve also got some gains, but nothing that we\u2019ve lined out is in an area right now that we\u2019re going crazy with on the development side.","Charles A. Meade \u2013 Johnson & Rice Company L.L.C.","","Got it. That\u2019s helpful detail. Thank you, John.","Operator","","The next question will come from Arun Jayaram with Credit Suisse.","Arun Jayaram \u2013 Credit Suisse","","Good afternoon. Alfonso, Steve, understanding you\u2019re still evaluating the potential separation of international. It seems like the comments today suggest that you believe strategically a complete separation of the two makes the most sense. So, is that a fair characterization strategically?","G. Steven Farris","","I think it\u2019s a fair characterization that they are \u2013 we recognize and we have recognized that there really are two different businesses and I think how we accomplish that recognition in the end will probably end up a majority of those assets being in another vehicle, if you understand what I\u2019m saying. What that vehicle is if it\u2019s a capital structure solution or for an outright sale.","Arun Jayaram \u2013 Credit Suisse","Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. Thanks for clarifying that. Second question just goes along with the Anadarko Basin. Steve, this has been an area that I know you focused on post the Cordillera transaction. Can you just give us a little bit more detail on why the growth rate is coming in a little bit lower than you had thought initially?","G. Steven Farris","I think I\u2019ll let John comment on the details. I think our biggest issue is, I think I\u2019ve pointed out in my prepared remarks, we are 26% behind in terms of getting wells on compared with our plan. Regardless of the results of those wells, 26% is, and honestly the majority of those had some kind of mechanical issue either sidetrack, or casing, or completion problems. We just took our eye off the ball frankly and we got to get our eye back on the ball.","John J. Christmann, IV","And, Arun, just a little color there. We\u2019re 43 wells short of what we plan to have on through the first half of the year, which is huge when you had a program of 163 for the plan. And then when you look at a lot of what\u2019s lead to that we\u2019ve had over 27 wells that sidetrack in. So when you look at that, I mean, that\u2019s big, big portion of where we are. I will say we\u2019ve had good results in all of the play. So we aren\u2019t saying none of them are working. We\u2019ve just got to kind of get refocused and get back to doing it how we approach, how we used to do it.","Arun Jayaram \u2013 Credit Suisse","Okay.","John J. Christmann, IV","And with new technology too.","Arun Jayaram \u2013 Credit Suisse","Okay. And then just my final quick question, you guys reiterated your volume guidance despite the timing in Australia at Coniston plus perhaps a slower growth rate from the central. Where is this going to be made up, Permian and East Texas?","John J. Christmann, IV","Your Permian, your East Texas, Eagle Ford as well as Bivens play, Canada remains ahead of schedule as well.","Arun Jayaram \u2013 Credit Suisse","Okay. Thank you for that detail.","Operator","The next question will come from Jeffrey Campbell with Tuohy Brothers.","Jeffrey Campbell \u2013 Tuohy Brothers","","Good afternoon. I think I\u2019ve got some, John, questions here. Can you give some color on the current DNC costs and the K-bob Duvernay and what you think these costs can look like over the next 18 months?","John J. Christmann, IV","Well, right now we\u2019ve got two wells down and they were not done off of pads and so not really in a position to steer off of where we\u2019ve been. As we work on the program this fall, we plan to spud six more Duvernay wells and I think we\u2019ll see cost come down significantly. But our first couple wells were science wells. And, so they\u2019re not representative of where we\u2019ll be in the future with our program up there.","Jeffrey Campbell \u2013 Tuohy Brothers","The next question was the Hector County Kline well was a very strong result. Can you contrast the extra Kline from the Kline wells you\u2019ve been drilling in the East and Glasscock? Are there any noteworthy differences in geology or mix or cost?","John J. Christmann, IV","","Well, just like the Midland Basin, you get a little bit deeper in the basin. So you get a little bit pressure or little different oil makeup. So that area, we\u2019re very excited about. But geology is a little different and obviously the fluid property as well.","Jeffrey Campbell \u2013 Tuohy Brothers","Okay. If I can sneak one last one in. You said in the first quarter 2014 when you were talking about the East Texas Eagle Ford, you were targeting getting some wells up to 10,000 feet laterals. I was just wondering have you drilled any of that long yet? And can you disclose what the lateral lengths were of the two Reveille wells you highlighted in the second quarter supplement?","John J. Christmann, IV","Those Reveille wells have been in the 6,000 to 7,000 foot range and we have not drilled one up to 10,000. I think we had one about 8,000 was one earlier. So we do think we\u2019ll be able to continue to drill longer laterals. A lot of that\u2019s just driven by how we led the units down in the land position.","Jeffrey Campbell \u2013 Tuohy Brothers","","Okay, great. Thanks very much.","Operator","The next question will come from Leo Mariani with RBC.","","Leo Mariani \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Just a question on the Kitimat disposal here. Can you talk a little bit more about the motivation for this? Is this based on the fact that it\u2019s going to be a significant CapEx burden for a number of years for the company and you wouldn\u2019t see any cash flow out many years? Is that one of the motivating factors behind the disposition? And given how that\u2019s a very early stage project, would you expect to get a material amount of cash for that on the short-term?","John J. Christmann, IV","","Well, in terms of the decision process, obviously if you look at where we are going on our base business and you think about the priority of capital and the time frame associated with LNG projects and specifically Kitimat frankly, it makes sense for someone else to own it that has a different time horizon than we do. And in terms of the order of magnitude of the capital, cash, we\u2019ll have to see.","Leo Mariani \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Okay. That\u2019s all I had. Thanks.","Operator","The next question will come from Richard Tullis with Capital One.","Richard Tullis \u2013 Capital One","Thanks. Good afternoon. Just a couple quick questions. Steve, what were the average well costs in the second quarter for your Permian, Wolfcamp and Bone Spring wells?","G. Steven Farris","Our Wolfcamp wells have been running around $7 million roughly, which is kind of an average. One thing we\u2019ve seen is we\u2019ve gone with little harsh sand loadings, some have creeped up, $7 million is probably a pretty good number and our Bone Spring wells have come down a little bit and they\u2019re probably in that same range.","","Richard Tullis \u2013 Capital One","Okay. Given this, what could be even in more focused onshore North America assets than say at the time of the Analyst Meeting, how does the Gulf of Mexico shelf fit into that portfolio? Would you still plan to be active there in 2015\/2016?","Thomas E. Voytovich","This is Tom. Gulf shelf remains an area of focus for us, but we are in an inventory building mode now. There\u2019s no capital committed for 2014. We would anticipate some expenditures in 2015 provided of course that that opportunity is competitive with other things in the portfolio. ","I will say that inventory building is well underway. We have pretty impressive list of prospects. And I will also say though that there\u2019s no pressure to execute on these right now. The only decision making component here is whether or not these prospects are competitive with what we\u2019re doing in North America onshore. And if they are, they\u2019ll get consideration for capital.","Richard Tullis \u2013 Capital One","Okay. And then just lastly, how much has been spent to date on Kitimat on a net basis?","Thomas E. Voytovich","I think IR will have to come back to you on that number.","Richard Tullis \u2013 Capital One","Okay that\u2019s fine.","Thomas E. Voytovich","I don't have that number yet.","Richard Tullis \u2013 Capital One","All right. Thank you. I appreciate it.","Operator","The final question will come from Joe Magner with Macquarie","Joseph Patrick Magner \u2013 Macquarie Capital Inc.","Thanks for getting me on here. Just want to go back to the portfolio of repositioning topic here for a bit. I guess I'm still not clear on what actually is driving the moves now, what's driven the recognition that the domestic business or the North American business is different and should be separate from the international and LNG businesses. And it's only a few months ago that you all had laid out sort of the longer term view with all of the moves that it made last year and there was a lot of hope that perhaps that work was behind you. And now we've got one, two potentially a number of additional transactions to be on the look out for over the coming quarters.","What really, I mean aside from the recent announcements about some increased interest from some potential shareholders, some certain shareholders, I guess that's what I'm trying to get a better handle on. It seem like you were comfortable and had made comments in the past, but the moves that have been made were the moves that you had in sort of in mind and thought that was going to be enough. And now we've got another change here, so could spend a little more time on that?","G. Steven Farris","Certainly. Let me start off with talking about from late 2009. And I thank most of our shareholders and (indiscernible) most have that chart because what I showed is that we made a strategic decision to get back into North America. And if you look at what we did over that timeframe, I think, we brought $16 billion worth of properties and 85% of were with North America onshore. And if you look at about what we were about after 2012, first part of 2013, I think at our year-end analyst call we said we were going to sell $1 billion worth of properties at that time. In the second quarter we came out and announced we were going to sell $4 billion worth of properties and end up now of selling $10 billion worth of properties.","I think the overriding thing that we take from this is that number one; we started out being on the forefront of coming back to North America. And I think what you\u2019re seeing is, what does it take to get North America onshore to center part of this company? And if you look at what we\u2019ve been able to do, it's getting us a long way there.","If you look at what we got in front of us in terms of these LNG projects and the long term nature of them, the amount of capital it takes to invest in them. I think that\u2019s an easy decision. I think the difference what we come to the conclusion of frankly in our North American versus international is they are two different businesses, and if you look at the way that you go about doing them in workflows, et cetera, they are two different businesses.","So, in our opinion it makes sense that we continue to reduce the size of our international assets because we made a decision long time ago, we\u2019re going to be North American onshore. So that\u2019s, honestly that is and we\u2019ve had some recent discussion about that, among lots of folks and I think it\u2019s important that we state our case and that is our case.","Joseph Patrick Magner \u2013 Macquarie Capital Inc.","Okay, we will stay tuned for additional updates, thank you.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time.","Castlen Kennedy","Great thank you so much.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you.","I would now like to turn the call over to Gary Clark, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Clark, you may begin your conference.","Gary T. Clark - Vice President-Investor Relations","Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us on Apache Corporation's second quarter 2015 earnings conference call. Speakers making prepared remarks on today's call will be Apache's CEO and President, John Christmann; and CFO, Steve Riney. Also joining us in the room is Tom Voytovich, Executive Vice President of International and Offshore; as well as Tim Sullivan, Senior Vice President of Operations.","In conjunction with this morning's press release, I hope you have had the opportunity to review our quarterly earnings supplement, which summarizes our operational activities and well highlights across various Apache operating regions. The supplement also includes information on our revised full-year guidance, capital expenditures for the quarter, as well as a chart that illustrates cash sources and uses and reconciles Apache's change in net debt during the second quarter of 2015. Our earnings release, the accompanying financial tables, and non-GAAP reconciliations, and our quarterly earnings supplement can all be found on our website at www.apachecorp.com.","I'd like to remind, everyone, that today's discussions will contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions based on our current views and most reasonable expectations. However, a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from what we discuss today. A full disclaimer is located with the supplemental data on our website.","And I would now like to turn the call over to John.","John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Gary. Good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us today. I'm very pleased with our second quarter results and the tremendous amount of progress we have made refocusing our asset base, strengthening our balance sheet, and restructuring our operational organization. Importantly, we are continuing to deliver on our cost initiatives, and we are exceeding our previously established production goals.","During the quarter, we closed on the sales of our LNG business and remaining oil and gas assets in Australia, which served to more strategically align our portfolio with our core competencies. In doing so, we greatly enhanced our balance sheet strength and liquidity position.","Additionally, we reduced our drilling and completion activities and overall spending to a level that is more in line with the current commodity price environment. We also realigned our management and regional operating structure to drive greater efficiencies, and we implemented meaningful new initiatives to reduce overall G&A costs. Finally, we delivered strong production both domestically and internationally, which is prompting us to raise our 2015 production guidance. Looking ahead, we anticipate having strong production momentum as we exit 2015 and believe that we will have the flexibility to live within 2016 cash flow, while maintaining relatively stable year-over-year production levels.","Now I'd like to review our operational results in greater detail. During the second quarter, onshore North American production averaged 317,000 BOEs per day and once again came in ahead of our expectations. This was driven by strong operational performance across the entire portfolio and in particular from new well contributions in the Permian and the Eagle Ford. Our performance internationally was also impressive. Excluding Australia, pro forma production from international and Gulf of Mexico was 172,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Egypt was a significant driver during the quarter as delineation of the Ptah and Berenice oil fields continued to drive gross production sequentially higher.","In the North Sea, our production declined modestly from the first quarter as a result of two seasonal platform maintenance turnarounds, but was still above internal expectations due to production efficiencies. We have also had recent drilling success in the North Sea, which I will discuss in a few minutes.","Our performance on the capital side, during the quarter, was in line with our expectations. Expenditures on continuing operations before leasehold acquisitions, capitalized interest, and non-controlling interest were $857 million, which was down 28% from the first quarter. In addition to realizing service cost reductions, Apache is delivering solid drilling and completion efficiency gains, which is critical in this low oil price environment. At the beginning of the year, we took aggressive steps to address our cost structure and established a plan to reduce drilling and completion costs by at least (5:30) levels.","Year-to-date we have already achieved the 15% reduction and are on a run rate for an approximate 25% reduction for the remainder of the year. We now believe that there are potentially even more cost savings over and above the 25% if oil prices remain at current levels.","Our lease operating expenditures per BOE were down 13% year-over-year in the second quarter, and our G&A run rate is following quickly as a result of the overhead initiatives that we are pursuing on multiple fronts. Steve Riney will provide some more details in a few minutes on those items, as well as some forward-looking guidance.","As noted in our press release this morning, we raised our full-year 2015 onshore North American production guidance to between 305,000 BOE to 308,000 BOEs per day, the midpoint of which is up approximately 5,000 BOEs per day from our prior implied guidance. We are also effectively raising our international guidance, as we now see production in Egypt and the North Sea up 5% to 8% this year on a pro forma basis, which is a notable increase from our previous guidance of up slightly.","Looking at our onshore North American production profile for the remainder of the year, we expect third quarter production will be down sequentially from the second quarter. This is due primarily to monthly well completion timing, planned downtime associated with offset fracing operations, and planned facility and plant maintenance in the Permian. In the fourth quarter, however, we expect a strong production rebound and project that December will be our highest production month in the fourth quarter, absent any adverse weather events.","Overall, we feel very good about our performance to date and our projected production momentum as we enter 2016. It is important to note that we are in the process of developing our initial 2016 plan, as well as our five-year plan. This will put us in a better position to provide more thoughts around next year's production and capital outlook on our third quarter call.","I'd like to now discuss some of our key operational areas and activity plans for the remainder of the year. During the second quarter, we operated an average of 34 rigs company-wide with 15 rigs in North America, 12 rigs in Egypt, and 7 rigs in the North Sea. In North America, we completed 63 gross operated wells during the quarter, which was a 51% decrease from the first quarter. Despite the significant drop in completion activity, our onshore North American production grew by 9300 barrels of oil equivalent per day sequentially. The majority of this increase was driven by the Permian Basin where we delivered strong new well results and experienced a bounce back from the tough first quarter weather conditions and shut-ins.","We consider our Permian Basin to be advantaged in this current environment due to a relatively low base decline rate of approximately 22%. This is aided by our Central Basin Platform and North West Shelf assets, which represent approximately half of our gross production from the Permian and have a decline rate of roughly 14%. We have several production enhancement initiatives under way, including various water flood activities, and ESP installations that serve to protect our base decline rate at a fairly low capital cost.","In the Delaware Basin, we saw a strong oil performance in the Pecos Bend area and generated positive results from our delineation and target testing. Drilling at our 7-well Osprey pad confirmed good performance from 660 foot down-spaced wells and also helped to confirm an additional landing zone in the third Bone Spring formation, which appears to be performing as well as our primary target in the third Bone Spring. In the Waha area, we placed our first two wells online during the last week of June. Initial results look encouraging, and we will update you on this area next quarter.","At our North American update on November 20 of last year, we shared an average well cost for the Delaware Basin of $8 million. Today, we are drilling those wells in the mid to upper $5 million range, and our target is to get down closer to $5 million, which would represent an approximate 35% reduction from November 20.","In the Midland Basin, we ran three rigs during the second quarter, with one in our Wildfire area, one in Powell-Miller, and one at Azalea. Our first four wells at Wildfire in Midland County showed strong 30-day average IP rates of 1,090 BOEs per day in the middle Wolfcamp. We plan to complete an additional eight wells in this area during the second half of the year, three of which will be drilled to the lower Spraberry.","During the second half of the year, we will be completing 11 wells in the Powell-Miller and Azalea areas, which we anticipate will contribute solid results. Lastly, at Barnhart, we brought on four wells during the quarter, which exhibited some of the strongest results we have seen to-date across the field. In the Central Basin Platform and North West Shelf, we see numerous opportunities across our acreage position to continue drilling wells with high rates of return.","We are currently focusing on areas such as the Cedar Lake Yeso play and the Seth Campbell Clearfork play, which are highlighted in our quarterly supplement. These plays offer relatively inexpensive drilling and completion cost, thus yielding very attractive rates of return in today's low commodity price environment.","Turning to the Eagle Ford. During the second quarter, we made important progress in optimizing our completion techniques and significantly improving flow rates on the four new wells we brought online. Our current focus in the Eagle Ford has primarily been in Area A at Ferguson Crossing in Brazos County. During the second quarter, we brought online four key wells, two on our Walker pad and two on our Rae pad. The 30-day average IP of the two Walker wells was 1,935 barrels of oil equivalent per day, which significantly exceeds Apache's Area A type curve and represents our highest flow rates in the Eagle Ford play to-date.","Based on these results, we plan to add a rig back into the Eagle Ford at Ferguson Crossing, during the second half of 2015, which will help us continue optimization and delineation of this highly prospective area. In the Midcontinent, which was formerly our Central region, production was down 7% sequentially from the first quarter, as a result of natural declines and reduced activity. During the second quarter, we completed only six wells compared to 24 wells during the first quarter.","Apache's primary focus in the Midcontinent is delineating our Woodford\/SCOOP acreage and continued testing of the Canyon Lime play. In the Woodford, we have one rig drilling and delineating our 50,000 plus net acres, primarily in Grady County, and we plan to add another rig in the fourth quarter of 2015. We recently brought online our first Woodford well of 2015, with very good initial results. The Truman 28-6-6 #1H, a 16-stage 4,400 foot lateral, tested at a peak rate of 392 barrels of oil and 6.9 million cubic feet of gas per day on a 20\/64-inch choke. We plan to complete at least three more Woodford wells this year, including a two-well pad that is waiting on completion and another well which is currently drilling.","In Canada, we had very little drilling and completion activity during the quarter. However, our production declined less than expected due to minimal weather-related downtime. The next significant activity scheduled is the completion of our seven-well Duvernay pad in the fourth quarter of this year.","Turning to our international operations. In Egypt, Apache's continued exploration and development success is driving better-than-expected production volumes year-to-date. As noted in our press release, we experienced positive results during the quarter at our Ptah and Berenice oil fields in the Faghur Basin. We now have nine wells online at these new fields producing a combined gross rate of more than 23,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.","During the second quarter, the Ptah-5X exploration well appraised the northeast flank of the Ptah field and is flowing at a restricted rate of 3,000 barrels of oil per day. We also drilled and completed our first development well, which flowed at a 30-day average IP rate of more than 3,000 barrels of oil per day. Apache has five wells drilled in the Ptah field, all of which are currently producing.","In the Berenice field, Apache drilled an additional development well during the quarter that logged 93 feet of pay and is now online. This marks the fifth well drilled to-date in the Berenice field, four of which are currently producing. Our current 2P reserve estimate for the Ptah and Berenice fields is approximately 50 million barrels, which we believe will require a total of 20 wells to 25 wells to fully develop. During the quarter, Apache achieved an exploration success rate in Egypt of 78%, which is significantly above the company's historical average.","In the North Sea, two seasonal platform maintenance turnarounds reduced output by approximately 3,300 barrels of oil equivalent per day, but production still exceeded our internal plan. We anticipate a strong second half of the year, which has minimal scheduled maintenance downtime. As a result, we now project that pro forma North Sea production will be flat year-over-year, compared to our previous expectation of down slightly.","In the Beryl field area, we made a significant exploration discovery with the 9\/19 B\/K well, which we refer to as the K prospect. The well encountered 235 feet of net pay in two Jurassic-age sandstone reservoirs. Apache's pre-drill mean unrisked reserve estimate for the K prospect was approximately 7 million barrels of oil equivalent and, given our initial test results, we believe recoverable reserves are likely to significantly exceed this estimate. The field will be developed as a subsea tie-back into existing infrastructure.","The K prospect well was our first exploration well and only our tenth well drilled in the Beryl area since acquiring the field in 2011. We look forward to demonstrating the future reserve and production growth potential at Beryl. Also in the Beryl area, Apache brought its first subsea development well on production at the Nevis Central field. The S67 well encountered 114 feet of net pay and achieved an initial production rate of approximately 11,500 barrels of oil equivalent per day.","Egypt and the North Sea continued to provide excellent diversification to the Apache portfolio and reduced the overall volatility of our cash flow profile in this low oil price environment. Returns at $50 oil in these regions are very economic. And we plan to provide more detail around the portfolio depth and quality of these two businesses in the future.","At the beginning of 2015, we established a conservative budget that assumed a $50 WTI and $53 Brent oil prices. Although prices came in above these levels in the first half of the year, the recent retreat in oil prices underscores the importance of our conservative budget and capital spending approach.","As we enter the back half of 2015, Apache is achieving efficiency gains and cost reductions that are enabling us to increase our planned drilling and completion activities. In North America, we are now planning to run an average of 16 rigs in the second half of the year, 13 rigs of which will be in the Permian Basin, one will be in the Eagle Ford, and two will be drilling in the Woodford\/SCOOP play. We now expect to reach total depth on approximately 40 wells to 50 more wells than our original 2015 plan, and to complete approximately 30 wells to 35 more wells than originally planned.","Internationally, we plan to average 17 rigs in the second half of the year, which is down slightly from second quarter levels. However, we plan to complete approximately 15 wells to 20 more wells than previously planned, most of which are in Egypt. This incremental activity will positively impact our production trajectory as we enter 2016, while having only a minimal impact on our full-year 2015 production volumes.","In conjunction with this activity increase, we are tightening our capital expenditure guidance range to between $3.6 billion and $3.9 billion. Apache is staying within our dramatically reduced capital spending budget, while at the same time exceeding our production goals for the year. Our strategy in this low oil and gas price environment is to continue working on our cost structure, continue investing in acreage and 3D seismic, and continue key play delineation and target testing such that when it is time to ramp up our drilling program, we will be doing so in the most efficient manner possible, which will maximize program rates of return and net present value.","To sum up, we made very good progress in the second quarter. We completed our major asset sales and put our balance sheet in excellent shape. We reduced our drilling and completion program to levels that are appropriately aligned with the current commodity price environment. We realigned our regional operation structure to drive greater efficiency and technical collaboration. We made significant reductions in our run rate G&A and overhead costs. And we delivered strong production both domestically and internationally, which resulted in an increase to our 2015 guidance.","And with that, I would like to turn the call over to Steve Riney.","Stephen J. Riney - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, John, and good afternoon. As John said, we had a very good first half 2015 and we are very well positioned, even if the current low oil price environment persists. I would like to take some time to highlight the financial positioning of Apache and what we have accomplished in terms of driving down our cost structure consistent with the current price environment, utilizing divestment proceeds to reduce debt and to improve near-term liquidity, extending our credit facility to ensure liquidity through to June 2020, and aggressively adjusting our activity level to live within our means on an ongoing cash flow basis.","But first, let me highlight the second quarter financial results. As noted in this morning's press release, Apache reported a GAAP loss of $5.6 billion or $14.83 per common share. This includes after-tax charges for a ceiling-test impairment of $3.7 billion, as well as $1.9 billion of other items, mostly after-tax losses and tax expense associated with the company's assets sold during the quarter. Our earnings for the quarter adjusted for these items were $82 million or $0.22 per share.","As in the prior two quarters, we experienced a ceiling-test impairment in second quarter resulting from the continuing low price environment. Under full cost accounting, our upstream assets are carried at historical costs. Each quarter we compare this cost basis to a PV-10 value, calculated using trailing 12-month average oil and gas prices, held flat into perpetuity. To the extent the net book value exceeds the PV-10 valuation, the result is a ceiling-test write-down. We expect further ceiling-test impairments in the second half of 2015.","As outlined in more detail in our 10-Q, based on June 30, 2015 forward strip prices. For the remainder of this year, we would expect to incur an additional $3.5 billion post-tax impairment. One notable impact of the ceiling-test impairments on our financial results going forward will be a reduction to our unit DD&A rate. For example, our DD&A per BOE during the second quarter was 20% lower than it otherwise would have been as a result of impairments taken in 4Q 2014 and 1Q 2015. Forward-looking impacts are uncertain as they will depend on many factors beyond just ongoing impairments.","Let me now turn to costs. The following oil price environment and subsequent activity reduction across the industry has resulted in significant downward pressure on service costs, and we are generally seeing lower trends in most major cost categories. More specifically for Apache, much of the improvement in our cost structure is being driven by our belief that we should prepare ourselves for an extended period of lower prices. Accordingly, we have put considerable effort into poring over every aspect of our cost structure. Since the end of 2014, we have reduced head count by approximately 20%, consolidated certain regional offices, and streamlined the organizational structure. These actions are generating significant savings in our overhead cost structure.","The measurement of overhead costs can be complex from an accounting perspective. A good proxy for our overhead cost structure is the gross cash spend for everything above the field. At the end of 2014, these costs were running approximately $1 billion annually. The combined effect of our portfolio changes and extensive efficiency efforts across the organization will bring our current run rate to below $750 million. Our goal is to enter 2016 at a run rate around $700 million. These overhead cost show up in our financial statements in various places. On average, about 20% typically appears in lease operating expense, 45% in expensed G&A, and 35% in capitalized G&A. Thus, these savings will manifest in many different ways.","The bottom line, though, is it represents cash savings of about $300 million per year, which can now be better utilized to create shareholder value. On the lease operating expense side, our second quarter LOE was just over $9 per BOE, which is 13% lower than second quarter 2014. As John indicated, we believe in this price environment there will be continued downward pressure on all costs, and this includes lease operating expenses.","Next, I would like to make a few comments regarding our balance sheet position and liquidity. While we've certainly accomplished a lot in terms of focusing our portfolio, we have also improved our overall financial strength. In particular, we have reduced debt levels, extended our credit facilities and we are now eliminating certain nearer-term debt maturities. Our proceeds from divestments enabled us to pay off $2.7 billion of short-term debt in the second quarter. We ended the quarter with long-term debt of $9.7 billion, and nearly $3 billion of cash, and have recently initiated steps to pay off $900 million of outstanding 2017 bonds. Following this, we will have no long-term debt maturing prior to 2018.","As mentioned in our 1Q call, the sale of our foreign assets and the repatriation of the proceeds triggered a U.S. income tax payable of $560 million. Actual cash payment of this liability will occur in the second half of 2015, so I would like to point out that our current net debt of $6.7 billion should be considered as being closer to $7.3 billion. As of June 30, 2015, Apache held access to an undrawn commercial paper program backed by our $3.5 billion credit facility, which was recently extended through to June 2020. Combined with our current cash position and the maturity profile of our long-term debt, our liquidity is in very good shape.","Having established this position, we are also working hard to protect it. As John has indicated many times, we are aggressively working to live within our means on a cash-flow basis. Obviously that was a difficult task for the first half of the year as prices declined rapidly and activity took time to ramp down. John spoke previously about our activity level for the second half of 2015. We are positioning our second half exploration and development activity at a pace that, if continued, would target cash flow neutrality for 2016. Our goal has been and continues to be to live within our means on a cash-flow basis. We have taken significant actions to achieve this and it has proven to be the prudent course.","However, we want to balance these efforts with continued investment in an inventory of high quality opportunities that still work in this price environment. We have made great strides to position the company to be successful in a low-commodity-price environment. We knew that if we could be successful at $50 oil, we would certainly be successful at higher prices. The company is in a solid foundation with a healthy balance sheet, substantial liquidity and improving cost structure commensurate with the price environment, and a capital activity plan to live within our means as we enter 2016.","We will remain opportunistic, but highly disciplined in the manner that we allocate capital in this challenging environment. I look forward to a successful second half of the year. And we'll now turn the call over to the operator for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from the line of Dave Tameron of Wells Fargo.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi. Congrats on a good quarter. John, how do you think about the price level here when you're at $45, versus $50, versus $40? And at what level would you see yourselves going the other way and pulling back a little bit?","John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, Dave, I mean, I think the first thing is we took a more conservative approach earlier in the year when we kind of carved out a $50 budget back in February. So it's put us in a position where we've been counting the \u2013 trying to get our heads around what $50 means and working hard on our cost structure. You know, I think clearly with the \u2013 when you look at the activity increase, while we're adding back three rigs in North America, it's really going to be just one rig increase over what we ran in the second quarter. So we're trying to kind of streamline our activity with where we envision things would be in that price range, as you mentioned.","I think the good news is we've got flexibility and as we're working on our plans for 2016 right now, we'll work on it even harder, but we've got flexibility to move up or down from this point. So the first thing was, was to kind of synchronize to this price environment and we'll maintain flexibility that we could ratchet down or ratchet up a little bit if necessary.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And then just as a follow-up circling back to 2016, you mentioned within cash flow, you could show some, I think you said modest growth or you keep your production level, I guess, where it's at. Are you assuming the current strip? And then kind of, what framework, what metrics should we think about for 2016? Is it going to be within cash flow? Is that the driver there? Can you just talk more about that?","John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, I think that first of all, we've got a deep inventory, projects that work at low prices, so we feel good about the inventory. I think the key is, we do and we've said from the get-go this year we had a heavy outspend Q1. I think we did an excellent job of getting in line in Q2. So as we start to think about 2016, we do want to be in line within cash flow and kind of living within our means. We're working through our planning process right now in great detail, and as that becomes a little bit more clear and we think about it, as we work through it, we'll be able to give a little bit more color on the next call.","But in general, I think the important thing is, we've proven what we can do this year on a much lower decreased CapEx budget. We've proven that our costs \u2013 our dollars are going further. And I think with the initiatives we have and the way the cost structure, the G&A, we're going to be able to do more with even less capital in 2016 if necessary.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","All right. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Leo Mariani of RBC.","Leo Mariani - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey, guys. Just, I wanted to see if I can get some comments on the current kind of M&A market. I know you guys had talked previously in the year about trying to grab more acreage and looking at acquisition opportunities.","John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Leo, two things. Number one, I think when you look at the acreage market out there, there's stuff off the beaten path that I think we'd be interested in. And we don't budget for that, but we're clearly always looking for things that work in low price environment. I think when you step back and look at the bigger picture M&A market right now, some of the price decks that have been used to justify some of those transactions I think have been relatively high. And I think if you go back to our portfolio, at $80 we've got a lot of inventory that works. And so from my standpoint, we would look at things incrementally.","The good news is we've taken the steps to put our balance sheet in great shape, so we've got capacity, we've got a credit facility in place and we've aligned our cost structure and our activity levels to current so we've got lots of flexibility. And I think the key is, is we've got a good portfolio and it would have to be something that made sense incrementally to what we have in terms of what we could add. So I think in general, the market's been a little pricey. These last transactions have been using a higher deck than I think what's bearing out right now.","Leo Mariani - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. And I guess just thinking about your most resilient assets and where you have the deeper inventory in the low oil price environment here, should we continue to think Egypt and Permian get the lion's share of capital as you work your way into 2016?","John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","As we look at the back half of the year, we'll run approximately 16 rigs in North America. 13 rigs of those will be in the Permian. We'll have five in the Delaware, like we maintained all year. You'll have the other eight in our Midland Basin and Central Basin Platform\/Northwest Shelf. You'll see us sprinkle a few more rigs into the Midland Basin second half of the year. You'll also see one rigs to two rigs from us in the Woodford, which is working quite well in the low price environment. And with the results that we mentioned on our Walker wells in the Eagle Ford, we're pretty excited about that as well. So when I look at North America, you'll see most of the work being in the Permian.","Internationally, quite frankly, both Egypt and the North Sea compete very well and have great rates of return in terms of those projects. So we've scaled back there this year like we did in all the other areas, but we've got good inventory there. Look at what we're doing with Ptah and Berenice. I mean, we've now got 10 wells on, producing more than 23,000 barrels a day and that's constrained with facilities, there's room for that number to go higher and it's going higher as we speak. So I think we've got a lot of inventory at low prices that's going to keep us busy for a long time.","Leo Mariani - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Brian Singer of Goldman Sachs.","Brian A. Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. Good afternoon. I wanted to focus on the Eagle Ford that you've spoken in the past about, some geologic complexities in this part of the Eagle Ford. With the results that you're reporting in Area A, do you feel like you've cracked a code there? Is there a code to be cracked? Can you talk to the well costs and where this play stands and ranks relative to some of your other opportunities?","John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, Brian. I mean, it is a little more complex. You've got, as I've mentioned in the past, your geologic setting is critical as well as your fluid. I mean, you've got everything from a dry gas to a black oil. You've got a wet gas, a volatile oil in there. There is higher clay content. It's a little thinner. So I think one of the key areas we have been able to make some progress on our completion procedures. And the latest four wells we brought on, the two Walkers and the two Raes, I think if you look at the two Walker wells, those wells in a little over three months have produced 83,000 barrels and 80,000 barrels of just oil alone.","So we're pretty excited about those results. Well costs are in the low $7 million range and we feel really good about the economics. So, I mean, I think we've definitely made some progress. We're still working spacing. We will put a rig back to work there and continue to highlight the fairway there. But a big breakthrough for us technically on the fracking side.","Brian A. Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thanks. And then I wanted to shift to the Midland Basin and the Wildfire area in Midland County is an area you reported some good results. Can you talk about the running room there at Wildfire? And then if we look outside Barnhart at your Midland position, is this the area that has the greatest running room that you're most excited about, or would you highlight other parts of the portfolio within the Midland Basin?","John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","If you go back, the best place to go back and look at our portfolio there would be our November 20 update. We kind of circled the four counties. We showed around 200,000 acres as I recall. In addition to Wildfire, we've got our Powell-Miller area, we've got our Azalea area. We've got a lot of running room in there. We've really just had a rig or two working. So we're very encouraged. It's an area we've got room to add. If you go back to our November update, we were planning to run eight to ten rigs. We'll probably have two to four or five rigs in there roughly this back half of this year. So we've got a lot of running room and we're very encouraged by the results.","We're also taking a pretty measured approach on our flow backs. We've been experimenting with the frac procedures. We've taken some of those up to 3,000 pounds per foot. So we're making headway in there and feel good about the inventory.","Brian A. Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of John Freeman of Raymond James.","John A. Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Good afternoon. Just some questions on the backlog that you all laid out. You said at the end of the year you'd have roughly 80 to 100 drilled uncompleted wells. I think you ended last year around 200 wells. And I'm just trying to get a sense, would you consider kind of a normal backlog at somewhere around two wells to three wells per rig?","John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","That would be a little high. What we'd say a normal backlog. You know, when we were blowing and going, we were down to maybe 1.5 wells per rig. Some of the pads, you'll get a few more. If you go back to, we actually came into 2015 with 216 wells in backlog, and I think about 45 wells of those were verticals.","So when you look at our horizontal backlog, it was in the 160 to 170 range. I think the number was 166 wells. We've kind of guided to 80 to 100. And that number may creep up, but we feel good about that range. So it's going to be a little higher, and that's just a function of still keeping an eye on prices and keeping a handle on our CapEx spend in this low price environment.","John A. Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. And then just my one follow up along those same lines. I was a little surprised in the Permian that uncompleted backlog on the horizontal wells, it basically stayed flat despite going from 15 rigs to 10 rigs. Is there anything unusual that maybe caused that?","John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","No, when we backed off for the first part of the year, the completion costs hadn't come down yet. And right now we've currently got two frac crews in the northern portion of that and we've got two in the south, and we're just going at it very methodically. And so there's clearly room to accelerate, but we don't see any reason. And obviously in hindsight, with this recent drop in prices, we've been prudent not to do that.","John A. Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Great. Thanks, John. Good quarter.","John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Herrlin of Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale.","John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC","Yeah, hey, John. In your ops report regarding the Delaware, you talked about doing different completions at Pecos Bend and Waha to eliminate water. What are you doing and how much could that save you on a cost basis going forward?","John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, John, one of the things that's not talked about a lot, we hear about the oil rates, we hear about the gas rates in the Delaware, we don't get a lot from other companies on the water rates. These wells are high pressure. The Delaware is characterized by very high pressure and you will get some very, very high water rates.","And so we've been going in and really understanding our geology, using our 3D seismic, trying to understand how we want to complete these and buffer around areas where we can eliminate some of the water production. If we can take those water cuts down just a few percentage points, it makes a big difference, one on your cost, your LOE, because you're having to handle the water, not to mention your ultimate recoveries and that sort of thing. So we're trying to move the needle and produce these wells at higher ultimate oil cuts, and we're really trying to understand the geologic system and the framework to how to complete them.","John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC","Great. Then in terms of restructuring your organization, where are your technical operational centers is based? I mean, you have one obviously in San Antonio, but where else?","John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, we've got an unconventional center in San Antonio. We've got our regions now. We've maintained a really three super regions as we have called them. Permian we have a big presence out there, which is handling our Midland Basin and Central Basin Platform\/North West Shelf, our San Antonio has our Delaware Basin and our unconventional technology center. In the Houston region now, we've consolidated by closing Tulsa and collapsed our central region properties in with our Gulf Coast and actually Canada now reports into that.","And we also have a technology center here in Houston that does a lot of support around the world on kind of our EP technology. So not to mention our Corporate Reservoir Engineering Group here, our enhanced recovery, and some other things. So really Houston, San Antonio, and then our regional offices. And then our international, we still maintain our presence in Cairo for Egypt and Aberdeen for the North Sea.","John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC","Great. Thanks.","John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate of Bank of America.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, John.","John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hi, Doug.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","We'll go with something more exotic than normal, but that's fine. A couple questions, if I may. First of all, if I could jump back to the Eagle Ford, the wells results continue to be pretty strong there. I just wonder if you could help us understand the relative attractiveness of pulling wells or pulling rigs out of the Eagle Ford in favor of some of the other areas as opposed to continuing with Eagle Ford activity. And in your answer maybe you could hit the HBP question as well, if you've got any issues there. And I've got a follow-up, please.","John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, I mean I think the important thing there is we had to really focus in on the completion procedures and the geologic settings. And so actually backing down those rigs was a blessing for us. It's let us really spend some time. We've had a frac crew out there and we've done some work, and like I said, the last four wells we reported, we've made some significant progress in understanding the complexities geologically and what's going on in the Eagle Ford.","When we start to look at the numbers today, it competes extremely well, which is why we're going to put a rig back in there. But we have got Woodford that competes very well as well as Permian, as well as some of our other areas. So we've got a deep inventory and a lot of areas competing for capital. And we're glad to be able to put it back to work in the Eagle Ford.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Are there any HBP issues in the Eagle Ford, John, that we should be aware of?","John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I would say the acreage that we want HBP, will have HBP. So clearly the fair way there is we're understanding that. I mentioned that it is not a blanket fluid system, and so it's important to understand your system. But the acreage, we're not worried about losing acreage that we'd want to hang onto.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thank you. My follow up is on (43:43).","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Pearce Hammond of Simmons & Company.","Pearce Wheless Hammond - Simmons & Company International","Good afternoon, John. Thank you for taking my questions.","John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","You're welcome, Pearce.","Pearce Wheless Hammond - Simmons & Company International","The first question is looking at your portfolio, I know this is hard to answer, but what do you think your base decline percentage is as kind of a whole company? And what do you think the maintenance CapEx is for the company to keep production flat?","John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, I mean, if you look at our overall portfolio decline, we're in the 25% range. I mean, we highlighted in my prepared remarks today our Permian is around 22%. It's helped by our Central Basin Platform\/North West Shelf. We're working through our planning process right now. And the one thing I would say is that if you look at 2015 relative to 2014, we now are going to show growth in North America on a significantly reduced CapEx program, but we're not in a position to give you guidance in terms of what would be \"maintenance\" in terms of \u2013 if you're asking maintaining flat production or that sort of thing.","Pearce Wheless Hammond - Simmons & Company International","Okay. Thank you. And then my follow-up: service costs, you've done a great job of bringing those down. Looking at the Ford strip, it sounds like your expectation as service costs move lower, but a lot of the service companies right now negative cash margin. Do you think that service costs continuing to come down is realistic at this point?","John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, I mean, I think there's two things. Number one, we were probably the earliest out there on the service side, and if you look at our savings today to the 25%, there's probably more than half of that is operational things and logistics and things we've done to get better. My conversations with the service companies have moved to, this has never been about margin, we're just asking them, they've got to make the margin to have a healthy business.","It's been, though, we've got to sit down and figure out how to work together and how they get smarter, and how we can take costs out of the system that don't need to be passed through. So bottom-line on, it is in a low price environment, it doesn't matter if you're operating at negative margin, you're going to have to find a way to get more creative and get your cost structure down. And I think it's a matter of us rolling up our sleeves, working with them, and finding creative ways to take costs out of the system, which is what we do and that's what's we'll \u2013 that's what's happening right now across the industry, and that's what we'll continue to do in the future.","I mean, when you look at the numbers second quarter, the market had pretty well baked in recovery into the mid-$60s on oil price back half of the year. And clearly that's not \u2013 it doesn't look like that's the case, and so as a result, the cost side's going to have to come down and we're going to have to work together and get in the trenches and figure out how to lower them.","Pearce Wheless Hammond - Simmons & Company International","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Bob Brackett of Sanford Bernstein.","Bob A. Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Yeah, a question on your realizations in the international assets. North Sea and Egypt looked pretty strong. Is that a seasonal effect, or what's driving that?","John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, I don't know if Steve, wants to add something. I think it's just a function of having Brent pricing and predominantly oil-driven revenues. And Tom Voytovich has another comment too.","Thomas E. Voytovich - EVP-International & Offshore Region","We get a pretty good gas price in the North Sea too, and our gas rates are up this year, so that's contributing to it as well.","Bob A. Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. Great. And another would be, what's your exit rate for December 31 of this year? Do you have a sense of what that might be?","John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, what we said is, if you look at our fourth quarter, December's going to be our highest month. So we're not in a position to give that number at this point. If you take our North American guidance, we gave numbers in terms of we got actuals first quarter, second quarter, 307,000 BOEs, 317,000 BOEs, gets you to 312,000 BOEs for the first half average. Our midpoint of our guidance range would be 307,000 BOE for the year, which means you average 302,000 BOE the back half. We've said third quarter is going to be under that and fourth quarter we're going to see a nice rebound, so and I think there's room in those numbers. So with that, it's about all I'll say at this point. And we guided to kind of 164,000 BOE to 168,000 BOE on our international. And it's going to be probably relatively flat.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Hall of Heikkinen Energy.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","Thanks. Good morning. I guess I wanted to follow-up a little bit on your comment about keeping production relatively stable within cash flow for 2016. Is that intended to mean stable year-on-year 2015 \u2013 or 2016 versus 2015, or stable from the exit rate in 2015?","John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I mean that clearly we're not giving full color. I think what we've looked at and if you look at how we've been able to stretch capital this year, with where our cost structures are and the quality of our inventory, we feel like we can be relatively stable, and it would be more year-over-year. But we'll come out with something more definitive at the appropriate time.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","Okay. Great. And then as a follow-up, you've done some great jobs on the overhead cost reductions. I appreciate all that extra granularity. Just curious, as you guys are looking at 2016 and beyond, you had a much larger rig count obviously, and activity level in 2015 \u2013 or sorry, 2014. What sort of activity level are you gearing the company for, or sizing the company for from an overhead perspective? I don't know if you put that in terms of rigs or what, but I'm just kind of trying to think through if there are more overhead reductions to come in 2016, or is it kind of already been done, and at what sort of activity level can it support?","John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, we've been gearing our cost structure to a $50 price environment. The thing I would say though is, with the efficiencies and things we're doing today, it will not take the number of rigs in the future in a higher price environment, so I mean, I think we've got \u2013 we've set this thing up to where it's kind of an accordion that can take on a lot more activity, but we tried to gear it towards the low price environment because what I can't do is be wasting dollars in terms of G&A that I should be putting in the ground that can be generating results.","And so we've tried to get real frugal on where we need to be, and then in typical Apache fashion, we feel pretty good. We've got a footprint in place that will expand fairly significantly because I think what we've done this year has been really healthy. We needed \u2013 as Apache and quite frankly as an industry \u2013 to look at our overall cost structure, even in a high-price environment. And we feel real good about where we are and how we've geared it and that we're definitely prepared for lower prices.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Charles Meade of Johnson Rice.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Yes. Good afternoon, John, to you, and your team there. If I could go back to a question that you touched on before, in your operations report, you mentioned that you had 70 horizontal wells in the Permian drilled and completed here at mid-year. Does that \u2013 how does that interact? Or how does that drilled and completed count progress as we go through the back half of the year? I guess what I'm really after is, are you really planning on working that down in late 3Q, early 4Q. And that's why we're going to see the bump-up?","John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I'm going to let Tim Sullivan, who I have not let him handle a question yet. But I'll let Tim, jump in and talk through those numbers a little bit for you.","Timothy J. Sullivan - Senior Vice President-Operations Support","Okay. For the Permian Basin, for our drilled and uncompleted wells, we're at about 40 right now. And as we work through the back half of the year and with our rig activity, we're going to exit the year at down to about 25 to 30 throughout the year, at the end of the year.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Got it. And you said you're 40 \u2013 you're at 40 right now, you said?","Timothy J. Sullivan - Senior Vice President-Operations Support","In the Permian Basin...","John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","About 45. We're at 45.","Timothy J. Sullivan - Senior Vice President-Operations Support","We're at 45, right now.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Okay. Got it. All right. Thank you for that, Tim. And then if I could go back to some of Steve's comments...","John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Let me back up there. We're at, like, 70 right now. We'll end the year at about 45 with total Permian.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Got it. And so that includes \u2013 when you say total Permian, that's vertical and horizontal? Or what's the distinction there?","John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Okay. Okay.","John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","43 \u2013 it's going to be 50. We're roughly \u2013 we're projecting about 52, if you add verticals and horizontals for combined Permian.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you. Thank you, John. And then shifting over to more of balance sheet philosophy sort of question, and this might be for Steve, Steve, I appreciate you giving us the forecast of what's going to happen with the balance sheet here in the back half of the year, and I know that all of you guys there have worked really hard to put the balance sheet in the good shape it's in right now. But philosophically as you \u2013 you talked about \u2013 you're working on a \u2013 you're working in a $50 world, philosophically, what kind of constraints do you want to keep on your balance sheet, whether it's in terms of debt-to-EBITDA or some other relevant metric? And what are the circumstances that you'd have to see that would make either one lever up? Or use your balance sheet for a transaction?","Stephen J. Riney - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, Charles. I think at this point and in this environment as of today, I think that the balance sheet in the shape that we've got it right now is probably pretty good. And I'd prefer \u2013 my philosophy would be, at this point in time we just keep it where it is. We may look at paying down some further debt. We'll look at that as we go through the second half, look at what the price environment is doing. And we get a really solid view of 2016 as we round out the planning. But right now I think the best thing to do is for us to sit on the balance sheet that we have. It's a good strong one.","It's highly liquid and it's one that would allow us to be opportunistic if we felt like the compelling opportunity came along. I think John hit the nail on the head a few minutes ago, and that is that the opportunities that we've seen and we've seen some other people jump at, we wouldn't have put those under the column called, compelling, at this point in time. And it's just not something that we would be willing to sacrifice the balance sheet for in any material way.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Mike Kelly of Global Hunter Securities.","Michael Kelly, CFA - Global Hunter Securities","Hi, guys. I was hoping you could maybe give us a bit of a preview of what's to come with this capital allocation review that you're going to unveil next quarter. And I'm really trying to get a sense of whether we should expect potential major strategy shift with this, the portfolio get shaken up quite a bit? Or is this more modest alterations around the edges? Thanks.","John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, I would say in general, if you look at where we are today, you look at the rig count we're running and you look at the price environment, I don't have a crystal ball out there what's going to look like in a couple of months, but it's probably pretty similar, I mean we've done a good job this year. We're really drilling the things we want to drill. We don't have an area where we are in what I'd call development mode, with the exception of maybe our Ptah and Berenice area in Egypt. So as you start to think about going forward, I think capital is going to go to the best places, but we've got it in those projects that are working the best right now.","And as you think about the incremental capital back half of the year, we're putting a little bit back to work in the Eagle Ford. We're putting a little bit back to work in the Woodford and obviously in the Permian in conjunction with our international.","Michael Kelly, CFA - Global Hunter Securities","Okay. Great. If I go over to the Permian and the Delaware. It was good to hear that the Delaware well cost down 35%. If you go back to that November 20 presentation, you guys had 100% IRRs out there but a much higher oil price. Just wondering if you could talk about kind of mark-to-market today, lower costs, lower oil price, what project return you could be looking at right now? And then just the scale of the inventory there, the opportunity set that's really core Delaware. Thanks.","John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I'll let Tim Sullivan jump in on this one.","Timothy J. Sullivan - Senior Vice President-Operations Support","Yeah, with the well costs we're seeing out there, about $5.8 million. And the IPs that we're currently seeing, we're well above our type curves. And even at the $50 oil price, we're seeing above 40% rate of returns out of the Pecos Bend area.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of James Sullivan of Alembic Global Advisors.","James Sullivan - Alembic Global Advisors LLC","Hey, guys. Good afternoon. Just sticking with the Permian for a second. There was a comment in the prepared remarks about a second landing zone in the third Bone Spring. Is that an option for stack development? And can you speak to how prevalent that appears to be? It may be early days on it, but any detail you might have.","John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Right now we're looking at them as individual zones, just another well that can be drilled from the pads. And the good news is we've got a full pad in and they're pretty compelling. And we're not in communication. And the second zone is performing really in line with the primary zone.","James Sullivan - Alembic Global Advisors LLC","Okay. Sounds great. So just maybe pulling back a little bit on the question of science work. And I did notice you guys pulled the rig out of Canyon. That might have been part of the plan that you guys were working on. But just in terms of high-grading the portfolio, how do you guys manage the balance between trying to allocate capital to areas that are going to be sure bets in terms of delivering program rate of return cash flows and doing more experimental work like in the Canyon and elsewhere, where you've got stuff you don't know yet and maybe costs that needs to come down, just philosophically?","John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, you've got to look at the areas where you think you've got the most impact or running room. And the real driver is you can't lower costs if you don't put a rig in there. And a lot of what we're doing this year is strategic testing, like the second landing zone in the third Bone Spring. We've just got to look at those and see how they stack up and see how many and then we'll go to work on that.","But very few places right now in North America are we parking rigs on pads and trying to develop things. I think it's a function of right now setting up opportunities and really continuing to line our cost structure and get our returns at the levels we want before we'd go back to work with major development programs.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Edward Westlake of Credit Suisse.","Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thanks for squeezing me in at the top of the hour here. Just on the last comment you made about getting into development mode. No one has focused on this today, but say the oil price does go back up to the sort of $65 range that I think you referenced on the last call for some of the plays. How aggressive could you be in terms of the number of rigs that you could add over the next two years to three years? That's my first question and I have a quick follow-up.","John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, in terms of the number of rigs, I think we could add as many as we wanted to. We were running 93 last fall. So that's not hard. It will all come down to cash flow and economics and where's the cost structure. So what will be the driver \u2013 and we've been real consistent on that theme all year, is it takes the cash flow from our operations to be able to drive our programs. Over the long haul, we can go to the balance sheet from time to time if we felt like there was an opportunity. But in general, we want to be balanced and living within our means. And so it will be a function of the cash flow that we have to reinvest versus what other opportunities are out there.","Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","And then follow on is on the international CapEx. I mean, it's still running something like $650 million in Egypt on an annual basis, if I just annualize your first half and $800 million in the North Sea. Any opportunity to get some deflation or activity cycling as you go forward to get some savings there in the CapEx program?","John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","We are seeing savings there. The one thing in Egypt, you really never had the run up from 2009 on the rigs that you had in the service side in North America. So dollars go further, which is why we've been running a number of rigs in Egypt.","When you look at the North Sea, we've had a lot of success. The one thing we haven't talked about is we sanctioned a project that's pretty critical to us. It's Aviat. It's a $200 million project over two years. It's in the numbers now this year. We're going to spend about $100 million. But the big deal on that is we're going to convert the field to field gas from diesel. And it's a very economic project, it makes great rate of return.","But the big deal is is it's going to be safer, it's going to be environmentally friendly and it's going to give us field gas supply where we're not having to bunker diesel to well into a 2030 timeframe. So it's an important project. It's about $100 million. That's part of what's in that North Sea number this year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Rowe of Tudor, Pickering, Holt.","Michael J. Rowe - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Yes. Good afternoon. You mentioned earlier a balanced CapEx program. Do you think the capital spent on North America onshore versus international offshore this year, which is roughly 60\/40, is that balanced enough? And does that really change depending on what part of the commodity cycle we're in?","John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, clearly we look at the opportunities, we look at the running room and we look at the economics of the projects. And the good news is we've got a great inventory in general. The international portfolio is less sensitive to the drop in prices, so it's a little more buffered on the returns. And then on the North America side, you can generate in some areas a little bit more NPV. So it's a balanced approach. We like where our mix is right now. We're generating cash, cash out of both Egypt and the North Sea. And that's kind of directionally where we want to stay. But right now we like that mix, and think it's serving us very well.","Michael J. Rowe - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Okay. And then just a quick question on the Mid-continent program. You're spending some capital in the Woodford\/SCOOP area, but not much in the context of the whole portfolio. So I was just wondering if you can comment on the 50,000 net acres you've got there today, and just maybe provide some context around how sustainable you think that is for a company of Apache's size. Thanks.","John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, number one it's, we've got about 50,000 net acres that's predominantly Grady County. We've got a rig in there, we're going to put another one in, the economics work very well. Yeah, it's material, and it's material to that portion of our portfolio. Most of the acreage has been purchased in there, but we've got some nice positions that are clearly very economic at low prices, and clearly, we've got a lot of running room to develop on that acreage position. So it's not something we're looking to scale up necessarily, just because most of it has already been gotten, but we've got really economic projects in there and it can make an impact.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate of Bank of America.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I just wanted to hear it one more time. Sorry. Guys, I had a follow-up that I don't think \u2013 I think that your operator thought that my follow-up was a clarification point. Anyway, Egypt, John. Obviously at the beginning of the year, you decided that this was going to be a core part of the portfolio. So I'm just kind of trying to understand this step-up in exploration activities. Is that something that has been a deliberate change in reallocating capital? I'm thinking with the PSC, you get the money back fairly quickly. And if so, what is the exploration or drilling backlog look like for Egypt on the go-forward plan?","John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, Doug, it's really more driven off of technology. I mean, we've got the seismic 3D interpretations and so forth. Our success rate, we're drilling fewer wells than we drilled last year, but we announced a 78% success rate and it's really just a function of the quality, the technical work we're undoing in unlocking the basin, and a lot of these stratigraphic areas and traps with the 3D seismic, we're just getting better, and we've got a better handle on the system.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And so is Egypt cash flow positive in the current environment?","John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Absolutely.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great stuff. Thanks very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Richard Tullis of Capital One Securities.","Richard M. Tullis - Capital One Securities, Inc.","Hi. Thanks. Good afternoon, John. Quick question: looking at the Delaware Basin, I noticed the Bone Spring completions during the second quarter. While it's solid, it looked to be a little bit lower in oil cut and productivity per lateral foot than those Condor wells that you reported in the first quarter. Anything done differently drilling those Condor wells, or was it just a particularly sweet spot?","John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, I mean, I think it's going to be spacing and just the area that you're in within that Bone Spring. They're completed very similarly. So it's just a function of the area where you are.","Richard M. Tullis - Capital One Securities, Inc.","And how much acreage does Apache have in that Pecos Bend area?","John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Pecos Bend is actually pretty small. I mean, you'd have to go back and look at our ops report. I think we're in the 7,000 acres to 8,000 acres in there. It's not a very big area, but it shows you how many landing zones we've got in a really nice little development area right there.","Richard M. Tullis - Capital One Securities, Inc.","All right. That's it for me. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question and our last question, I should say, comes from the line of Jeffrey Campbell of Tuohy Brothers.","Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Good afternoon. My fist question is just broadly looking throughout the various plays, your Permian 30 day rates look pretty strong. I was just wondering, are you practicing any rate restriction in any of the portions of the Permian?","John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Actually, Jeff, we are. I mean, we have gone to some managed chokes and we're doing some things there right now that are helping us. And we have also been very focused on our completions and sand concentrations and so forth.","Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thank you. And then kind of taking Tom's remarks about the UK gas market in mind, the high rate S67 well, is that predominantly a nat-gas well and does it de-risk other potential similar locations?","John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Tom?","Thomas E. Voytovich - EVP-International & Offshore Region","Indeed it does. It is a high rate gas well. In fact it's making about $50 million a day right now which is at the gas price we're getting, that's pretty much parity with oil right now on a BOE basis. There are other opportunities out there. We're just now getting started with our exploitation and exploration program of the recent 3D seismic, but there are more opportunities just like this in the field pays. These are individual fault blocks that were heretofore unseen or untouched at least.","Operator","And there are no further questions in the queue.","Gary T.

In the first quarter, Apache delivered solid operational results, strong financial performance, and notable drilling outcomes, all of which were supported by our relentless focus on continuous improvement and cost reductions.","Today I would like to start with a brief recap of first quarter results, and an update to Apaches 2016 production guidance. I will then provide an operational overview with particular emphasis on some of the exceptional well-cost reductions we are achieving at our key North American onshore plays. I will conclude with thoughts on our current activity level and the potential for increasing capital investment in the near future.","As noted in this morning's press release, companywide, pro forma production of 479,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day was at the high end of our quarterly guidance range of 470,000 BOEs to 480,000 BOEs per day. Outperformance came primarily from North America onshore, which produced 298,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day and exceeded our 290,000 to 295,000 BOE per day guidance range. Each of Apache's North American operating areas performed well, despite a significant reduction in capital.","The Permian in particular delivered robust results with strong performance from the underlying base, coupled with solid contributions from both newly drilled wells and base maintenance projects. In light of first quarter production strength, we are raising our full-year 2016 North American onshore guidance range by 5,000 BOEs per day, to 268,000 BOEs to 278,000 BOEs per day.","On the international and offshore side, pro forma production was 180,000 BOEs per day, which was at the low end of our guidance range of 180,000 BOEs to 185,000 BOEs per day. This is primarily attributable to unplanned third party plant and pipeline outages in the North Sea. We remain on track to achieve our full-year 2016 international and offshore guidance of 170,000 BOEs to 180,000 BOEs per day.","As we have stated previously, our 2016 North American onshore drilling program is primarily focused on strategic testing and acreage delineation to build and high-grade inventory. Nevertheless, we are continuing to see some remarkable progress on drilling efficiencies. For example, in key areas of North America, where Apache was actively drilling during the first quarter, the average drilled and completed well costs were down approximately 45%, as compared to average well costs in 2014.","On the expense side, continuing with our efforts from last year, we saw further reductions in both lease operating expenses and gross G&A.","Looking ahead, we anticipate further benefits from aligning our cost with the scale of our business and the commodity price environment. As you will recall, Apache is targeting cash flow neutrality in 2016 under our current budget, which assumes flat $35 oil and $2.35 gas.","As expected, we were not cash flow neutral in the first quarter; however, we do anticipate generating a net cash flow surplus through the remainder of the year. As such, we remain on track for unchanged or lower net debt levels at year end. Steve Riney will elaborate further on this in his prepared remarks.","With the recent improvements in strip oil prices, we are prepared to increase capital spending but will refrain until we are confident cash flows have sustainably improved relative to our 2016 plan. Although we have the financial capacity to increase capital spending today, we believe that preserving our strong financial position and our credit quality through cash flow neutrality is the best approach for our shareholders in this price environment. I will provide more color on our thinking around this in a few minutes.","Turning to our operations, in the Permian Basin, first quarter production held up well despite a significant decrease in the number of wells placed on production. We produced 171,000 BOE per day, which represents a 2% sequential decrease from the fourth quarter. In the Delaware, we placed five gross operated wells on production, primarily targeting Bone Spring formations in the Pecos Bend area. One very notable well, the Seagull 103-HR, produced an exceptional 30-day average peak rate of nearly 2,800 barrels of oil equivalent per day from a lateral length of approximately 4,600 feet. In its first 60 days of production, the Seagull 103-HR accumulated 78,000 barrels of oil, which makes it Apache's best well to date in the Delaware Basin. The success of the Seagull 103-HR is a function of our thorough understanding of the hydrocarbon system and continuous efforts to improve our results of these complex reservoirs.","Thus far, our efforts in the Pecos Bend area of the Delaware have been focused on two primary landing zones in the Third Bone Spring formation. During the first quarter, we tested a promising new landing zone within the Third Bone Spring that could significantly enhance our running room in the area. In the Midland Basin, Central Basin Platform, and Northwest Shelf, we placed 25 gross operated wells on production, which is approximately 40% fewer wells than in the fourth quarter.","During the first quarter, Apache generated good results from six Wolfcamp wells in the Powell area, two Wolfcamp completions at Wildfire, and four horizontal Yeso wells on the Northwest Shelf, all of which are summarized in our quarterly earnings supplement.","Before moving on to Egypt and the North Sea, I would like to highlight our North American well cost reduction efforts, which continue to exceed our expectations. Last quarter, I noted that we have dedicated a considerable amount of time, energy and resources toward reinvigorating Apache's strong culture of cost and returns discipline. This quarter, we are seeing some very tangible results from these initiatives which I would like to share with you. As I mentioned earlier, in key areas of North America where Apache was actively drilling, our average drilled and completed well costs were down approximately 45% in the first quarter compared to average 2014 levels. Notably in the Delaware Basin, our most recent well costs are now down approximately 60%.","Although we have made great strides throughout 2015, I am truly amazed by the ongoing positive cost trends in our North American onshore drilling program. Six quarters into the downturn, we are still achieving significant quarter-on-quarter cost improvements. For example, in the Delaware Basin, we recently drilled and completed a Third Bone Spring well for $3.5 million.","In the Midland Basin, one mile horizontal Wolfcamp and one-and-a-half mile Lower Spraberry drilling and completion costs are now projected to be less than $4 million and $4.5 million, respectively. In the horizontal Yeso play on the Northwest Shelf in the Permian, recent well costs are trending below $2.3 million. And in the Woodford SCOOP, our latest pacesetter well was drilled and completed for only $6.6 million. Achieving these lower well costs both expands our drillable inventory and significantly enhances our returns for future development programs.","Recently, we received questions about the sustainability of our well cost improvements once demand for oilfield services begins to rebound. The high level answer is that more than 50% of our average well cost decrease since the 2014 peak has come from design and efficiency improvements and should therefore be viewed as permanent cost savings. In our earnings supplement this quarter, we have provided exhibits for our key North American onshore plays that highlight the breakdown between service price and efficiency improvements.","Apache's cost achievements to date are more than just belt tightening efforts in response to the downturn. We seek to continuously implement structural changes and improvements which accrue to the bottom line and enhance our long term returns regardless of where oil prices and services costs go in the future.","Now turning to our International operations, in the North Sea, first quarter production was slightly above 70,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, which represents a 2% decline sequentially from the fourth quarter of 2015. Unplanned downtime associated with outages on the third-party operated Forties Pipeline system negatively impacted our sales volumes by approximately 1,700 BOEs per day during the quarter. These outages reduced our production uptime from what would have been 94% down to 90%.","As a reminder, U.K. North Sea industry average production uptime has been between 60% and 70% over the last several years. Therefore, Apache maintains a significant competitive advantage in this regard. Despite the higher-than-expected downtime during the quarter, Apache still achieved exceptional LOE costs of approximately $11 per BOE.","Our first quarter development drilling program in the North Sea delivered four successful new wells, all of which were placed online in the second half of the quarter. This set up a strong production rebound during the month of April. The nature of North Sea operations and production is such that there will always be monthly and quarterly lumpiness, but we are confident in our full year 2016 production guidance which we stated would decline slightly year-over-year from 2015 levels.","Our subsea tieback of the Kaliter (11:46) discovery is proceeding on time and on budget, and we continue to expect this project will begin production in mid-2017. We are also looking forward to drilling our Storr and Kinord exploration prospects, which we highlighted in our North Sea webcast last November.","In Egypt, our gross production of approximately 353,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day was essentially flat with the fourth quarter. Steve will provide more color on Egypt production reporting in a few minutes, but excluding tax barrels and minority interests, pro forma production in Egypt was up slightly versus the fourth quarter. Apache's drilling program in Egypt continues to deliver successful and reliable results. We placed 23 wells on production during the first quarter and achieved a drilling success rate of 88%, which is in line with our historical success rates in Egypt. At our prolific Ptah and Berenice fields, we placed two more wells on production, bringing the total number of producing wells in the complex to 13. We have a few additional locations remaining to fully develop Ptah and Berenice, but facilities are currently constrained.","Before I move on, I would like to leave you with a few high-level observations on Egypt. Apache's operation in Egypt remains stable. Our drilling, workover and water flood programs continue to deliver quarter after quarter. When compared to North America, our well costs are relatively low and our netbacks and margins are relatively high. And lastly, cash flow generation in Egypt demonstrates much less price-related volatility than North America, despite reported net production volatility from quarter-to-quarter.","As we all contemplate the timing and magnitude of an oil price recovery, I want to leave you with a few key points around our thinking with regard to 2016 capital spending and the potential for incremental activity above our current plan.","Cash flow is the governor on Apache's capital spending and activity levels in 2016. We still plan to manage to cash flow neutrality and exit the year with unchanged or lower net debt levels. We entered 2016 with an industry cost structure that was still out of sync with the low oil price environment. The recent rally in oil prices coupled with our cost reductions means that development drilling in North America is now generating acceptable returns in many areas. We believe these returns will continue to improve as costs come into better alignment with price.","Recent improvements in oil prices are encouraging. We are now looking for a sustainably improved pricing structure that would generate the cash flow visibility for us to confidently increase our capital program. The potential timing and magnitude of this increase is the topic of significant planning and discussion right now at Apache and with our board.","In the meantime, the vast majority of Apache's North America and onshore spending is focused on target testing, acreage evaluation and expanding our low-cost inventory locations to be exploited in an environment that offers higher returns. When the time is appropriate, our first priorities for increased investment will be to add development rigs in the Permian. We will also accelerate North American acreage testing, and we'll keep our two platform rigs running in the North Sea. Beyond that, the Woodford SCOOP play and Egypt are next in line for incremental capital.","Importantly, Apache has maintained the organizational capacity and personnel to operate a significantly higher number of rigs and we are well prepared to ramp-up activity when appropriate. Lastly, we are very mindful of the fact that we are in a highly cyclical and highly capital-intensive business. As such, any ramp in investment activity will pass rigorous hurdles on returns and net present value.","In closing, Apache's portfolio and capital allocation approach is designed to withstand volatility over the long term, which is evident in our results. We look forward to demonstrating the capability of our North American assets and efficiency of our capital allocation process in the next upturn. I want to reiterate what I stated on last quarter's earnings call; our plan is to emerge from this commodity price downturn with top-tier financial strength, a robust inventory of high rate of return drilling opportunities and a sustained capacity to generate free cash flow from our international assets in Egypt and the North Sea. We have made great progress in these efforts.","Over the long term, our goal is to offer competitive debt adjusted per-share production, reserve and cash flow growth rates and to achieve a top quartile cost position in terms of average well cost, G&A, and LOE per BOE. We will accomplish this with an intense focus on long term, full-cycle returns for our investment programs. Through the cycle, we believe this will translate into significantly improved returns and an appreciation in our share price.","I will now turn the call over to Steve Riney.","Stephen J. Riney - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, John, and good afternoon. In addition to reviewing our financial results for the first quarter of 2016, I would like to highlight our progress on several key financial objectives. These include continuing to aggressively drive down well costs, lease operating expense and G&A, achieving cash flow neutrality, inclusive of dividends under a flat $35 oil price, protecting our strong liquidity and financial position, and ending the year with unchanged or reduced net debt.","Additionally, I will speak to our 2016 outlook for capital spending, LOE and G&A. And finally, I would like to review Egypt production volume reporting to address some potential confusion about the difference between reported volumes and the pro forma volumes we typically reference.","So let's begin with the first quarter financial results. As noted in our press release, under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, Apache reported a loss of $489 million, or $1.29 per common share. Our results for the quarter include a number of items outside of our core earnings that are typically excluded by the investment community in published earnings estimates, the most significant of which are ceiling test write downs. These items total $337 million after tax, in the first quarter and as in prior periods, resulted primarily from the continued low commodity price environment. Our loss for the quarter adjusted for these items, was $152 million, or $0.40 per share.","As John mentioned, better than expected onshore North American production and solid operating cost performance worldwide, were key contributors to our first quarter, 2016 financial results.","Apache's continuing focus on driving cost efficiencies resulted in capital spending of $466 million during the first quarter, which excludes non-controlling interest. This is well below our guidance range of $500 million to $550 million. Capital costs in all of our North American regions were lower than we budgeted, with Permian leading the way. Our capital spending guidance of $1.4 billion to $1.8 billion for the full year of 2016 remains unchanged.","We are clearly achieving better than expected capital efficiencies, thus absent an increase in planned activity, I would expect us to end the year somewhere in the bottom half of this range. That said, if the current oil price environment prevails, it's more likely that we will maintain or even increase drilling and completion activity from current levels, which would result in increased capital spending.","Lease operating expenses in the first quarter were $7.81 per barrel of oil equivalent, 22% lower than the fourth quarter of 2015. Underlying improvement in this metric is primarily attributable to greater efficiency in North American onshore production and the timing of workovers and other expenditures in the Permian and North Sea. While we are very pleased with this cost performance, certain one-time items and timing issues benefited us in a way that will not continue through the year.","Last quarter, we provided guidance that full year 2016 LOE per BOE would be roughly flat compared to full year 2015. This implied a target of approximately $9.50 per BOE. With the progress we have already seen this year, we now believe 2016 LOE will be closer to $9.25 per BOE.","On the G&A side, total cost continue to decline as we remain diligently focused on aligning overhead with capital spending levels. Our goal for the year was to further reduce gross cash overhead costs to a range of $650 million to $700 million. We are currently tracking towards the low end of this range, and we continue finding opportunities to further reduce these costs.","In the first quarter of 2016, recurring DD&A was $11.42 per BOE, 34% lower than the fourth quarter of 2015. Our DD&A costs over the last several quarters have been on a clear downward trend as the result of price-related asset write-downs.","Lastly on costs, we incurred $90 million of net interest expense in the first quarter. You will note a trend of increasing expense interest and decreasing capitalized interest over the last several quarters. This is a result of unproved property impairments and reduce capital investment activity.","Next I would like to make a few comments regarding our financial strength and liquidity position. In 2015, we worked very hard to strengthen our financial position and maintain our investment-grade credit rating with the three primary rating agencies. Having accomplished this, one of our key financial objectives is to protect this position by maintaining unchanged or even reduced net debt by year-end 2016.","During the first quarter, cash uses exceeded sources by approximately $463 million. This was primarily the result of commodity realizations coming in below our plan, a front-end loaded capital program, and a build in working capital due to the timing of some nonrecurring working capital items. We anticipate these negative impacts early in the year will be more than offset later in the year. Even with this shortfall in first-quarter cash flows, we ended the quarter with approximately $1 billion in cash.","In summary, our financial condition and liquidity remain very strong. We have created this position through disciplined capital spending and aggressive cost management rather than issuing equity, reducing the dividend or selling poor assets. Importantly, we still have good visibility to cash flow neutrality at our $35 plan level.","Finally, I would like to take a moment to discuss Egypt production volume reporting. As you are aware, we most often refer you to pro forma production volumes which for Egypt, excludes two items, the one-third minority share of volumes attributable to our partner and tax barrels.","Throughout 2014, and the first three quarters of 2015, our reported tax barrel production averaged approximately 26,500 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Asset impairments in the fourth quarter of 2015 and in the first quarter of 2016, combined with low oil prices, created a significant amount of noise in these tax barrel volumes. In the fourth quarter of 2015, these items resulted in negative tax barrel reported production of 47,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. In the first quarter of 2016, they resulted in Apache recording only 1,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day of production.","As a reminder, tax barrels have no economic effect on our net cash flow from the business. Combined with the fact that they can lead to this type of reporting volatility, we believe investors should focus primarily on pro forma production in Egypt. A more thorough description of this will be on our website along with a brief history of the difference between Egypt reported and pro forma volumes. We have also included this information for your reference in this quarter's earnings supplement.","In closing, we took great efforts over the past 18 months to position Apache prudently for a prolonged downturn. After successfully navigating the challenges that confronted the industry in 2015, Apache is well-prepared to capitalize on the opportunities that we believe will ultimately emerge.","We have delivered a strong start to 2016 and look forward to continued progress throughout the year. Our primary goals for 2016 remain unchanged. We will live within our means, maintain our strong financial position, continue to build high-quality development inventory for the future, and invest to improve long-term returns and add shareholder value. While we remain conservative in our budgeting and planned activity, we are prepared to respond when the environment is right to increase investment.","I would now like to turn the call over to the operator for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from the line of Ed Westlake with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Congratulations on the cost reduction, really quite impressive. Quick question on cash. You've got $1 billion of cash on the balance sheet, so just wondering what's the optimal level? I mean, obviously, peers have done some of the things you said, like issue equity and sell assets to get to their cash balances high, and people expect oil prices may still be volatile.","Stephen J. Riney - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes. Thanks, Ed. This is Steve. I think at this point in time, I don't know what the optimal amount of cash on the balance sheet is, but I kind of like at this point in time having $1 billion of cash on the balance sheet. It's good for liquidity; I think it's a good time to have liquidity. It's a good time to have the cash ready for deployment, either in terms of paying down debt if we decide we need to do that, or for deployment into the capital program if we see the price scenario in the future improving. Or, for that matter, I am happy just to hold cash. We do believe that the cash balance will go back up to $1.5 billion by the end of this year, based on our plan for the year.","Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","I guess a different way of asking it is there are obviously across the broad North American portfolio a lot of assets which potentially may be of interest to others, and as commodity prices lift their head a little bit, are you looking to be more aggressive on perhaps disposals of Tier 2?","Stephen J. Riney - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","The answer to that is we are always looking at the portfolio. We have done some small one-offs that are not really material to production. But at this point, we are always looking at our internal assets. We grade those against other things, we look at what could be added and what would add incremental value, but right now it's a pretty hard litmus test because of the types of projects we've deferred. So we sit on a pretty good set of assets, a really good deep inventory that we're very excited about, and we'll look how do we improve it going forward. But nothing major planned on either side.","Operator","Your next question will from the line of David Tameron with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Yes. Good morning. Nice quarter. A couple of questions, first I guess just on the horizontal Yeso. John, can you talk about what your plans are there, after seeing the results in the first quarter? What should we look for from that asset over the next few months or next few quarters, I guess?","John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, thanks, David. That is one of the areas that we've got inventory that we could put back to work. I mean, right now we do not have a rig that's over there. We've drilled some fantastic wells with, where the cost structure is moving now and when price has gone. That would be one of the areas that we could do, add some future activity to. But right now we don't have anything immediately planned to do, but we've got a lot of nice inventory.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And then as a follow up, bigger picture, if I think about, last conference call you made the comment that you could have kept 2016 production flat at $45, obviously I think your service cost and efficiencies have improved since then. Can you talk about looking forward, either give us an apples-to-apples numbers for 2016 or kind of projecting the forward for 2017, what that range would look like?","John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, I will take you back to what I said on the last call was, in 2016 another $900 million, which would have put our capital budget midpoint around 2.5, would have kept his flat in 2016. As we look at 2017, clearly we continue to make progress on the efficiency side, which would lower that. Our decline on our base is flattening, it's a function of, we're now 18 months into a slowdown in terms of the numbers of wells we've been bringing on, so that helps. Plus the base rate is a little lower that you have got to keep flat. So we see clearly less capital in 2017 to keep it flat, but it's kind of a moving target at this point.","And then obviously the other factor is we've got some projects that we are advancing, Kaliter (29:28) in the North Sea is on track, which would give us a big kick in the middle of 2017. So it's going to be less, but it's pretty dynamic and we're in the middle of working through a planning process at this point. So at this point I'll just say it's going to be less than it would have been this year and you're right, $900 million or $45 base plan versus our $35 would have kept us neutral in 2016. But it will be a lower number for 2017.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Pearce Hammond with Simmons\/Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","Pearce Hammond - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)","Hi, good afternoon, and thanks for taking my questions. My first question, John, what is driving the steep decline in LOE, and then how sustainable are those cost declines?","John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, and I'll let Steve chime in, in a minute, a lot of its timing of how things came up first quarter. We had a big drop in a couple of areas. It is not something that will be there for the rest of the year, which is kind of why we moved our number down from $9.50 guidance to about $9.25, but we're making progress, and I've got confidence the guys can keep working on those numbers.","Stephen J. Riney - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, I'll just...","Pearce Hammond - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)","Yeah, go ahead. Sorry.","Stephen J. Riney - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes, just in echoing John's comments, we had good cost results in Egypt, in the Permian and the North Sea. All three have been very strong. I think there is a good mix of that that's just timing related, and you'll note that that kind of a reduction doesn't show up in the guidance reduction to $9.25 per BOE.","Pearce Hammond - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)","Great. Thank you. And then my follow-up is given the improvement in commodity price, any updated thoughts on hedging?","Stephen J. Riney - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","At this point, the environment's getting much better. I mean, we like the direction on the cost, we like the direction on the oil price, so I think we're at a point where things are starting to look pretty darn attractive. But right now, our best hedge is we haven't committed to a lot of rigs or a big program at this point. So it's one of those things we will be discussing as we start to look at plans, but at this point, we're not quite where I would feel good about locking in a scenario.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Evan Calio with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey. Good morning, guys. Good afternoon to you, sorry. I appreciate all the color. I just wanted to make sure I understand the activity re-acceleration, which sounds closer. You accelerated around current levels, or are you looking for market fundamentals to clean up and then that acceleration will be governed, or the pace of that acceleration will be governed to remain cash flow neutral? Is that right?","John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, I mean, I think the key is, Evan, we budgeted to be cash flow neutral this year at $35 and a $2.35 gas price. We're a little bit behind that in the first quarter on oil, we're behind it on gas. Clearly, in April we've seen a little bit of a rebound. So if the strip were to hold up, clearly we're going to be in a position to have some cash to deploy in the back half of the year, and those are the types of things we would look at. But there's lots of things out there. I mean, we've got debt we could address or the program. But the plan would be to \u2013 cash flow is going to be the governor, we plan to stay cash neutral, and we'll have some options to choose from if the current conditions hold.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. You also discussed your North American capital allocation in the recovery, but you didn't mention the Eagle Ford, which I had thought was a higher hurdle from your previous comments. Yet in Q1, you completed four Eagle Ford wells with competitive results. Can you discuss what the driver there was? Is that some science or lease-related activity?","John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, we mentioned we'd been doing a lot of strategic testing. I mean, most of our North American capital is designed to that. We had some wells that were down that we wanted to complete and, you know, to be able to evaluate those. The Eagle Ford will require a little higher hurdle than some of the other plays. So as we start to think about in the future potentially putting capital back to work, right now it would not be the first place it would go. But we're seeing great progress in the Eagle Ford as well and have made a lot of progress over the last 18 months. So it's something I think can be an option in the future.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Herrlin with Societe Generale. Please go ahead.","John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC","Yeah, I had a question for you on the shales. Obviously, you've had a lot of improvement. How much capital have you really dedicated from the science side of things to better optimize, like density studies, things like that?","John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","John, I'd say if you look at our strategic testing, it really falls into several buckets, and I don't have an exact split on how much of it is in that portion of it, but we're doing three things, really. We're testing new acreage, we're testing new zones and then we're optimizing within zones. And if you look at our completions in the \u2013 a lot of the Permian as well as the Woodford or even the Eagle Ford, I mean, we're taking and integrating seismic data, core data, petrophysics, landing zones, everything. And so we're doing a lot of time on that, and I think that's where you're seeing some of the productivity things that are showing up from that time that we're taking to do things properly, and we've learned an awful lot.","John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC","Okay. Next one for me, with the services companies, do you find that your conversations about future activity levels and costs are different? Is it more collegial, less adversarial, or...?","John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes, I would say that really, since the fall of last year, it's become a lot more collaborative. I mean, we've had some really good sit-down discussions with some of the small service companies as well as some of the very big ones and have had some really, really constructive conversations on how do we lower the cost structure in North America, and a lot of progress on that front. And I think a willingness to recognize that that's what is going to take going forward. And you're seeing some of the fruits show up, not just in terms of cost reductions from the service side, but in terms of execution, efficiencies, structural things, a lot of these things that are going to be permanent. And that's what's important.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yes, good afternoon. John, I was wondering if you could perhaps comment on some of the steps you're taking kind of to manage your base decline in the Permian? You had a pretty skinny sequential decline, right? So in addition to new drilling activity, what are you doing to manage that base?","John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, I mean, I think one of the big things is we've stepped back. We've gone from trying to bring on a lot of wells and completing a lot of wells to really getting back to managing your base, and looking at fluid levels, looking at optimizing how we're producing these wells, changing some of the lift, it's amazing what you can do when you take the time. Compression, optimizing water shut offs, little things. And there's not a lot of money, but boy, it sure makes a big, big difference. I mean, we've got back in, cleaned out some injectors in some of our water floods, some of the old bread and butter, classic Apache things that we've done for decades.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","John, I remember you commenting, maybe in a previous call, that you thought that your overall base decline rate was in the low 20% range? Any thoughts on that number, is it a coming down?","John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, I mean, clearly, as we started the year, we said it was in the 25%, 26% range. As we bring on fewer wells, which is what we've done, it has flattened and is flattening. That's a good topic of discussion with me and our reservoir engineers, because we are always working on that. But clearly it is coming off and clearly in terms of flattening, and then also all these projects help too. So I think you'll see us continue to focus on that. It gets back to the quality of having some conventional, and a big chunk of our Permian is water floods and CO2 floods and things that just don't decline as rapidly. There's a lot of things you can do, scale cleanouts, all kinds of things, moving more water, there's just a lot \u2013 you have a lot more options to pull on your conventional asset base and you're seeing us pull those. So I think you will see it flatten.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Scott Hanold with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks. Good afternoon. Just specifically on some North Sea activity, did the Storr and Kinord wells, did those move into this year? And if you could comment if changes in the PRT tax over there have changed your view on how active you get?","John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes, I would say that the changes in the PRT are very helpful. It does not change where we are in terms of the game plan. I mean, we've got such a low cost structure there relative to the rest of the industry, and we're going to generate cash flow out of the North Sea, much like Egypt, on our international portfolio. So it does not change big picture the steps we're taking, but it does make things more attractive, and provides us incremental cash flow, it lets us do a few more things.","We do plan to bring Storr and Kinord into the back half of this year at this point. So that would be \u2013 the plan would be to at least get the wells drilled at this back half of the year or could spill into next year.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Thanks. And as my follow-up, turning to the Permian and really good results on that Seagull well. Could you give a little color on what you all might have done differently there and maybe a little bit of color, too, on that new zone within the Third Bone Spring that you're looking at?","John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, I mean, the Seagull is a pretty \u2013 it's only a 4,600 foot lateral. It's really target testing and modification. As we continue to understand the hydrocarbon system, we're figuring out exactly where to land those wells and how to modify our fracs. And, Tim, do you have any color you want to add?","Timothy J. Sullivan - Executive Vice President \u2013 Operations Support","Yes, really, the results of the Seagull well incorporate the integration of the team, and that really takes into consideration the 3-D and targeting fracture intensity there. And it's had tremendous results and I think it's repeatable as we've just recently put a well online, or Bluejay 103, that's flowing over 2000 barrels of oil per day, very similar geologic environment.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Doug Leggate with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you. Guys, I don't know if you could give this or not, but Egypt and the North Sea are your big cash cows in the portfolio. I wonder if you could give us an idea of what the operating cash and free cash flows out of those assets this quarter?","Stephen J. Riney - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, Doug. We typically don't give that type of information down to the asset level. You obviously can figure that out at the end of each year. We are thinking about some \u2013 potentially expanding our \u2013 both our guidance and our detailed reporting around things like that for the future. But we're not ready to start doing that at this point in time. I can tell you that both of those asset areas this year will be cash flow generators for us.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Were they free cash flow positive in Q1?","Stephen J. Riney - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Not going to say whether they were or not. I can say that they will be for the year, that's for sure.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Freeman with Raymond James. Please go ahead.","John A. Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Good afternoon. On the Bluejay 103H that you just mentioned came on at over 2,000-barrels a day and also set a record and completed at $3.5 million, what were the specs on that well, like the lateral length?","John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","That's just a single mile lateral.","John A. Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","And then where specifically is it located in your position?","John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","It's our target one in the Third Bone Springs interval.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Sankey with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Yes, apologies, I'm going to keep going on the Bluejay and the Seagull, if I could. But if we put it in the wider context, you talked about design and efficiency gaining you in costs considerably since 2014. Has there been a step change there or is that a linear progression?","And further to that, you mentioned the results at Bluejay were very strong. I was going to ask you if they were less than the Seagull, where you had such strong volume performance. Can we go \u2013 I guess what I'm driving at with the linear and the step is can we actually go a whole lot lower than that $3.5 million? Does it have a similar split between drilling and completion that we typically see? How much more do you think we can get out for less money? Is it a question of more volume, or can you actually even go less money? Thanks.","John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes. I mean, when you look at \u2013 we put in the supplement a good bar chart that shows the steps in terms of how the costs have come down really over the last five or six quarters. So I continue to be amazed at what we can do. Obviously, there are certain things that, as you get lower and lower, it gets harder to keep having those sorts of reductions.","I mean, I think $3.5 million for a mile-long lateral in the Delaware is pretty strong, especially with the type of productivity the well's come on. It tells you we're not cutting corners on the completion or anything like that. So, yeah, we'll clearly keep driving. The guys will tell you they can keep taking off small chunks, but how far \u2013 how much further can we go, I think that will be a function \u2013 we'll just have to wait and see what we can do.","In terms of performance, it's going to end up being pretty similar to the Seagull. The 2,800 BOEs a day included gas, the 2,000. As Tim referenced, it's very early on the Bluejay, and that's just on the oil side. So I think it's going to be a pretty similar well before it's all said and done. But we'll have to wait and see.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Charles Meade with Johnson Rice. Please go ahead.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Good afternoon, John, and to the rest of your team there. I'd like to go back to the question of the possible acceleration in the back half of 2016. I know you spent a lot of your prepared comments on this and you've already had a couple questions in Q&A here, but number of other companies have spoken about this decision, this kind of a \u2013 maybe being in two pieces. The first question is do you have the capacity to accelerate? And then the second would be do you have the appetite to or do you have the returns to? And I wonder if you could speak more to that second piece. I understand that you want to keep staying cash flow neutral on the year, but in this current environment, is $45 enough for \u2013 you would have the cash flow \u2013 but is it enough on the returns front on these plays to really entice you to up your rig count?","John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Charles, a couple of things. Number one, we've seen tremendous progress and now we've got a lot of wells with returns actually full cycle, fully burdened, look pretty darn good. So I think we've got plenty of inventory.","If you go back a year ago, everybody started ramping up and adding rigs quickly and expecting prices to hold. And unfortunately, those that outspent significantly in anticipation of what I'll call visibility into more flat, longer sustainable price environment, ended up having to go back to the debt markets or the equity markets, that sort of thing. So I mean we're going to be cautious. We're going to be very thoughtful and disciplined. And like I said, we're going to want to see some cash flow accrue before we start putting things back to work.","But we'll have a lot of conversations over the next couple of months and weeks, actually starting next week with the Board. A lot to talk about, and the nice thing is we have a lot of attractive options right now. We've also got a lot of things we want to test. And quite frankly as I look at the results and I look at the well cost, I'm glad I didn't outspend in some of the other quarters, because we've got wells that we didn't drill. I mean, we continue to make progress and we'll do things differently.","So there's a fine line of feeling when we're ready to move forward. We clearly had the financial capacity to do so. The returns are starting to look pretty darn good, and it's a function of managing and balancing your financial structure.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Got it. That's helpful detail, John. And am I understanding you correctly that it's not just the level of the oil price, but you want to see it settle in there with less volatility? Is that am I hearing that correctly?","John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, no. We're going to have to be prepared to live in volatile bands. But I just want to see more visibility into more belief we're going to have the cash flow that's going to come with the price, and it's going to stay there a little bit, so.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Michael Hall with Heikkinen Energy Advisors. Please go ahead.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Yes. Thanks. If I could, just a couple accounting-related questions for me. First, on Egypt, am I understanding it right, you basically had, on a recurring net income basis, about a $17 million loss, if I just back off the $54 million write down from the $71 million non-controlling interest? I'm just talking about the non-controlling interest side, that $17 million. And if that's right, I'm just trying to think through, what price level is that business net income breakeven?","Stephen J. Riney - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes. Sorry, Michael. You're looking at what number for Egypt?","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","So, on the non-controlling interest side, the $71 million loss that was backed out, if you just adjust that for the $54 million write down in the adjustment, you get $17 million loss on that third of the business. Is that the right way to think about it? And if so, what price level brings net income to breakeven?","Stephen J. Riney - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes. If you corrected that for the Egypt's non-controlling portion of the impairment in Egypt, you said.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Right. Exactly, yes. Is that the right way to think about it?","Stephen J. Riney - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes, so \u2013 and the question is what would it take to do what?","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","My question is, number one, is that right way to think about if that's the net income on that third of the business? And then number two, what price level would be required to drive a net income breakeven for that business?","Stephen J. Riney - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, okay. So I think that for the quarter, yes, that's a reasonable way to think about that. I think when you reduce operating results down to a single quarter, you're going to get lots of noise in that quarter. But for example I think we had a significant piece of noise on the revenue side in Egypt for the quarter to the tune of about $8 million on gas revenue side that we're in some dispute on, and we're looking at.","I think that obviously the issue with the price that would breakeven, so how much lower can the price go to breakeven from an accounting perspective. I think that's obviously very difficult to do because of the cost sharing arrangement in the PSC. So I'm not really prepared to say how far down prices would have to go in order for that number to become zero. But suffice it to say, it would have to go down a bit more from where it is in the first quarter in order for that to happen.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Yes, that's what I was getting at, that's helpful. Maybe I'll follow up more offline. And then the other piece was just on the North Sea, again accounting-related, but the $27 million PRT refund, was that adjusted out of net income in that $55 million tax adjustment, or is that still in the net income line? Is that expected to recur, or any more of those coming this year?","Stephen J. Riney - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","No, it's not adjusted out of net income. It is a PRT refund because of, there are some costs related to prior year items. That's not an unusual type of thing to happen in the North Sea. We have that happen on a regular basis, we never adjust that out, whether it's a benefit to us or a detriment to us. We don't adjust it out for calculating adjusted earnings or adjusted EBITDA.","It is \u2013 it's a large item this quarter relative to typical PRT simply because PRT is now approaching zero with the price environment that we have. But it's not \u2013 if you go back two or three years, you'll find PRT expense of nearly $300 million in some years.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Michael Rowe with Tudor Pickering Holt. Please go ahead.","Michael J. Rowe - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Thanks. Good afternoon. First question I have is on cash flow. You highlighted in your prepared remarks there was a big swing in working capital during the first quarter, as well as an excess of cash CapEx over accrual CapEx. So just to confirm, we should expect those items to reverse throughout the year so that you don't have any net debt additions, all else equal, according to the budget?","Stephen J. Riney - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","That's right. So if we assume we don't pay down any debt this year, we expect to end closer to the $1.5 billion of cash where we started. We had about, a little over $450 million of cash consumption in the first quarter. Roughly two thirds of that, if you just take, if you look at first quarter actual versus the plan that it would take for the year to get to cash flow neutrality, of that $450 million, and about two thirds of that is because we built working capital in the first quarter and we had practically zero sale proceeds in the first quarter. We expect both of those items to be cash flow generators for us by the time we get to the end of the year. So, about two thirds of the $450 million is simply because of that. We had a pretty significant build in working capital during the quarter.","The other one-third of the $450 million would be split roughly 50-50 between the overspend on capital in the year, versus kind of an average quarterly run rate for the year and the shortfall on revenues, less OpEx, because of the fact that prices were below our $35, $2.35 Henry Hub plan for the year.","On the working capital side, I mean, so why did we build working capital in the first quarter? The primary reason for that is because of the pay down of payables and accrued costs between the end of the fourth quarter last year and the end of first quarter this year. And that's primarily because activity is slowing down so much, so our payables are coming down. Activity won't continue to slow down quite at the pace that it did through that timeframe, and we expect inventory and accounts receivables, which tend to lag a bit, the pay down of payables, those to also come down through the year.","And then we've got some pretty significant unique items, if you will, on the working capital side that we expect late this year, probably in the fourth quarter. Those are primarily in the form of tax refunds on loss carrybacks that \u2013 one has been filed, one is about to be filed. And then also, we do anticipate some asset sales, which will also take place later this year, the proceeds of which will come in late in 2016. So all of those things combine to offset the $460 million cash deficit that we incurred in the first quarter.","Michael J. Rowe - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Great. That's helpful.","Stephen J. Riney - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","A very longwinded way of saying, yes, we anticipate getting back to $1.5 billion cash with the same debt level by the end of this year.","Michael J. Rowe - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Great. Thanks for the clarity there. And my second question, or follow-up, is you talked about adding capital potentially back to the Permian first if you got some stability on the oil price and felt good about the cost structure. But I was wondering if you all are comfortable allocating that towards strategic testing first, kind of like you're already doing this year, rather than full development or development drilling? Just curious on how you compare the capital efficiency between strategic testing and development drilling. Thanks.","John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And, Michael, in my prepared comments, we said obviously there would be some that went into the development side of Permian as well as some acceleration of some of the testing. And then also you've got a couple platform rigs in the North Sea that we'd like to keep active. And then you've got Egypt \u2013 projects in Egypt as well as the Woodford. So we look at what sets us up best for the future, and we look at the timing under which we want to go drill some development wells as well. So it'd be a balance, but you'd see some of it going to development potentially and then some of it would accelerate some testing.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Richard Tullis with Capital One Securities. Please go ahead.","Richard Merlin Tullis - Capital One Securities, Inc.","Hi. Thanks, John, and thanks for taking a call at this late hour. I'll be quick. Obviously, you've had some nice well results over the past several quarters in that Pecos Bend area. Roughly how much surface acres do you have there and how many estimated drilling locations, given the various targets, at this point?","John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","The Pecos Bend area is a very small area that we've got, and we've been pretty active there. I think it shows you, it's a block of acreage that's less than 10,000 acres. And quite frankly, the other nice thing there is we have a high mineral interest. So we don't have many royalty owners we have to share anything with. But it just shows you the depth and the number of wells and so forth that we can continue to drill. We've got a good, I would say, probably 40 to 50 wells there easily that even the one zone would add.","Richard Merlin Tullis - Capital One Securities, Inc.","Okay. And just staying that same theme, looking at some of your best areas in the Permian, I guess that would be Pecos Bend, Barnhart, Deadwood, Wild Flower, how much acreage in total is made up from all of those different areas?","John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, I mean, the best thing I can do is point you back to our November 2014 Analyst Day where we broke the areas down. I mean, we've got 3.3 million gross acres in the Permian. We've got about 1.6 million to 1.7 million net. The four-county area we showed in the southern Midland Basin, we've got over 200,000 acres. That did not really include even the Audrian County stuff. So the best place to go look at those acreage counts would be going back to our analysts update from late 2014.","Operator","At this time I will turn the conference back over to management for any closing remarks.","Gary T.

Speakers making prepared remarks on today's call will be Apache's CEO and President, John Christmann; Executive Vice President of Operations Support, Tim Sullivan; and Executive Vice President and CFO, Steve Riney.","In conjunction with this morning's press release, I hope you have had the opportunity to review our third quarter financial and operational supplement, which can be found on our Investor Relations website at investor.apachecorp.com.","On today's conference call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the differences between these non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the supplemental information provided on our website.","Consistent with previous reporting practices, production numbers cited in today's call are adjusted to exclude non-controlling interest in Egypt and Egypt tax barrels.","Finally, I'd like to remind everyone that today's discussions will contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions based on our current views and reasonable expectations. However, a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from what we discuss today. A full disclaimer is located with the supplemental data on our website.","I will now turn the call over to John.","John Christmann","Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. On today's call, I will discuss third quarter results and accomplishments, comment on our Midland basin oil production and development program, recap some of the key Alpine High points from last month's webcast and provide an update on our 2018 planning process and current thinking around commodity price assumptions.","Beginning with the third quarter, as anticipated, our average daily net production in the US returned to a growth trajectory. We also grew net production in the North Sea and gross production in Egypt. Production was in line with our guidance with notably strong performance in Permian oil volumes. We stated in our webcast update last month that we expect this performance to carry through into the fourth quarter with Midland and Delaware oil production tracking at the high end of the guidance range, established back in February. As we also noted, the delayed start-up of two central processing facilities at Alpine High caused by Hurricane Harvey will defer some natural gas volumes into 2018. So, our updated fourth quarter production guidance is unchanged.","In the Midland and Delaware basins, we are benefiting today from the strategic testing, optimization and development planning initiatives that we implemented in 2015 and 2016, while running a very lean capital program. Going forward, we anticipate continued capital efficiency gains in both the Midland and Delaware basins. This is particularly true at Alpine High, as we move further into multi-well pad development, continue to extend average lateral length, utilize more smart completions and further optimize our landing zone targeting and well spacing. The majority of optimization benefits, which have been proven in other unconventional plays are still ahead of us at Alpine High.","On the international side, cash flow generation during the third quarter was strong once again, as both Egypt and the North Sea benefited from improving Brent crude prices and production from our Callater startup in the North Sea. Overall, capital investment was in line with expectations and remains on track with our guidance for the full year. We have shifted some capital in the back half of 2017 from our international regions into the US to take advantage of attractive portfolio opportunities in the Permian Basin.","Finally, we continue to benefit from our cost structure focus with both LOE per BOE and G&A costs remaining low as a result of the significant rationalization efforts over the last two years. Apache also made some excellent progress this quarter with regard to its portfolio transition. Specifically, the discovery of Alpine High enabled our strategic exit from Canada. In only one short year, we will have completely replaced our Canadian production and we will have done so with an asset that offers significant returns and is only just beginning to show its enormous long term potential.","Value creation and returns accretion were challenged in Canada, given this low ratio of cash margins to F&D cost. Alpine High on the other hand will have significantly lower F&D costs, much more attractive cash margins and will transform Apache's long term return on capital employed profile. Organic portfolio transformations like this take time, but are much more accretive to returns than acquiring high priced proved acreage positions.","I will now turn to the Midland Basin where activity is primarily focused on multi-well pad drilling to the Wolfcamp and Spraberry formations. Our third quarter oil production was up approximately 5,500 barrels per day over the second quarter, as we are delivering excellent results from recent multi-well pads in our core areas. We will continue to progress our development efforts with two more pads coming online before year end. Our focus in the Midland basin is on multi-well pads and full field development.","We believe the proper approach to an unconventional resource has developed each section in a way that optimizes long term value and returns. This requires a full understanding of intra-well dynamics and proper spacing in order to design development patterns that optimize costs and recovery. Additionally, Apache utilizes a fully burdened returns approach, which should give you confidence that the anticipated returns will result in a competitive return on capital employed at the corporate level. Tim will share more details on the impressive progress we have made in our Midland basin development efforts.","Next I would like to move to Alpine High and reiterate a few of the key points made in last month's webcast. First, Alpine High consists of three primary plays, a highly economic wet gas play that contains the majority of our currently identified locations, a dry gas play that is smaller, but very economic and an emerging oil play with tremendous future potential. Second, we increased our location count from 3000 to more than 5000, which consists of at least 3500 locations in the wet gas play, at least 1000 locations in the dry gas play and more than 500 locations in the oil play. As we have previously discussed, we believe there is significant upside potential to all of these location counts.","Third, 90% of our currently disclosed locations are in the highly predictable and repeatable transgressive source interval, which consists of the Woodford, Barnett and Penn formations. Being a true source interval, there is minimal in situ water that will be produced with the hydrocarbons. Water handling and disposal costs are becoming a significant challenge across the Delaware Basin and this will only get more difficult in the future. We are fortunate to not have this problem in the transgressive source interval. Fourth, returns of Alpine High are driven by the combination of extremely low development costs with attractive cash margins. Recent wells have validated our assumptions on future drilling and completion costs.","Cash margins will be attractive due to the high quality liquid content and the low operating costs. Lastly, we are very pleased with the performance of the wells of Alpine High, many of which have been producing now for several months. Cumulative production data is confirming our expectations for this high quality rock, which was predicated on extensive geologic, geophysical and reservoir engineering work. Our investment economics are robust for all three plays at current or lower commodity prices and are consistent with those presented more than a year ago.","Next, I'd like to discuss the process we are undertaking as we finalize our 2018 plans. Since the beginning of 2015, we have operated Apache with a fundamental belief that over a typical run of years, it is both possible and appropriate for an E&P company to live within operating cash flows. Within cash flow, a company should be capable of growing production volumes and delivering competitive rates of return above its cost of capital, while also increasing return of capital to shareholders through dividends and\/or share buybacks. We have taken a number of transformative steps over the last three years, designed to enable this vision, irrespective of the oil and gas price environment.","We streamlined our portfolio and strategically shifted our asset base, reset our overhead and operating cost structure, dramatically reduced our capital investment program from mid-2015 through 2016 to live within cash flow, implemented a rigorous capital allocation process based on fully burdened returns as opposed to fundamentally flawed half cycle economics and reduced debt and preserved our dividend without issuing equity and diluting our shareholders' future ownership. Recently, we have been on the road meeting with shareholders and other long term oriented potential investors. Encouragingly, the market sentiment is becoming more aligned with Apache's philosophy.","For most of the last three years, the E&P industry has been engaged in excess spending to drive short term oil growth. Today, we are seeing a return to the fundamentals of capital discipline and focus on long term returns. We welcome this change and believe it is very constructive for the long term health of our industry. So as Apache enters the 2018 planning season, we are experiencing some natural, but very positive short term budget tension. That is, do we continue investing in our attractive Permian upstream opportunities at what we consider to be the optimal pace for delivering the long term returns or do we pare back and manage the program for cash flow neutrality.","That is a nice problem to have and as an expected outcome of discovering and bringing into development a large low cost new play. We believe Alpine High is a compelling world-class resource. Once ramped to its production potential, Apache will benefit for decades from high returns and free cash flow from a significant portion of our future capital employed. Given the dynamic nature of our opportunity set and the volatile commodity price environment, our 2018 capital budget is still being rigorously worked.","Consistent with previous years, we will issue our 2018 budget and associated guidance in conjunction with our fourth quarter earnings results in February. As we have in each of the past three years, we will base our 2018 plan on benchmark pricing that is slightly on the conservative side of the prevailing strip. Given the recent volatility in oil prices, this means we are preparing for a number of possible scenarios. Fortunately, we have considerable portfolio flexibility. Our focus now is prioritizing next year's activity and identifying areas where the capital program could be pared back.","While spending could be lower in 2019, the allocation of capital across the portfolio would likely be very similar to 2017 with Permian Basin investment representing the majority of Apache's capital program. Internationally, we will continue to invest to maintain current levels of free cash flow. At recent oil and gas prices, this spend is in the $700 million to $900 million range. In 2018, we will also continue to fund the Alpine High midstream buildout as this is strategically important to enable an optimized upstream development program. As we have stated previously, we believe this represents a very attractive investment opportunity and are continuing to review its monetization potential.","Finally, like in 2017, we have begun a program of hedging for 2018 and '19. This activity is focused on protecting cash flows to support our near term capital program. Steve will talk more about the details in his prepared remarks. To sum up, the third quarter was important for Apache as it marked our strategic exit from Canada, the very early stage acceleration of production at Alpine High and a significant turn in our Permian Basin oil production. We're making excellent progress across the company.","As the Permian region grows in relative scale with our portfolio, the quality of its returns and cash flows will improve those of Apache as a whole. Our teams have created a deep inventory of investment opportunities, both domestically and internationally. As we have over the past three years, we will fund these opportunities in a disciplined manner that in no way stresses our balance sheet.","We look forward to discussing our plan further in February when we will provide a review of our operating cash flow, capital spending and production outlook for 2018, a higher level preliminary outlook for 2019 and potentially beyond, a longer term view into how the investments we're making today will improve long term corporate level returns and free cash flow and a more detailed view into Alpine High for both the upstream and the midstream.","Now, I would like to turn the call over to Tim who will provide some operational highlights.","Tim Sullivan","Good afternoon. My remarks today will cover operational activity and key wells in our US and international focus areas and their impact as we plan for 2018 and subsequent years. Our third quarter production results reflect the ramp up in drilling activity Apache began at the end of last year. We have shifted to a growth trajectory and are benefiting from the fiscal discipline and returns focused drilling programs that we initiated in 2015. During the third quarter, we maintained activity at a measured pace, averaging 36 operated rigs worldwide with 17 in the Permian, 4 in other North American areas, 12 in Egypt and 3 in the North Sea.","In North America, third quarter 2017 adjusted production average 207,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, up 7% from the second quarter. Please note these volumes exclude Canada, where we completed our country exit during the period. With the success of our Midland basin drilling program and the continued production ramp at Alpine High, third quarter oil production increased 8% quarter to quarter. Our core Midland Basin assets are the primary contributor to these higher oil volumes. At our Wildfire field in Midland County, we completed seven wells with mile and a half laterals at the June tippet-12\/13 pad.","The pad comprises four completions in the lower Spraberry with twelve by spacing and three completions in the Wolfcamp B on six by spacing. These wells achieved an average 30-day peak initial production rate of 1058 BOE and fifty per day, producing 83% oil. Also in the Wildfire field, on the Lynch A unit, we drilled a six well lower Spraberry pad, also with 12 by spacing. The wells were drilled with a mile and a half long laterals and average a 30-day peak IP rate of 1142 BOE per day, producing 85% oil. At the Powell field in Upton County, we drilled the CC4045, a six well pad with two mile laterals on 12 by spacing staggered in the Wolfcamp B1 and B3 formations.","These wells have been online for about four weeks and are trending toward an average 30-day peak IP rate of 1300 BOE per day with 80% oil. We plan to drill three additional wells on this pad in early 2018. These excellent Midland Basin well results are reflective of our integrated approach to determine optimal landing zones, pattern spacing, lateral length and completion design. At Alpine High, net sales to Apache averaged 13300 BOE per day during the third quarter.","As we noted in our webcast last month, we began our fourth quarter, producing at a rate of 20,300 BOE per day and assuming this start-up of the Hidalgo CPF by the end of the year, we anticipate achieving production of approximately 25,000 BOE per day. We continue to make good progress on drilling, completion and cost optimization at Alpine High. We recently drilled and completed three wells with an average lateral length of approximately 4500 feet and for an average cost of $5.5 million. We remain very confident that in our development, we will be able to achieve completed well costs in the range of $4 million to $6 million, which is consistent with the economics we put forward when we announced the play last year.","I'll turn now to our international assets. Gross production in Egypt increased slightly to 339,000 BOE per day. Adjusted production in Egypt which excludes minority interest and the impact of tax barrels decreased slightly from the second quarter 2017 to 87,000 BOE per day. The decrease in adjusted production reflects the terms of our production sharing contracts in Egypt, which generally provide for fewer cost recovery barrels to the contractor as the price of Brent index crude oil increases. In the North Sea, production increased 9% from the second quarter to 60,000 BOE per day.","Net production from the Callater field is currently averaging approximately 14,000 BOE per day from two wells. A third well, the CB1, was recently drilled into a new fault block and found more than 260 foot of net pay. This well is expected to come online later this month. Please see our financial and operational supplement posted today for more information on drilling and production activity during the third quarter in our US and international regions.","I'll now turn the call over to Steve.","Steve Riney","Thank you, Tim and good afternoon, everyone. On today's call, I will begin with a brief review of our third quarter financial results, comment on our infrastructure build out and future midstream plans at Alpine High, provide some additional color on certain Alpine High economic assumptions behind our webcast last month and lastly I will update our hedge positions and the continuing strength of our financial position.","Let me begin with third quarter financial results. As noted in our press release, Apache reported net income of $63 million or $0.16 per diluted common share. Results for the quarter include a number of items outside of our core earnings that are typically excluded by the investment community in published earnings estimates. The after tax values of some of the more material items are a $219 million gain related to recent divestitures, $104 million of unproved acreage impairments and a $54 million unrealized mark-to-market loss on our commodity price derivative positions. Excluding these and other similar items, our adjusted earnings for the quarter was $14 million or $0.04 per share.","Cash flow from operations in the quarter was $554 million. Before working capital changes, Apache generated $655 million in operating cash flow. During the third quarter, we completed non-core asset sales in the US and Canada for net cash proceeds of $693 million. Our cash position on September 30, including a small amount of restricted cash, was $1.9 billion, up from $1.7 billion the previous quarter. Lease operating expenses in the third quarter were $8.74 per barrel of oil equivalent, down slightly from the prior quarter. Our year to date LOE was $8.42 per barrel of oil equivalent, which is in line with our guidance for the full year of $8.25 to $8.75 per BOE.","Exploration expense in the third quarter was $231 million. $198 million of this was attributable to dry hole expense and unproved leasehold impairments. The primary contributors to dry hole expense this quarter were the previously mentioned well in the barrel area of the North Sea along with some exploration wells in Egypt. Unproved impairment costs were primarily related to acreage in the Anadarko Basin. These were legacy acreage positions, which based on the success of Alpine High will clearly never compete for further exploration funding.","Our October 9 webcast included a review of the progress we have made on our Alpine High midstream buildout. As John mentioned, we are investing in a large infrastructure system that will make for an extremely attractive midstream enterprise. Our board recently approved plans to install a first phase of cryogenic processing in Alpine High. This decision was taken for three primary reasons. Most importantly, we believe the incremental cost of cryo processing will be economic in the future.","Secondly, having at least some cryo capacity significantly enhances the reliability of processing the extremely rich gas to assure we meet sales pipeline spec and finally cryo processing capacity will enhance the value of the midstream enterprise and product marketing by introducing optionality for the product stream.","We will begin by installing 200 million cubic feet per day of cryo capacity, which will come online in 2019. Future increments of additional capacity will be treated as independent decisions and will have to be economically justified based on the then prevailing price outlook for gas and NGLs. To eliminate any potential confusion, let me be clear that this investment is already embedded in our current $500 million Alpine High Midstream capital plans for 2018. Note also that this Midstream spend may be pared back when we finalize our 2018 budget.","Next, I would like to discuss some questions that have come up related to the economic assumptions for Alpine High that were set forth in last month's webcast. One of these questions is about how we arrived at our estimated average NGL realization of 60% of WTI. To begin with, I should clarify that this realization is before third-party transportation and fractionation costs. As such, you need to subtract these costs to arrive at a net realization to Apache at the least. Given we are currently trucking NGLs from our processing facilities, these costs are around $10 per barrel.","In the future, with full pipe transport, these costs will be closer to $7 per barrel. At current Mont Belvieu pricing and assuming cryo recovery, over 90% of anticipated Alpine High NGL barrels would be priced in a range from 55% to 60% of WTI. Based on some of our future pricing assumptions, average NGL realizations could be as high as 70% of WTI. I would also note that the mechanical refrigeration units we currently use for processing leave most of the ethane in the gas stream. As a result, our NGL barrels today are receiving close to 75% of WTI before transportation and fractionation.","Another question we have received is around our long term Waha basis differential assumption of $0.35 per million BTUs. Waha basis has ranged from a $0.37 to $0.53 discount to Henry Hub in the last six months. Prior to that, from 2010 through 2016, that same Waha basis differential range from a $0.69 discount to a $0.42 premium and averaged around $0.15 discount. The forward market view on Waha basis reflects a significant widening of the differential as anticipated production volumes would test takeaway capacity. We see this as a relatively short term risk before additional transport capacity comes online, most likely in 2019. For the long term, we believe Waha basis will trade in a lower range.","Moving now to hedging, we have added some crude oil and natural gas hedges through a mix of financial derivative instruments. As a reminder, the primary goal of our hedging activity is to protect the pace of a strategically important capital program at Alpine High against the risks associated with price sensitivity on cash flows. This continues to be the case as we look to 2018. We do not use hedging to speculate on price.","For 2018, we have currently hedged an average of 55,000 barrels per day in aggregate of WTI and Brent based oil production volumes through a variety of instruments. On the gas side, we have entered into a series of swap transactions that lock in average 2018 pricing at $3.07 per million BTUs for average volumes of 237 million BTUs per day. We have also entered into hedge positions relative to Waha basis.","Most of these hedges are focused on production for the second half of 2018 and the first half of 2019. For this four quarter time period, through a series of swap transactions, we have locked in an average basis differential of a $0.52 discount for 207 million BTUs per day of production. We also have some contractual hedges for Waha basis, which access non Waha based pricing through transportation and sales contracts.","A couple of things to note. First, the actual volumes and pricing of product hedged differs from quarter to quarter. What I gave you were averages for the time periods described. Second, our hedge positions represent only a portion of our anticipated production for any given quarter. They should not be construed to give any guidance as to future production volumes. The details on all of our current hedge positions for the remainder of 2017 and the full years 2018 and 2019 can be seen in our financial and operational supplement posted on our website today with the quarterly earnings press release.","I would like to conclude by emphasizing Apache's financial strength and quarter end cash position of nearly $1.9 billion. This is a product of our disciplined approach over the last few years. Looking ahead, we are well prepared for continued volatility in commodity prices. Our hedge positions provide cash flow support to assure the deployment of high priority investments without putting the balance sheet at risk.","We also have the ability to flex the capital program if that proves to be the best decision for our shareholders. With regard to our capital investment plans, we are carefully weighing the balance between achieving cash flow neutrality and the desire to move forward with investments in 2018 that will optimize long term returns from our asset base. Throughout this effort, we focus on investments that will deliver full cycle economics at current or even lower commodity prices.","With that, I will turn the call over to the operator for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our fresh question comes from the line of Bob Brackett with Bernstein.","Bob Brackett","A question on the US rig program. It looks like you've got four rigs running outside the Permian. Can you talk about what they're doing and would you expect those rigs to be running next year.","Tim Sullivan","Good afternoon, Bob. No, we've got one section in the scoop, where we've had three rigs running there. There are seven wells we're drilling. They will finish up year end and then they will - that's where they'll stop for now. And then in the Panhandle, we've got some acreage that we got two rigs in quickly that are going to get in and drill some footage before year end, the whole block of acreage there. So they're just purely picking up some acreage retention.","Bob Brackett","And can you think about next year? I know you don't want to give a specific guidance. Can you just give us some idea of where the levers are? What assets have the most flexibility to dial up CapEx or dial down CapEx?","Tim Sullivan","I mean if you look at the program, we're in really good shape. I mean we've given you the kind of the range. International is going to be pretty similar in the 700 to 900 range. That's where we can sustain our ability to generate good strong free cash flow there. You look at the rest of the rigs predominantly, we're sitting in the Permian with both our Midland basin and Alpine High and we will have the flexibility to flex there either directions. So we've got a lot of flexibility and you'd see it kind of generally across the Permian.","Bob Brackett","So I guess Alpine High where there are still optionality around retaining acreage might be the least flexible, but everything else has the ability to dial up and down?","Tim Sullivan","Well, even in Alpine High, we've got good flexibility in there. We don't need - we've got six rigs running there today. We would not need all six of those. I mean the nice thing about Alpine High is a lot of that land and we've got some very astute royalty owners with some very large ranches and they recognize that the best way to maximize value for them and us is alignment on how you would handle that. So it's not like we've got a section by section program, where we've got to go out and drill one well across the whole portfolio. So, we've got a lot of flexibility and that count can be scaled up or down pretty easily as well.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Herrlin with Societe Generale.","John Herrlin","Two for me. With the Midland drilling, you were doing 6 to 7 well pads, is that going to be kind of the norm going forward and then the next one for me is on hedging. What's the maximum amount that you will set volumetrically Steve?","John Christmann","So on the pads, John, as you know we've been pretty vocal that you need to be developing all your areas on a section basis. So these have been designed and we've got a couple more pads coming on between now and the end of year. They've been doing our adequate spacing and pattern tests. So that's why there are no half sections, we're kind of doing a half section test pad. So that's what you've had going on in the Midland and it's really defined tune exactly the pattern and the spacing between the various landing zones that we say. Hedging, I'll let Steve.","Steve Riney","John, the question on hedging was what's the maximum volume we would hedge?","John Herrlin","Yeah.","Steve Riney","So we don't - we haven't really thought about what the maximum volume at this point in time. We've hedged - we've begun the hedging process. So I think you got to go back to first of all what's the purpose of hedging and why do we do it. We generally like commodity price exposure that's the business that we're in and we prefer to have it. We hedge for purposes of protecting the capital program against say a low price environment. We began hedging oil and gas for 2018 during the quarter. And we put the positions on that you see in the supplement. We feel like that's a good place to be right now. We feel like the oil price movement has been pretty constructive here recently and we'll continue just to monitor that and align any forward hedging program or activity. With that strategy, we want to make sure that we're protecting the balance sheet and cash flows associated with the capital program that we want to deliver.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Sankey with Wolfe Research.","Paul Sankey","Can I just follow up on the hedging question while we're on it and you explained that some of the force behind it. But you also have repeatedly made the point that you've been relatively cautious over the down cycle and you're going to remain I think, it sounded, let's say, cautious relative to the strip going forward. Isn't that a bit of a belt and braces guys in terms of planning the company just in terms of being both cautious on how you plan and hedged.","Steve Riney","Yeah, maybe so Paul. I don't know, I've never worn belts and braces. I don't think that that's necessarily a bad thing in the price environment that we've come out of over the last couple of years in the volatility associated with it. To be a little bit cautious, a little bit conservative about what we're committing to in the capital program and the liquidity and financial capability of meeting those commitments once we've made them. [indiscernible] maybe a bit on the conservative side on doing that, yes.","We've indicated the volumes that we've had for the quarters out in 2018 and Waha basis hedges for '19 as well. We haven't gotten into what is that relative to anticipated production volume. The only thing I would say is that we are below 50% of our anticipated production volume in almost every product, in almost every quarter for 2018 and definitely 2019 obviously, we don't have any commodity hedges other than the Waha basis. So we've still got a significant amount of unhedged volumes going into 2018.","John Christmann","And one thing I want to add to Paul is, we've done some things to protect the upside to because we like the exposure even on the oil where we've done some collars, we've also bought the coal as well. So it's more geared towards protecting some downside and protecting the balance sheet over the short term than it is trying to make a price collar because we like actually the constructive nature, especially on the oil side.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jeoffrey Lambujon with Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co.","Jeoffrey Lambujon","If the planned midstream monetization is structured, it comes with a large cash payment up front or if commodity prices are materially higher than what you end up budgeting with for next year. Can you just talk through how you'd rank your options for allocating that extra discretionary funding?","John Christmann","The good news is, is with the price movements has gotten very constructive lately. And we find ourselves and can see a price now where we could actually have some free cash flow next year pretty soon. So I mean that puts you in a position to, you know, we've been a company that's maintained our dividend and actually continued to return something to the shareholders over the last three years. So obviously dividend is an option if you look at in terms of - you could be in a position of accretion. Obviously share buybacks or some acceleration, but clearly we would look to find ways to return that to shareholders.","Jeoffrey Lambujon","And then just one last one, looking longer term, starting with the cash balance that you're planning to exit this year with, obviously gives you a lot of flexibility in the near-term to do - to explore some of those options you've mentioned. What does that number look like long terms, is there a steady-state cash balance you have in mind. Thanks.","Steve Riney","I think the steady-state cash balances obviously quite a bit lower than $1.9 billion. We don't anticipate carrying 1.9 billion for obviously for the extended period of time into the future. We do that now because we've got for several reasons. The two most important would be, we've got some debt maturities coming up in 2018 and we want to make sure that we've got the liquidity to handle those as they come due 560 million of debt maturing next year. And then also just having that backstop of cash and liquidity in the event of downside price volatility. We are still exposed to that and we want to make sure that we've got the liquidity to protect ourselves in the event that that occurs. I think as we get Alpine High in particular, so we get to a midstream solution in Alpine High and as we get to Alpine High becoming a larger scale producing asset and is more cash flow generative and supports itself and certainly we don't need 1.9 billion of cash I would say that would be - at a sustained level of cash is certainly below $0.5 billion.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Scott Hanold with RBC Capital.","Scott Hanold","In the Anadarko Basin, you talked about having a few rigs drilling. Is that HBP, some acreage or are you testing a specific concept. And also with the write-off in that area how does that regionally, how does that write-off compare with some of the stuff you're testing right now.","John Christmann","Number one, the write-off is really legacy Anadarko Basin; it's not what we call a SCOOP stack area. So it's going to be more in the Texas panhandle, there's some hangover from the Cordillera transaction many, many years ago. So it's really more just legacy Anadarko Basin acreage have some attractive things in the future, but it's not anything we're funding or planning to fund in the near term. So that's where that is.","And in the SCOOP stack, actually it's in the SCOOP area. We've got a section there that we needed to drill a well to hold, but rather than going in and drilling one well, we got in there and did seven wells because that's a proper way to do that. So we're drilling those seven wells in the in the SCOOP there to meet some lease obligations on a section that we really like. And it gives us the ability to test some spacing and things in the SCOOP as well. So kind of two birds with one stone.","Scott Hanold","And just to clarify and I know you guys are still working the capital budget for '18. Are you comfortable spending a little bit in '18 to keep Alpine High up and running or have those thoughts changed at all.","John Christmann","I mean I would say at this point we're looking at '18 hard. We're watching the commodity price view. We said we will come out with a plan that's kind of predicated on something slightly conservative to strip. So we're watching that very carefully. I think the good news is there's flexibility. I mean we don't have to outspend to keep Alpine High up and running so to say is the way you phrased it. But we're also looking at what we think is the right thing to do in the right pace to develop Alpine High. That we're just going to really maximize long-term returns and that's really what we're trying to accomplish.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs.","Brian Singer","A little bit of a similar take to Scott's last question, I think you posted the industry history about spending in recent years pretty well in the - this asset is the one worth outspending cash flow for a dilemma that you're facing is likely when many companies have faced over the years. To the degree do you decide to out of free cash neutrality? How do you prioritize between Permian and Alpine High, it seems like based on your comments you might flow the Permian. And is there any flexibility internationally or do those assets run in maintenance levels regardless.","John Christmann","Well, it's a little bit of flexibility on the international side, but we kind of laid out that range where we'd like to stay the $700,000 to $900,000. I think there's flexibility in both places. And I'd also remind you that Alpine High is part of Permian. But there's flexibility in both. I mean you wouldn't see us flex one or the other and we're not talking a massive change from what we've laid out in February of this year anyways. That plan was going to be neutral on the upstream spend at a $55 deck and we're not far from that right now. So we're not talking about a lot that we'd have to pare back and it can be flexed into place. And so we'd look at what we thought made the most sense. And that's some of the exercises and scenarios we're running through right now.","Brian Singer","And then on Alpine High, can you talk to a little bit more towards the oil zone opportunities and whether you see a scenario or a likely scenario where you see less volatility and greater predictability of well performance from those zones or should we expect the well may ultimately be perspective and may not necessarily be as consistent.","John Christmann","Well, I mean I think it's just different geology. I mean that's something we've gone to great lengths to explain in terms of a source interval versus a parasequence, which is what the Wolfcamp and the Bone Springs are in the Delaware Basin. So actually if you look at the five wells we've drilled, we're very pleased with the results. Since the disclosure on October 9, we've actually had another one well in there that's cleaned up very, very nicely. So it's actually fairly predictable. We're just talking in terms of the geology. You have to get in and do your rigorous mapping. We have to do the inversion work with the seismic. I mean it's more going to be based on where the organics inside and what's really water wet rock and you have to do the detail work.","But once you've done the detail work, it's going to be pretty predictable. It's just not a blanket you're going to lay across a large area. Most of the locations you know we'd came out with 500 was based on a couple of landing zones, we've in truthfulness we've added another one, so those location counts are going to go up even since the October 9 disclosure. So we see it as a very prominent program. I can tell you most of those are in the northern trough. And the good news is, with every well we drill in Alpine High, we're looking at all those sections. So we see it as a very viable and a very material play that we're going to continue to move forward. And you're going to see the number of landing zones and the location counts grow.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bob Morris with Citi.","Bob Morris","John, you did a nice job last month of laying out the liquids and oil potential an Alpine High. And you sort of touched on this earlier in the Q&A. But you'd been working to try and renegotiate or extend a lot of your leases to be able to accelerate drilling of the shallower zones and still hold those without having to drill to the deeper gassier zones first. How is that progressing? And then, second part of that question is, is there a minimum level of activity or capital spend in 2018 to hold the acreage that you have now that you'd be able to or would want to have to maintain?","John Christmann","There's two things I would say, Bob. Number one, we do have some very sophisticated land owners and we've been making great progress on our discussions with them as well. But it's not a matter of just trying to drill the shallow zones and not drill the deeper zones later. What you really want to do like anything is, you wanted to develop the sections properly and very systematically where we would develop the deeper zones and the shallow zones together where we need to do that. What you don't want to do is come back later and drill deeper after you have develop shallower or you're going to find yourself with some of the challenges that you're seeing in the other parts of the Permian.","Where now they happen to run extra casing strings and things to deal with water flows because you've they're going to run extrication strange things to deal with water flows because you've because you've dealt in depletion and that sort of thing. So contrary to that one of the advantages we have at Alpine High, we've done a lot of data analytics and been recently able to eliminate even a string of seven of 58s on our 14,000 foot TVD wells. So you want to do this properly and I think the conversations we're having with the landowners are constructive and that you want to go about this in the right way where we can develop the wet gas and the oil zones and you want to do them where you don't have to go back in later. So it's more or less of you know developing everything and then margin directionally than it is trying to develop bottom up or come in and develop all your shallow and then have to drill through your shallow to get your deep.","Bob Morris","That made sense, so that would seem instill a little more activity in drilling these wells. So the second part of my question was, in doing all of that, is there a minimum level of activity or capital spend you need to do in 2018 to be able to hold onto leases?","John Christmann","If you look at '18 and I look at Alpine High and if I just if - even if we were to keep a six rig program, less than half of that would be necessary in terms of near term acreage. So I mean, we're in a really good spot.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gail Nicholson with KLR Group.","Gail Nicholson","Looking at the replacement of the Canadian volumes in the year with the Alpine production. That's very impressive especially since now those wells are completed in the optimal manner. When you look at the well count to get to that $50,000 rate by next May, what percentage was optimally completed and what percentage was more science wells?","John Christmann","I mean if you look today, I mean we've been making that shift. And as of the October 9 disclosure we had 34 wells online. And we said we're going to be virtually halfway there year end with I think another eight wells, we're going to bring on 42 by year end. So as we move forward and start to shift into our pattern and spacing tests, you're going to continue to see us start to climb that curve. I'll give you a little bit of a feel for well camps that are necessary to do that.","Gail Nicholson","And then just shifting tack a little bit, I know everyone is trying to talk about cash neutrality and paring back the budget. But looking at the improvement in kind of Brent\/LLS pricing that we've seen to-date. Are there any exploratory projects in the portfolio that look more attractive that you might be willing to spend some capital on next year because of the spread there versus WTI?","John Christmann","I think we're continuing looking at the portfolio and clearly we've got projects in Egypt and the North Sea that have, you know, that are Brent-weighted. We've got some brand new acreage that in Egypt that we just received through the award process. We're anxious to get our seismic shot and we'll actually be drilling wells there. So I think it's more a function of the opportunities as we high grading things, there will be things that we will move up in the portfolio for sure.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Charles Meade with Johnson Rice.","Charles Meade","I wondered if I could push a little bit more on this idea that you put out on your prepared remarks about the optimal investment profile being a little - optimal investment for 2018 being over what you'd look at, if you just fund it with cash flow. I think most of us are understanding that to certainly applied to Alpine High, but I'm curious does that also apply to your Midland program or in other words would you, is the optimal development there, would that call for more than cash flow as well.","John Christmann","I think the thing you got to think about is, number one, we're not far off of that optimal from where we sit today anyway. So and kind of what we laid out at the start of this year would have been what we thought was optimal. So we're not, you know, we're pretty darn close to being that zip code as we sit today. The point is, you always want to balance and what's going to maximize our long-term returns and the pace. And I think the beauty of it is, as it has been alluded to we've got some flexibility, we've got some cash on the balance sheet. You're just trying to balance the right approach. And the good news is, we've got the ability to defer. So those are just some of the trade-offs that you have to balance and that's some of that what I'll call good positive tension.","As you find things and discover things, your goal is to always bring more things into the portfolio that give you opportunities to high grade and pull things forward. And so it's just a good healthy situation and tells you the quality of our portfolio. And the other piece I'll say to that is. you see we're in multi-well pads, we're not out one well here, one well there. And so I think the testing we've been doing in the Midland Basic, we've been building a lot of momentum there. The patterns and spacing tests and things were also moving toward Alpine High. Those are all building towards understanding and to finding that optimal pace because that's how you're going to maximize your long-term returns versus short-term things you can do to manage short term.","Charles Meade","And actually kind of segues to what my next question is, is around what sort of results are we going to see from Midland. If we look at those three pads, where you had those good results, I believe it was [indiscernible] wells on each of those. Is that going to be the bulk of the Midland program in 2018, those big pads or at least moderate sized pads?","John Christmann","Well these are half section type tests. And so, depending on the capital level that we decide to disband, you're going to see us moving more into full section development type mode. And you'll see more similar type things, but that will be hinged on the pace that we want to go. And the beauty of having a lot of inventory that's drill ready and the infrastructure that we put in place puts you in a great position to be able to move forward. But you'll see continued building on pad level type economics because fundamentally we think that's how you're going to create the most value","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Arun Jayaram with J.P. Morgan.","Arun Jayaram","I want to start off, you mentioned in your script how you'd moved some capital from international back to the US. I'm wondering if you could talk about that as well as the prospects for the North Sea and maybe just highlight the results thus far Callater.","John Christmann","I mean, I'd let Tim go into details on Callater, but first two wells that gone on are performing quite well. Any color you want to add Tim to Callater.","Tim Sullivan","The first two wells we brought on, net production was about 19,500 barrels of oil per day. They're currently producing about 13,000 barrels per day right now. We've got another well that will be bringing on shortly. We do have some facility constraints there with our bundle and some surface facilities. But we also have future drilling plans out at Callater as well. So a lot of good things happening there in the North Sea.","John Christmann","And I would say on the capital shift, Arun, it's pretty minor. But it's more geared towards some of the pad testing and things we're doing in the Midland basin.","Arun Jayaram","And just a question, as you guys think about future markets for Alpine High gas. Is obviously the Gulf Coast Express Pipeline, which is the Kinder Pipeline, any thoughts on Apache participating in that long haul pipe?","John Christmann","We're looking at all options. I mean our gas today is flowing into Mexico, but we're certainly not counting on the Mexican market to be the purchaser of all of our gas. We recognize that we've got to be able to move a substantial volume of gas to the Gulf Coast. We're certainly looking at all options associated with that. And for that matter the liquids as well.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Doug Leggate with Bank of America.","Doug Leggate","John, just come back to the relative capital allocation for next year, what's the obligation on from an HBP standpoint in Alpine High that might limit your flexibility there. And what I'm really getting at is that you've obviously got a very strong ratable program in the Midland. I'm just wondering would you tend to skew capital away from the Midland in order to meet HBP or would you want to keep the momentum going in the Midland as well. I've got a follow up please.","John Christmann","No, I mean, I think as I've answered, we're in a good place in both. I think we'll be able to move both programs forward. if you look at current rig count today as I mentioned less than half of the capital we'll be spending this year as we kind of roll forward into next year would be required in terms of how we need to meet lease obligations in the Alpine High. So I think we're in a pretty good zone that we can materially move both programs forward, like we need to move them forward.","Doug Leggate","Is five-rig program is still the right number for avoiding any acreage expiry and so on?","John Christmann","I mean if we look at Alpine High today, I mean, you could see something similar very easily.","Doug Leggate","My follow actually is really going back to the question about the activity level outside of the Permian. I mean, when you look at the returns that you're talking about in the Alpine High, their obviously, they're going to just be anything else in the portfolio it seem so. When you think about the scaling up of that business going forward, what does it say about the high grading of the bonds? I know you've done a lot, but is there more to be done thinking obviously Oklahoma in particular.","John Christmann","Well, I mean I think the key there is, number one, I mean if you look at the portfolio today, we like the balance that we have across the entire portfolio. We like what we have internationally or like what Egypt and the North Sea bringing to the table with exposure to Brent, we think we've got world class operations there and we differentiate ourselves. And so we like having free cash flow that we can invest. We also like the running room and the exposure we have in those two areas. I think it's a very good compliment.","When we look at North America, we're always looking at the portfolio and that's something we will continue to do and continue to do on a daily basis. I like right now we moved up and we've got a nice position in the SCOOP. We could run a couple of rig program up there for several years. And we think it competes fairly nicely. So that's where your rigs are now. But I'll tell you we continue to look at the portfolio, we continue to have those conversations with the board.","And I think the nice thing is, with the, you know, those areas there's a lot of upside and there's very little to hold those positions. And so I think they really create options for us in the future because we can see to a point where we're going to be generating a lot of free cash flow coming out of Alpine High.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Hall with Heikkinen Energy Advisors.","Michael Hall","I guess maybe just continuing on the theme around cash flow neutrality and balance. Two questions I guess, number one, longer-dated, how far out do you see it when Alpine High does become self-sustaining including any midstream spend. And then secondarily, when we talk about cash flow neutrality, just to be clear, is that CapEx plus dividend equals cash flow or is it CapEx equals cash flow\u2026","John Christmann","First of all, if we just take a single rig at Alpine High, it's less than two years before its self-funding. So, it really comes down to pace and how we want to scale that up. I mean that's the way you want to think about that. And that's fully burdened with infrastructure and midstream spend. And then secondly, when we do talk about our numbers, we've got our dividends dialed in. So our dividend payment has been dialed into our capital programs.","Michael Hall","And then I guess on the midstream side, as we think about monetization pads in 2018, can you maybe just kind of talk about the relative pros and cons you see for the different pads available and how important upfront cash flow is relative to longer-dated value capture.","Steve Riney","We're still in early days of looking at that. And looking at the options, we've got a lot to consider. It's not just about the assets that we own, it's about what's going on in the Permian Basin and what's going on between the Permian Basin and the Gulf Coast. So there's a lot of work to do just to get prepared to consider the question that you just asked. We're going to look at it from the perspective of what creates the most value for the shareholders long term and not so much about what creates cash flow in the short term. We'll certainly look at it from the perspective of how does that impact our strategic value for the upstream, making sure that we've still got adequate elements of control if you will to be able to make sure that the midstream serves the purpose of the upstream as opposed to the other way around. But beyond things like that, we're open to quite a few options and exploring what those options ought to look like before we start talking to anybody in earnest in the marketplace.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael McAllister with MUFG.","Michael McAllister","My question has to do with Alpine High midstream, when you talked about the cryogenic facility being built out in 2019, is that early 2019 or mid-2019, what's the thought on that?","Steve Riney","What we're looking at is something that would come available probably in the first half of '19. So it would be - so obviously something that we would start construction on in 2018.","Michael McAllister","And are there mechanical facilities in the budget for 2018 or we're going to just go with the 330 that are expected at the end of this year?","Steve Riney","No, there will be more. There will be more processing in the field during '18.","Michael McAllister","Do have a number or is it just contingent on the budget I guess activity?","Steve Riney","It's something that we haven't shared yet and we'll probably share that when we get to the '18 plan for - that we'll go through in the fourth quarter results in February.","Michael McAllister","What steps have you been taking for - there's not much NGL takeaway from there, what steps is Apache taking on that front.","Steve Riney","By the time we get to a cryo plant, we will obviously need pipe takeaway for liquids as well. So we are looking at that.","Operator","And we have no other question in queue at this time. And I would like to turn the call back over to Gary.","Gary Clark","Thanks everybody for joining us. We look forward to speaking to you again in February. In the meantime if you have any follow ups please call myself or Kian or Patrick on the IR team and we'd be happy to walk through anything you need. Thanks so much. Bye, bye.","Operator","Thank you for your participation. This does conclude today's Apache Corporation third quarter earnings call.

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Patrick Cassidy. Sir, you may begin your conference.","Patrick Cassidy","Thank you, Kendra. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us for Apache Corp.'s Full Year and Fourth Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call. This morning, we reported earnings of $4.5 billion or $11.47 per diluted share. Adjusted earnings, which excluded certain items that impacted comparability of results, totaled $4.7 billion or $11.83 per diluted share. Cash flow from operations totaled $10 billion. ","On today's call, we will have 4 speakers making prepared remarks prior to taking questions. First we will hear from Steve Farris, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; followed by Rod Eichler, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Tom Chambers, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and finally Roger Plank, our President and Chief Corporate Officer. ","We prepared our usual detailed supplemental data package for your use, which also includes a reconciliation of any non-GAAP numbers that we discuss such as adjusted earnings, cash flow from operations or pretax margin. The data package can be found on our website at www.apachecorp.com\/financial data. Today's discussion may contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions, and no assurances can be given that those expectations will be realized. A full disclaimer is located with the supplemental data package on our website. ","With that, I'll turn the call over to Steve.","G. Steven Farris","Thank you, Patrick, and good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Apache had an outstanding year in 2011. We had strong production growth, earnings and cash flow, all delivered with the financial and balance sheet discipline that has characterized our company for 57 years. Apache's global oil and gas production in 2011 was 748,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day, which is 14% growth over 2010 and a new record for us. The strong growth delivery is consistent with our performance over time compared with other companies. Whether it's over the last 5 years or 10 years, Apache gross production posted more than most of its peers, and we do this in a balanced and diversified manner, living within our means. ","Crude oil represented 45% of our 2011 production and if you add NGL, liquids represented 50% of our production. We already have the portfolio balance that most of our peers aspire to obtain at some point in the future. As we grow competitively, we do not sacrifice our balance. 2011 earnings, as Pat mentioned, was $4.5 billion, which was 50% up year-on-year or 36% per share. Our cash flow from operations before working capital items in 2011 stood at $10.2 billion, which was up 39% year-on-year. The driver of this financial performance is, truthfully saying, we focus on rate of return, and it shows. This financial performance will continue to fuel our growth as it continues to increase our investment capacity. Needless to say, 2011 was an excellent year for Apache. ","I'd like now to move to 2012 and talk a little bit about our capital program and our production growth forecast. Our initial exploration and development capital budget for 2012 is $9.5 billion, which is a 25% increase year-on-year on a cash basis, and we'll continue to ramp up our activity in the Permian, the Anadarko wash fairways and development projects in deepwater Gulf of Mexico and also our global exploration. We live within our means, and we do it consistently. I would say at strip prices, this initial 2012 capital program leaves us with well over $1 billion of operating cash flow surplus. As we always do, we will put our additional investment firepower to use as we go through the year. ","In the Permian alone, our initial budget increased from $1.1 billion in 2011, and I might add it was $500 million in 2010. In 2012, we'll spend $1.7 billion, and depending on commodity prices, we expect to at least double last year's price. We expect to grow production between 7% and 13% in 2012, which excludes operations divested in 2011. And we delivered this competitive growth with less than half of our capital. As Roger will outline in greater detail, over half of our 2012 capital program goes to projects to grow our production starting in 2013 and beyond. ","In 2012, we're also stepping up our global exploration activity, and I'd like to briefly list a number of our key exploration steps for 2012. In the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, we expect to participate in 6 oil prospects with a combined potential of well over 600 million barrels of oil equivalent, and we continue to grow our footprint and prospect pipeline there. In Alaska, we will grow our first wells in the Cook Inlet, which is a [indiscernible] oil exploration play, where we are the largest acreage holder with some over 800,000 acres. In the onshore North America, we're taking advantage of our premiere acreage positions to progress new liquids plays in which we have critical mass such as the Canyon Wash and the Texas Panhandle, where we were the first movers last year and are now shifting to the development phase with 14 wells in the play. A number of new plays in the Permian, including the Wolfcamp Shale play, where we're going to test our 25,000 acreage position there. Deepwater Kenya, we intend to drill our first major oil prospects in the third quarter for the potential of nearly 300 million barrels of oil equivalent and the opportunity to de-risk several additional prospects. In New Zealand, we expect to drill our first 4 wells targeting our new onshore unconventional play. We will also continue our exploration in Australia and Egypt, where we have built so much value through the exploration over the years, and we will continue to add new large-scale exploration positions, some of which we are not ready to announce. ","We also started increasing our dividend in 2012, as you've noticed. Steady dividend growth has been an important element of our financial strategy over time. We put this on hold as the world went through its turmoil over recent years, but we believe it is the right time to resume our dividend growth. ","Apache's mission is to build long-term value for our shareholders, and we remain confident that our fundamental value will be recognized. We're going to give some assistance from our portfolio evolution and more communication about our unbooked resource potential in the coming years. Over time, the market tends to recognize fundamental performance and in the long term, Apache share price has historically outperformed most of our peers, which is consistent with our leading growth and return delivery. ","I'd like to point out that over the last 24 months we have increased our North American proved reserves by almost 50%, which includes our latest acquisition in the Anadarko Basin. Further, our 18 million acres in the heart of the Permian, the Anadarko Basin, Canada's resource plays in the Gulf of Mexico hold a premiere position of unbooked upside in most new plays across those areas. And it's time we gained recognition for our North American asset base, and we intend to communicate more on our resource upside during this year. ","On the other hand, Egypt and the Gulf of Mexico shelf have caused concern over time based on the perceived overexposure for the company. Clearly, the events in Egypt have had an impact on our share price over the last year. However, in light of our enlarged portfolio, which includes our announced expansion in the Anadarko wash fairway, either of these regions now represent more than 10% of our proved reserves. Having said that, we remain bullish on both of them. We expect to continue to invest both in Egypt and Gulf of Mexico shelf for many years to come. The fact is with our enhanced portfolio balance, Apache continues to deliver strong growth without depending on any one region. ","And with that, I'd like to turn it over to our COO, Rod Eichler.","Rodney J. Eichler","Thanks, Steve. I'll focus my remarks on our 2012 plans based on the initial allocation of capital and what this means in terms of production for each of our regions. The biggest drivers for our growth in exploration in the year ahead include the following: the Permian and Anadarko basins, where we are going to step up our activity by close to $1 billion; the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, where we are broadening our participation in high-impact prospects such as appraisal drilling at Heidelberg and moving into the development of megaprojects such as at Lucius, where our first test well last year flowed at 15,000 barrels of oil per day, a rate that was constrained by a surface test equipment. ","In Australia, we've entered full development at Wheatstone LNG, Apache's first LNG project. In our global exploration, our efforts over recent years are now translating to big steps forward across a number of new portfolio positions. During the year ahead, we expect to run between 90 and 95 operated rigs worldwide on a daily basis. This is up from the 80 rigs we averaged during 2011. We are planning up to a 30% increase in new wells drilled, which represents approximately 300 additional wells compared to the 1,100 wells drilled last year. More than half of all planned wells will be drilled in the Permian and Anadarko basins as we exploit their liquid-rich stacked pay opportunities. Across our portfolio, a shift is underway to Apache to direct our drilling to more profitable oil and NGL opportunities. This will be most evident in North America. Our supplemental disclosure document posted on our website outlines Apache's 2012 capital by region. It can be found on Page 10. ","I'll move on now to discussing our recent highlights. We continue to ramp up activity in the Permian, where we have been active since 1991 and are now the second-largest player in the basin. The increase and acceleration of activity in this region has been steep. Until 2009, the area was managed from our Tulsa office. We opened our Midland office in 2010 with a half dozen employees operating 5 rigs executing a $500 million capital program. Last year, we spent about $1.1 billion and increased the rig count to 25. Today, we have more than 200 employees in our regional office, with 480 field staff. We operate 30 drilling rigs and more than twice that many pulling units and plan to spend $1.7 billion in the region during 2012 as we continue the steady ramp-up of our drilling program. We plan to drill more than 600 wells in the Permian this year and expect mid-single-digit production growth in 2012, and the true contribution of this investment will be realized in 2013. We expect to increase our pace of activity overall in the Permian throughout the year. ","The Wolfcamp play in the Deadwood area will continue to represent about half of our Permian activity in 2012. In the past year, we've cut drilling time in half, further enhancing the already attractive economics of this play. During 2012, we're going to be active in just about every play and area of the Permian basin. ","I'd like to talk briefly about a couple of our catalysts in the region. In November, I mentioned the first 2 horizontal wells Apache drilled in lower Cline. We've now drilled 4 lower-Cline horizontal wells at various locations across our 100,000-acre Deadwood leasehold. These wells are contributing -- 3 wells are producing in this 5,500-foot lateral, and a fourth is being prepared for fracture stimulation. Results from the last 2 wells indicate initial production rates of 300 barrels of oil per day and 200 Mcf of gas per day, with expected EURs of 300,000 barrels of oil equivalent per well. Based on this early success, there are potentially an additional 565 resource locations on our current leases. We anticipate drilling up to 4 lower-Cline horizontals in 2012 and testing 2 additional shales in the Atoka, Barnett and the Wolfcamp formations on this acreage. ","In the Southern Midland Basin, we leased 20,000 acres in the Wolfcamp shale play in Irion County, which brings our total to 25,000 acres. This is in addition to 31,000 acres in the form of BP leasehold we have in the same area. And during 2012, we plan to drill up to 6 horizontal wells on these properties. We currently think there's potential for up to 150 locations, horizontal wells in this area. ","Apache has built a 30,000-acre position in the Bone Spring and Wolfbone plays in the Delaware basin. We currently estimate up to 130 horizontal locations and 160 vertical locations on our position. In 2012, we plan to drill 2 or 3 wells at both the Bone Spring and Wolfbone plays in Loving and Pecos County, Texas. We're still determining the size, but each of these opportunities has the potential resource of drilling backlog for extensive, long-life development. As we drill more wells and collect more data this year, we'll be able to disclose more about our Permian plays. We plan to conduct a detailed review of our Permian resource potential at our Analyst Day in midyear. ","I'll move on now to the central region of Oklahoma to Texas Panhandle. We will more than double our position at the Anadarko wash play fairway to more than 1 million acres or 487,000 net acres through the Cordillera acquisition announced last month. Together, Apache and Cordillera are currently running 17 rigs in the region and will assume operatorship of Cordillera's rigs when the deal closes, which is expected in the second quarter. By closing, we expect to have up to 25 rigs operating on the combined properties. We plan to drill up to 160 wells in the Cordillera acreage alone, principally in the liquids-rich Granite Wash and the Tonkawa and Cleveland oil plays. As a result, in 2012 we expect to increase our annual production from this region by nearly 50% on our continuing operations. This excludes East Texas, which has been divested and represents about 6,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2011. ","As announced in the news release this morning, we also added 96,000 acres to our position in the Bivins Ranch area. Our initial exploratory results in the emerging Wittenburg Basin play had been very encouraging, with 3D 30-day production ranging from 107 barrels of oil and 42 Mcf of natural gas per day to more than 1,000 barrels of oil and 800 Mcf of gas per day. We completed a 240 square mile 3D shoot on the property during 2011, which we're using to further de-risk in the 5 future drilling locations. Our breadth and scale across these plays allows us to generate efficiencies to increase the value of our position. In the Granite Wash alone, we've been able to reduce costs $500,000 per well by optimizing our casing design, reducing pump volumes and changing profit type. Across the region, we've implemented a fracture database to allow us to reduce frac size and reduce costs by more than 25%. We will continue to pursue these kinds of improvements as we simulate Cordillera assets into Apache. ","The Gulf of Mexico shale continued to fuel our investment firepower with strong free cash flow generation and attractive returns. We manage the shale as a financial investment, perhaps the best one we've ever made and that is a growth region. Production there is expected to decline in the high-single-digit range during 2012 as we have channeled most of its cash flow to growth areas in our portfolio. However, we will increase our activity in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico in 2012. ","On the development front, we approved the Lucius development project in December, and its first oil date is scheduled in 2014. Heidelberg, another potential 200 million barrel oil development is currently drilling an appraisal well in Green Canyon Block 903. In the year ahead, we expect to commence production from the Bushwood, Mandy and Wide Berth subsea tieback developments, increasing our production for this region by close to 15%. ","We also have a mix of prospect types that we'll test this year, including sub-salt and salt overhang targets, where new seismic techniques, particularly one asset's data acquisition and processing, are improving our ability to manage areas that have historically been difficult to manage and interpret. We plan to drill and participate in up to 9 wells in 2012, including appraisals at Lucius and Heidelberg. This also includes 6 exploration prospects with more than 600 million barrels of potential resource and where Apache's working interest average is 35%. ","In our Gulf Coast onshore region, we grew our acreage position significantly last year. Rates of return in this traditional hydrocarbon-rich area are robust, and our willingness to seek opportunities away from the herd puts us in a position to have a double-digit production growth in this region in 2012. We expect to run 3 rigs and drill more than 30 wells, nearly all of them targeting oil reservoirs. ","Turning to Canada, Apache holds approximately 7.5 million gross acres in Western Canada. And while the region was generally thought as a gas province, we have a substantial multiyear inventory of oil and liquids-rich opportunities, as well as dry gas. 3\/4 of Apache's 170 wells planned for Canada in 2012 are currently oil- or liquids-rich reservoirs. We plan to average a 5-rig program for the year, growing production by more than 5%. 80% of our activity will be focused on oil plays, the Glacier, Viking and EOR oil plays, and the Bluesky liquids-rich gas play. We progressed the Glacier oil play to the development stage during the fourth quarter, with 3 horizontal wells tested at an initial rate of approximately 80 barrels of oil per day. We currently hold approximately 162,000 net acres in this shallow drilling play. This success sets up a 37-well program for this year, with EURs ranging from 80,000 to 130,000 barrels of oil equivalent per well. We continue to expand the fairways of these plays in our portfolio as we also test additional oil and liquid plays. Our transition in Canada is well underway, but the step change will come with the Kitimat LNG project. LNG gas sale negotiations continue to move forward, as do all development preparation elements of the project. We will announce further developments at the appropriate time as we progress towards final investment decision. Apache's first mover steps to secure a development-ready integrated LNG project at a very low cost continues to look better and better for our shareholders. ","In Australia, we're going to double our investment in 2012 as we move into the heart of the construction phase with a number of major projects. It will provide Apache with growth for many years. The largest component of our investment in the Wheatstone LNG project, which will provide us with a multi-decade visible free cash flow profile that is oil-linked, provides a steady plateau profile year after year and, in fact, has growth potential via expansion phases. Because of the long lead times out of our developments and the timing when all of these projects come online, the production profile of Australia can be lumpy. We expect this region's production to decline in the high single digits for 2012, which is absorbed by the rest of our portfolio as this exploration-driven region continues to develop projects that drive Apache's future growth trajectory. Australia exploration will be active in 2012 on multiple fronts. Most important would be our de-risking of resources to potentially support additional LNG trains and premium-priced domestic gas projects. This includes appraisal of the Zola area, a 2011 gas discovery on trend with the multi-Tcf Gorgon Field and the BHP-operated [indiscernible] exploration prospect. ","In our Egypt region, 2011 was a year of production growth, with net oil production up 5%. One of the more active and successful drilling areas in Egypt last year were the development leases acquired for BP. Since November 2010, we've drilled 31 wells in our exploration program as a result of the 3 new field discoveries and 2 new field extensions. Oil production here has increased 60% to 34,000 barrels of oil per day, and gas production is 140% higher at nearly 90 million cubic feet gas per day. One exploration well of note is the Spyglass 1x on the AG development lease that tested at a daily rate of 21 million cubic feet gas per day and more than 400 barrels of oil per day for the lower Bahariya formation. ","In 2012, we plan to maintain our 2011 level of investment and growth in Egypt, running 25 rigs and drilling more than 250 wells. Up to 70 of these wells will be exploration test. We are advancing important new exploration plays across our 11 million gross acres in Egypt. These new plays include stratographic traps, the deeper horizons in the Paleozoic and unconventional resources. Like the Permian and Anadarko basins, the Western Desert provides multiple stacked pay opportunities. Each one of these plays has the potential to give our asset base in Egypt entire new decades of life cycle beyond the current successes. ","In the North Sea, we closed the ExxonMobil transaction at the end of the fourth quarter, which gives us a greatly expanded asset base and talent pool going into 2012. We expect to run 6 rigs during 2012 and build 33 wells. The Forties Field, previously our sole asset in the region, represents half of our drilling capital in 2012 as we increase our opportunity set with new wells at Beryl, Bacchus and an active exploration program. These important steps will propel our North Sea production to a 60% increase or more in 2012. ","The foundation for continued growth in 2013 will also be strengthened during this year as we install additional platform in 40s and acquire the first field-wide 3D seismic survey over Beryl in 15 years. ","Finally in Argentina, we maintain our financial discipline by living within our cash flow as we advance the appraisal of what is believed to be one of the largest shale resource basins of any country outside the United States, and Apache is the leading North American company in the shale fairway. Most importantly, Argentina in 2012, we plan to conduct the first oil test in our shale play position. Our acreage is adjacent to the recent wells drilled by YPF at Loma La Lata. Development drilling in areas tied to premium-priced gas plus contracts is expected to drive our Argentina production growth above 5% in 2012. ","That concludes the operational highlights, and I'll now turn it over to Tom Chambers.","Thomas P. Chambers","Thanks, Rod, and good afternoon, everyone. I'd like to reiterate what Steve mentioned earlier in that we had record results for the year across the board. Underpinning our 2011 financial results was record production, which averaged 748,000 barrels of oil a day, up 14% from the prior year. More importantly, we achieved record oil production of 340,000 barrels per day, allowing us to benefit from higher oil price realizations. For the year, we reported record earnings of $4.5 billion or $11.47 per diluted share, our first time to break the $10 threshold. When we remove items for comparability purposes, adjusted earnings were $11.83 per share, up 32% from the prior-year period. Record production and oil prices drove cash from operations before working capital items, up 39% to $10.2 billion, our best year ever. ","In a nutshell, it was a phenomenal year in all respects. Record cash flow enabled us to fund our largest E&D capital budget, acquired assets for another $2 billion in cash, which provide a future platform for continued long-term profitable growth, while we also paid down $925 million in debt. So we were able to end the year and reduce our debt-to-cap 20%. ","I want to highlight the importance of our portfolio's ability to consistently generate cash flow. For 2011, our $10 billion of operating cash flow enabled us to achieve many targeted goals and set the stage for continued growth into 2012. Without the constraint of having to pay down debt in 2012, the 2012 capital budget spending rises, as Steve indicated. However, I would emphasize that our disciplined approach reduced capital on a quarterly basis to ensure we do not outspend our cash flow or, if prices rise significantly, to potentially allocate any excess to the best projects available. These results speak volumes for our balanced portfolio strategy given the significant volatility seen in commodities. We've been able to benefit substantially from our oil portfolio and the fact that oil currently sells for over 40x the price of North American gas. Our oil balance also offers us a unique benefit when it comes to price. Dated Brent and sweet crude from the Gulf of Mexico and the Gulf Coast onshore areas continue to be priced at a significant premium to WTI-based prices. Approximately 75% of our total production receives Brent index or Brent comparable index pricing, realizing premiums of $10 to $15 a barrel to WTI. Our North American gas prices remain depressed. Our international portfolio is providing access to rising gas prices, particularly in Argentina and Australia, as you heard Rod just mention. Compared to the prior year, our international gas price realizations were up 27%. Higher realizations and a steady commitment to holding a line on costs allowed us to report solid cash margins of $45.60 per boe, up 30% over 2010 levels. Pretax margins, which includes DD&A, increased 37% to $29.64 per barrel of oil equivalent. These closely watched measures, combined with our focus on returns, drove our return on average capital employed to over 13% for 2011. We are very focused on margins and continue to monitor cost trends. Total cash costs during the year averaged $16.24 per boe, up $0.86 over last year. As with each year, our goal is to keep 2011 cash costs flat with the previous year. We ended up slightly at 6% higher, influenced by the impact of rising oil prices on cost and continued market pressures in nearly all of our regions. Absent taxes other than income, which are basically production taxes linked to prices, we are focused on keeping 2012 cash costs in the range of $13 to $13.50 per boe for the full year average. Our recurring DD&A was also up in 2011 from prior-year levels, as you might expect with our recent acquisition activity. Through our drilling program, we added more -- we more than replaced current production by adding 342 million barrels of oil equivalent to proved reserves during 2011. That's about 125% of what we've produced during the year. Including acquisitions, sales and revisions, we replaced 113% of production. We believe our exceptional cash flow provides a critical foundation as we head into 2012. With the confidence of continued strong future growth prospects and financial position, our Board of Directors, at their last meeting, increased the regular quarterly cash dividend 13% to $0.17 per share, as Steve already indicated. The board also indicated they will continue to review the dividend level annually as our progress -- as we progress further. ","To wrap up, we had a record year, one that provided our best financial results in the company's history, one that is ended with a considerable amount of momentum and one that sets the stage for continued growth and opportunity into 2012. ","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Roger.","Roger B. Plank","Thanks, Tom, and good afternoon, everyone. 2011 was, indeed, another year of growth and change for Apache, and I wanted to just take a moment to reflect on how the company's evolved over the last few years. In a deteriorating price environment for North American natural gas, in the last 2 years Apache turned $7.5 billion in cash flow to $17.5 billion. Through drilling and acquisitions, we've invested $25 million, expanding our production and rebalancing our portfolio in areas with considerable future growth prospects. To manage this change and maintain focus on executing and delivering consistent profitable growth, we've added hundreds of professionals and, importantly, 3 new growth regions: deepwater, Gulf Coast onshore and the Permian Basin. In addition, recent changes in our central region, including the Cordillera transaction, will transform its legacy Apache region into one of our most active drilling regions focused on drilling oil and liquids production. ","The changes have the affect of beefing up our portfolio in North America and today, onshore North America represents 38% of our worldwide production compared to 28% just 2 years ago. On a pro forma basis, including Cordillera, no single region accounts for more than 1\/5 of our total production. Although our geographic mix has shifted, our production mix has not. Half our production remains liquids, in which 90% is oil. Another aspect of Apache's portfolio evolution is the inclusion of a growing number of long lead times, impactful development and infrastructure projects. More than half of our 2012 capital goes to projects that contribute no production this year, but will contribute meaningful volumes in 2013 and beyond. In fact, following additional investment, we expect these projects will add hundreds of thousands of equivalent barrels to our daily production spread out over the next 5 years. ","Fortunately, we have the portfolio diversity and financial strength to make these significant long-term investments while still delivering near-term profitable growth. We've also evolved our approach to global exploration. We've established meaningful position through joint venture agreements and acreage acquisitions in frontier areas mentioned earlier, Cook Inlet in Alaska, New Zealand and offshore Kenya. Each of these positions target oil and we believe hold hundreds of millions of barrels of resource potential. While unproven at present, we believe it's just a matter of time before our exploration strategy gains legs and begins to pay off. ","At the end of the day, we aren't too concerned whether our production comes through acquisition of drillbit, but we do recognize the potential value of internally generated prospect development and active exploration. Apache's changes come amid a rapidly changing industry and world. The lowest North American natural gas prices in a decade are squeezing industry cash flows and capital investment. After visiting double-digit natural gas prices, the industry is finally reaching a point of capitulation where companies are beginning to pull on their horns due to lack of funding. This process has a cleansing effect. With industry laying down gas rigs, the upward pressure on cost for drilling, completions and other services is beginning to subside. Lower cash flow and capital in the hands of the competition will also lead to more attractive opportunities to drill and acquire. Frankly, it makes for an ideal environment for well-heeled companies with strong cash flows, such as Apache, to excel. ","In closing, following a year of record financial results driven by our 31st year of production growth out of the last 33, Apache has all the ingredients to deliver standout results again in 2012. ","Patrick?","Patrick Cassidy","That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we're ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question is from Brian Singer of Goldman Sachs.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Two questions. First on the Cline shale, how does the Cline compete with other horizontal and vertical opportunities that you're pursuing in the Permian Basin? And can you talk to what your well cost expectations are there relative to the EURs that you mentioned earlier?","G. Steven Farris","Well honestly, Brian, I think it's a little early to tell how they can be. But with our portfolio, we are going to test most of the plays and the horizontal plays out there, whether it be the Wolfcamp shale or the Cline. And frankly, we're looking for the highest rate of return. I think Rod mentioned 300,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day with a cost of what, Rod?","Rodney J. Eichler","Completed well cost around $6.5 million.","G. Steven Farris","Yes, completed well cost $6.5 million, so it will compete with most shale plays.","Operator","And your next question is from Pearce Hammond of Simmons & Company.","Pearce W. Hammond - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","You outlined your production growth for this year at 7% to 13%, and you made some smart acquisitions in the course of the last year, the North Sea acquisition and here recently, Cordillera. If we try to look at just the organic production growth rate without the acquisitions, what do you think it might break out to be?","G. Steven Farris","Well honestly, we don't break that out. I will tell you probably in the high single digits.","Operator","Your next question is from John Herrlin of Societe Generale.","John P. Herrlin - Societe Generale Cross Asset Research","Two quick ones. In terms of your CapEx budget, how much is actually exploration and how much is development, because you just depict it as E&D.","G. Steven Farris","Well, whether it's in the regions or new ventures group, it's about $1 billion.","John P. Herrlin - Societe Generale Cross Asset Research","Okay, that's fine. Next one for me is on Egypt, Steve. Your reserves went down out a little bit year-over-year. Were there performance issues because you had negative revisions? Normally, you have positive revisions there. And that's it for me.","G. Steven Farris","Actually, what we had is we had a negative revision, but it all has to do with price. John, you're aware of that concession agreement. What happens is you get more barrels for cost recovery, but you also have an adjustment on the reserve side. So that's counterintuitive. I mean, when you have more production, you have less reserves. And if you have less production, you have more reserves. I mean, it really is the way the concession agreement works.","Roger B. Plank","So because we got to recover our costs, the higher the price per barrel, the lower the reserves you get to report. But the actual reserves performance has been just fine.","Operator","And your next question is from Bob Brackett of Bernstein Research.","Bob Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","One of your competitors has talked about a JV or a sale of kind of 1 million acres scale asset in the Permian Basin. What's your appetite for that sort of scale transaction?","G. Steven Farris","Well, we don't really comment on that, number one. And the other one is I think we have a pretty good acreage position as it is. Actually we are never looking, but opportunities come in a lot of different ways.","Operator","Your next question is from Leo Mariani from RBC.","Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Just kind of 2 quick questions here for you. I guess first off, could you maybe elaborate a little bit on your progress there on Kitimat? You guys kind of  advanced negotiations with potential buyers. And a quick question here on the Permian. Obviously, you're stepping up the capital pretty dramatically here in 2012. And if I heard you guys right, you talked about mid-single-digit production growth in the Permian in '12. It just seemed like a low number to me. Is there some infrastructure issues there? Or maybe I misheard you guys.","G. Steven Farris","Yes, I'd answer the first one at Kitimat. Frankly, we're somewhat past the polite introductions and that kind of stuff with respect to buyers. We are now in throes of actual negotiations. And in terms of the Permian Basin, you understand we're the second or third largest producer out there, so you've got 93,000, 94,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day starting off with. So a higher single-digit growth is a pretty good number, especially with the kind of capital that we're putting in there.","Rodney J. Eichler","There's also a lot of timing involved. We have a lot of wells that are being drilled throughout the year. All those wells probably won't make it out to production until the early parts of 2013.","Operator","Your next question is from John Malone of Global Hunter Securities.","John Malone - Global Hunter Securities, LLC, Research Division","Just on Argentina, can you guys give us any color on the [indiscernible] well? The indication so far is gas. Have you seen any liquids in that? And really just overall, can you give us some thoughts on trends, what you're seeing in Argentina in terms of export and patriation, the politics down there?","Rodney J. Eichler","Well, the exploration test we drilled at [indiscernible] in 2011 was specifically targeting the shales in the gas window. So it was a gas -- designed to be a gas test. That's what we have been evaluating. The subsequent wells we'll be drilling in 2012, as I mentioned, will be oil tests that are in the shale oil window as we currently mapped them adjacent to the recent discoveries announced by their operators.","G. Steven Farris","With respect to your question about the politics down there, I think it's well to take a look at the circumstances that YPF, Repsol and the government of Argentina are in. I don't think there's any question that the Argentine government would like more money spent by YPF or Repsol in country. Personally, I think what you're seeing is a lot of discussion that really revolves around a specific issue. So we're truthfully not concerned about the wholesale expropriation of the oil industry down there.","Rodney J. Eichler","In fact, Apache has been held up by the government in their recent press releases as one of several companies and an example of increasing the production and meeting or exceeding their production targets outlined in their concession agreements.","Operator","And your next question is from Mario from Tuohy Brothers.","Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","It's actually Craig Shere. Mario had to jump off, but we have a quick question as a follow-up on Argentine also. Can you remind us how large the acreage positions are and the gas fee and then the oil shale windows and if you're still looking to expand acreage in either of those? And remind us the details regarding the 2012 drilling effort in the oil shale.","Rodney J. Eichler","Okay. So the first part of your question, we have about 1.7 million gross acres, about 900,000 net acres in the shale fairway. We do not break that out; I don't have a breakout of that by oil province or gas province in that fashion. So it's a simple part of the Neuqu\u00e9n Basin. The second part of your question was what was...","Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Capital.","Rodney J. Eichler","Capital in 2011?","Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","2012.","Rodney J. Eichler","2012. All right, 2012. We're looking at about $250 million as a preliminary capital allocation for our Argentina projects.","G. Steven Farris","Just so you know, that's not an opportunity number. That is more of a prudency with respect to staying within our cash flow down there. And we're really testing ideas. If you look at any of our areas, when we talk -- Brian asked a question about the Permian Basin. We have built meaningful acreage positions in some of the best hydrocarbon basins in the world. And what we are trying to do is build long-term value for our shareholders. So in the Permian, we're going to test a number of different shales in a number of different ways, horizontal, and the same we're doing in the Neuqu\u00e9n. And we are a legacy owner in the Anadarko Basin. So it's not surprising that new technology catches up with a lot of hydrocarbons.","Operator","And there are no further questions at this time.","Patrick Cassidy","Okay, thank you, Kendra, for those remarks, and thank you for participating in Apache's conference call this afternoon.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Apache Corporation Fourth Quarter 2012 Earnings Release Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instruction) in order to make sure that everyone has a chance to ask a question, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question,(Operator Instruction).","At this time I would like to introduce your presenter for today Mr. Brady Parish, Vice President of Investor Relation. Mr. Parish, you may begin your conference.","F. Brady Parish","Thank you Ally, good morning everyone and thank you for joining us for Apache Corporation's full year and fourth quarter 2012 earning conference call. This morning we reported 2012 earnings of $1.9 billion or $4.92 per diluted share, adjusted earnings, which excludes certain items that impact the comparability of results totaled $3.8 billion or $9.48 per diluted share. Cash flow from operations totaled $10.2 million.","On today\u2019s call, we will have three speakers making prepared remarks prior to taking questions. First, we will hear from Steve Farris, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; followed by Rod Eichler, President and Chief Operating Officer; and finally, Tom Chambers, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","We've prepared our quarterly financial supplemental data package for your use, which also includes the reconciliation of any non-GAAP numbers that we discuss such as adjusted earnings, cash flow from operations or pre-tax margins. In addition, new for this quarter, we have prepared an operations supplement to summarize our activities across the various Apache regions. These can both be found on our website at www apachecorp.com\/financialdata.","Today\u2019s discussions will contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions based on our current views and most reasonable expectations. However, a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from what we discuss today. A further disclaimer is located with the supplemental data package on our website.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Steve.","G. Steven Farris","Thank you, Brady, and good afternoon, everyone, and thank all of you for joining us. Apache achieved some new milestones in 2012 and first of all, despite significant downtime we grew our average annual production to 779,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day, almost 5.5% above 2011 if you adjust for dispositions, which is a new record for Apache. And as a matter of information, and I assure you not an excuse, I would like to point out had we not experienced the unplanned downtime in the North Sea and Hurricane Isaac in the Gulf of Mexico during just the third quarter.","Our production growth would have been 6.3%. More importantly, during the fourth quarter, we averaged 800,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day, the first time in our company's history which establishes a strong base as we enter 2013. And despite as Brady pointed out, despite much weaker North American natural gas prices, our balanced portfolio enabled us generate $10.2 billion of cash flow consistent with 2011. I'd also like to point out, driving this impressive cash flow were our liquids revenues which constituted 81% of our overall $17 billion in revenues for the year, and North American natural gas accounted for only 11%.","By the end of the year, we had fully integrated our Midcontinent North Sea portfolio expansions and we really hit our stride in our large Permian position. As a result, we built operational momentum heading into 2013. We have become the most active Permian basin player with 38 operated rigs and we plan to increase our horizontal rig fleet to half of our total operated rigs during the year. We've also become a leader in the Midcontinent liquids and oil plays, increasing our horizontal drilling activity from six rigs at the beginning of 2012 to 25 today.","At the end of the year, we advanced the Kitimat LNG project by increasing our interest to 50% and expanding our strategic relationship with Chevron, so we believe this is the financial and technical LNG wherewithal to complement on our upstream strength, and it should help us accelerate our plants to monetize the over 50 Tcf of natural gas that we have in Liard and Horn River, importantly at the oil-linked prices.","I am sure all of you have noted in our earnings release this morning, during 2012 we replaced 156% of our production before revisions. Excluding property acquisitions this replacement ratio would be 131%.","Low prices in Canada for natural gas during the year was a predominant driver of the negative revision of 299 million barrels of oil equivalent, in fact it\u2019s over 90% of that number. With this transition behind us, we\u2019re going to move into 2013 with our initial capital budget set at $10.5 billion which is essentially flat with a 2% year-over-year from 2012.","Our capital allocation for 2013 really reflects our choice to deliver competitive near-term performance while building balanced long-term value for our shareholders. Approximately $4 billion of our capital would be invested in Onshore U.S., but we expect production to grow in excess of 20%, 2013 driven primarily by our Permian and Central Region drilling programs.","We also project our North American oil productions to grow by 14% in 2013, which was up from 12% in 2012. Furthermore our 2013 planned costs for $2.2 billion investments in ten long year infrastructure projects which represents nearly 21% of our total 2013 capital.","As a result of this capital allocation choice and taking into consideration production declines in certain of our regions we expect total production to grow by 3% to 5% in 2013. Just for comparison purposes, and using our budgeted economics, if we instead use this long-term capital investment to fund additional drilling in the Onshore U.S. our projected 2013 growth rate would be in excess of 6%.","Based on our current ownership of these long-term projects, these projects are expected to contribute 150,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day over the next five years and over 200,000 barrels of oil equivalent by the end of the decade.","As a result of our two major LNG projects, production for our development pipeline is expected to continue to increase over 200,000 of oil a day before settling into a zero decline multi-decade plateau. We have built this company by focusing on returns, balance and long-term value.","Over the last three years, we have deepened and strengthened our portfolio. We now have over 9 billion barrels of oil equivalent unbooked resource in our Permian and Mid-Continent positions. That is second to none. We have a robust project pipeline in motion that will provide a stable base of free cash flow for decades and we have broad exposure to quality resource and exploration opportunities around the world.","On a broader and deeper footprint, provides us the opportunity to optimize our portfolio. And as such, we are in the process of identifying approximately $2 billion of asset rationalizations to be completed during 2013. We're not in a position to get into specific details at this time, but having acquired $16 billion of assets over the past three years, and strengthening our asset base, we have been in the process of reviewing our overall portfolio. We are here for one purpose and that is to generate long-term profitable growth for our shareholders. And we truly believe we can continue on that mission.","Finally, another important item of note is that last week our Board approved increasing our common dividend by 18% from 17% to $0.20 per share. This follows our increase from 2012 of 13%. We remain confident in Apache's ability to continue growing profitably and see dividend growth as an important component of shareholder returns.","So with that, I\u2019ll hand it over to Rod Eichler, our COO.","Rodney J. Eichler","Thank you, Steve. Good afternoon. As Brady previously mentioned, we have compiled an operations supplement for your use which highlights our activities by region during the fourth quarter. We have put this together in an effort to be responsive to feedback we have received and hope you find it useful. In this supplement, we have provided detailed operational information for the fourth quarter. We also like to highlight some of our most notable achievements during 2012.","Firstly, with our growth in the U.S. onshore sea drilling. Combined, our Permian and Central regions grew production nearly 24% year-over-year and represent 25% of Apache's total global production by the fourth quarter and 197,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. As impressive as these results are the reality is we're just in the early stages of our growth as each region evolves in a full-scale development. In the Permian Central alone, we have identified over 9 billion barrels of oil equivalent of resource potential to further fuel our liquids-rich gas and oil production growth to unfold.","In addition, we are in the process of completing our resource assessment in Canada for liquids-rich gas and oil opportunities with approximately 7 million gross acres in the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin. We anticipate identifying thereby in several thousand economic wells in our various plays which should allow us to add another North American onshore growth region as we ramp up activity over the next couple of years.","We also successfully integrated the barrel properties into our North Sea region. We have spent the last year preparing for drilling campaign that will test new opportunities based on the first 3D seismic acquired over these fields since 1998. Finally, we replaced over 130% of our production through drill bit and approximately 156% when you include the acquisitions; this obviously excludes the impact of later revisions, which primarily resulted from weak North American natural gas prices during 2012 versus 2011.","Looking ahead, I want to focus the remainder of my remarks on our plans for this coming year. Our plans are based upon our initial $10.5 billion allocation of capital, which Steve has mentioned; includes $2.2 billion for the long-term projects, not expected to generate production till 2014 and beyond.","In 2013, we expect our U.S. onshore regions to grow production in excess of 20%, predominantly consisting of liquids growth. We also expect our investment to increase production in North Sea and our drilling program in Egypt to increase our gross production in that region.","However, we expect moderate production declines in Canada and Argentina, double-digit declines in Australia and deepwater due to the future timings of our next development projects coming on line and a double-digit decline in the Gulf of Mexico shale due to natural fuel declines.","We're currently running 122 rigs worldwide and expect to average a similar amount over the course of the year. We plan to drill more wells in 2013 than 2012 in an estimated total of nearly 1,600 wells. Almost two-thirds of all planned wells will be drilled in the Permian and Anadarko basins of the U.S. and are expected to generate fully loaded after-tax rates of return in excess of 20% at planned commodity prices. Our financial supplement posted on our website out lines Apache's 2013 initial exploration and development capital allocation by region on Page 10.","Now turning to our region highlights; the Permian region produced nearly 118,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the fourth quarter with 74% liquids constituting nearly 15% of our total production. In addition, we replaced over 260% of our production in the Permian through drilling activities during 2012, excluding price realizations and ended the year with 800 million barrels of proved reserves. In 2013, we'll further exploit our vast 3.8 billion barrels of oil equivalent net resource position with plans to drill over 700 wells running on average of 34 rigs and investing nearly $2.4 billion of capital. We will significantly ramp up our horizontally activity in the basin.","We are currently running 13 horizontal rigs at a total of 38 rigs and anticipate increasing our horizontal rig count to 17 by the end of the first quarter. As such, nearly 180 of the 2013 wells will be horizontal versus 104 horizontal wells in 2012. We will build upon our successful horizontal program in 2012 by increasing our Wolfcamp shale and Cline shale developments, and will be focused on driving down drilling and completion costs as we move towards development mode to further optimize our returns. We have already successfully donated 10 horizontal plays across the region. This year we will target and test an additional 20 horizons.","In the Midland basin, we will continue our successful vertical program in the Fusselman, Wolfwood, and Wolfberry plays within Deadwood and other areas.","On the Central Basin platform, we plan to drill additional Grayburg, Clear Fork and Wichita-Albany, all those horizontal wells and to test Strawn and Mississippian zones. For the Yeso play in Southeast New Mexico, we will continue to drill vertical wells, once again our first horizontal program in the Cedar Lake area.","And in the Delaware Basin while we already have successfully drilled the second Bone Spring horizontal, we plan to test in the first quarter and also drill a horizontal well in the Wolfcamp. We will be actively testing the vertical Wolfbone within this emerging area for us.","Finally, since we see the number of questions regarding our Permian realizations, I wanted to mention that we successfully negotiated a five-year contract to sell crude that is then transported to the Gulf Coast via pipeline. Terms of this contract are confidential, that should allow us to receive favorable placing for this oil. These volumes will ramp up over the next several quarters and at a full capacity we will sell up to 20,000 barrels of oil per day into the Gulf Coast.","Turning to the Central region, the region produced approximately 79,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the fourth quarter. This is a 9.6% increase over third quarter of 2012 production, over 38% on an annualized basis. Just as significantly, we increased our oil production by 24% in the fourth quarter versus third quarter to 21,000 barrels of oil per day, which represents 27% of total region production. Total liquids production increased by 24% to 31,000 barrels of oil per day or approximately 39% of total region production. Further, we replaced over 340% of our production in the Central region through drilling activities during 2012 excluding price revisions and nearly 645% when you include the acquisitions.","For 2013, we will continue to accelerate activity as we plan to ramp up our drilling across our extensive acreage position in the Anadarko and Whittenburg Basins. We will further explore our vast 5.4 billion barrels of oil equivalent in that resource position with plans to drill nearly 300 wells, up from 192 wells in 2012, while running in average of 29 rigs of which 28 are horizontal and investing nearly $1.4 billion in capital. About a third of our program will target the prolific liquids-rich Granite Wash, with another quarter targeting the oilier Tonkawa, rigs will also work the Cleveland, Marmaton, Cottage Grove, and Canyon Wash.","Apache has 11 lower Marmaton tests planned in 2013 with a total of 90 resource locations identified. 17 vertical Canyon Wash wells are currently planned for 2013, with expectations that we will commence water flooding in the Wash and begin a horizontal program in the Canyon line later in the year. After integrating our Cordillera acquisitions and further donating our acreage over the past year, we expect that it will drive down drilling and completion plans and costs as we optimize our development program.","In our Gulf Coast onshore region, we intend to average three operated and one non-operated drilling rigs during 2013, anticipating we will drill 39 wells.","At Atchafalaya Bay, we anticipate our drilling activity will increase gross production from the field to 155 million cubic feet of gas per day from 140. Phase II of this facility expansion from the Atchafalaya Bay Field to [Belvieu] will be completed during the first quarter and startup of Phase III will commence, which should be completed late in the second quarter, bringing the capacity of the Atchafalaya Bay system to 220 million cubic feet of gas per day from 155.","In the Gulf of Mexico shale, we plan to drill over 30 wells as we exploit low-risk liquids-rich prospects. We will also work to expand our inventory at permanent drill prospects and acquire additional wide-azimuth 3D seismic as we apply deepwater technology to the shale to enhance subsalt imaging and identify previously overlooked prospects.","In the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, we have drilled our position to 166 blocks and approximately 900,000 acres and have identified dozens of prospects to sustain an active exploration program for many years.","In 2013, we plan to drill three operated exploration wells and four non-op development wells. We have two rigs under contract under drill prospects San Marcos and Mississippi Canyon 983, Starlight, Green Canyon 230, 274 and Guadeloupe in Mississippi Canyon 554, 555. We are moving forward with the partner-operated projects, Lucius and Heidelberg and expect to invest $200 million of our share of four wells in these two developments during 2013.","In Canada, our 2013 program includes over 150 wells with a focus of oil and liquids-rich gas opportunities and horizontal exploitation of Sparky, Bluesky, Beaverhill Lake, Dunvegan and Viking oil plays. We also intend to test the Montney and Duvernay within our substantial acreage positions in these plays.","Our 2013 plan in Australia totals nearly $1.9 billion, includes drilling 16 wells, six of which are for exploration. Mid-year the partner-operated Macedon gas project will be complete, and will add approximately 35 million cubic feet of gas per day of net production. But the real focus in Australia continues to be the long-term growth, we will realize from the pipeline of development projects we have lined up over the next several years. This includes the Julimar-Wheatstone LNG development project, the Coniston and Balnaves oil projects, the Moondyne and Upper Pyrenees projects and the Varanus Gas Compression project. Total capital allocated to these projects in 2013 exceeds $1.5 billion.","With respect to the Coniston oil development, in order to repair the Ningaloo Vision FPSO for its increased throughput capacity, Apache has reviewed all requirements for planned maintenance and as scheduled, the vessel to go offline to the shipyard in the first quarter of 2014. This time we will take advantage of the 2014 cyclone season window should we normally see some weather-related downtime, thus optimizing production for 2013.","Turn to Egypt, our operations continue uninterrupted. This asset remains a highly profitable piece of Apache portfolio and as such we plan to make a similar investment in 2013 as we did in 2012. This will allow us to drill over 270 wells including over 60 exploration wells. Our drilling program will focus on Bahariya, Abu Roash, Jurassic and AEB targets. So we are also looking to further test these horizontals in the region. These with our level of investment combined with the Heathrow field now online, we expect the gross production in Egypt to be slightly higher in 2014.","In the North Sea, we plan to drill 27 wells of which 24 will be operated including 11 new wells at Forties and at least six at Beryl. We also plan to drill a third well at Bacchus field during the first quarter. In 2013, we will install a commission with pass top side and commits drilling operations. Two wells will be drilled and test in 2013. Apache will acquire a 307 square kilometer of 4D seismic survey of Forties and Bacchus fields commencing in July and complete the acquisition of the Beryl 3D seismic survey which we gave in the summer of 2012.","In Argentina, our investment level will be consistent with recent years as we aim to invest within the region's cash flow. We plan to drill additional 20 wells during the year, 16 of which will be Apache operated focusing on gas plus wells as well as continued Vaca Muerta exploration activities.","Finally, with respect to our venture activates, we continue to evaluate the well data we have collected from our Bakken and Mississippian Lime exploration wells, and we'll provide further detail in the future with respect to our path forward in these areas in including any development plans.","In Alaska, we are in the final stages of drilling our first onshore well and expect to complete it in the second quarter. In Suriname, we have signed a 3D seismic acquisition contract for 2,100 square kilometer survey over our Block 53 and expect to commence seismic operations in the second quarter.","One last item of note, before I turn the call over to Tom Chambers, due to Cyclone Narelle in offshore Australia and other weather events in Australia, unplanned facility downtime in the Gulf thus far this year, we expect first quarter 2013 production to be down versus fourth quarter 2012. However, we have already incorporated this downtime into our 2013 production guidance.","That concludes the operational highlights, and I'll turn it over to Tom Chambers.","Thomas P. Chambers","Thanks Rod, and good afternoon, everyone. While 2012 provided plenty of challenges, we finished the fourth quarter strong, averaging 800,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day, boosting us to record production for the year and fueling record oil and gas revenues in our second best cash flow year ever.","Production which averaged 779,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day was up 4% from the prior year and up almost 5.5% adjusted for dispositions as Steve indicated. More importantly, record oil production of 352,000 barrels per day combined with record oil price realizations drove cash from operations before working capital items to $10.2 billion for the year and a record $2.8 billion for the quarter.","Oil and gas revenues of $16.9 billion were slightly higher than 2011 and we achieved a new record in spite of average North American natural gas prices falling over 30%. We continue to benefit from our portfolio with WTI crude prices currently over 28 times the price of North American gas. Having 72% of our oil production priced at Brent or Brent-comparable indexes, which continues to realize substantial premiums to WTI, also enhances our results.","Our international natural gas portfolio continues to have a positive revenue impact by providing increasing volumes to markets with gas prices significantly higher than North America particularly Argentina, Australia and the UK grid. For the fourth consecutive quarter international gas price realizations outpaced those of North America. In 2012 international gas price realizations increased 13% compared to the prior year and at $4.15 they were 47% higher than those realized in North America excluding hedging.","Turning to earnings for 2012, as you heard we reported earnings of $1.9 billion or $4.92 per share, despite the impact of several key non-recurring items. Our results include prior quarter non-cash property write-downs in Canada totaling $1.4 billion aftertax directly related to collapsing Canadian natural gas prices. We had a number of other charges that impacted our results for the year including $226 million of deferred tax charges, $118 million tax adjustment in the UK related to decommissioning discussed in the third quarter, $51 million charge for derivative mark-to-market, and $19 million merger and acquisition charges.","When we remove these items for comparability purposes, we earned $3.8 billion or $9.48 per share down from 2011\u2019s $4.7 billion and $11.83 a share. The detailed breakout of all of our financials including adjusted earnings and cash flow from operations can be found in the financial supplement located on our website. The bottom line though is margins. We\u2019ve been able to sustain strong cash margins at $42.86 per barrel of oil equivalent down just 6% from 2011. Margins were impacted by a 3% reduction in commodity price realization and a rise in our lease operating expenses.","Current year repairs, maintenance and plant turnarounds directly impacted our LOE by almost $0.40 per BOE, predominantly related to the Grand Isle 43 corrosion repair and Canadian plant turnarounds. In addition, we have continued growth in our onshore North American operations, our labor costs have increased as well.","Our operating costs generally trend with commodity prices and are also impacted by the location of our properties. Oil properties are inherently more expensive than natural gas properties to operate as our offshore properties. The 51% of our 2012 production oil and liquids and approximately one-third of our production located in offshore areas, our costs run higher than many of our competitors.","Total cash costs during the year averaged $17.06 per barrel of oil equivalent, up $0.82 over last year. For 2013, cash costs absent price dependent production tax are projected in the $14 to $16 per barrel of oil equivalent range.","We remain focused on cash margins and continue to monitor our cost trends in all areas, in addition to reviewing our capital spending to ensure we focus on the highest rate of return projects. Our ability to sustain margins allows us to generate a robust $10 billion of operating cash flow that\u2019s funded our largest E&P capital budget ever.","In addition to our organic cash flow generation, we were able to successfully issue $5 billion of new debt this year at all in cost of 3.6%. $3 billion in April of five, 10 and 30 year tranches used to fund the cash portion of the Cordillera purchase price and repay maturing debt and additional $2 billion in December of 10 and 31 year notes with record low coupons allowing us to take advantage of continuing low rates to term up floating rate debt and increase our overall liquidity.","Our successful E&P capital program with its focus on U.S. drilling added 372 million barrels of oil equivalent to proved reserves during 2012, that\u2019s over 130% of what we produced during the year at a finding cost of a little over $24 per barrel. At first blush, that might seem high, but I\u2019d like to point out that our 2012 spending included over $500 million of facilities capital, plus nearly $1.5 billion for leasehold and seismic purchases that while in the cost side, do not immediately result in reserve additions.","Excluding this spending, finding cost would have been very competitive. While the seismic and leasehold purchases were very large last year, we do not see that trend continuing in 2013. However, these expenditures while seemingly a drag on finding cost now will provide a large benefit in the future setting the foundation for future growth. Reserve ads through acquisition totaled 73 million barrels of oil equivalent, bringing total ads to 156% of 2012 production. Unfortunately, low North American gas prices were primarily responsible for negative price revisions totaling 299 million barrels of oil equivalent, a majority in Canada.","I would point out that with gas prices rebounding somewhat in the second half of the year, the negative revisions were halted after the third quarter and virtually, all of those reserves remain in the ground available to be produced if and when prices and economic conditions warrant.","Turning to income taxes for a moment; the adjusting items mentioned earlier also impacted our 2012 effective tax rate, moving it up to 59%. If you adjust for these one-time charges, our tax rate would have been a more typical 44%. As mentioned earlier, 2013 will be another active drilling year and balancing our capital allocation and ensuring capital availability are key, because our cash flows are heavily influenced by oil realizations, we have recently entered into financial derivative contracts on 125,000 barrels a day of oil for calendar year 2013, using a combination of WTI and Brent swaps, representing about one-third of our worldwide oil production based on our fourth quarter of 2012 volumes. Our average combined hedge price is approximately 98,000 per barrel. We\u2019ve not entered into any new gas hedges and our international gas portfolio exposure helps mitigate our North American price risk.","In closing, we had a solid year of production revenues, cash flows resulting from our active drilling program. We have built a very strong foundation for cash flow generation and support both for our ongoing drilling program and our inventory of longer-term development projects as we head into 2013.","And with that, I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to Brady.","F. Brady Parish","Thank you, Tom. Allie, we are now ready to open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Arun Jayaram from Credit Suisse.","Arun Jayaram \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC","Can you hear me?","G. Steven Farris","Fairly.","Arun Jayaram \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC","Fairly, okay.","G. Steven Farris","That\u2019s fair.","Arun Jayaram \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC","Steve, I wanted to talk to you a little bit about the overall production. I mean in October, you guys updated the market, and you\u2019re about 800,000 barrels a day in overall production. So there, next quarter despite some pretty strong gains in the U.S. onshore and you\u2019re guiding down now for Q1. So, the sense is you're losing a little bit of operating momentum outside of the U.S. So I was wondering if you could just comment on that and just the overall shift to a little bit of a lower growth rate in 2013, notwithstanding the changes in capital allocation.","G. Steven Farris","To be real frank, holding 800,000 barrels a day for quarter, we were very proud of that frankly, because we\u2019ve never hit that from where we were. In terms of going into 2013, the first quarter, we\u2019re affected by Hurricane; I mean a cyclone in Australia. I will tell you though we put that downtime in our 3% to 5% growth projection. There is no doubt that we have some properties that are declining, but we\u2019re going to more than make up for it in the Permian and the Anadarko Basin this year. And we\u2019re pretty confident about the long-term value of our Canadian assets also.","Arun Jayaram \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC","Okay. And just I was wondering if you could comment. Has there been any change in the way you\u2019re thinking about? I know guidance is relatively new to Apache thinking about the long-term. Are you all changing your approach, you may be trying to guide to like P90 type of case versus maybe P50 differently. So just trying to see if there has been any change in the way you\u2019re thinking about guidance I guess?","G. Steven Farris","We are new to this. I have to be real honest with you. One thing that we don\u2019t want to do is, miss our guidance. We\u2019re going to spend quite a bit of money intentionally in a few, remember what Rod said, $1.5 billion of that $2.2 billion is going to Australia. The biggest chunk of that is Julimar, Brunello and the Wheatstone LNG facility, which is now over 80% contracted. And those are tied to oil linked prices, so when that comes on, we\u2019re going to see about over 25,000 barrels a day for the next 25 years.","Operator","Your next question comes from Pearce Hammond with Simmons & Co.","Pearce W. Hammond \u2013 Simmons & Co. International","Good afternoon.","G. Steven Farris","Good afternoon.","Pearce W. Hammond \u2013 Simmons & Co. International","Steve, I just wanted to get a little color. You mentioned about the possibility of maybe divesting around $2 billion worth of assets for that 3% to 5% production growth guidance for 2013. Is that guidance already includes the potential sale of those assets, if there\u2019s production or would the guidance potentially need to be adjusted after the sale?","G. Steven Farris","The guidance would be adjusted after the sale.","Pearce W. Hammond \u2013 Simmons & Co. International","Thank you. And my follow-up would be on service costs, specifically in the Permian and then in your Central region. Just curious as you look at 2013 and compare it to 2012, how do you see service costs trending? Do you think that prices are bottoming and are there any areas of services right now whether they\u2019re a little bit tightening in one of those regions?","G. Steven Farris","Rod you\u2026","Rodney J. Eichler","The service costs in both areas are flat and declining and we see that, specifically, we see that in the Permian, they have been very large increases in the frac stimulation companies. as a result, that\u2019s provided simply downward pressure on the pricing of that. We\u2019ve seen a 30% drop in frac spread costs compared to 2012 as well as we might expect to see even more decline in our side from using more self-sourcing of same in chemicals in 2013, which will allow us to further reduce those stimulation costs. Same thing on rig rates. Spud rates are much more favorable than they were. We\u2019ve seen about a 5% to 7% decline in rig rates. For the mechanical rigs, 2,000 horsepower rigs we used to build the vertical wells at Deadwood, that\u2019s an example and we expect to see continued downward pressure on those as well.","Roger B. Plank","Pearce, it\u2019s Roger. Just one a little bit of comment on the sales. We\u2019re going to identify exactly what it is, we\u2019re going to sell, but not everything necessarily would have current production for example, the assets that we sold to Chevron, I guess last week, we collected $400 million and there is no production associated with that.","Pearce W. Hammond \u2013 Simmons & Co. International","Great, thank you for the color, Roger.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Herrlin with Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale.","John P. Herrlin \u2013 Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale Americas Securities, LLC","Regarding the Permian, you said in your ops report that you spud 22 horizontal wells with 463 frac stages. Are you going to be increasing the frac densities at all because it averages about 20 wells. I was just curious.","Rodney J. Eichler","It depends a lot on what's lower or unconventional target that we are after in terms of the optimal frac concentration and we have a lot of efforts underway right now. They are various areas specific to try to optimize the amount of frac stages. And large numbers, not necessarily the optimal number and we're trying to find out the certain areas.","So we expect to see overall improvements in both the cost and efficiency of our frac treatment programs in both the Permian and Central as we go forward in 2013 based on a lot of the benchmarking we are doing to become a best-in-class operator in these areas, we're drilling horizontal completions.","John P. Herrlin \u2013 Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale Americas Securities, LLC","Okay, thanks Rod. Next one from me is on the Central; are those lateral lengths listed really the lateral length of the horizontals or is that kind of a type of?","Rodney J.

Tameron \u2013 Wells Fargo Advisors LLC","Good afternoon everybody. A couple of things, the PSC contracts, you said you just \u2013 and then you said, I guess bid round, you got a lease and you're going to have a revised PSC contract. Can you talk about that and should we read into that is that's where the government is headed going forward?","Rodney J. Eichler","Could you repeat that question? It was very broken up.","David R. Tameron \u2013 Wells Fargo Advisors LLC","This now better.","Rodney J. Eichler","Little bit.","David R. Tameron \u2013 Wells Fargo Advisors LLC","Okay, sorry I\u2019ve trouble here with the phone. But In Egypt, if you talk about winning in the recent round of bidding, you won a couple of leases and there's going to be a new PSC contract. So I'm just wondering if we should read anything into that. Is that the direction that we should expect the contracts to go in Egypt?","G. Steven Farris","Well, the one thing I would say is they have continual posting of leases in Egypt, concessions in Egypt that people bid on. The most significant thing about the latest bid round were they were very similar to all of the other concessions that we've got in the Western Desert. So, there weren't any term changes in terms of what they had asked for in the latest bid round.","David R. Tameron \u2013 Wells Fargo Advisors LLC","Okay, so your expectation for this contract is that they're going to look just like the last year?","G. Steven Farris","There's always a \u2013 the cost recovery goes from 35% to 40%, but in terms of directionally, it's pretty much the same as all our concessions across the Western Desert.","David R. Tameron \u2013 Wells Fargo Advisors LLC","Okay. New Zealand, can you talk a little bit about what's happened there?","G. Steven Farris","Did you say New Zealand?","David R. Tameron \u2013 Wells Fargo Advisors LLC","New Zealand, yeah.","G. Steven Farris","Well, I think what we \u2013 in terms of the long-term potential, there is definitely a tremendous amount of hydrocarbon service. Being able to do that and the magnitude that it takes over the timeframe that it takes, we've decided that that wasn't in our best interest, and you're going to see that when we talk about our asset sales. We now have some long-term projects that have some significant durability and significant potential and so we're going to have to balance off our long-term and our short-term in terms of being able to grow both long-term \u2013 but also be able to grow short-term.","Operator","Your next question comes from Bob Brackett with Sanford Bernstein.","Bob A. Brackett \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hi, good afternoon, I had a question. What do you expect to do with the proceeds from the divestments of $2 billion?","G. Steven Farris","Well, originally we're going to pay down debt, but when we get there we'll have to make a decision as to what we do with the proceeds but the first call on it is going to be pay down debt.","Bob A. Brackett \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","And then a question, I thought I heard you say you're going to start water flooding in the Granite Wash. What's the concept there? Is it true the horizontals that have been fraced?","Rodney J.

Just a few questions, on the divestitures, while some will not be productive anywhere to ballpark how much is associated, how much I guess current production is associated what is the?","G. Steven Farris","I think when we get there we will announce what \u2013 we've got a number of different banks that we're looking at.","Joe Magner \u2013 Macquarie Research","Okay. Then one of the comments you mentioned that 72% I believe of your oil is linked to Brent or Brent equivalents. Can you provide any perspective on how you see price differences playing out between Brent and WTI, Brent and LLS and then also Midland Cushing going forward?","G. Steven Farris","Well, I think Brent if the world price. And when you look at 5% of the well is traded at WTI prices and so what you have is, that you have a bottleneck in certain areas, certainly West Texas is one of them, there is an awful lot of people trying to solve that problem. I think Tom or Rod pointed out that we have an equity interest or a throughput interest in the pipeline that we're going to start, and there are going to be more and more of those.","My personal opinion is that I think those numbers will come and it's not going to be in the next 18 months but over time they're going to \u2013 that spread is going to shallow. I mean I just think that's not attainable forever.","Joe Magner \u2013 Macquarie Research","By spread you mean Brent TI spread or\u2026?","G. Steven Farris","Yes.","Joe Magner \u2013 Macquarie Research","Okay. Are there any, other than pipelines in the Permian, I guess as you think about just routing crude from and where you're producing onshore to where it needs to be. Any other significant plans or infrastructure projects that could create bottlenecks or constraints on being able to achieve your plan for this year?","G. Steven Farris","Not really, not to achieve that plan. We certainly and the Permian basin as you know, and I'm sure you know that there is a number of areas that are getting built or projected to be built but it's not going to affect our 2013 plan.","Operator","Your next question comes from Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you. Good afternoon everybody. I hope you can hear me okay. I've got a couple of questions if I may. Steve, clearly, this is a bit of a change from what you told us at the Analyst Day last year. Can you help us understand is this move away from the growth target in 2013, a move away from the long-term growth target as well. In other words, are you abandoning now the 6% to 12% target you laid out and just, so if you could help us understand what's changed?","G. Steven Farris","No, in fact, it's not. If you look at our asset base, it really is based on what our capital allocation is this year. If you look at the \u2013 if the amount of production that we are developing, it should help us in terms of obtaining that \u2013 actually we are at 6% to 9% if you don't include gas. We see gas go up, we can drill more gas wells, but right now 6% to 9%, we are still looking at that from a long-term basis.","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I think you had kind of signaled that you tempered gas, so that would be the number, so I appreciate that. My follow-up is really on the asset sales. Forgive me if I'm wrong here, but it sounds like you haven't quite identified what the assets are, or have you? Is it a bottom-up process, or are you seeing $2 billion as a number and then trying to make that fit? In my [meeting] going to this is, how big ultimately does that disposal process get as clearly they're extremely asset-rich and you're obviously not getting a lot of credit on the share price, and I'll leave it at that? Thanks.","G. Steven Farris","Doug, I didn't. Well, in terms of \u2013 certainly we have considered assets that we may sell. In terms of specifics and our pricing, I mean we've also scoped the order of magnitude of the pricing. But we're really not in a position at the present time to talk about which one of those asset bases that be. All of them will not include current production.","Thomas P. Chambers","I'd like to go back to your question about, are we abandoning in the long-term. Really, just think about what Rod said in these long-term projects we're spending over $2 billion on this year. They're going to add 150,000 barrels a day, and then later 200,000 barrels a day. So, those are big needle moving projects where we've got to put capital over a number of years. We don't get near-term production growth, but when they come on, you see a real stair step in our growth.","And so, when Steve was talking about LNG projects, for example, those are very big stair steps that will bring our average rate over the long-term back to the kind of range that we were talking about earlier. But in the short-term, those are dollars that aren't adding production in 2013. The rate of return is great, but when you bring them online especially those LNG projects they don't deplete. So they are very enticing.","Operator","Your next question comes from Matthew Portillo with Tudor Pickering Holt & Co.","Matthew Portillo \u2013 Tudor Pickering Holt & Co.","Good afternoon.","Thomas P. Chambers","Good afternoon.","Matthew Portillo \u2013 Tudor Pickering Holt & Co.","Just two quick questions for me, with limited capital investments in Canada around your gas assets, could you give us a little bit of color on how we should think about volume decline, and then a similar question for the U.S.?","G. Steven Farris","Yeah, the capital allocation I think represents $600 million in Canada, which will be directed. Now what we have done just for information, we now have a Kitimat upstream business and we have our base Canadian operations business and we have two different organizations just recently set up; one to do nothing, but the Horn River and Liard. In terms of the base business in terms of our \u2013 we are really directing that more towards liquids-rich and in terms of what\u2019s the decline curve is I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t have it. We should see a slight decline, but it\u2019s not real significant.","Matt Portillo \u2013 Tudor Pickering Holt & Co.","Okay, great. And then just a second question for me. In terms of the Permian and the Midland Basin, could you provide a little color on how your Cline results have performed to-date? How those look against your type curves, and then how we should think about current well costs? Thank you.","G. Steven Farris","Rod, you might.","Rodney J. Eichler","Yeah. In the Cline, we\u2019ve really had some good progress on the Cline and we\u2019ve managed to cut six days of the amount of time, it takes to do a Cline horizontal from the Deadwood area. When that translates to an average split rate is about $60,000 a day savings, which translates into about $360,000 wells, that\u2019s very significant. And then generally speaking, we gave you some information at the Analyst Day last June that it cost us about $7.6 million and as a result of some of these efficiency improvements and overall cost reductions that I mentioned that we should be under $7 million in total well cost in that particular formation, and I think the Cline, the well results have been posted in the supplement.","Matt Portillo \u2013 Tudor Pickering Holt & Co.","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Charles Meade with Johnson Rice and Company LLC.","Charles A. Meade \u2013 Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Hello, everyone. If you don't mind, too much, I'm going to take one more step at the guidance question, because I think the other question maybe got us a little bit, we have a \u2013 you've laid out the 3% to 5% overall BOE guidance, but it's maybe not that \u2013 it's not meaningful. It's not apples-to-apples to replace \u2013 when you're replacing oil volumes with gas volumes or vice versa as you guys are. So, if you have it in your mind and can share it, do you have an idea of the four pieces of your product mix that North American liquids, North American gas, international liquids, international gas, what the individual growth rates on those four would be? Or maybe you might not have it, but I just thought it.","G. Steven Farris","Everybody is scrambling for information here, give us a second.","Charles A. Meade \u2013 Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Well, you can come back to that and another thing, I greatly appreciate all the data in the operations supplement you have. Just two of those \u2013 just two things on that if I could ask; one, I saw you guys drilled another really good horizontal on the Central Basin platform in the Permian, and I think you're really the only operator who's been doing that. So, I'm curious if you're planning on doing a lot of much more event and then, the last kind of obscure question that comes from the operations release is, I noticed in the Gulf Coast region, you said you're drilling in Lamar County, Mississippi, and I'm wondering if that's the smack-over target or if you're ready to talk about that?","G. Steven Farris","Rod?","Rodney J. Eichler","Well, the answer to your first question, I believe you might be referring to our drilling program in our Three Bar Shallow Unit, which is the Wichita Albany play. I think we mentioned that at our last quarter's call. We've continued to drill. We have five wells drilled and producing there. It\u2019s one of our best plays and take in terms of the estimated ultimate recovery for horizontal wells and we have about a couple of wells that are waiting on completion and we have additional 12 wells yet to drill in that program, a lot of which would be drilled in 2013. Your second question dealt with what are we doing in Lamar County, Mississippi?","Charles Meade \u2013 Johnson Rice","That\u2019s right.","Rodney J. Eichler","Well, we\u2019re drilling an exploration test and that\u2019s in progress. That\u2019s all we want to say about it right now.","Charles Meade \u2013 Johnson Rice","Got it, okay. Thank you very much, and if you have those other growth rates, I\u2019m going to stay on the call and queue up whenever you guys are ready.","G. Steven Farris","North American Oil is supposed to grow at 14% for 2013. That\u2019s what we\u2019re projecting.","Operator","Your next question comes from Leo Mariani with RBC Capital.","Leo Mariani \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Hi, guys. You talked about some exploration plans in 2013. I think you guys said three deepwater Gulf wells and then six wells in Australia. Could you give us some more information about what type of targets those are and what some of the associated growth potential maybe on some of those?","Rodney J. Eichler","In Australia, the wells are mostly in the Olympus-Bianchi, the general quadrant going south, just north of Exmouth Basin area. They\u2019re targeting the typical Mungaroo Triassic reservoir objectives, which we have in other producing areas out there. We have successful exploration tests at Zola back two years ago and we\u2019re following up on that. In the Gulf of Mexico deepwater, as I recall that those specific targets or those prospects I mentioned will probably be [Midland Basin].","Leo Mariani \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Okay, thanks. And I guess, additionally another question on the asset sales. Traditionally Apache has been obviously an acquirer of a lot of assets over the years. Is there any sort of shift in philosophy that you guys are seeing here, now that you have announced these asset sales, somewhat I guess prior to specifically identifying it. I mean, you guys trying to maybe strengthen the balance sheet in response to maybe some capital expenditures coming up on the LNG side in the next couple of years? How are you guys kind of thinking about it, if there is any just philosophical change, just curious on that?","G. Steven Farris","Well, from a philosophical standpoint if you look at where we have come from over the last three years, and if you look at the assets that we\u2019ve acquired, and it's not just here in the last week but over the last month or two, we\u2019ve been looking at our asset base and saying, okay, now which one of these asset bases do we want to take forward into the future. And we have to make some tough choices \u2013 we can't be all things to all people. So we go to make some choices as to which one of these that we can actually exploit or could somebody else exploit them better. So we're still going to be a net buyer. If you think about $16 billion and $2 billion, but in terms of just transitioning our asset base that's what the effort's about.","Operator","Your next question comes from Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs.","Brian A. Singer \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Thanks, good afternoon. Just picking up on the growth in the asset sales and the acquisitions together. It's interesting to know that the areas that you have that are growing rapidly, the Permian and the Midcontinent are where you have focused your acquisitions over the last couple of years. And then, so I guess in your interest in achieving your 6% to 9% guidance longer-term, there are various ways you could do, you could acquire more assets in growth areas, you could sell assets and producing areas that have little growth, or you could just wait it out as kind of Roger described, and wait till some of these long lead time projects come online. Is it fair to say, that it's more of the latter strategy there just kind of wait things out until the long lead projects come online that you've kind of decided on. And then, in that case, should 2014 be another year of relatively low growth?","G. Steven Farris","Yeah. We haven't reported our 2014 plan. It really depends on how we allocate that capital, Brian, and also what our asset base looks like. We certainly want to further those long-term projects, but we also have to balance this. What I was suggesting is, we have to balance short-term growth with long-term growth.","Brian A. Singer \u2013 Goldman Sachs","So I guess, would you consider acquiring any areas that have become more core to you or as for the rest, or are kind of acquisitions completely off the table here?","G. Steven Farris","Well for the present time, we are going to drill wells. So that doesn't mean we won't pick up an acre or two around some place, but in terms of making major acquisitions in our existing core areas or new core areas, that's not something that's part of our strategy right now.","Rodney J. Eichler","On a project side, we do have three or four projects, which will mature to first production in 2014. These are in Egypt and in Australia and that could add, approximately in the range of 25,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.","Brian A. Singer \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Great thanks. And then just to clarify on the asset sale decision, have you definitive call that you're going to sell the $2 billion of assets or are you considering asset sales up to $2 billion?","G. Steven Farris","Obviously price has something to do with it, but we certainly are dedicated to selling $2 billion worth of assets.","Operator","Your next question comes from Kevin Cashman with Assurant.","Kevin Cashman \u2013 Assurant","Hi, and thanks for taking the question. Just kind of following up on the asset sales in the \u2013 you mentioned some of your refinancing last year with the two 2013 maturities coming up. I'm just wondering, you mentioned debt reduction would that be a plan to reduce those ultimately with the debt proceeds or payment?","Thomas P. Chambers","Yes, I mean that's a consideration. Once we get, depending on the timing of when we get these assets sold and what else is on our plate, that is definitely a consideration to pay down that debt.","Kevin Cashman \u2013 Assurant","Have you guys had your annual meeting with the rating agencies for this point already?","Thomas P. Chambers","No.","Kevin Cashman \u2013 Assurant","When is that coming up?","Thomas P. Chambers","Shortly.","Kevin Cashman \u2013 Assurant","Okay, thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from Michael Howe with Robert W. Baird.","Michael Howe \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","I guess, my point has been addressed but I'll jump back on the production outlook topic, commented through the question in another way. As you look at just your mix of natural gas oil liquids, do you see that shifting materially as we make our way through 2013, you've seen a nice...","G. Steven Farris","You're going to see our oil production as a percentage continue to grow up.","Michael Howe \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","All right.","G. Steven Farris","Because we are predominantly drilling oil wells or liquid rich gas wells.","Michael Howe \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Can you quantify any of the changes, directionally?","G. Steven Farris","What we have said and I don't have the numbers in front of me, Brady is looking at them. What we say is we're going to grow our North American oil by 14%, so.","Operator","And your final question comes from Joe Magner with Macquarie.","Joseph Magner \u2013 Macquarie Capital","Yeah, just one quick follow-up, I wondered if you had any update on some of the new exploration ventures that were detailed fall of last year in the Cook Inlet, Montana, Mississippi in particular.","G. Steven Farris","We are almost down on our Alaska well. We were 11,400 feet; we're going to 11,800 feet. Then obviously we'll have to test it and run pipe and all that stuff. And in the Bakken, in Montana, and in the Mississippi Lime, we've drilled few wells bulk of those we're really concentrating our efforts right now on the United States, on the Permian and the Anadarko Basin. And then we just picked up a block as Rod pointed out, we picked up a block in Suriname which is a very good block and we're getting ready to shoot 3D seismic on it.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the conference back over to the hosts for any closing remarks.","F. Brady Parish","Thank you very much for attending our conference today.

[Operator instructions.] At this time I would like to introduce your presenter for today Mr. Brady Parish, vice president of investor relations. Mr. Parish, you may begin your conference.","Brady Parish","Thank you operator. Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining us for Apache Corporation's first quarter 2013 earnings conference call.  On today\u2019s call, we will have four speakers making prepared remarks prior to taking questions.  I will start by giving a brief summary of the first quarter results, and then we will hear from Steve Farris, our chairman and chief executive officer; followed by Rod Eichler, president and chief operating officer; and finally, Tom Chambers, executive vice president and chief financial officer.","We've prepared our quarterly financial supplemental data package for your use, which also includes the reconciliation of any non-GAAP numbers that we discuss, such as adjusted earnings, cash flow from operations, or pre-tax margins.  In addition, we have prepared an operations supplement to summarize our activities across the various Apache operating regions. These can both be found on our website at www apachecorp.com\/financialdata.","Today\u2019s discussions will contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions based on our current views and most reasonable expectations.  However, a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from what we discuss today.  A further disclaimer is located with the supplemental data package on our website.","This morning, we reported first quarter 2013 earnings of $698 million, or $1.76 per diluted share.  Adjusted earnings, which exclude certain items that impact the comparability of results, totaled $806 million, or $2.02 per diluted share.  Cash flow from operations totaled $2.4 billion.","In the first quarter, total net daily production averaged approximately 782,000 BOE per day with liquids production comprising 53% of the total.  This represents an increase from the 769,000 BOE per day reported in the first quarter of 2012 and a decrease from the fourth quarter as we had guided on our year-end earnings call.","Production in the first quarter was negatively impacted by 8,000 BOE per day of deferred production due predominantly to three cyclones, which impacted production in Australia and third-party gas plant downtime in Canada.  This downtime was expected and incorporated within our full year guidance.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Steve.   ","Steven Farris ","Thank you, Brady, and thank all of you for joining us this morning.  Apache did report solid financial results for the quarter.  We generated over $800 million of adjusted earnings and $2.4 billion of cash flow from operations.  ","I think of particular note, we generated outstanding production growth in our North American onshore regions at very attractive rates of return.  Our onshore North American liquids production averaged 165,000 barrels of oil per day, which constitutes 21% of our total worldwide production, and is an increase of 6% quarter over quarter and nearly 45% versus the first quarter of 2012.","In addition, our U.S. onshore asset base, which we bolstered over the last three year, continues to deliver sector-leading performance.  Apache is currently the second most active U.S. onshore driller.  During the first quarter, we averaged 206,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day from the Permian and central regions alone or 26% of our worldwide production.","This represents a 50% increase over the first quarter of 2012, and a 40% increase if you adjust for the Cordillera acquisition.  In addition, our central region in the Anadarko Basin grew production almost 9% from the fourth quarter of 2012 to the first quarter or nearly 36% on an annualized basis and increased liquids production over 28%.","We\u2019re currently running 42 rigs in the Permian Basin, 28 rigs in the Anadarko Basin, and so we expect this level to continue.  Our exceptional onshore liquids growth was offset primarily by the deferred production that Brady mentioned in his opening remarks, a decrease of 5% in North American natural gas production, as we chose not to drill any dry gas wells during the first quarter, and some natural declines in fields in some of our international regions.  As Brady pointed out, we\u2019ve already incorporated these deferrals and declines into our plans and we remain on track to achieve our full year guidance of 3% to 5%.  ","I\u2019d like to move now from our first quarter results and provide more detail on the portfolio review that I mentioned in our year-end conference call.  Just over three years ago, we set out to expand our portfolio in areas that we believed could generate profitable growth.  With this goal in mind, we significantly strengthened our onshore North American asset base through acquisitions in the Permian, Anadarko, and Western Canadian sedimentary basin.  We also entered the deep water Gulf of Mexico and added tactical extensions to our Gulf of Mexico shelf, North Sea, and Egyptian asset base.","Importantly, during this timeframe, we significantly grew our production by almost 200,000 barrels a day, with 162,000 barrels a day, about 198, 82%, coming from North American onshore.  Now that we\u2019ve reached the end of this three-year effort, we\u2019ve spent the last several months evaluating our expanded portfolio to determine which assets to keep and which assets might be more highly valued by others.","Having been in the oil and gas business for 50-plus years, this is not the first time Apache has gone through this process.  The sole purpose of this review was to determine which assets make the most strategic sense for us to go forward with in order to continue to do what Apache has always done best: exploit our best inventory of opportunities, rigorously allocate capital to generate attractive returns, profitably grow our production, create long term value for our shareholders.","With this single focus in mind, we developed a fairly robust list of potential asset sales and monetizations that we believe will achieve our goal and expect the initial phase of this process to generate about $4 billion of proceeds.  ","Over the last four months, we\u2019ve been actively engaged in a divestiture and monetization process for certain of these identified assets.  Our goal is to complete this initial phase during 2013 and we intend to announce transactions as agreements are in place.  As we finalize transactions, our priorities will be, with respect to the proceeds, first to pay down $2 billion of debt, then allocate proceeds received above $2 billion to repurchase shares.  ","Given the current level of our stock price, our board has authorized Apache management to repurchase up to 30 million shares, or approximately $2 billion of stock based on today\u2019s share price.  This share repurchase, combined with recent increases in our dividend, demonstrate our continued commitment to deliver value to our shareholders and reflects confidence in our long term strategy and underlying value of our company.","Given the highly confidential and sensitive nature of these transactions, we\u2019re not going to provide any specifics at this time.  Please keep in mind all of these transactions and the use of proceeds received are subject to market conditions.  However, we are confident that given the number of items that we have on our list, and assuming commodity prices hold, we should be able to deliver on this plan.","I\u2019d like to note that we have not incorporated any material adjustments from dispositions in our annual production guidance for 2013.  Some of the assets we are considering have limited production while some have a meaningful amount of production.  So it would be premature to modify our guidance until we gain more clarity on the results of the various processes.","Finally, I want to reiterate something that I\u2019ve said many times.  We\u2019ve build this company by focusing on returns, balance, and long term profitable growth and value creation.  We are cognizant of the frustration our investors feel regarding our stock price performance and current value.  We are shareholders too.  Rest assured we are focused on optimizing our portfolio and emerging from this process an even stronger company than we are today, one that can continue to do what we do best: exploit our asset base to generate profitable production growth and increase shareholder value over time.","Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Rod Eichler, our COO.","Rod Eichler ","Thank you, Steve, and good morning.  For the second straight quarter, we have compiled an operations supplement for your use, which highlights our activities by region during the first quarter.  We received a very positive reaction to our first report, and we have incorporated many of the comments we received in an effort to further improve it, and we hope you find it useful.","As Steve mentioned, we had an outstanding quarter drilling and completing wells, in particular in our North American onshore liquid plays.  During the quarter, we averaged 119 rigs operating worldwide and drilled 412 total gross wells, of which 402 were development wells, with 355 of these wells, or nearly 90%, located onshore in North America.  These wells were drilled with a success rate of 99%.","In the Permian and Central regions alone, we drilled 263 gross development wells, or 65% of our total.  Our production growth in North American onshore liquids of 6% during the quarter was driven predominantly by our Permian and Central regions.  ","Combined, these two regions grew liquid production 10,000 barrels per day quarter over quarter, or 9%, to 129,000 barrels per day, which represented nearly 31% of total worldwide liquids production.  Combined production from these regions was nearly 206,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, or over 26% of total company production for the quarter.  We have truly hit our stride in these two liquids-rich regions.  ","In the Permian region, we produced 119,400 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the first quarter, 74% liquids, constituting over 15% of our total production.  This represents more than 20% production growth over the first quarter of 2012.  ","We further exploited our 3.8 billion barrels of oil equivalent in net resource potential by running an average of 37 rigs and drilling 187 gross wells, 36 horizontal, with 100% success rate.  We continue to have great results in our vertical drilling program and in many cases our well performance is better than expected, especially in plays such as our Midland Basin Fusselman play in which recent 30-day [IP] rates for several wells have averaged over 300 BOE per day, 83% liquids, with only a $1.6 million drilling and complete cost.","We are currently running 17 horizontal rigs out of a total of 42.  As such, we are still on track to drill 180 horizontal wells during 2013.  We have built upon our successful horizontal drilling programs of 2012, and ramped up activity in our Wolfcamp shale and Cline shale developments.  We are currently running seven rigs in the Barnhart Wolfcamp shale play in Irion County and four rigs in the Deadwood Cline shale play in Glasscock County, with excellent results.","During the first quarter of 2013, we drilled 17 Wolfcamp wells in our Barnhart area; eight wells are currently on production while the remaining wells are in the process of being completed.  The expected 30-day IP rate per well is more than 500 BOE per day, or 86% liquids.","In the Deadwood Cline shale play, nine wells were drilled during the first quarter, three wells are currently on production, while the remaining wells are in the process of being completed.  The expected 30-day initial production rate per well is over 400 BOE per day, 72% oil.  ","We have moved into full development mode in our Barnhart and Deadwood programs, and have successfully driven down drilling and completion costs by more than $1 million per well, in an effort to further optimize our returns.  ","We\u2019ll achieve this by reducing our drilling days, primarily by optimizing bit selections and mud programs, among other improvements, and applying best practices on the completion side by substantially reducing our frack costs to self-sourcing, optimizing frack designs, and taking advantage of synergies from pad drilling and frack bonds.","These achievements will have a substantial economic impact when spread across thousands of horizontal locations in our inventory.  We expect to further reduce these costs as we continue to optimize our operations.","In the central region, we produced 86,200 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the first quarter.  This is a 7,000 BOE per day, or nearly 9%, increase over fourth quarter of 2012 production.  Just as significantly, we increased our liquids production by 28% quarter over quarter to 40,000 barrels per day.  Liquids now represent over 46% of total region production versus 27% in the first quarter of 2012.","During the first quarter, we accelerated our activity in the Anadarko and Whittenburg basins.  We\u2019ve further exploited our 5.4 billion barrels of oil equivalent net resource potential by running an average of 25 rigs, 24 of which are horizontal, and drilling 78 gross wells.  We are currently running 20 rigs in the region, and remain on track to drill 300 wells during 2013.","About a third of our program will target the prolific liquids-rich Granite Wash, with another third targeting the oilier Tonkawa.  Rigs will also continue to work the Cleveland, Marmaton, Cottage Grove, and Canyon Wash plays.","In our liquids-rich Granite Wash play, our wells continue to exceed expectations.  The first six wells that were drilled on production for at least 30 days in 2013 averaged IP rates of nearly 1,500 BOE per day, consisting of 760 barrels of liquids, of which 291 barrels are oil and 4.4 million cubic feet of gas.  We still have over 22,800 identified well locations in our resource inventory awaiting exploitation.","In addition, our oily Tonkawa play also had outstanding results.  Our first seven Tonkawa wells drilled and on production for at least 30 days in 2013 averaged IP rates of 662 BOE per day, which included 420 barrels of oil, 103 barrels of NGLs, or 80% total liquids.  These production rates have substantially exceeded our original expectations.  We still have nearly 2,800 identified well locations in our resource inventory.","Finally, we have expanded our Cottage Grove oil play with our recent Beckham County, Oklahoma Simmons 3-30H well, achieving a 30-day IP rate over 1,900 barrels of oil per day and 1.8 million cubic feet of gas per day.  We plan to drill over 20 Cottage Grove wells during 2013 and we are in the process of quantifying our resource potential in this prolific oil play.","Similar to the Permian, we are beginning to realize the benefits of scale development in this region.  We have been able to drive down drilling and completion costs substantially as we accelerate activity.  By implementing new drilling techniques and completion designs, we\u2019ve been able to drive down Granite Wash costs by $1.3 million to $2.0 million per well.  And Tonkawa costs, by $1.5 million per well versus last year.  By continuing to apply best practices, we expect to further reduce costs by applying these techniques to our other plays in the region.  ","Finally, I wanted to briefly comment on operations in the North Sea.  Having successfully integrated the barrel operations into our North Sea region, we are beginning to bear the fruit of our increased activity.  During the first quarter, production from the North Sea increased 79,100 barrels of oil equivalent per day, 87% oil, 85,000 BOE per day increase over the fourth quarter of 2012.  We remain on track for mid to high single digit annual production growth for 2013.  ","In addition, we are still on plan to install and commission the [fast] topside and complete acquisition of our 3D seismic survey [unintelligible] and drill a total of 27 wells in the North Sea during 2013.","Of particular note, we just announced our first well in the satellite Tonto field, about 2 km east of the Forties Bravo platform.  The Tonto-1 well came online at an initial production rate of over 10,300 barrels per day from the [unintelligible], the result of successfully applying our recent seismic conversion process and by our geoscience team to delineate the field.  This is the third new oilfield brought on in the Forties area within the last three years.  ","That concludes the operational highlights, and I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Tom Chambers.  ","Tom Chambers ","Thanks, Rod, and good morning everyone.  I\u2019ll repeat one more time, this morning we reported earnings of $698 million, or $1.76 per diluted share.  Overall, our bottom line results reflected another solid quarter of production revenues and cash flows.  Our production this quarter averaged 782,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day, our second-highest quarter ever.","Oil and gas revenues totaled $4.1 billion for the quarter, of which nearly $3.3 billion, or 79% of the total, was oil revenue.  Strong first quarter oil prices enabled us to generate $2.4 billion of cash from operations before working capital items.  We\u2019ve been able to routinely generate these cash flow levels given the fact that over 53% of our production base is oil and liquids, and that oil currently sells for over 20 times the price of North American non-GAAP.","Our focused drilling program produced a 45% increase in liquids production in North America onshore properties from the prior year quarter, primarily driven by outstanding results in the Permian and Anadarko basins, as you just heard Rod indicate.","Worldwide liquids production for the quarter averaged 416,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, an increase of 9% from the comparative 2012 quarter.  A key point worth emphasizing is that not all liquids are created equal, a fact that was driven home with the significant fall in NGL prices from year ago levels.  ","For Apache, our liquids growth and drilling opportunities are primarily focused on crude oil.  Over 85% of our first quarter liquids production is crude oil.  In addition, our international gas portfolio has continued to bolster our realizations as natural gas prices in North America trailed our international realizations by 11% in the first quarter.  For the fifth consecutive quarter, international gas price realizations outpaced those in North America.","Although realizations in Egypt were down after the loss of a legacy Egyptian oil linked contract that expired at the end of 2012, Australia and Argentina realizations continued to increase, reflecting the impact of new sales contracts.","Our production efforts directly translated into a pre-tax margin that continues to exceed 30% on a BOE basis.  Our operating costs, while higher than we\u2019d like, are a derivative of our product mix, with oil and offshore properties generally more expensive to operate than natural gas properties.  With 53% of our first quarter production oil and liquids, and approximately one-third of our production located in offshore areas, our costs per BOE run higher than many of our competitors.","I also wanted to note that the first quarter earnings were impacted by a $31 million after-tax unrealized loss on derivative instruments as well as a $42 million noncash after-tax writedown of our Argentina oil and gas property balance.  This was the result of two concessions expiring in the next two to four years, both of which we are currently in discussions with the government to extend.","Adjusting for these noncash writeoffs, FX impacts, and deferred tax adjustments, we earned $806 million, or $2.02 per share, down $0.98 from the first quarter of 2012, a period where we saw record oil prices and down $0.20 on a sequential quarter.","These adjustments also impacted our effective tax rate for the quarter, which was 46%.  If you adjust for items mentioned above that impact the comparability of results, our tax rate would have been a more typical 43%.  Detailed calculations for margins, adjusted earnings, adjusted tax rate, cash from operations, can be found in the financial supplement located on our website.","Turning to the balance sheet, our ability to generate consistent operating cash flows continues to support our robust drilling program and other planned capital expenditures.  This quarter, our total debt balance remained relatively unchanged, and at the end of the quarter, our debt-to-capitalization ratio was 28%, the same as last quarter.","However, as Steve mentioned earlier, we\u2019re working to rebalance our portfolio by actively pursuing asset sales to be completed in 2013.  The proceeds of some of these sales would be used to reduce our debt, including the $900 million of notes that mature this year.  ","The first of these sales was completed in February.  As you are aware, we completed a transaction with Chevron Canada to jointly build the Kitimat LNG facilities and develop the shale gas resources in the Liard and Horn River basins of British Columbia. The net proceeds to Apache from the transaction were $405 million.","The results of our efforts to rebalance our portfolio will enhance our debt maturity profile, preserve our balance sheet flexibility to fund operations and growth, and enhance shareholder value.","Finally, one last important item to highlight this quarter.  In February of this year we announced that our board of directors increased the regular quarterly cash dividend 18% to $0.20 per share, which demonstrates our confidence in our ability to continue to deliver future growth and shareholder value over the longer term.  This increase follows the 13% increase in 2012.","That concludes my remarks, and I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to Brady.  ","Brady Parish ","Thank you, Tom.  That concludes our prepared remarks.  I will now turn the call over to the operator.  Operator, we are ready to open the line to questions.  ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions.]  Your first question comes from the line of Pearce Hammond with Simmons.","Pearce Hammond - Simmons & Company  ","I guess my first question is you mentioned joint ventures.  Is that separate from the $4 billion?  Or is that included in that $4 billion worth of divestitures?","Steven Farris ","That would be included, but the proceeds have to be cashed, if you understand what I\u2019m saying.  ","Pearce Hammond - Simmons & Company ","So it is included?","Steven Farris ","Yes.  ","Pearce Hammond - Simmons & Company ","Then you mentioned the $4 billion of the initial phase, does that imply that there\u2019s a second phase beyond the $4 billion?","Steven Farris ","Well, what I can say is the asset list that we have generated at today\u2019s prices, and what our market expectations are, would exceed that $4 billion.  ","Pearce Hammond - Simmons & Company ","Then my last question is, I think the share buyback plan is a great idea, especially given how cheap the stock is.  I guess I wondered why not use the full $4 billion to buy back the stock, rather than pay down the debt, because you have a very good balance sheet?","Steven Farris ","Two things.  One is we want to make sure we retain our flexibility and our A rating.  The other one is that it also gives us financial flexibility to invest that money in our ongoing business.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Harry Mateer with Barclays.","Harry Mateer - Barclays  ","","You just touched on it, but perhaps if you could just highlight for us again the importance of single-A ratings, and [unintelligible] S&P for your long term vision for the company.  And then second, the $2 billion of debt reduction, as you mentioned, you have $9 million of short term debt.  Where does the other $1.1 billion of debt reduction come from?   ","Tom Chambers ","The other debt reduction comes from we\u2019re going to pay off some commercial paper.","Harry Mateer - Barclays ","And what was that commercial paper number at the end of the first quarter?","Tom Chambers ","End of the first quarter, it was $619 million.","Harry Mateer - Barclays ","And then on the single-A ratings?  That is of importance to you guys longer term?","Steven Farris ","We\u2019ve historically tried to be finally fiscal, and we want to continue that.  It\u2019s given us great flexibility over the years, and we continue to think it will give us flexibility in the future.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Amir Avif with Stifel Nicolaus.  ","Amir Avif - Stifel Nicolaus","A clarification on the repurchasing of shares.  Will that only begin after you have the first $2 billion of asset sales done, or will you start doing that again at the current share price, given where it is?","Steven Farris ","Our first priority is to pay down debt.  And we would have a goal to get that done this year, the $4 billion.","Amir Avif - Stifel Nicolaus ","Okay, so only after you have the first $2 billion, then we\u2019ll start buybacks?  That\u2019s fair?","Steven Farris ","Yeah, we want to give ourselves a little flexibility.","Amir Avif - Stifel Nicolaus ","And then a follow up question on Egypt.  The free cash flow you\u2019re generating in Egypt, are there any restrictions on moving that money back to the U.S., outside of repatriation tax?","Steven Farris ","No.  We move it in all of our international regions.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bob Brackett with Bernstein Research.  "," ","Bob Brackett \u2013 Sanford Bernstein ","Following up on theses asset sales, is Kitimat included in part of that $4 billion target, or is that already done and finished?","Steven Farris ","It\u2019s not in the target.  Obviously we\u2019re going to have to size Kitimat as we go forward.  Right now we are in a position to have taken something from raw materials to wholesale, and there will be a time when it will be retail.","Bob Brackett - Sanford Bernstein ","And then I understand you don\u2019t want to talk about the specifics of what potentially is for sale, but can you lay it out in terms of you prefer international versus domestic sales?  Is it gas versus oil?  Is it production versus acreage?","Steven Farris ","I think what we said in our release is that our goal is to come out of this with assets that we think have the potential to grow long term or short term, and that we also have assets that have great generating power to fund those programs.","Bob Brackett - Sanford Bernstein ","Not sure that answers the question.  Is it looking for assets that are mispriced by the market, where you keep the stuff that\u2019s undervalued, and you trim the stuff that\u2019s potentially overvalued by the global market?","Steven Farris ","No, we have an asset base that are growth generators, and we have assets that are cash generators.  We want to balance our cash generators with our growth generators.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Freeman with Raymond James.  ","John Freeman - Raymond James","Sorry to keep beating the same dead horse here, but just to clarify on the last question, when he asked if the $400 million you got from the Kitimat transaction, that\u2019s not included in the planned asset sales that you\u2019ve got?  So you\u2019ll be doing $4 billion above and beyond the $400 million you got from Kitimat?","Steven Farris ","That\u2019s correct.","John Freeman - Raymond James ","And then just a follow up on a question that Pearce asked earlier, on the JV front.  So when you view things in terms of, it would have to be cash, does that mean if you did any JV that had a drilling carry, that joint carry would not count towards your asset goal?","Steven Farris ","That\u2019s correct.","John Freeman - Raymond James ","Okay, and then on Alaska, are you all still on schedule to complete that first onshore well in the second quarter?","Steven Farris ","I\u2019ve got to check when the timing is.  I don\u2019t know when the timing of that is.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Herrlin with Societe Generale.  ","John Herrlin \u2013 Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale Americas Securities","How tax-efficient will the sales process be?  Have you thought about that?","Tom Chambers ","We have.  And it all depends on what the assets are that we sell.","John Herrlin - Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale Americas Securities ","In terms of a strategic change, does this mean you\u2019ll be reducing your expiration exposure at all?","Steven Farris ","Well, certainly if you look at our portfolio today, we\u2019re still going to have a joint venture group that has an exploration bent.  But in terms of the amount of funding that they get for the next two or three years, it\u2019s going to be less than they\u2019ve gotten in the past.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Eliot Javanmardi with Capital One.  ","Eliot Javanmardi - Capital One","I apologize for splitting hairs here, but just want to make sure I\u2019m clear.  Are these share buybacks, if things go well, do you expect to have it completed this year, in 2013?  Or could we expect it to kind of start in the second half and then perhaps just lead into \u201914?","Steven Farris ","Well, the share buybacks will be obviously opportunistic.  We have a goal to have asset sales of $4 billion by the end of this year, and the first $2 billion are going to pay down debt, and the next $2 billion are going to buy back stock.  What the timing of the stock buyback is, based on how soon we get the transactions done and closed, and have the cash available.","Eliot Javanmardi - Capital One ","You talked about your composition and how it helps you right now.  What are you guys targeting, do you think, as far as maybe after you go through this process, initially, and perhaps in another phase, where do you like to be portfolio-wise on your composition mix?","Steven Farris ","I\u2019m not following the question, sorry.  What will the company look like?  What will the assets look like?","Eliot Javanmardi - Capital One ","The production [unintelligible] oil and gas mix, kind of what would you be targeting still, close to a balance of 50-50?","Steven Farris ","Yeah, we intend the portfolio balance to stay relatively the same.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Charles Meade with Johnson Rice.","Charles Meade - Johnson Rice ","Looking at the region-by-region production in your earnings supplement, I noticed that one thing that stands out to me is Egypt oil volumes were down about 12,000 barrels quarter over quarter.  And I\u2019m curious if you could characterize what that is.  Is that natural decline?  Or was that some facilities related downtime?  And give some guideline on what you expect for the rest of the year there.","Steven Farris ","We\u2019re going to try to do a better job of our guidance on Egypt going forward.  If you look at the numbers, our gross production was down 2%.  And the most important thing to look at in Egypt is cash flow, frankly.  ","But what we\u2019re going to try to do in the future, and I don\u2019t want to confuse everybody on the line, is we\u2019re going to start showing, basically, net of tax.  Because Apache is not responsible for the tax in Egypt, and we basically gross up the volumes for the effective tax rate.  And it adjusts numbers.  ","If we had done it on a net basis, it would have been down about 5,000 barrels a day, or 6,000 barrels a day, rather than 12,000 barrels a day.  So we\u2019re going to try to clean that up going forward.  In terms of the actual production decline, the 2% on the gross, that\u2019s more timing than anything.   ","Charles Meade - Johnson Rice ","That\u2019s great clarity.  I think I understand you.  That just kind of introduces some noise that\u2019s not really there.  On the flipside of that, I\u2019m also looking at the NGL production you had in your central region in the U.S., and that almost doubled, up 10,000 barrels a day quarter over quarter.  And I\u2019m curious, is that just well performance?  Or is that also some midstream issues and perhaps ethane rejection that was going on in Q4?  Those ethane volumes coming back in Q1?","Steven Farris ","No, that\u2019s just well performance.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joe Magner with Macquarie.","Joe Magner - Macquarie Capital ","I\u2019ll take another stab at the thoughts or the framework around the asset sale program.  With the goal of repaying assets [unintelligible] to drive the near term and long term growth, what should we think about in terms of the growth potential of what could be retained relative to the current five-year, 6-9% growth objective.  Is it going to be higher?  Lower?  Willing to comment?","Steven Farris ","It\u2019s premature.  We have an asset list that exceeds our target.  And how we approach that going forward in the next few months, or six months, will really determine what comes out of the back of it.  I\u2019d be premature to answer that question right now.  Our whole goal is to be more profitable and more predictable growth.","Joe Magner - Macquarie Capital ","And on Kitimat, could you provide us the updates on the [offtake] agreement discussions?  And then also, whether there\u2019s a plan in place to exercise the pipeline right away that\u2019s outstanding?","Steven Farris ","Well, with respect to to the market, obviously we are in the market.  We\u2019re in the market now with our new partner, Chevron, who is leading that charge.  Before we got into the current relationship, it was pretty strong then, and I would venture to say, with Chevron as part of the partnership, it is stronger today.  ","In terms of the pipeline right of way, we\u2019re proceeding forward on all those issues.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joseph Allman with JPMorgan.","Joe Allman - JPMorgan ","In terms of the asset sales, when you made the list of non-core assets that made up that robust list, what are the parameters that defined, for you, the non-core assets?  ","Steven Farris ","Whether they had long term growth potential, short term or long term growth potential, or do they generate significant excess cash.  That\u2019s it.  ","Joe Allman - JPMorgan  ","Was rate of return one of the parameters?  Lower relative rate of return?","Steven Farris ","Well, yeah.  I think if you look at those raw definitions of which ones are on either side, rate of return is our primary focus.  So it would fit those categories.","Joe Allman - JPMorgan ","And then when you guys sit around and think about the stock\u2019s underperformance relative to the group, to what would you attribute the reason for the underperformance?","Steven Farris ","I think two things.  I think we haven\u2019t done what we said we were going to do in 2012.  And I think that as we get further into the process with Egypt in terms of the continuity of Egypt, I think that will help.  We\u2019ve got 26 rigs running in Egypt.  We continue to get paid every day.  It generates a tremendous amount of cash.  And I think over time people will get more comfortable with that.","Joe Allman - JPMorgan ","And when you look at the underperformance of the stock, are you focused mostly on over the past year or so, are you focused on underperformance over a longer period of time?","Steven Farris ","No, if you look at our stock performance truthfully, through 2010, it\u2019s been very competitive with any of our peer companies.  If you look at 2011 and 2012, we\u2019ve really digressed.","Joe Allman - JPMorgan ","Is a lot of the problem just concerns about Egypt, do you think?  The market\u2019s perception, with the headline risk about Egypt?  Do you think that\u2019s the reason for the underperformance?","Steven Farris ","Well, I think you can make your own assessments.  We think that has some impact on our stock price.","Joe Allman - JPMorgan ","And then lastly, just the process, have you opened data rooms yet in the asset sales process?  And why not define the assets at this point?  What is it about the process that makes you just want to keep the assets you want to sell confidential or secret?","Steven Farris ","Well, we have a pretty broad asset list, number one.  Number two, we started the process about four months ago, and I think the best thing we can do is do it, and then announce it, as opposed to advertising what we\u2019re doing as we go forward, both from a competitive stand and from a market standpoint.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs ","Steve, you\u2019ve never been shy about opportunistically acquiring assets from the majors or others.  Are you as interested as you have been in acquisitions that can improve predictability of growth?  And does the resulting stronger balance sheet open up that opportunity?  Or are you going to be more focused on the assets that you have?","Steven Farris ","We\u2019ve had this discussion before.  I think companies, people, go through lifecycles, and right now our lifecycle is to give us a portfolio that we can grow organically.  We certainly have been very successful in the acquisition market.  That\u2019s not one of our focuses at the present time.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs ","And we\u2019ve seen volatility in Apache\u2019s production, which has been in part a function of a number of items, weather, other disruptions.  Yet you mentioned earlier you\u2019re interested in having more predictable growth.  Would the assets that you\u2019re planning to sell have reduced the volatility that we\u2019ve seen in production, say in the first quarter of 2013, or in 2012?","Steven Farris ","Long term, what we want to do is have a more predictable growth profile.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs ","And I guess if you look back on, let\u2019s say the last quarter and the last year, and the assets that you\u2019re looking to sell, if we would have sold those a year ago, year and a half ago, would that have made that more predictable, less volatile?  ","Steven Farris ","When we announce what we are going to sell, then we can have this discussion.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs ","And then lastly, just a single asset question.  In your Permian Basin update, you mentioned a couple of strong Wichita Albany wells that had some pretty good rates.  I just was wondering if that\u2019s an area that you see running room in what the production mix is between oil and gas and natural gas liquids.","Steven Farris ","Yeah, Wichita Albany is largely oil.  We do have some running room in that area.  Those wells have been, like a lot of the wells in the Tonkawa in Oklahoma, those Wichita Albany wells have far exceeded our expectations.  We\u2019ve got wells that make 900 barrels a day and are still making 800 barrels a day.  It\u2019s been a very good play for us.  And we do have running room in that play.","Operator","[Operator instructions.]  Your next question comes from the line of [Kyle Rose] with RBC.   ","[Kyle Rose] - RBC","How should we think about Egyptian gas prices for the rest of the year?","Steven Farris ","I think Egyptian gas prices, that number will be the same number going forward really forever.  That is our gas price now.  And the reason is, and I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard this before, we had a gas contract that rolled off at the end of 2012 that was one of our higher-priced gas contracts in Egypt.  That\u2019s the last one of those kind.  ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate with Bank of America.  ","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch ","I apologize, I was a little late getting on the call, so I hope none of these have been asked.  My first question, I guess on the portfolio high-grading, or the asset sales I guess you could call it, there\u2019s been a lot of chatter about the Gulf of Mexico discoveries being in that package or in that process.  And I guess my question isn\u2019t so much about is that true or not, but it\u2019s really more about your philosophy on exploration and bringing longer-dated projects\u2026 You know, you make a discovery, it\u2019s a five year out to development type of situation, is your decision to go down a more aggressive asset sales route impacting your view of exploration as a kind of core strategy for the company?","Steven Farris ","I think if you look at our portfolio today, from where it was in 2010, we have now invested in the [Wheatstone] project, which is a long term project that is basically oil-related.  It will come on in late 2016 and effectively be 35,000 barrels of oil a day for 20 years.  That\u2019s about 270 million barrels of oil production.  ","So if you look at our long term projects that we have, we\u2019ve got 50 Bcf in Liard that is associated with our Kitimat project.  Those are long-lead items that take capital, that also provide steady future revenues for years to come.  So in terms of what we look at selling, are the things that have high cost right now, that have lumpy production in the future.  ","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch ","Are you happy with the balance? Because obviously these up front long term large projects are dilutive to your core goal, which is I guess return on capital.  So are you happy that you\u2019ve got the right balance of short term and long term currently?  Or do you see that as\u2026","Steven Farris ","We do right now, because Wheatstone, we have 13%, we\u2019ve got one more year of capital associated with it, and frankly, with Wheatstone, we\u2019ll just have to see how that goes.  We haven\u2019t reached FID yet with Kitimat, and we\u2019ll have to make that decision when we get there.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch ","And I guess my follow up Steve, and I know this comes up a lot, and I apologize in advance, but Egypt, I think they just had their credit rating downgraded by a third party earlier this morning.  It doesn\u2019t seem to be getting any better.  And I guess when you think about discount rates applied to your cash flow, which obviously operationally things are going well, but the value doesn\u2019t seem to be [unintelligible].  Is there any updated thought as to how you address the exposure issue?  Is it just getting too big a part of the portfolio, given the escalating risk profile?  Or are you still happy to hold things as they stand currently?","Steven Farris ","Well, I think you\u2019ve got to look at the results.  They have gone through a number of quarters now, and almost two years, and we continue to be very profitable there.  We continue to think that that will level out over time.  My opinion is, Egyptians are Egyptian-first, and then that part of the world.  We were just there a month and a half ago, and I feel very good about the forward plan in Egypt.  How we convince our U.S. investor base that that is the way it is another matter.  ","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch ","Should we think about Argentina as being been a long term part of the portfolio?","Steven Farris ","Truthfully, Argentina\u2019s got a lot of great resources.  Right now they\u2019re troubled politically.  How that fits in our program long term we\u2019ll just have to see.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Amir Avif with Stifel Nicolaus.","Amir Avif - Stifel Nicolaus ","A follow up question on the Permian sequential growth.  It was a little slower this quarter.  Is that just due to the facility downtime?  And can you just [inaudible] you might be running into there\u2019s in the Permian, as you start wrapping up activity?","Rod Eichler ","Yeah, we had some facility downtime, but we also had some capacity constraints.  As we\u2019ve been ramping up our drilling activity and associated production volumes, we\u2019ll be out in front of the ability to hook up the wells and move products out of there.  There\u2019s about a 2.5% on the first quarter.","Amir Avif - Stifel Nicolaus ","And that should be alleviated by Q2?  ","Rod Eichler ","That will be an ongoing challenge throughout the year.","Amir Avif - Stifel Nicolaus ","And a follow up question, if you could give us an update on your drilling of your acreage in the Miss Lime and the Bakken?","Steven Farris ","We have not drilled any wells in the Bakken, nor the Miss Lime, in this last quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Harry Mateer with Barclays.","Harry Mateer - Barclays ","A follow up on my earlier questions about the debt reduction.  You mentioned $900 million of short term debt, and then $600 million change of [CP], but that gets you to a little over $1.5 billion.  So if I could just ask a minor point on how we get to the $2 billion, is it because you think you\u2019re going to be slightly free cash flow negative through this year, so you\u2019ll add some debt?  And then that will be paid down?  Or is there something else that I\u2019m missing?","Tom Chambers ","Typically what happens in the first half of the year is when we get off to a quick start, which we have this year, in all of our regions, we usually run a little cash flow negative for the first half, and that\u2019s our plan.  We\u2019re actually tracking on that now, so we\u2019ll be able to pay down some debt, [unintelligible] will come from that.","Harry Mateer - Barclays ","So relative to first quarter debt balances, debt reduction is not going to be quite $2 billion, it will be less than that?  Is that fair?  Because it\u2019s going to go up a little bit next quarter?  ","Tom Chambers  ","Yeah, based on balance, that\u2019s correct.","Operator","Your last question comes from the line of Nathan Churchill of Societe Generale","","Nathan Churchill - Societe Generale","Just back on the asset adjustments, wondering if there are any particular constraints that you have in the portfolio as far as investing some of this additional cash that you have coming in.  I know your share price has been a little bit depressed, and I think the buyback makes sense, but just wondering how you think about weighing the buyback versus maybe increasing capex, and also if you\u2019ve considered maybe an MLP of the assets if they\u2019re high cash-generative and low growth.","Steven Farris ","I will tell you, in terms of the share buyback, I think, from a board standpoint, and from a management standpoint, we find ourselves in a unique position, because we have relatively high commodity prices, at least on the oil side, and our stock has got a lot of upside in it.  So I consider stock buyback [an event], but this is a very good event to buy your stock back.","I can assure you, we have, over the last several months, looked at a number of combinations of an asset base that we want to come out of this going forward.  ","Nathan Churchill - Societe Generale ","On the buyback, it wasn\u2019t really explicitly said, but are these shares cancellation?","Steven Farris ","We have no one in here that answers that question.  [laughter]","Nathan Churchill - Societe Generale ","Okay, maybe switch gears for a second.  Can you give us some insight as to what you\u2019re seeing on the service cost side?  Has it hit an inflection point as service costs started to bottom, domestically that is?","Steven Farris ","I think as we all learn, not just Apache, but I think as our industry learns ways to reduce cost, I think service costs will continue to come down for a while.  I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve hit the bottom yet, for all kinds of reasons, because of the different ways you\u2019re sourcing things now, and the different services major service companies provide versus what they used to provide.  That\u2019s all changing, as I\u2019m sure you\u2019re aware.","Nathan Churchill - Societe Generale ","Of course.  And there is the learning curve benefit and then there\u2019s the actual price of the curve, so I was just trying to tease out how I should think about the moving pieces there.","Rod Eichler ","Well, drilling rates in the Permian Basin, for example, have been increasing since 2008.  However, the curve is flattening.  If you look at the day rate increases, the increased from 2012, to what we\u2019re seeing in 2013, it\u2019s only about a 5% increase on average for the 42 rigs we\u2019re running out there.  So we\u2019re starting to see that curve starting to turn over.  Rig availability is not an issue.  As I mentioned in my remarks, we have a large number of programs in place to reduce costs in all elements of drilling and completion.  In fact, some of the cost reductions have been rather dramatic that we\u2019ve experienced in the last 12 months through these efforts.","Operator","And at this time, presenters, there are no further questions.  Do you have any closing remarks?","Brady Parish ","No, I think that\u2019s it.  Thanks, everyone, for participating on our call.  We appreciate it.   "],"1790":["Apache Corp.

These can both be found on our website at www.apachecorp.com\/financialinformation.","Today\u2019s discussion will contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions based on our current views and most reasonable expectations. However, a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from what we discuss today. A full disclaimer is located with the supplemental data package on our website.","This morning we reported 2013 earnings of $2.2 billion or $5.50 per diluted share. Adjusted earnings, which excludes certain items that impact the comparability of results totaled $3.2 million or $7.92 per diluted share. Cash flow from operating activities totaled $9.8 billion for the year.","During the fourth quarter, total net production averaged approximately 688,000 boe per day with liquids production constituting 55% of the total. Total net production excluding the noncontrolling interest in Egypt totaled 661,500 boe per day.","In addition to the sales of the noncontrolling interest which closed on November 14th production during the fourth quarter was impacted by the sale of our Gulf of Mexico Shelf operations which closed on September 30th, the sales of selected Canadian assets which closed in September and October, and the impact of severe weather on our Permian and Central region operations all which we previously disclosed. ","As a final note, I want to remind everyone about our upcoming Investor Day which will be held the morning of February 26th at Houston. Among other things we will be providing 2014 capital and production guidance, as well as a longer term view of our high graded portfolio is capable of achieving. We look forward to see you there.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Steve.","Steve Farris","Thank you, Brady. And excuse me, good afternoon, everyone, and thanks all of you for joining us. As Brady pointed out, despite the uncertainty surrounding our fourth quarter results associated with divestitures, Apache reported another year of strong financial results. We generated $3.2 billion of adjusted earnings and $9.8 billion cash flow from operations.","And our performance is in large part due to the success of our strategy to rebalance our portfolio to drive returns by achieving the right mix of predictable production growth from North American onshore assets combined with substantial free cash flow generation from our International operations.","During the past year we successfully executed our strategy in three important areas. Rebalancing our portfolio by divesting of assets that\u2019s no longer fit our ideal growth for cash flow return profile but the end results being a higher growth, more predictable and profitable portfolio.","Maintaining our relentless focus on being best-in-class in operational execution, which frankly has been a long time core of Apache over the years. Taking a discipline approach to capital allocation that enables us to grow production, reduce operating costs and enhance return to shareholders.","First, with the Argentina sales which we have announced yesterday after the market close, we have largely accomplished what we have set out to do in 2010. To make our North American onshore regions a center piece of our growth strategy going forward.","This latest transaction is on the heels of completing over $7 billion of divestitures in 2013, needed high grading our portfolio to include the right mix of assets capable of generating strong returns, driving more predictable production growth and enhancing shareholder value.","We still have a couple of small packages, we are marketing one in South Texas and one in Canada, but we should get done in the first half this year, but in all we expect the heavy lifting is certainly behind us.","Pro forma for 2013 completed transaction plus Argentina. Our North American onshore production represents nearly 60% of our total production during the fourth quarter of 2013. That\u2019s up from 70% during 2009, the year before we embarked on our strategy to substantial bolster our North American resource base.","In addition, our North American asset base which contains 1.81 billion barrels of oil equivalent approved reserve now represent 71% of our total year end reserves with the pro forma of Argentina and even a larger percentage of our total resource base.","Second, with regard to operational execution, we demonstrated the effectiveness of our transition for North American onshore liquids growth in 2013, with all four of our onshore North American regions increase in liquids production at attractive rates of return.","You can read more details about our operational performance in our operational supplement. But I am going to mention a few highlights. Our North American onshore liquids production increased nearly 46,000 barrels per day or 34% full year 2013 versus 2012. During the fourth quarter we averaged 187,000 barrels per day represents nearly 50% of our total worldwide liquids production and 27% of our overall production.","Just as impressively, our 2013 onshore North America crude oil production grew nearly 23,000 barrels a day, which is an increase of 23% versus 2012. Our fourth quarter North American oil production averaged 134,000 barrels per day, representing nearly 19% of our total worldwide production. Both of these exceptional production growth rates place us in the top of our large peer group.","Furthermore, our U.S. onshore resource base continues to deliver sector leading performance. During 2013, Apache was the most active onshore U.S. driller, running an average of 71 rigs and completing 1,150 gross wells.","During the fourth quarter, we averaged a combined production of 227,000 barrels equivalent per day from our Permian and Central Regions alone. We are nearly one-third of our total production.","In addition for the first time, we treated 100,000 barrels a day of combined crude oil production from these two regions. Importantly, we have combined our production growth with a relentless focus on operational execution and cost efficiency.","In all of our onshore regions, we continue to do what Apache does best and that\u2019s reduce costs, increase production, driving returns. During the fourth quarter, we lowered our lease operating by 11% to nearly $10 per boe.","Finally, as I mentioned in our press release, we replaced 140% of our worldwide production to our exploration and development activities. We also grew our proved reserve base by nearly 4% on a pro forma basis. Excluding acquisitions, divestments and revisions, this was predominantly driven by our outstanding results from our onshore North American drilling activities from which we replaced over 200% of production.","The Permian had exceptional performance, replacing nearly 325% of production and drilling reserves by nearly 14%, from 800 million barrels of oil equivalent to 910 million barrels of oil equivalent, which now comprises over 34% of our year end proved reserves. This is best-in-class versus Permian Basin operators in our weight class.","Similarly, Central replaced nearly 200% of its production and grew its reserve by nearly 14% to 304 million barrels of oil equivalent, which constituted nearly 12% of our proved reserves. Third, with respect to capital allocation, on prior calls, we stated we will primarily use the net proceeds received from these divestitures to reduce debt and repurchase shares under our 30 million share authorization from our Board.","Using a portion of the sales proceeds received during 2013, we reduced our debt by $2.6 billion to $9.7 billion and repurchase $1 billion of stocks at year end. In addition, we have repurchased $100 million of stocks so far this year, bringing the total number of shares to 12.4 million. We continue to believe our stock is a compelling investment at current price levels.","Finally, we announced last week that our Board increased our 2014 quarterly dividend by 25% to $0.25 per share. This follows increases of 18% in 2013 and 13% in 2012. The significant increases are direct reflection of the confidence we have executing our future growth plans.","As Brady mentioned, we are going to provide our 2014 capital and production guidance at our Investor Day on February 26th as well as provide a longer term view of what we believe our high graded portfolio is capable of achieving. I think you are going to be pleased with what you see.","As a final comment, we firmly believe that the strides we have made in our efforts to rebalance our portfolio have enabled us to emerge from this process a stronger company. One that can continue to do what we do best. Exploit our inventory of opportunities, allocate capital to generate attractive returns, profitably and predictably grow our production and in the end create long-term value to our shareholders.","So with that, I would like to turn the call over to Tom Chambers.","Tom Chambers","Thanks, Steve and good afternoon everyone. Fourth quarter like the rest of the year was a busy one in terms of activities to reposition the portfolio. This was the first quarter without the shelf production. We completed two additional property sales in Canada and closed on the sale of one-third non-controlling interest in our Egypt business to Sinopec.","We also bought back additional $750 million of Apache shares during the quarter, bringing the buyback to total of $1 billion in 2013 and in addition, paid down debt. Consequently, the quarter\u2019s financial results were not fully reflective of Apache going forward in 2014.","One key element I want to highlight before we go any further is the change you will notice in our financial reporting as a result of sale to Sinopec, up to one-third minority stake in our Egypt operations.","Since we retained a controlling interest in the assets under the accounting standards, we continue to consolidate the entire region to reflect Sinopec's non-controlling interest separately in our financial statements.","For instance, on our income statement, we back out Sinopec\u2019s interest in the new line item called net income attributable to non-controlling interest. Similarly, production and reserves are also reported on a fully consolidated basis and the amount attributable to the non-controlling interest is indicated in footnotes of the tables.","As a result, all of our comparable metrics remain the same. All data to which I refer is based on the GAAP numbers. The financial supplement also on our website provides additional details showing the impact to Apache on a net basis.","Turning to the results, we finished the fourth quarter with production averaging nearly 690,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, lower than the previous quarter as expected, primarily impacted by the Shelf and Canadian property sales.","More importantly though we created a strong foundation on which to move forward. During the year, we were able to shift our production mix to 54% liquids, up from 51% in the prior year. Also, North American onshore liquids production increased over 34% from 2012.","Oil price realizations averaged approximately $102 per barrel for the year, down 1% from 2012. For the quarter, oil realizations were 6% lower than third quarter at a $100.59 per barrel. Bear in mind for the quarter and going forward, with the divestiture of our Shelf assets, less of our oil production is receiving Brent like prices, which directly reduces our overall realizations.","We are now seeing about 60% of our oil production priced at Brent or Brent comparable indexes, down from 64% in the third quarter. Gas prices for the year averaged $3.70, a $0.10 per mcf decrease from last year as our prior year hedges rolls off. For the quarter, bit of a cold weather propped up prices to $3.71 in mcf, 6% higher than the sequential quarter.","Heading into 2014, we have hedged 62,500 barrels per day of each Brent and WTI oil at a $100 and $91 per barrel respectively. On the gas side, we\u2019ve hedged 100 million cubic feet a day of gas, commencing in February, rising to 150 million cubic feet per day in March through December at an average price of $4.29. All hedges are financial and not cash flow hedges.","Despite a year with a lot of moving parts, we are able to report solid earnings of $2.2 billion or $5.50 per share, up $0.14 -- 14% from 2012 despite the impact of several key non-recurring items.","Our results included $659 million in after-tax non-cash property write-downs primarily related to full cost ceiling impairments in the U.S., North Sea and Argentina. We also distributed $643 million in cash proceeds received from our strategic partnership with Sinopec in Egypt, back to the U.S. which resulted in a deferred tax charge of approximately $225 million.","In current year net operating loss will be utilized to offset any current tax otherwise due on this repatriation. We had unrealized after-tax derivative losses of $142 million and the $65 million benefit in other deferred taxes associated with foreign currency fluctuations and valuation allowances. When we remove all these non-cash items for comparability purposes we earn $3.2 billion or $7.92 per share for 2013 versus $3.8 billion a year ago.","Operating cash flows remain strong given the performance of our North America onshore base. We generated $9.8 billion cash flow from operations before working capital items and $2.1 billion in the fourth quarter. Total cash operating expenses were $17.32 per barrel of oil equivalent for the quarter and $17.62 for the full year. The lower rate in the fourth quarter reflects some of the benefits of exiting the higher cost Shelf properties, the lease operating expenses which we have done over $1 per boe from sequential quarter.","Apache\u2019s cash margins decreased by 5% versus the third quarter to $40.50 per boe and 5% versus the prior year to $40.99 per boe, primarily driven by lower oil prices and realized derivative losses. Our product mix and shift to geographic emphasis has also impacted our tax rate for the quarter. Our effective tax rate after adjusting for non-recurring items was 44%, higher than historical. This was the result of loss of Shelf revenue which skewed our total revenue to our higher tax rate international regions. This higher tax rate, plus the lower realizations discussed earlier could be two of the main differences between reported and consensus estimates.","Likewise our effective tax rate for the full year 2013 was 46%. Adjusting for non-recurring items mentioned earlier, the effective tax rate would have been a more typical 42%. The $7 billion in cash proceeds from our Egypt Shelf and Canadian transactions we were able to effectively deploy the cash to increase drilling in 2013, enhance our [audio gap] and commence our share buyback program.","We increased our U.S. onshore drilling program by $700 million over our original budget, paid down debt by $2.6 billion to $9.7 billion at year end and bought back share in 2013 totaling $1 billion. We purchased an additional $100 million of stock in January bringing the total buyback since inception to $1.1 billion and 12.4 million shares bringing the outstanding share count as of end of January at 394.7 million shares.","Just as important we exited the year with a debt to capitalization ratio of 22%, no commercial paper outstanding and $1.9 billion in cash which adds flexibility to our balance sheet and is a nice position to have as we head into 2014.","This concludes our prepared remarks. I will now turn call back over to Brady?","Brady Parish","Thank you, Tom. Operator, we are now ready to open the lines for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Pearce Hammond with Simmons & Co.","Pearce Hammond - Simmons & Co.","As highlighted in your operations of data, I noticed in the Permian a change in some of your net acreage positions, have you done some recent land work or is it just a new assessment of prospectivity for the different zones in the Permian?","Steve Farris","Pearce, it\u2019s really something we continually do as we look at this and some areas we picked up some acreage, some areas we have let it little bit go. So I think that\u2019s the dynamics of what we are doing. Also in the plays we\u2019re chasing we\u2019ll be acquiring. So it\u2019s a little bit of everything and I think we will outline that in great detail in a couple of weeks at the Analyst Day.","Pearce Hammond - Simmons & Co.","Great. And then a follow-up, it was the big industry-wide ramp in activity in the Permian, how are service costs trending there right now and what have you done not relating yourself from any surface cost creep or service availability issues?","Steve Farris","We continue to the business as we build critical math and we\u2019re in the low 40 rig count the Permian for mid part of last year. So I think it\u2019s something we got people in place we got relationships in place, we\u2019ve kept frac crews and drilling rigs busy. So that\u2019s been very good. I think in general we see cost trending now and they are flat right now in terms of service. A lot of that at this point is going to be driven by efficiencies. Producing days are just getting better and the exploits we continue to do every day.","Pearce Hammond - Simmons & Co.","Great. And then the last one for me, I know it\u2019s the gathering transmission and processing facility capital spending, last year was a big enough to think about 1.3 million up from nearly 800 million year before. Is that something, is that little more one-off or you would expect it to be at these elevated levels for a while?","Steve Farris","Again we looked at the detail of the chart, I would assume that it\u2019s one of our Wheatstone project and also we built the plant in (inaudible) it\u2019s a best plant in (inaudible) it\u2019s probably the uptick. The vast majority of it would be associated with our Wheatstone LNG in Australia.","Pearce Hammond - Simmons & Co.","Thank you very much, Steve","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bob Brackett with Bernstein.","Bob Brackett - Bernstein","Okay. Following up on the comment on the heavy lifting behind us in terms of asset sales, how does that drive with the notion of the Sinopec deal being part of a strategic partnership?","Steve Farris","When I was talking about its repositioning, we are probably out. In terms of what we set out to do several years ago actually is North America went to work is centerpiece of our growth because we have over 3 million acres in the Permian, we have over 2 million acres in the Anadarko Basin and we have some plays in South Texas, we have some plays in Canada. And that\u2019s going to attract most of the capital, but it really taking about is the base in terms of either having assets that can grow or assets that provide cash flow and if they can\u2019t do either, that\u2019s not going to be part of the portfolio.","Bob Brackett - Bernstein","And then on the other question, if I look at sort of the implied price at which you were repurchasing your equity. It\u2019s probably closed to the high 80s, almost touching 90 and we\u2019re sitting here today at a much more attractive entry point. How does that drive your thinking about the share repurchases?","Steve Farris","No. I think I said in my prepared remarks, we view our stock as a good investment price now. I think our average price was probably around 85 bucks or little. I don\u2019t have that in front of me.","Bob Brackett - Bernstein","Well, thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Tameron with Wells Fargo.","David Tameron - Wells Fargo","Hi. Good morning. Can I just talk about the ramp? I guess, good afternoon. Sorry. Could I just talk about the ramps and the vertical to the horizontal and in the Permian. How should we think about that over the next whatever -- next four quarters, next six quarters, I\u2019m just trying to figure out with you guys, what that looks like?","Steve Farris","David, I think where we ended the fourth quarter was about 50-50 on the terms of what you see out there. We did start dropping some vertical rigs in the third quarter as we transitioned and picked up some verticals. Right now, we\u2019re running slightly more horizontals and verticals and I would anticipate that trend moving forward. We\u2019ll get into the details at the Analyst Day as we start looking forward.","David Tameron - Wells Fargo","Okay. And then if I just -- I hate to ask a detailed question. If I could just ask about the weather impact in both the Permian and Central. Did you guys have -- I\u2019m just trying to figure out what the true run rate is for what those region ex weather impact. Can you give us\u2026","John Christmann","In Permian, it was about 3,000 BOE a day, net in terms of the fourth quarter. Most of that was from the November storm that hit pretty hard. Central was a smaller number and it was not as impacted as we were in Permian.","David Tameron - Wells Fargo","Okay. And all the weather impacts behind for now?","John Christmann","You will see several numbers in Central as you look going into January and February and a little bit Permian as well.","David Tameron - Wells Fargo","Okay. I\u2019ll let somebody else chip in. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Malone with Mizuho Securities.","Steve Farris","Two questions is enough.","John Malone - Mizuho Securities","Good afternoon. One, just, can you give us an update on Kitimat, the marketing process here, I\u2019m going to talk now about Asian companies looking at gas and (inaudible) anything you can comment on that and how things are going there?","Steve Farris","Well, I will tell you with Chevron as our Partner and Chevron is leading that effort. The downstream and the pipeline is now operated by Chevron, really part of the marketing. We have a dual marketing agreement but certainly Chevron with their knowledge and history in the market is leading that.","I can tell you we continue to talk to people more than just slightly. I think what we said, I know I said it in Goldman this -- this year is a year. We got to rightsize the size of Kitimat in our portfolio and that could come several different ways. One is with a Sinopec buyer taking an interest across the board. But I happen to read, John Watson\u2019s comment in Chevron\u2019s year end conference call. Certainly it is a big asset for them and it is a big asset for us.","John Malone - Mizuho Securities","Okay. Fair enough. Thanks. There is a question for Tom. It looks like there was an uptick if I\u2019m reading correctly and the additional portion is of DD&A. Can you just tell me what was behind that?","Tom Chambers","There was a lot of DD&A and I kind of went through a number of those on the call. We had write-offs. We had charge for bringing cash back to certain charge of $225 million to bring cash back. So when you add all that in, that picked up DD&A.","John Malone - Mizuho Securities","Okay. So all that you mentioned now gets piled into that, that additional DD&A number?","Tom Chambers","Yes.","John Malone - Mizuho Securities","Okay. Perfect. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs","Thank you. Good afternoon.","Steve Farris","Hi Brian.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs","In Permian, you highlighted in the ops update, you are buying hard area and the Reagan County as the key component of the Wolfcamp program. Can you put into context your views on the rest of your Midland and Wolfcamp acreage, the differences and similarities you see in the upper versus the middle zone wells and whether you plan to test any of the shallower zones horizontally?","John Christmann","At this point, Brian, (inaudible) lot of wells. We ramped six rigs versus last year. We currently got five in there right now. As there we got and it really work hard to try to understand. I think as we all know as you move back to the lower to the west and Midland Basin, we\u2019ve had good results. Clearly, we got, I think seven rigs running in those other areas. So it\u2019s area we will start to shift to, take our learnings from Barnhart and that\u2019s something we will walk through in two weeks as we outline in our Analyst Day. But there is also multiple other zones that we\u2019re looking at there. And so not just in the Wolfcamp.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs","Got it. Now you\u2019re seeing some of the results so far from the Upper, from the Middle and the Barnhart?","Steve Farris","I would say good results from both zones.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs","Okay. Thanks. And then separately just in terms of how you\u2019re thinking about 2014 maybe this is more analyst material but can you just talk about CapEx versus cash flow and level of comfort without spending versus not outstanding this year ex Kitimat and Wheatstone and with Kitimat and Wheatstone?","John Christmann","In terms of the details of all that we\u2019ll certainly get into that on in our February 26 Analyst Day. I think I\u2019ve said at Goldman conference. We\u2019re going to look within our cash flow with our E&D budget and we\u2019re going to finance our LNG project outside of our cash flow.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Herrlin with Societe Generale.","John Herrlin - Societe Generale","Two quick ones, assuming you\u2019ve maintained a kind of run rate in Permian and Central as you have been on a spending basis and activity basis. Should we expect if prices are kind of constant to have a similar or large amount of reserve ads in terms of expansion discoveries. As far as I can recall, this is the most onshore ad you\u2019ve ever had onshore. That\u2019s one -- if this is run rate basis we\u2019ll see this repeat?","Steve Farris","Well, certainly let me kind of answer that directly. We\u2019re going to show a lot of that on the 26th of February. But what we\u2019ve been up to over the last three years is to make those certainly the Permian and Central region and some of the other things we\u2019re doing in North America, the center piece of our growth. So we would expect to continue to be able to grow on Permian, Central and our overall onshore North American assets.","John Herrlin - Societe Generale","Okay. Thanks Steve. Regarding Argentina, you did have a lot of unconventional potential. Was it just not worth all the hassles, political in terms of getting money out of the country in terms of repatriation?","Steve Farris","It\u2019s a situation that is for us. It was 3% or 4% of our reserve, 3% or 4% of our production. And if you think about the opportunities that we have in North American onshore and you think about bringing that money forward, what we can do with, it made all the sense in the world, John.","John Herrlin - Societe Generale","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate with Bank of America.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America","Thanks everybody. Hey Steve, I was wondering if I could just come back on portfolio rationalization question. Specifically when you sold the Gulf of Mexico, one of the, I guess, justifications was the reserve life had -- it is difficult to see how you could replicate recent terms of the market and have been able to give credit for it. But it did generate free cash flow. I\u2019m just wondering, it seems to me that the U.K. kind of falls into lot of the same categories. So I guess, my question is are you not done with your portfolio rationalization and if so why does U.K. to rank as competing for capital versus the onshore. And I\u2019ve got a quick follow-up please.","Steve Farris","Yeah. What we have said is we want assets that generates substantial cash flow. We want assets that can grow. In the North Sea, we\u2019ve been able to generate quite a bit of excess cash flow while keeping it relatively quiet. But one thing I would say, the difference between that and Gulf of Mexico we were facing about $250 million a year of abandonment liability because of the change in the laws, because of Macondo, so it was time to divest that asset.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America","Okay. So do you (inaudible).","Steve Farris","What we have on the books right now is our assets going forward and we think we have tremendous potential to grow where we are.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America","Great. I appreciate that. And maybe my follow-ups for Tom maybe. Tom, you gave us the earnings number for the non-controlling interest, I wondered -- and which is the housekeeping question though, I wonder if you can give us cash flow numbers associated with that and I will leave it there? Thanks.","Tom Chambers","I don\u2019t have the cash flow, you know the way the accounting, accounts work there wasn\u2019t very much actual cash flow that came out and since we didn\u2019t do the acquisition for the sale until middle of November, but it\u2019s going to come out in investing and will show up in investing activities on a go forward basis. I don\u2019t have that number in front of me Doug, but we can get. If you call Brady afterwards, he will get it for you.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America","All right. Thanks everybody.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Leo Mariani with RBC.","Leo Mariani - RBC","Just a follow-up question here on Argentina, would you guys expect to report that is discontinued operations at all in the first quarter, or is it going to stay in your financials until the deal closes? And then I guess additionally, are you guys going to be able to repatriate all that capital back to the U.S. and there isn\u2019t going to be any tax leakage.","Tom Chambers","Leo, we are still looking at how we are going to report. Obviously, we just signed the deal yesterday, hasn\u2019t closed yet. So we are looking at, by the end of the day we should have an answer on how we are going to report it. In terms of the cash, the cash will remain overseas until we determine what our needs are both internationally and domestically.","Leo Mariani - RBC","Okay, I guess\u2026","Steve Farris","And the currency is U.S. dollars.","Tom Chambers","U.S. dollars.","Leo Mariani - RBC","Okay. I guess just looking at Egypt here, kind of getting into your financial supplement, it looks like your gross production kicked up this quarter from Q3 in the first time a little while. Do you guys see any kind of renewed growth going forward? In Egypt I think your rig count has been pretty steady, but I guess the growth production hadn\u2019t done much until this quarter. Just trying to get a sense of dynamic there, do you guys think that you have done better captive growth here going forward?","Steve Farris","","I think that the uptick that we have seen in the fourth quarter is largely a timing thing. We had a fairly slow process in getting new development leases approved, but what\u2019s that happened at the beginning in the year of the third quarter we had that uptick in production and you are seeing all the new discoveries coming online at this point in time. That\u2019s the explanation to that.","Leo Mariani - RBC","Okay. And I guess that is looking at the Gulf of Mexico Shelf, I thought it was a little bit of production in the fourth quarter, is that just prior period adjustment or is that actually some lingering legacy stuff and maybe one so?","Steve Farris","Well, I think it\u2019s associated with the state water stuff that we have.","Tom Chambers","But also remember we had some rights that didn\u2019t close until the fourth quarter, so that reflects the production off of properties until they close.","Leo Mariani - RBC","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Hall with Heikkinen Energy.","Michael Hall - Heikkinen Energy","I guess, first on my and the operational supplement had some info on the Delaware Basin, just curious, it look likes it\u2019s pretty low working interest on the acreage position there. How much of that is operated and all the activity you are moving forward here near term? Are there any particular areas that you are focused on and what\u2019s the interest looks like around those assets?","Steve Farris","When you look at Delaware Basin position, we have picked up a lot of that through BP and so we do some metals which has some lower interest and the good news is we\u2019ve got high nets. There is an update to the operational supplement that Chaparral 89 #101H, it\u2019s a 3rd Bone Spring horizontal. We had opened the chokes as well as the numbers in the report are flowing, it\u2019s now making 972, it\u2019s kind of a peak on the oil side at 3.4 million for boe a day of 1,375 and 30 day average now is over 1,000 barrels a day. We have got another one in the Shelf and we have the demonstrated staying on. So we are excited about the Delaware and which is our acreage position, it\u2019s taken us a little longer to accomplish some things together and get some critical mass so we can clear in a position to drill horizontally in there.","Michael Hall - Heikkinen Energy","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks. Look forward to more color at the Analyst Day and then I guess last one, you have mentioned a package for sale in South Texas, any color around what exactly for sale there, is it more, is it there, getting your asset?","Steve Farris","Yeah. I -- its small gas assets that are just scattered around the South Texas, they are just cleaned up.","Michael Hall - Heikkinen Energy","Okay, and\u2026","Steve Farris","I am sorry?","Michael Hall - Heikkinen Energy","Not the big block usage in era?","Steve Farris","I mean which is drilling in so we are drilling quite a few well in that part of the world right now.","Michael Hall - Heikkinen Energy","Okay. Very good. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joe Magner with Macquarie.","Joe Magner - Macquarie","Good afternoon. I want to follow up on the Barnhart\u2019s question from earlier. It looks like in the ops report volumes in December were down to 10,000 barrels a day, I think that\u2019s down from around 13,000 barrels a day in early October. I am just curious what\u2019s happening there at the Barnhart.","Steve Farris","It\u2019s a timing issue, I mean I think now what we have found is with five rigs running out there currently right now, we now have to drill sections and some buffer before we go on and complete the lot of wells. So it\u2019s just a simple timing issue of when you bring those pads on, I mean right now with the section where we laid out four uppers and four lowers, we think we can get those on with five to six rigs running and two frac crews in about 90 to 120 days. And so it\u2019s purely a timing issue of brining production on.","Joe Magner - Macquarie","Okay. And that\u2019s four lower, four upper is that sort of the spacing that you determine is optimal for that area?","Steve Farris","We will go into more of that on Analyst Day, but I mean right now that\u2019s kind of where we are, but I think as you look the unconventional, just like conventional in Permian you know you have been in for drilling for 50 years in this type rock. And when you look at the unconventional, they are even tighter. So I think there is going to be room to continue downspacing as we go forward.","Joe Magner - Macquarie","Okay. Just one clarification Steve you mentioned what\u2019s in the portfolio now is what would be in the going forward. There has been some talk about potential deepwater Gulf of Mexico transaction, any update or thoughts on that?","Steve Farris","No, I think we stand by our statement. What we are going into 2014 now with the Argentina now I will tell you, Argentina was the long-term company, we have worked on that for a months and months and months, but in terms of assets that we have right now as stands Argentina and stands the Canadian gas package, small Canadian gas package, I don\u2019t want to over-emphasize that, I just want to bring up that we have couple of other things marketing out there. The assets which you see right now, the assets we are going to go forward with and I will be real honest with you, I am extremely excited about what we are today.","Joe Magner - Macquarie","Okay. Thanks for the update.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Campbell with Tuohy Brothers Investment Research.","Jeffrey Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research","Good afternoon. I want to go back into the Delaware again and just be a little bit more specific. In the supplement that you put out, you have said that you got to achieve commercialization of the 2nd and 3rd Bone Springs and the Wolfcamp and Reeves and Loving County. I was wondering if you could just give some color as to what commercialization means maybe on acreage or locations and are this going to be develop simultaneously on that?","Steve Farris","Well, Jeff, Oldham County specifically, we\u2019ve got a really nice block of acreage out there. We got three rigs running right now. We\u2019re drilling second third most rigs both, as well as in Wolfcamp. So we\u2019ve got a play that we feel really good about in there and the numbers are starting to show and that Shelf well that is update to be honest, one of the third Bone Springs that we brought on in December.","So the nice thing about that area it doesn\u2019t take big acreage block because you can stack a lots of horizontals in and we\u2019ve got a pretty good material block in there with high, high nets and we\u2019re very excited about it.","Jeffrey Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And another question I have was with regard to the rocker B on 106 Cline well. I notice that was completed in Reagan County and I was wondering first of all just one of your first Reagan Cline wells and going forward is the program going to increase in Reagan or is it going to still predominantly be Glasscock?","Steve Farris ","That is one of our first wells in Reagan, I think as we get over there. You got multiple branches in the Wolfcamp and we\u2019re also excited about the Cline basin to do. So we continue to test our acreage and as we set up our 2014, \u201915, \u201916 and beyond programs, we got to get in and understand all the various expansions and that\u2019s exactly what that is.","Jeffrey Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research","Okay. Great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Richard Tullis with Capital One.","Richard Tullis - Capital One","Good afternoon, everyone. Steve, just a quick question on the Gulf of Mexico shallow water subsalt play, what has been the recent activity there and how does it fit into your plans for 2014 based on what you see so far?","Steve Farris ","Let me give you an overview and then I\u2019d like number that we have achieved to run that some detail. The exploration potential varies significant and what we -- what is the reason we retain that 50% is that we don\u2019t to dreg the base on the shallow Shelf. But we have a real opportunity to grow that in the future. And with that, Tom, you might mention some of the things we are doing.","Tom Voytovich","There are a couple of rigs active. They are all outside operated at this point time on the shelf itself. The most notable one probably is the appraisal well to our (inaudible) which is main pass 295. That appraisal well is making whole as we speak and in the next 45 days or so we are to see some results from that, it\u2019s a down-dip appraisal test to establish reserve magnitudes and hopefully provide us with our first drainage point in that field.","There are other wells underway. I believe there are two other ones that are drilling or completing. There are fairly low-risk tests being drilled as well. We don\u2019t have any results on that at this point. We see that they are fairly slow in 2014, as we convert over from the old Gulf of Mexico shelf to the new program. And I think it will take a while to build inventory and prioritize those so that we can look forward to the feature. I think it\u2019s an outstanding opportunity for growth.","Richard Tullis - Capital One","All right. Thank you. Appreciate it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of the Michael Rowe with Tudor Pickering, Holt & Company.","Michael Rowe - Tudor Pickering, Holt & Company","Yes, good afternoon. I just want to follow-up on the discussion of severance costs, trends in the Permian and kind of wondering if you could talk about sort of recent well cost you\u2019re seeing down in the region and particularly for the Barnhart assets where you all have been drilling some longer laterals.","John Christmann","Yeah, I think, in general things are holding pretty good. I mean, we\u2019re getting more efficient there. But in some areas, we\u2019re also experimenting on the completion side and putting more sand in and less fluid and those various things. So we\u2019ll get into those in detail but I feel good about the cost. And obviously if we want to increase our completion size, obviously we expect to get bigger recoveries for that relative.","So it\u2019s all about either taking cost down or increased our EURs, and that\u2019s something that Steve highlighted in the opening comments about our operation excellence we will continue to do. But I think in general, they are at a point right now where they are holding pretty firm its topline and it\u2019s all about what kind of efficiencies we can drive in right now.","Michael Rowe - Tudor Pickering, Holt & Company","Okay. Great. Thanks. And then just a quick follow-up on that would be. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about, maybe this is an Analyst Day question but maybe some of the Wolfcamp potential that you see in Glasscock Counties specifically and where you all primarily have been drilling the Cline information?","John Christmann","Yes, that is something we\u2019ll get into in Analyst Day. I mean, it\u2019s right there in Deadwood where we\u2019ve been. It is more heavily in the Cline and you\u2019ve got the Wolfcamp coming off and it does not lend itself quite as much for horizontals right in the area we are. Get South of us there, the geology changes, you see a lot more activity. But we\u2019ll get into more detail about that at Analyst Day. And then, I would also expect to see us drill a couple of horizontal Wolfcamp wells done there as well.","Michael Rowe - Tudor Pickering, Holt & Company","Okay. Great. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Charles Meade with Johnson Rice.","Charles Meade - Johnson Rice","Good afternoon, everyone. If I could go back and ask another question about the Permian. One of the things that distinguishes you guys -- Apache, from a lot of the other independent E&Ps out there, particularly in the Permian Basin is your big position on the Central Basin platform. And I noticed in your operation supplement you have, you made a point of saying that three bar field had one of that, I guess, it was a second highest production increase in the quarter.","But you really only detail one well there which was at the, I guess the Three Bar Shallow and the Wichita Albany. I\u2019m worried if you can give us an idea, there\u2019s been a lot of questions on the Wolfcamp and the Midland Basin, a lot of these Delaware Basin, unconventional plays? Can you give us an idea where your Central basin platform projects or target fit in terms of relative attractiveness with these other more industry-led horizontal drilling programs?","John Christmann","Yeah, it\u2019s a great question. It's something that tends to get overlooked is the potential for horizontal in the Central basin platform. I\u2019ll tell you that Wichita Albany play at Three Bar will stack up against anything in the industry. We\u2019ve got 16 wells on there. We did give highlight, that is in the year we\u2019ve got and there has also been fantastic there.","We are looking at taking that play outside of that, just on Three Bar unit there but additionally as you start to look up and down the section, there are all sorts of zone that we\u2019ve not completed vertically or not drilled vertically that make great horizontal targets. And we always typically have run one to two rigs on the Central basin platform. I think we\u2019ve got three of -- they are right now and they are chasing these exact types of things. And there is lots of oil to be found in Central basin platform.","Charles Meade - Johnson Rice","So just to be clear, I think you said it John but I want to make you understand, you said what you\u2019re seeing there is as good as any of these horizontal conventional plays you\u2019re seeing elsewhere in the Permian basin?","John Christmann","Our Three Bar development, absolutely.","Charles Meade - Johnson Rice","Okay, thanks for that detail.","Operator","And at this time, there are no further questions in the queue. Mr. Brady, do you have any closing remarks?","Brady Parish","Excuse me. No, I don\u2019t have any closing remarks. I just wanted to say thank you all for participating in the call and putting up with my cold. And if you have any additional question, please reach out to Investor Relations.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Second Quarter 2018 Earnings Call. Please limit your questions to one question and a follow up. Thank you.","I would now turn the call over to Mr. Gary Clark, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin, sir.","Gary T. Clark - Apache Corp.","Good morning, and thank you for joining us on Apache Corporation's second quarter 2018 financial and operational results conference call. Speakers making prepared remarks on today's call will be Apache's CEO and President, John Christmann, Executive Vice President of Operations Support, Tim Sullivan, and Executive Vice President and CFO, Steve Riney.","Our prepared remarks will be approximately 25 minutes in length with the remainder of the hour allotted for Q&A. In conjunction with yesterday's press release, I hope you have had the opportunity to review our second quarter financial and operational supplement which can be found on our Investor Relations website at investor.apachecorp.com.","On today's conference call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the differences between these non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly-comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the supplemental information provided on our website. Consistent with previous reporting practices, adjusted production numbers cited in today's call are adjusted to exclude non-controlling interest in Egypt and Egypt tax barrels.","Finally, I'd like to remind everyone that today's discussions will contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions based on our current views and reasonable expectations. However, a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from what we discuss today. A full disclaimer is located with the supplemental data on our website.","And with that, I will turn the call over to John.","John J. Christmann IV - Apache Corp.","Good morning, and thank you for joining us. On today's call, I will begin with commentary on Apache's second quarter production results and our outlook for the second half of 2018. Then I will provide an overview of the progress we are making in our key regions. Tim Sullivan and Steve Riney will then provide some additional operational details and summarize our second quarter financial performance and guidance before turning it back to me for closing remarks and a comment on the status of our midstream transaction.","2018 has been a year of continued progress on important strategic initiatives and operational performance. On the operational side, we have made several significant advances including drilling efficiencies, strong operational runtime, base decline mitigation, new well outperformance and a step change reduction in Permian Basin completion costs and cycle times. All of these have contributed to our positive production trends year to date.","This is most evident in our strong second quarter U.S. results, where solid execution and an increasing pace of activity enabled us to exceed guidance by 7,000 BOEs per day. The Permian Basin was the primary growth driver in the quarter with oil production in the Midland and Delaware basins up almost 6,000 barrels per day from the first quarter.","As highlighted in last night's press release, based on this performance, we are raising our full year 2018 U.S. production guidance to 260,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day and we are raising full year 2018 Permian Basin guidance to approximately 210,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Both of these are above the high end of our prior guidance, which was increased in May.","In our international operations, second quarter production was roughly in line with expectations. We are updating full year 2018 guidance to approximately 134,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day from a previous range of 130,000 to 140,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Despite a relative limited capital expenditure program, we have made tremendous progress this year in preparation for long-term growth in Egypt and sustainability in the North Sea.","As we look further ahead, our progress this year brings us significant upside bias to our 2019 and 2020 production guidance, both in the U.S. and internationally. We will provide more detailed updates on this in the coming months.","During the first half of 2018, we invested $1.45 billion in our upstream operations and approximately $230 million at Alpine High midstream. We anticipate maintaining an investment pace in the second half of the year that will bring our full year 2018 capital outlook to approximately $3.4 billion versus our prior guidance of $3 billion. The majority of this incremental capital is being directed to the Permian Basin where we are increasing investment to align and optimize our drilling and completion programs. Production growth will be an outcome of this investment. However, the primary objective is to deploy capital in the most efficient manner and improve rates of return. I will discuss these points a bit more in my regional commentary. A combination of higher production volumes and higher than budgeted oil prices this year provides more than enough cash flow to fund the incremental capital.","Moving now to region performance, beginning with the Permian Basin. In the Midland Basin we remain focused on pad development in the Wolfcamp and Spraberry formations. Results are exceeding expectations as strategic testing continues to enable efficient and optimize full field development. Apache continues to make great strides on capital efficiency. We have implemented a significant change in our Midland Basin completion program which is delivering a step function reduction in both costs and cycle times. This saves about $400,000 on the average completion and has reduced cycle times to the point where we need to rebalance our drilling rig to frac crew ratio. We addressed this in the immediate term with a temporary holiday in June and July for one frac crew. As that crew returns in the third quarter, we will also bring two additional drilling rigs into the Midland Basin to rebalance our drilling and completions pace. This will primarily benefit production volumes in 2019.","Addition of these rigs is the most operationally efficient, cost-effective and return-maximizing approach to development. It represents a significant portion of our incremental capital investment this year. In the Delaware Basin outside of Alpine High, we are developing the Wolfcamp\/Bone Spring formations in our Dixieland area and delineating acreage in a slope play further to the north. The strong well performance we are seeing from this program is also driving the need for incremental capital to expand production facilities.","Turning now to Alpine High where progress towards a value optimized full field development program is continuing as planned. As we described in the February earnings call, our 2018 Alpine High drilling program consists of pad and pattern development tests, ongoing geographic delineation and some required acreage retention drilling. We have chosen to effect a more material transition from one and two well tests to larger pad drilling this year. This has created longer lead times to first production and a completion schedule that is weighted more heavily to the back half of the year, but it is clearly the most efficient way to deploy capital into the drilling program. It is also accelerating our learnings, which we are incorporating into full field development.","We've spoken in previous quarters about evaluating our progress at Alpine High through a framework of well cost reductions, well productivity and inventory expansion. And I would like to update you on those now. Beginning with well costs. We continue to drive well costs down despite ongoing upward pressure on service costs. We previously stated our goal of reducing average drilling and completion costs by approximately 25% in 2018. Year-to-date, our average cost per treated lateral foot is down by approximately 25%, so we are on track to beat our goal.","In terms of well productivity, the next phase of optimization at Alpine High is underway and involves testing spatial positioning within and between target intervals. We are also making tactical refinements to landing zone targeting drilling longer laterals where practical and increasing the use of larger stimulations based on positive results we have seen from tests conducted last year. Results from these optimization efforts have been very good, and you can see that in the productivity of some of our recent wells. We will have more to say about this in the future.","Lastly, in terms of drilling inventory, our location count today stands at more than 5,000 wells. Landing zone and spacing tests thus far have confirmed that this inventory count is conservative based on original assumptions. We will update this inventory periodically as strategic testing and optimization progresses.","We are moving up the learning curve quickly at Alpine High and the transition to more pad drilling is accelerating this process. In 2018, we plan to place approximately 90 wells on production. As I previously indicated, our completion schedule is back-end loaded this year and will result in a steep production ramp in 3Q and 4Q. This ramp is now well underway.","At the end of July, net production at Alpine High was approximately 54,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, representing a nearly 70% increase from the second quarter average. For 2018, our Alpine High production is on track to achieve 45,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, which is the midpoint of our previous guidance range. The benefits of pad drilling coupled with continual progress on well costs and well productivity are driving a positive bias to our production outlook for next year. As a result, we anticipate that 2019 production from Alpine High will trend towards the high end of the 85,000 to 100,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day guidance range that was established back in February.","Turning now to our international operations, beginning with Egypt. Apache continues to generate strong drilling results and maintain relatively flat gross production rates in Egypt. We recently added a third new concession consisting of 650,000 acres in the East Bahariya area, bringing our total Egypt footprint to more than 6 million acres. Activity has already begun on our new concession as we are currently drilling our first two wells and have planned drilling activity on all three concessions before year-end. Apache is the largest oil producer in Egypt and our objective is to grow production and free cash flow there for many years to come.","In the North Sea, we had a good quarter despite fairly limited activity. We are currently running two platform rigs, one at Beryl, along with one floater, the Ocean Patriot, which recently reset to a substantially lower day rate. Given the timing of our capital spending and well completion cadence, we placed only one new well on production during the second quarter, which led to flat production in the North Sea. With the implementation of an integrated water flood management program, we are seeing improvements in our underlying base decline rate in the Forties field. It is still early, but there is tremendous potential for improved recovery from this massive oilfield. Every 1% improvement in EUR represents 50 million barrels.","Looking ahead, our next development well at Callater is scheduled to be on production early in the fourth quarter and our initial well at Garten is expected early in the first quarter. These two high volume wells will bring a significant increase in oil production and provide tremendous momentum as we enter 2019.","Before turning it over to Tim, I would like to conclude with a few brief comments on our exploration activities. In Suriname, we have ordered long lead items in preparation for initiating a drilling program at Block 58, which is on trend with recent industry discoveries offshore Guyana. We also have a portfolio of exploration projects in various stages of evaluation where we are seeking large scale highly economic opportunities in the Lower 48 consistent with our organic growth strategy.","With that, I will turn the call over to Tim Sullivan, who will provide some operational details on the quarter.","Timothy J. Sullivan - Apache Corp.","Good morning. My remarks will briefly cover second quarter 2018 production and operations performance including drilling highlights and activity in our core regions.","Operationally, we had a very good quarter and saw improvement in many key areas. We achieved second quarter company-wide adjusted production of approximately 390,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, a 16% increase from the same period a year ago and up 6% from the first quarter 2018. The Permian Basin remains the primary driver of our growth, where oil production increased 25% and total production grew 39% from the second quarter a year ago. These increases reflect the ongoing development of oil production in the Midland and Delaware Basins and the continued ramp up at Alpine High. We averaged 17 rigs and 4 frac crews in the Permian Basin during the quarter.","In the Midland Basin we placed 22 wells online in the second quarter, all of which were on multi-well pads. Results are exceeding our expectations and the information we are gathering is critical to optimizing full field development plans. During the quarter, we drilled a number of notable pads, and I would refer you to our financial and operational supplement for more details on these results.","Moving to the Delaware Basin and our Wolfcamp development in the Dixieland area, we placed on production 11 high-rate oil wells that are also in our supplement. We are seeing impressive results with only one mile laterals. We have two proven targets in the Upper Wolfcamp and plan to test two additional targets later this year. At Alpine High, our well connections are heavily weighted to the last seven months of the year. We have included a chart in our quarterly supplement that illustrates this cadence by month, which as John noted, will lead to a sharp production increase in the back half of the year.","Also in our quarterly supplement, we have provided a slide that shows some impressive recent well results from key tests at Alpine High. Recent completions include a 12 well pad at Blackfoot, which is testing 660 foot spacing in three landing zones, all within the Woodford. The pad is currently flow testing 93,000,000 cubic feet of gas and 200 barrels of oil per day gross and is still improving as it continues to clean up.","A three-well Woodford pad at Fox State testing longer laterals near the central crest with early flow back test rates of 19 million cubic feet and 321 barrel of oil per day gross and the Mohican #201, a Barnett wet gas test in the northern flank which recently flowed at 9.4 million cubic feet of gas and 420 barrels of oil per day.","On the last call we noted the impressive production profile at our six-well Dogwood pad. This was our first multi-well development pad designed to assess down spacing potential at Alpine High. The Dogwood wells went online around the beginning of the year and continue to deliver at a stabilized gross rate of nearly 50 million cubic feet per day. This pad has been producing for more than 180 days with cumulative production of 11 Bcf, and we see no signs of interference. We believe that this performance on 660 foot spacing in the dry gas window has positive implications for future additional inventory in the source interval where we have assumed 800 to 1,000 foot spacing in our current location count.","We continue to make progress on our cost reduction goals at Alpine High. In the northern flank and central crest, we are moving from single well appraisal drilling to pad development with a focus on cost reduction, lateral length and completion optimization to maximize net present value. For this year, we are targeting well costs below $1,380 per lateral foot, which is an approximate 25% reduction from 2017 costs. Our recent second quarter drilled and completed wells at Alpine High were ahead of target, averaging less than $1,260 per treated lateral foot.","On the operating cost side, we are making great progress building out our water handling infrastructure. To supply our frac water needs, we have installed an extensive network of facilities throughout the northern half of Alpine High which significantly reduces our need for incremental new water sources and dramatically reduces our dependence on expensive trucking services. This includes 43 miles of water gathering and distribution facilities with five water recycling centers that are currently handling 90% of the produced water from Alpine High. During the second half of 2018, we plan to conduct tests in the southern flank of Alpine High to further delineate the play.","Internationally, in Egypt we drilled and completed 35 gross wells with an 83% success rate. Noteworthy results are included in our supplement. These are high-rate oil wells with Brent index pricing. Our seismic acquisition in the western desert continues with the first surveys completed over the West Kalabsha and Shushan basins. To date, we've acquired close to 1 million acres of a planned 2.6 million acre seismic shoot. Early processing indicates a considerable uplift in imaging capability and reservoir characterization.","Moving to the North Sea, production averaged approximately 54,000 BOE per day during the quarter and was temporarily constrained by maintenance on compressors in the Beryl area. Quarter-to-quarter production was flat as we brought online only one well.","During the third quarter, North Sea operations will be impacted by annual turnaround maintenance which will reduce our production approximately 3,000 BOEs per day. This is planned activity which occurs every year at this time. Production is expected to bounce back and accelerate in the fourth quarter with the benefit of new wells scheduled to come online. We anticipate achieving our highest average production rate for the year in the North Sea during the fourth quarter.","We just TD'd our fourth development well in the Callater field at Beryl's. This well logged over 580 feet of Cormorant pay with virgin pressure. We anticipate an online date in early Q4. This well should have a positive impact both on production and reserves. Apache owns 55% working interest.","To sum up operationally, we remain on track for a good year and are focused on building on the success in quarters ahead. I will now turn the call over to Steve.","Stephen J. Riney - Apache Corp.","Thank you, Tim. As noted in the press release issued last night, under generally accepted accounting principles, Apache reported second quarter of 2018 net income of $195 million or $0.51 per diluted common share. Adjusted earnings for the quarter were $192 million, or $0.50 per share.","Second quarter financial performance was good across the board. Production volumes were strong as John outlined previously. Average realized oil price was over $69 per barrel as nearly 70% of our global oil production received Brent or Gulf Coast linked pricing. Costs remained under control as LOE, G&A, DD&A and cash taxes were all consistent with or better than latest guidance. Capital investments in the quarter were $833 million, bringing the first half total to $1.69 billion.","As John noted, we plan to invest at a similar pace in the second half of the year, which will bring our total planned capital in 2018 to approximately $3.4 billion. This represents about $400 million of increased investment relative to prior guidance, which can be characterized as follows.","The majority of the increase, roughly two thirds, is attributable to incremental drilling, completions and facilities investment in the Permian Basin including Alpine High. This reflects the two Midland Basin rigs we are adding in third quarter, the costs for longer laterals and larger stimulations in Alpine High and a slightly higher well count throughout the Permian due to the efficiencies in our drilling program.","Approximately $145 million of the incremental investment will be at Alpine High and $120 million will be elsewhere in the Permian. For all of the reasons John outlined previously, these increases will maximize capital deployment efficiencies and will help drive incremental production in late 2018 but more materially into 2019 and beyond.","Approximately $75 million of the additional capital is attributable to general service cost inflation in excess of what we budgeted for the year. The remainder is associated with a number of smaller items. This includes incremental investment at Garten due to a 100% retained working interest and upsizing the topside facility to handle larger production volumes. It also comprises long lead items for our anticipated Suriname exploration program and various other investments mostly associated with our unconventional exploration portfolio.","With the combination of higher production volumes and improved oil prices, cash flows have been very strong. Our cash return on invested capital for the first half of 2018 was 20% on an annualized basis and we ended the second quarter with nearly $1 billion of cash on hand. We anticipate the recent price environment and our outperformance on production volumes will continue. Both will contribute to a strong cash flow performance for the year with full year free cash flow being better than originally planned even with the increase in capital investment. We will also likely see some small non-strategic asset divestments in the second half of 2018, which will further strengthen year-end liquidity.","To summarize and expand on our production guidance, estimates for our third quarter volumes are as follows: total Apache adjusted production of 398,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, up 8,000 from second quarter; international adjusted production of 128,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, down 6,000 from second quarter, primarily due to routine maintenance activity in the North Sea; U.S. production of 270,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, up 15,000 from second quarter; Permian Basin production of 220,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, up 18,000 from second quarter; and Alpine High production of 50,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, up 18,000 or more than 50% growth from second quarter.","We have also updated all of our full year production guidance. John referenced much of this in his remarks, so I will not repeat them. One thing I would note, clearly our U.S. production guidance reflects strong trends in performance. It could easily go unnoticed, but our international production has also done very well. Our updated guidance for international production is at the midpoint of our original guidance for the year. This includes a negative impact that the strong Brent pricing has had on our Egypt volumes. Without that price impact, our international volumes would have been near the top end of our original guidance range. Please refer to our quarterly supplement for information on all guidance updates.","I will conclude with some views on how we are dealing with Permian takeaway and realization issues. We are clearly in a period of tightening takeaway capacity and therefore widening differentials. Ultimately, more takeaway capacity is the only solution. The entire industry is working on that situation and Apache is certainly playing our part. We recently announced material participation in projects involving oil, gas and NGLs. Good progress is being made and relief will start showing up next year.","For the time being, we focus on the current situation day by day in a very pragmatic way. We take steps to make sure our product flows to market and gets the best possible realized price. We have included in our quarterly supplement a summary of our Permian oil and gas marketing positions for 2018 and now for 2019 as well.","Let me touch on just a few things quickly. On the oil side, we had some success in second quarter by moving 12% of our Permian oil volumes from evergreen contracts subject to cancellation to term contracts. We now have 50% of our Permian oil for both 2018 and 2019 on term sales contracts that are backed by firm transport arrangements. As we outlined previously, approximately 30% of our production is West Texas sour. We continue to see very little flow risk with these volumes as they are sold to regional refineries specifically equipped to run sour crude. We manage the remaining 20% of oil production very closely and do not currently believe it will result in any production shut-ins.","With respect to differentials, we added some Midland oil basis hedges in second quarter. We are currently exposed to Midland oil basis movements for just under 60% of our 2018 Permian oil volumes. In 2019, absent any further hedging, that will increase by about 10%.","With respect to Permian gas, our risks related to takeaway and basis differentials did not materially change in the second quarter. Nearly 90% of 2018 volumes and over 80% of 2019 volumes are on term contracts or have access to firm transport to other markets. 65% of our 2018 Permian gas volumes are subject to movements in Waha or our El Paso Permian differentials. In 2019 this falls to just under 60% as new transport capacity becomes accessible.","In summary, we see the current situation as transitory and are participating in some of the key solutions. We have heard the discussions and in some cases seen decisions to reduce Permian rig count. We see this as a logical choice for those at risk of materially curtailed production. We do not anticipate that situation for Apache. To the contrary, we believe the long-term value created by advancing progress at Alpine High and other Apache assets in the Permian Basin more than offsets the potential impact of short-lived weaker basis differentials. Consequently, absent a significant change in the basis differential outlook, we will not materially revise our planned capital investment and we will most likely stay the course.","Now I'll turn the call back over to John.","John J. Christmann IV - Apache Corp.","Thank you, Steve. I would like to sum up by emphasizing that 2018 has been an exceptional year thus far in terms of strategic progress and operational execution. The capital efficiency of our drilling and completion programs is improving throughout the Permian Basin. We are running at an optimized activity level and pace demonstrating good cost discipline and generating high rates of return.","At Alpine High, now we have our primary infrastructure in place and are in the early stages of a significant long-term value accretive production ramp. We are seeing some excellent well results and our cryogenic processing is on track for a mid 2019 start-up, which will drive a significant increase in liquids production, cash margins and returns.","In the Midland and Delaware Basins, our wells are outperforming and unconventional oil production is the primary driver of our U.S. production guidance increase this year. Notably, in less than one year, we have completely replaced the 50,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day of the vested Canadian production with Permian volumes. This strategic portfolio rotation is positively impacting our margins and is a great example of Apache's returns-focused portfolio approach. We continue to generate substantial free cash flow in Egypt and the North Sea as these regions benefit from premium Brent crude prices as well as higher realized NGL and natural gas prices than the U.S.","And lastly, I know that many of you are curious about the status of our midstream business. We have been engaged in a very thoughtful and deliberate process with regard to creating and realizing value for our Alpine High midstream assets. As you have seen in our recent announcements, we have secured equity options in five transportation projects that will move oil, gas and NGL to the Gulf Coast from the Permian Basin. These options are very strategic for Alpine High, Apache and the Delaware Basin in general. We have worked the timing of these options to coincide with consummation of a larger midstream transaction to leverage their fully integrated value potential. We are in the advanced stages of a transaction that we anticipate will close before year-end and we'll come back to you with more details on this as soon as practical.","And with that, we will turn the call over to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question is from the line of Bob Brackett with Bernstein Research.","Robert Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hi. Question on the Alpine High. In the past, in recent past, you've guided toward the typical Alpine High well at say, 9 to 15 Bcfe, that upper range, 16 to 21 Bcfe. But those were at 4,400 foot laterals. So my question is two part, one, how should we think about these more recent 8,000 foot laterals in terms of EURs? And two, can you guide us directionally toward the typical well versus the upper range well? Where are the arrow bars on what those EURs could ultimately be?","John J. Christmann IV - Apache Corp.","Bob, good morning. It's a great question. I will tell you that we are early in changing the completions, as we've alluded to. That's one of the reasons on the capital side. We now have enough data going back to last year that confirms some of the strategic testing on the larger fracs is making a bigger impact as well. And so we're kind of shifting gears and we're early in those and for now I want to leave those because our location counts all kind of tie back to that. But we will be coming back with, as we get some more of these wells on and we do some more testing, you're going to see numbers go up as the productivity improves. So we'll come back to you with those and update, in general, the whole impact of that.","Robert Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","But should I think of things in terms of EUR per foot or should I just wait?","John J. Christmann IV - Apache Corp.","EUR per foot, I can tell you, we're seeing is translating pretty equivalently. So the longer laterals are going up on the lateral side, but I think with the opportunity to see even more changes is going to be on the completion designs which we're about to start doing on some of these pads. So for now, lateral foots, you can probably translate to what we've shown. But we'll come back to you when we've got more data to prove it.","Robert Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you. Quick follow up. What are you doing exactly to save $400,000 on the completion side? Is it efficiencies or technology or some combination?","Timothy J. Sullivan - Apache Corp.","Bob, a lot of it is just operational efficiencies. On the completions side, we've really been able to reduce our pump time substantially. We're drilling out our plugs even quicker and we've even made progress just on frac crew moves. And this is related to, it's given us a 20% reduction in our cycle time, which is on a mile and half lateral is about $400,000 savings. So it's primarily just completion efficiencies.","John J. Christmann IV - Apache Corp.","And, Bob, I'll add to what Tim just said. If you go back, I mean we realized in early May we were running into it was going to create some challenges. And the good news is, we set a frac crew down in the Midland basis for two months, both June and July, and still been able to come in ahead of guidance on the numbers. So I really have got to give a lot of credit to the operational folks and the teams for the progress that we're making.","And we said this would happen. I mean this goes back to the strategic testing we did last fall when we started doing pads on half section tests in the Midland Basin, you're seeing those results and now you're seeing us also doing similar things at Alpine High. So really, really credit to the field folks and the engineers and technical support.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of John Freeman with Raymond James.","John A. Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hi, guys.","John J. Christmann IV - Apache Corp.","Good morning, John.","John A. Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","So the first question related to Alpine High midstream, and I'm just wondering if you can kind of talk about how you sort of think about the trade-off with any potential deal where you're trying to remove future CapEx while also trying to retain as much equity as possible given the knowledge that, as Alpine High volumes ramp pretty dramatically in the next few years, the value of the Alpine High midstream goes up considerably as well.","John J. Christmann IV - Apache Corp.","Well, I mean in a lot of ways you just kind of answered your question. But I'll say a few words here, a little more than in the prepared remarks. We're deep in the process and we are very confident that we will get something done by year-end. Clearly the number one objective has been to remove capital from where it's competing directly with our upstream capital, which and moving it into a separate funding vehicle, which we will do.","The second thing, as you pointed out, we want to maintain as much of this enterprise as possible purely because number one, I think everybody's going to figure out that it's much more valuable to Alpine High, to Apache, and even the whole Delaware Basin than people realize. And secondly, we see that value as growing and accreting significantly over the next several years. So we'd like to hang on to as much of it is possible from that standpoint.","On the timing, we've had to kind of coincide this with some of the equity options that we've been announcing and as we alluded to in the comments, there's now five of them, so we've kind of had to run those in parallel paths. But we're now deep into the throes and clearly we want to be able to hang on to as much of it as possible.","John A. Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Thanks, John, and then my follow-up, just on looking at the revised CapEx budget, the changes on the U.S. side makes perfect sense. When I'm looking at the international CapEx number, which actually didn't change despite the increased kind of fast tracking on Garten, and then what's happening with Suriname, is there some other areas internationally that either are getting less capital than previous or you're just doing better on some costs? Or just, what allowed international to stay flat despite what's happening with Garten and Suriname?","John J. Christmann IV - Apache Corp.","I think that's just kind of in the round off. I mean the big thing is capital is actually going up in the North Sea with Garten as we now have 100% of it. But the other thing is, some of it's timing of the Ocean Patriot and we've reset that rig contract now to a significantly lower number than we've been burdened with the last three years. So it's kind of getting caught in the round off there, but it actually has gone up as we accelerate Garten on the capital side.","John A. Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Great. Thanks, John. Nice quarter.","John J. Christmann IV - Apache Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from line of Charles Meade with Johnson Rice.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Good morning, John, to you and your team there.","John J. Christmann IV - Apache Corp.","Good morning, Charles.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","I wanted ask a question about the Blackfoot pad and what you guys are seeing on the early flow-back there. I know you talked a little bit about in your prepared marks and you put some stuff in your slide presentation. But I wonder if you could share any more color on where you are on the flow back of that pad, if you're almost done cleaning up or you're still in the early stages of cleaning up on some of those wells. And what, if anything, you're seeing between, what kind of variation you may be seeing between the upper Woodford landing zones and the lower Woodford landing zones?","John J. Christmann IV - Apache Corp.","Well, Charles, I'll say it's dynamic. I mean, first thing is as you know, this is 12 wells in the Woodford in a half section. So this would translate into a full section of 24 Woodford wells only, which is a lot. They're on 660 foot spacing. We are not seeing any interference. I will tell you, it's is very, very dynamic and we're very early.","In fact, we went to print yesterday with our numbers and this morning, the Blackfoot now is at 102 million a day from the 93 that we had in there. So that shows you kind of the trajectory that it's on. We still do not have everything unloaded. So it's climbing very well. It's performing very strongly, so we're very, very excited about what we're seeing. And changing quickly, so tomorrow I'd have a different answer for you.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you, John. And then on the other side of the Permian, I wondered if you, Tim went through a lot of detail on how you've changed your, not just your designs but also your operational pace on that side. And I wondered if you could talk about the Lynch pad, which is that 8 well pad in the Wildfire area that you guys brought online. It had some good rates, but is that benefiting from these new designs, the new approach? Or maybe just add a little color to what was happening there.","Timothy J. Sullivan - Apache Corp.","Yeah, on the Lynch pad, it's an 8 well pad that's in the Wolfcamp B. And this was really a spacing test. We did some 10-bys and 8-bys in this pad, 7,300 foot lateral length. And you can see the rates are good, 1,275 barrels of oil equivalent per day and mostly oil from the IP. And we continue to do spacing tests. We've got another 10 wells that are online and some of them are Wildfire as well, very early stages of flow back, but they are on 6-by spacing. So we'll share results with you about that next quarter. But these are spacing test wells in the Wolfcamp B and we're going to compare them to 6-by next quarter.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","And so, I'm sorry, just real quick clarification, Tim. The 10-by spacing, so that's spacing equivalent to 10 wells across a section?","Timothy J. Sullivan - Apache Corp.","That's correct. Part of the pad is 10 wells per section spacing and part of it's 8-by.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Got it. Thank you, Tim.","Timothy J. Sullivan - Apache Corp.","You bet.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Scott Hanold with RBC Capital Markets.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks. Good morning, guys.","John J. Christmann IV - Apache Corp.","Good morning, Scott.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey. Can you talk about how you're looking to go about Alpine High right now? It sounds like you're starting to move into some optimization based on what you've seen. But I know early on you were trying to do things like separate various factors, right, lateral length, frac that you're putting on this to get a good sense of really what's driving performance. Where are we with that? And how does that sort of drive you for these 60, 70 completions you've got at the end of this year and maybe into 2019?","John J. Christmann IV - Apache Corp.","Well, I mean, it's exciting because now we've got data and we've been deliberate on those tests. And as you've correctly noted, we weren't moving many dials, except one usually for a reason, so we have a good baseline. It's clear to us now that we're going to be increasing the frac size. It's clear to us that we can go tighter with the current frac designs. And now, we're moving into the pattern and spacing tests, where we're testing things between zones, between formations, both aerially, spatially and so forth. And so, now you'll see us start to move some of those dials as we crank up the completions.","So we'll continue the very deliberate process. It just takes time to do it right. If you jump out there and go drill too many wells and pump too big of fracs and you get a lot of interference, then you got to go back and try to figure out how you unwind that. And so, what we've been is very deliberate with it and we're moving into that next phase. And we've got a plan. We've stuck to it and you're starting to see the benefit come and we're really excited about the results and the learnings that we continue to incorporate.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","All right. Great. Appreciate that. And a follow-up on the Egypt, with some of this enhanced seismic imagery you've gotten back, it sounds like you got some of it back, how much now maybe you had it in your hands to take a look at it? And what are you seeing now versus maybe what you had thought of it going into it?","John J. Christmann IV - Apache Corp.","Well, I haven't seen the new data. I've seen snippets of the new data. We've actually compared it to some of the 2013 vintage stuff. I'm looking at one of my ops guys over here, but I will tell you, I've heard now we're seeing some fault lines in some of our existing fields, which probably sets up more drilling, so you could see some things at Ptah, Berenice. I'll be over there in the fairly near future. We'll get to review some things, but we're excited about it. It's what we thought it would be. It helps us see image better, the subsurface, which is going to lead to more wells, stronger results and a better understanding. And plus, we're going to have a better handle on some of the recoveries and things. So, it's a whole new lens and it's going to be very helpful.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks for that.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Jeoffrey Lambujon with Tudor, Pickering, Holt.","Jeoffrey Restituto Lambujon - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Good morning, and thanks for taking my questions. My first one is on what I guess a midstream monetization could mean for the budget this year. Are you able to eliminate some of the planned incremental spend with a deal and for parts of the budget that have been spent ahead of an announcement or a closing? Is there an opportunity for rebates or reimbursements for at least the Alpine High piece?","John J. Christmann IV - Apache Corp.","Jeoff, obviously, we could make it look however we want to look. I mean, we could take a lot of cash out. We could eliminate capital and we could make the effective date whenever, whatever we want that date to be. So we've made pretty clear in here that our CapEx guide for the year-end still includes 100% of the midstream spend. We've made it clear that getting something done could pull some of that back and there's opportunity there. So I'll just say wait with us. It's going to have an impact but wait with us until we're in a position to disclose more because we're deep in the process, so.","Jeoffrey Restituto Lambujon - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Got it. And then just digging into the incremental Alpine High piece by itself, should we think of that as all or just maybe primarily longer laterals and completion enhancements? Or is there a portion related to midstream spend that was accelerated into this year from next year's plan initially?","John J. Christmann IV - Apache Corp.","It was a little bit of the midstream that we were looking at trying to accelerate cryo, but as we've said, most of the two thirds of the CapEx increase is going into drilling completions and it's new activity. When we made very clear that two thirds of it's new activity that will be incremental. Most of it is this back half of the year, which is why it'll impact 2019 and 2020. There's a little bit of impact on 2018, but not much.","There has been a little bit of inflation, about I'd say just under 20% is, and we budgeted a 10% to 15% rise, but anything that has to do with trucking, people, steel, or chemicals, there are some headwinds out there. And so there's a portion of it that's tied to that. And then we mentioned some on the exploration side, so. But most of it's new activity and two-thirds of it in Permian and it's new activity.","Jeoffrey Restituto Lambujon - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of John Herrlin with Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale.","John P. Herrlin - Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale","Thanks. You're gathering a lot of water at Alpine High. Are you going to be able to recycle any of it?","John J. Christmann IV - Apache Corp.","John, everything we're gathering, we're recycling. And the beauty of our transgressive source center rolls, it doesn't produce very much. So it's really the frac water that we're gathering. We produce it back, is load, and then we recycle it and reuse it. So I'll let Tim jump in on some more details.","Timothy J. Sullivan - Apache Corp.","Yeah, we've currently got five water recycling facilities out there and we are currently recycling about 90% of our produced water right now. That really is only about half of our frac water needs currently. So we do have to have makeup water and we do use brackish source for that. But by year-end, we feel like we'll be able to utilize about 80% of recycled water for our fracs.","John P. Herrlin - Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale","Okay. Great. Next one for me is on Dixieland. You had slightly stronger well results in the first quarter at Burnside and one other, and I was wondering how much heterogeneity do you have? Like Burnside and Bull Run were a little bit stronger than some of the other wells. So I'm not worried about everything always staying at the same level, but I was wondering how much heterogeneity do you see since you're basically doing similar type completions?","John J. Christmann IV - Apache Corp.","So, John, as you know, that's why we talk about Bone Springs and Wolfcamp as being pair sequences. Geologically, you have heterogeneity. Tim, do you want to add anything specifically to that area?","Timothy J. Sullivan - Apache Corp.","Yeah, I mean, we only have seven sections there. It's not like it's a big area, so it's fairly consistent. We've got two proven landing zones. We will be testing two additional landing zones out there. We brought 20 wells online here in the first half, 11 in the second quarter, and they're about 1,500 BOE per day. And these are just mile laterals, actually 4,400 foot laterals. So it's been a very, very economically attractive program for us. So we think we've still got a pretty bright future for the next couple years.","John P. Herrlin - Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale","Okay. Great. Thank you.","John J. Christmann IV - Apache Corp.","Thanks, John.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you. Good morning.","John J. Christmann IV - Apache Corp.","Good morning, Brian.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","In Alpine High, how do the results of some of the efficiencies, lateral length and spacing tests in areas like Dogwood change the relative rates of return and prioritization of the wet gas versus dry gas drilling? And how, if at all, does that influence your focus areas over the next few quarters?","John J. Christmann IV - Apache Corp.","Well, I mean if you look at the wet gas, dry gas, the breakevens on the wet gas are still going to be much better just because of the amount of the liquids. So it won't really change the pecking order there, but what it really changes is is number of wells we need to drill and some of those things in terms of the plan. So it can change the cadence and the sequence as you look at the capital that's going to the, what we'll call, retention wells versus the impact wells.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. Thank you. And then you've highlighted across the portfolio, but particularly in the Alpine High various efficiencies. And I wonder if you could talk about where you see these efficiencies going from here, whether we've just had a surge or whether you think this pace is going to continue. And how do you draw the line on when you let those efficiencies play through to higher CapEx versus just choose to become more narrowly focused within the portfolio?","John J. Christmann IV - Apache Corp.","Well, I mean I think if you look at our Permian, Brian, we've been running 17 rigs since the second quarter of last year. And so we're at what we think's a pretty darn good baseload. Clearly the frac efficiencies took a step function forward and we've seen that. Now we're seeing the drilling time and the footage take a step function move forward, so this is a continual ebb and flow as you continue to get better reduced cycle times and so forth. But if you step back and look at our program and then you look at the results over the last year, Permian's up 39% year-over-year and oil's up 25% year-over-year and we've been pretty steady on the program.","So what's changing at Alpine High is the completion design and more on the spacing tests, but when you look at the size program we're running, you look at the size cash engine that we're building to fund it, those are the things you have to factor in and you have to continue to integrate your learnings and be continuous improvement. And we stress to our folks to continue to get better in everything we do. And so you're going to have times where we're going to have to make adjustments as we continue to incorporate learnings. But it was a pretty easy call here as we look at what the engine for this thing looks like going into 2019.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Is it fair to say that if there is a free cash buffer to offset efficiency driven or even inflation driven increases in CapEx with no further change in activity, that that would be sufficient for you to further increase your budget?","John J. Christmann IV - Apache Corp.","Well, I mean I don't think you can assume everything on the free cash side goes to budget, right? I mean what we're trying to do with our efficiency programs and what you've seen with the size is ultimately it's returns and value driven. And so that's the big factor. I mean, you look at our activity, it's really hasn't changed and it's not going to change much going into the fall.","We've got to sprinkle a few rigs in to kind of keep it there with the frac crews and so forth. But we're getting to a point in the, we get the midstream deal done in the very near future with the engine that we've built that we actually see free cash flow. And it puts us in a position where we can start to truly, for the first time since coming out of this downturn, we can look now at other things to do. And those are things that we're very excited about because we can see a pathway to it, pretty near future.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Leo Mariani with National Alliance Securities.","Leo P. Mariani - NatAlliance Securities","Hey, guys. I was hoping that you could delve a little bit more into some of the exploration efforts that you guys alluded to on the call. You guys did mention kind of an unconventional U.S. exploration program. Just trying to get a sense of maybe what the dollars are that are exposed to that in next year's budget. And also was hoping for a little bit more detail on Suriname in terms of when you guys might spud a well there. What's your working interest there, as in what do you see as the potential in Suriname?","John J. Christmann IV - Apache Corp.","Well, a couple things, Leo, and thanks for the question. I mean, number one, I'll address them kind of in the order. On the unconventional side in the U.S., there's not a lot of dollars. What we're looking for there is large impact, large scale opportunities that are in various stages that we could acquire at low cost. And much like when we put something like Alpine High together, we put together 350,000 acres out there for less than $1,300 an acre. So it would be those types of things, but there's not a lot of capital at this stage but if you're looking in the right places, it doesn't take a lot of capital to go a long way. So not a position to say a lot more than that, but we do have some things we're working on on the unconventional side.","As it relates to Suriname, clearly what we've said, we've got 2 blocks in the offshore there, Block 58, we own 100%. It's about 1.4 million acres. We have 45% of Block 53. We will definitely commence a program in 2019 and we've started to purchase the long lead items. We got the 3D back and we're very, very excited about the potential. We're on trend with the success that's happened across the water boundary in Guyana and it's exploration that could be very, very impactful for Apache and currently today we own 100% of it.","Leo P. Mariani - NatAlliance Securities","All right, guys, thanks.","John J. Christmann IV - Apache Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","Your final question is from the line of Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks, John, good morning. I got a couple to close us out here, it looks like. My first one is on Egypt. As we understand it, in the last six or nine months, the government's gone through quite a lot of change in deregulating its gas market. It's removed subsidies from local industrial prices. You know everything that's going on there, and it's incentivizing exploration. I'm curious if any of that is filtering through to what you're doing, especially in your new concession, how you see the prognosis for seeing us maybe starting to see an uplift in your exploration activity translating to higher price realizations? And then I've got a quick follow up, please.","John J. Christmann IV - Apache Corp.","Well, I mean I think the key for us, Doug, is number one, all the activity, all the gas coming on has been very beneficial for Egypt, which is a good thing, and that translates into the country's just financial wherewithal. So things are going extremely well. I think the key for us is, is we've been able to pick up new concessions for the first time since 2006. We're shooting a large 3D. We're in between areas where we know there are big structures and really, really fertile ground.","So we're very excited about that. We're excited about the opportunity to continue to grow the free cash flow and we think we can be in a position to also grow our volumes in Egypt, and especially on the oil side. So I think in general, it's a very promising environment for Apache and things are going extremely well and we're very excited about the future.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Just to be clear, has the new exploration acreage come with come with different terms as it relates to realized gas pricing?","John J. Christmann IV - Apache Corp.","All the concessions are, you bid those. The thing I will say is, is we've kind of stuck to our guns historically, which is why you went through a drought where others came in and picked up other concessions. We've stuck to our guns in terms of how we've approached it. So we feel good about that. We feel good about the new concessions, and we like the terms.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Understood. My follow up, if I may, is just jumping back to Alpine High very quickly that it's kind of a follow-up to Bob's question earlier about the 4,500 foot laterals and getting bigger and so on. Clearly it seems that there is upside risk to the guidance you gave us a couple years ago. How would you think about what that, how that translates to your production profile through 2020? Do you have lower decline rates by choking back the wells, for example? Do you have faster acceleration? Just if you could characterize how all of that plays into the infrastructure plan and so on, and I'll leave it there. Thanks.","John J. Christmann IV - Apache Corp.","Well, we have just a tremendous resource. And as we've said on today's call, we would tend to the high side of the previous guidance that we gave earlier this year. And clearly, productivity is improving. Wells are performing extremely well. We're shifting to pads. So I would just steer to the high side numbers as it relates to 2019 is what we've said now and we'll come back with some updated numbers as the year moves along.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great stuff. Thanks, fellows. Appreciate you taking my questions.","John J. Christmann IV - Apache Corp.","Thank you all. I just want to wrap up and like to leave you with three key takeaways from today's call. First Apache had another great quarter. We exceeded guidance and raised our 2018 outlook.","Second, looking ahead to 2019 and 2020, there is a significant upside bias to our production outlook due to the added capital, which will benefit primarily 2019 and 2020, the capital efficiency improvements and strong well performance all in our Permian Basin. Additionally, total capital spending is likely to come down in 2018 to 2020 with the completion of our midstream transaction.","And lastly, at Alpine High, we are seeing very good results from our strategic tests and production growth has entered the acceleration phase. I look forward to sharing our ongoing progress with you in the future.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."],"1793":["Apache Corp.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions)","Thank you. And I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Gary Clark, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","Gary Clark","Thank you, Jennifer. Good afternoon, everybody. And thank you for joining us for Apache\u2019s third quarter 2014 earnings conference call. On today\u2019s call, we will have three speakers making prepared remarks prior to taking questions.","I will start by giving a brief summary of results and then we will hear from Steve Farris, our Chairman, CEO and President; followed by Anthony Lannie, our Executive Vice President and CFO. Also joining us for the question-and-answer session are John Christmann, Executive Vice President and COO of North America; and Tom Voytovich, Executive Vice President and COO of International.","Please note that we have streamlined our supplemental earnings disclosures this quarter. We are replacing our financial supplement and our operation supplement with a single quarterly earnings supplement. Most of the financial disclosures previously found in the financial supplement can now be found in the tables attached to our earnings release, as well as the 10-Q.","Our new streamlined earnings supplement will continue to summarize our operational activities for the quarter and include well heights across various Apache operating regions. The supplement also includes information on E&P capital expenditures and the visual graphic to illustrate cash sources and uses that reconcile changes in net debt quarter-over-quarter.","Our earnings release accompanying the financial tables and non-GAAP reconciliations, and our new quarterly supplement can all be found on our website at apachecorp.com\/financialdata.","Today\u2019s discussion will contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions based on our current views and most reasonable expectations. However, a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from what we discussed today. A full disclaimer is located with the supplemental data on our website.","This morning we reported a third quarter 2014 loss of $1.3 billion or $3.50 per diluted share, adjusted earnings, which excludes certain items that impact the comparability of results totaled $528 million or $1.38 per diluted share. Cash flow from operations before changes in working capital totaled $2.1 billion during the quarter.","Worldwide reported net production averaged 637,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, with liquids production constituting 60% of that total. On a pro forma basis, adjusting for recent assets sales and excluding the non-controlling interest and tax bills from Egypt, our second quarter worldwide production was 562,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. This represents a 2% increase from the second quarter and a 6% increase from the same period a year ago.","I will now call -- turn the call over to Steve.","Steve Farris","Thank you, Gary, and good afternoon, everyone, and thank everybody for joining us. During the third quarter, Apache continued to make progress on our transition to becoming a premier North American resource company, delivering another quarter of strong production growth.","Our North American drilling program delivered on-shore liquids production growth of 5% sequentially and 15% year-over-year, when adjusted for our asset divestitures. We had strong performance in the Permian and it continues to drive North American results.","I want to go back, if you recall during our February 2014 Investor Day, we provided guidance for our Permian production growth from 12% to 15% for the year. Through the nine months ending September 30, our production increased 25%, nearly doubling our February guidance.","This increase growth is a result of mix shift to more horizontal drilling. For example, our horizontal well count is up 50% and our vertical count is down 40% through the first nine months of this year compared to same period last year.","The biggest drivers of growth in the Permian were our Wolfcamp horizontals in the Southern Midland Basin, our Yeso program in the Northwest shelf and our horizontal Bone Springs wells in the Delaware Basin.","A particular note, our Pecos Bend area in Reeves County completed four very strong Bone Springs wells during the quarter. The average 30-day IP of these new wells was over a 1,000 barrels equivalent per day.","In our Eagle Ford play, we\u2019ve ramped up activity throughout the year and we are now running 10 rigs there. Strong results coupled with our relentless focus on lowering well costs are allowing this play to compete very well for capital within Apache\u2019s capital program.","During the quarter, we spud 29 wells, including wells on four separate pads and brought on our first two pads online in the Reveille area Williston County with an average 30-day IP of 609 barrels of oil equivalent a day.","The success of our Eagle Ford program to-date coupled with our expectations for lower well costs and higher rates of return have prompted us to allocate more capital to this play in 2014 than we originally budgeted.","Turning to the central region, we have retooled the organization, we have significantly reduced our rig count, we have made numerous process improvements and reprioritized our focus following our challenging first half 2014.","We are scaling back our traditional Granite Wash and Tonkawa plays in the Anadarko Basin and we are focusing more on our drilling program in the Canyon Lime play in Oldham and Potter County in Texas Panhandle. As of this morning, we had 16 rigs running in the Anadarko Basin and four in the promising Canyon Lime.","In our Duverney and Montney plays in Canada, we ran three rigs total and spud initial wells at the Duverney seventh well pad and drilled the first well at our Montney two well pad.","The Duverney and the Montney offer some of the best reservoir rock in North America and we are looking forward to these plays driving our strong production growth once we have optimized our well costs and our completions. We are continuing to high-grade our North American asset base through the addition of leasehold in key growth areas and the sale of non-core acreage.","During the quarter, we invested $520 million primarily in leasehold in the sweet spots of our key growth areas. This opportunistic investment was the big driver of the capital cost increase you see in our financial table.","We plan to fund our increased investment primarily through the sale of non-core North American assets which we currently have in the market. We\u2019re looking forward to sharing these details in our acreage purchases as well as providing an update on perspective asset sales on November 20th.","Looking ahead, we\u2019re confident that our 2014 North American liquids production growth will come in at the higher end of our 15% to 18% guidance range which led predominantly by better-than-expected production out of our Permian region.","To sum it up, we are encouraged by the progress we're making in North America, both in our ability to drive cost out of the system as well as improve our well performance. And we are looking forward to providing a lot more detail in the next few weeks when we visit New York City.","Turning to our international operations, all three of our regions, North Sea, Egypt and Australia delivered profitable production growth and remain on track to generate significant free cash flow per year. As a result, third quarter worldwide volumes came in slightly above the second quarter at 637,000 barrel equivalent per day, which is right in line with our internal expectations.","In the North Sea, we completed our annual third quarter maintenance turnaround with no material delays. Production losses from scheduled downtime was partially offset by strong drilling results at Forties in our first well from The Forties Alpha Satellite Platform.","In Egypt, we executed on a very active exploration and development program. During the quarter, we drilled eight new well discoveries in a call to concession. One of the most notable of which was Meghar-08 which IPed at nearly 3200 barrels oil equivalent a day. And yesterday, we tested our [Matruh] (ph) number one exploration well on Western Shushan Basin for over 7000 barrels of oil per day. Operations and production in Egypt continued with no material disruptions during the quarter.","And finally in Australia, we made headway on several projects. Our Balnaves\u2019 FPSO came online at the end of August and is currently producing at 18,000 barrels of oil per day net to our interest. We continue to progress our Coniston oil development and remain on track for first oil during the first half of 2015.","In closing, I want to reemphasize the strategic direction we laid out on our second quarter earnings call. We remain committed to exiting our two LNG projects, Wheatstone and Kitimat. And we are continuing to evaluate the separation of our international assets through either strategic transactions or the capital markets.","And with that, I\u2019d like to turn it over to Anthony Lannie.","Anthony Lannie","Thanks Steve. As mentioned earlier, we believe our North American onshore resource base is capable of driving strong growth and returns over the foreseeable future. And we continue to take important steps in that direction and allocate resources accordingly. In tandem with our strategic shift towards our North American onshore assets, we took the following two steps during the quarter.","We determined that the undistributed earnings in our Australia, Egypt and North Sea regions should no longer be considered permanently reinvested in our foreign operations. This change in policy results in a non-cash charge to U.S. deferred income tax expense of $814 million on those regions for undistributed earnings.","In addition, we repatriated $1.9 billion of cash from our Egypt region during the third quarter for which we recognized an associated non-cash U.S. tax expense of $249 million. Bringing this cash back to the U.S. will provide us additional balance sheet flexibility and liquidity as we delineate several promising onshore plays and expand our acreage holdings while at the same time repurchasing Apache\u2019s stock.","Turning to the income statement. As Gary noted at the outset, we reported a quarterly loss of $1.3 billion or $3.50 per share, which was driven by two significant items. The first is the $1.1 billion of income tax related charges that I just mentioned, in which reflect the change in our permanent reinvestment policy and repatriation of foreign earnings to the U.S.","The second item is an approximate $1 billion after-tax non-cash ceiling test write down primarily related to lower oil and NGL price realizations and the impact of unamortized deepwater costs that remained in our full cost pool following the sale of our Lucius and Heidelberg projects at the end of the second quarter.","When excluding these items, along with other more typical non-cash items such as mark-to-market derivatives and foreign currency exchanges, our adjusted earnings were $528 million or $1.38 per share, down from $644 million or $1.67 per share in the second quarter. Operating cash flow remains strong, driven by performance of our North American onshore base.","We generated $2.1 billion of cash flow from operations before working capital items, which was down slightly from $2.2 billion in each of the first two quarters of 2014. Despite strong production numbers, our bottom line results were impacted by lower commodity prices. In North America, our oil price realizations averaged $94.69 per barrel in the third quarter, down 9%, compared to the second quarter.","Gas price realizations averaged $3.88 per Mcf, down 7% from the second quarter, but still 9% higher than the comparable 2013 period. We ended the third quarter with just over $1 billion of restricted and unrestricted cash on our balance sheet, bringing our total -- our net debt to $9.9 billion.","Year-to-date, we have invested $7.5 billion in our drilling programs, of which approximately $626 million is related to opportunistic acreage and leasehold acquisitions onshore North America. Our strong free cash flow from foreign operations and low debt-to-cap ratio of 25% provides Apache the liquidity to support both our North American growth and share repurchase program.","On the expense side, LOE per Boe was up 5% quarter-over-quarter to $11.13. This is in line with the expectations we set on the first quarter call. The increase is driven by general increases in labor and power costs and our divestment of lower-cost dry gas properties.","Turning to income taxes, our third quarter effective tax rate reflects the impact of the aforementioned change in our foreign earnings reinvestment policy, along with the full cost ceiling test write downs as well as other non-recurring items. Absent these items, our adjusted effective tax rate would have been 43.5%, which is in line with previous guidance. Our adjusted earnings and adjusted effective tax rate recalculations can be found in our supplemental financial information attached to this morning's press release.","This concludes our prepared remarks. We are now ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from the line of David Tameron with Wells Fargo.","David Tameron - Wells Fargo","Good morning. I guess it\u2019s good afternoon. Lot of moving pieces, but can you talk about where Canada fits in big picture going forward?","Steve Farris","What I think you\u2019ve seen from 2014 -- I mean, 2013 and 2014, we\u2019ve really high-graded our portfolio up there. We basically have two real major plays up there, which is the Duvernay and the Montney. Right now that is going to be our growth drivers for going forward.","David Tameron - Wells Fargo","Okay. I don\u2019t what you say ahead of the North American update? But if I think about the Permian, production -- can you just talk about how you see production? It look like it\u2019s slowed a little bit in the quarter but I mean, that could just be noise and timing or completion, et cetera. But can you talk about that growth trajectory over the next 12 to 18 months?","John Christmann ","I mean, the first key is we are having a great year. When you look at the well count over the first three quarters of last year, our horizantals were up 50%, as we kind of shifted our program. We are currently running 41 rigs. You\u2019ve seen us dropping the verticals as well. So actually, we are working quite a bit ahead where you had guided to 12 to 15% and we are looking at year-end numbers. We are going to put you twice the lower end. So we feel really strong about that. I think going into next year, we'll get into that on the November 20th, but a lot of that will depend on the commodity price forecast and how much cash we want to invest there. The big deal is, I think we feel good about the projects and we have a lot of flexibility with the rig count. So we are in a good spot going into next year.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate with Bank of America.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America","Thank you. Good afternoon everybody. Steve, the step-up in the East Eagle Ford, obviously that\u2019s a newer play for you. I guess, we are going to hear more about that at the end of the month. But I\u2019m just kind of curios, if you could help right for us in this oil price environment, how that play would stack up against your Wolfcamp assets and in particular, how would you allocate capital or prioritize your allocation of capital towards the central areas and more gassy areas in the portfolio and I have a follow-up, please?","Steve Farris","Yeah. Thank you. Honestly, we are tremendously pleased and excited about the future of the Eagle Ford and I don\u2019t want to steal our guys thunder for November 20th. But we\u2019ve seen our latest wells continue to get better and we are driving quite a bit of cost out of the system. Our view is that\u2019s going to be a major play for us going forward, especially in 2015, 2016 and beyond. And some of that acreage that we talk about and we will show you this more on November 20th. We\u2019ve increased -- basically that acreage is made up of two parts. One is we\u2019ve increased the acreage in our interest and our existing acreage by buying some of our partners out and the other one is aggregating acreage right around what we think the sweet spot is. So, John, you might want to comment?","John Christmann","I mean, I think, directionally, when you look at where we are, we dropped our rig count in the Anadarko. Steve mentioned, we are down to 20 rigs now. So you see that drop in conjunction with the Eagle Ford ramp-up and that will continue going into next year. So that directionally tells you where they are and we\u2019re looking at the portfolio, things that migrate to the top quick, they are going to be the Eagle Ford, the Canyon Lime and the Permian and lots of plays there. So it\u2019s going to compete very, very well.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America","I appreciate. My follow-up is really more about -- I guess you don't talk too much about the restructuring, but the issue around -- the subtlety of the issue around the international cash or free cash flow, which I guess is previously accelerating the drilling program to some extent in the Lower 48. With the separation of the international business and the lower oil price, how does that impact your -- I guess your willingness to spend outside of cash flow to bring forward the volumes to some of these newer plays? So I guess I am really trying to understand is operating cost flow, is that still a limiter for spending in the Lower 48 or the standalone company? Or should be expected to use the balance sheet and I will leave it there? Thank you.","Steve Farris","Yeah. I might make a general comment. I think we -- over the last two months we\u2019ve seen a $20 move in oil prices. I think all of us have to look at that. We certainly are looking at it in terms of making sure we\u2019re prudent and what our capital program is going forward.","I will tell you from an investment opportunity standpoint, we are better off right now and we have been in Lower 48 over the last two or three years. We have tremendous inventory right now, good inventory. I doubt if you see us until we understand where this price is going be really bullish on overspending our cash flow going forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of John Freeman with Raymond James.","John Freeman - Raymond James","Good afternoon. The Canyon Lime is the one area in the central region that you all are increasing activity on and it seems like each quarter the commentary is more bullish. I think now you are kind of ranking as one of your three best North American areas since that Bivens well that you had. And I just want to make sure that I\u2019ve got on the right numbers. When you entered the year that was about 100,000 net acres that was prospective for either the Canyon Wash or the Canyon Lime, is that still a good number to use? I mean, you\u2019ve obviously been busy buying acreage across North America.","Steve Farris","We are going to show a lot more of that on November 20. We have more acreage than -- we have more acreage today than we have in the past.","John Freeman - Raymond James","Okay. I want still (indiscernible). I will wait on that. And then just my follow-up question. On Egypt you mentioned that there was the sequential production decline was due primarily to some technical challenges as well as some partial shutdowns on a shale operated gas plant. Can you just kind of give maybe an update on that status?","Steve Farris","I will let Tom Voytovich who really got the details on that to answer that question.","Tom Voytovich","Well to directly answer the technical challenges, there is a gas plant, the old biogas plant which has been rife with problems with the Benfield system and they have shale operated gas plant. It\u2019s the only outside operated plant that we participate in.","And as a result of that, out takes have gone down materially 30 million to 50 million cubic feet a day and that really accelerated here in the latter part of the third quarter. We think that this is going to continue through the rest of the year, but we will be making up for it in other ways.","Steve Farris","Now the only caveat I would give that is, is in the Egypt 88% of our revenues come from our oil. Gases is percentage wise a bigger chunk of our production on a Boe basis, but 88% of our revenues come from the oil side.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs","Thank you. Good afternoon. Following up on the earlier question on free cash flow. In a lower oil price environment, if you are committed for Apache to stay within cash flow, is there any change to how you're thinking about the strategic nature of some of your free cash generative businesses like the North Sea and Egypt? Is there a case that perhaps you keep that as part of Apache for longer and use that free cash flow? If not, do you see yourself potentially having to cut back on activities in areas that you may rank in your top 3 plays like the Eagle Ford, Canyon Lime or Permian?","Steve Farris","Brian, I think the statement that we made in our second quarter earnings call and I reiterated today, we are committed to exiting the LNG facilities and truthfully we are -- we\u2019ve got lots of people working on those projects to do just that.","In terms of evaluating our international assets for possible transactions or spends, that\u2019s an ongoing process and we continue to look at it everyday. Certainly I think our -- truthfully I think our North American business today and I probably wouldn\u2019t have said this a year ago or year and half ago is very capable of standing on its own. I mean, I think we\u2019ve got the inventory and I think what you\u2019re going to see in November 20 is we now have the capabilities and the leadership in the regions to be able to do that.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Joe Allman with JPMorgan.","Joe Allman - JPMorgan","Thank you, Operator. Hi, everybody. Steve, could you just clarify your strategic direction? So we understand that you plan on exiting the LNG business. But, do you plan to exit the international business? And has there been any even nuisance change just based on data or thinking more deeply about things, about whether to exit the international business?","Steve Farris","No, I don\u2019t think so. I think, our plan, our strategic vision is to separate our North American form our international business. I mean, no -- nobody else, I mean when I say think, it\u2019s just -- we have the same thinking today that we have in the past.","Joe Allman - JPMorgan","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then onshore North America activity, on a net basis are you in the process of ramping up the North America drilling activity and spending, or are you keeping things flat or you actually on the net basis reducing activity and spending over the next several months?","Steve Farris","Well, I think, I guess I will reiterate the answer I gave a little early or the fact of the matter is, we\u2019ve had by anybody\u2019s calculations we\u2019ve got a real sea change in oil prices. I think we\u2019re all going to have a look at how we run businesses at $80 oil in North America and without blowing out your balance sheet. So depending on what happens to oil prices, we\u2019re running a number of different cases, but we\u2019re going to -- our capital program is going to be somewhere around what our cash flow is going into 2015.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Rowe from TPH.","Michael Rowe - TPH","Yes. I have a quick question on the Anadarko. So I guess you\u2019re down to 20 rigs now versus 30 or so that we\u2019re averaging Q3 and you specifically highlighted the Granite Wash and Tonkawa two intervals that you are hitting activity. I was wondering is that purely driven by tribal economics given where commodities prices are. Or was there I guess something else unique going on there operationally that cause those two specific targets to see less drilling?","John Christmann","As we mentioned or Steve mentioned in the script, I mean, we retooled and even on the last call we\u2019ve changed out our entire leadership in our central region. So we\u2019ve addressed the region VP as well as the Op. So the good news is in all of our plays, we still got good wells and good things there. We have shifted the rig count a little bit. We pared back as Steve said in the script and the talk on the Granite Wash. We\u2019ve got a few more running in the Cleveland and the Cottage Grove, where we\u2019re having some good results. And we\u2019re also shifting to the Canyon Lime. But I think when you look at that portfolio and the mix, you\u2019ll see a shift towards the Eagle Ford and the Permian and the Canyon Lime as we look at next year.","Michael Rowe - TPH","Okay, great. And then just lastly on the $520 million spend for leasehold and property acquisitions in Q3. Is this part of a broader effort to I guess increase M&A activity relative to drilling given where commodity prices are now, just curious to see, if you are all thinking about easing capital for M&A has been changed versus prior expectations?","Steve Farris","Gary, do you want on the Rockies then I handle.","Gary Clark","Yeah. I mean, we have really seen an opportunistic -- opportunity this year to add some exceptional acreage in our key growth areas and so we\u2019ve taken advantage of that. I wouldn\u2019t say that it\u2019s necessarily a sea change and how we view acreage acquisition and M&A, but the reality is we need to high-grade the portfolio. And as we\u2019ve matured our key plays and demonstrated a lot of confidence and what we can accomplish there, we have seen a interesting opportunity to beep up in the sweet spots of those key plays. And at the same, we will divest and are divesting some of our areas where that are not going to attract capital and that are not on the growth track and they have lower rates of return. So what you all seen is our spending in the third quarter, what\u2019s pending is the divestitures that will cover a lot of that spending.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Herrlin with Societe Generale.","John Herrlin - Societe Generale","Yeah. Hi. Three quick ones. With respect to the asset packages, can you give us a ballpark on associated volumes with them?","Steve Farris","Well, we\u2019re going to do that November 20th. We have got a -- I will say, we\u2019ve got a package related to that we\u2019re keen on. We\u2019ve got a package in South Louisiana, our South Louisiana stuff its legacy, we\u2019ve had for sometime. And we\u2019ve also got some properties in central region that are gassy and we\u2019re not spending money on. So you\u2019ll see what that looks like in -- on November 20th.","John Herrlin - Societe Generale","Okay. Thanks, Steve. How much does your typical Eagle Ford well run on a complete well cost basis?","John Christmann","John, we\u2019ll get into that on November 20th, but they\u2019re going to come in under $8 million Eagle Ford well cost.","Gary Clark","We told you $8.3 in February and we\u2019re doing better than that now and we\u2019ve got our site set lower but we\u2019ll share more on the 20th.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Charles Meade with Johnson Rice.","Charles Meade - Johnson Rice","Yes. Good afternoon, everybody. Steve, if I could go back to maybe try to tie two questions together. As we look at or as I look at your debt trajectory, you had been on a trajectory down with debt, not every quarter, but generally over the last six quarters. But you have had tick up this quarter.","And I\u2019m wondering if perhaps that might be tied into a view that you are more likely to actually have an outright sale of some assets, whether it would be Wheatstone or maybe some of your conventional, all assets in Australia and that might be a source of funds to get that debt back down or alternatively if you're comfortable with debt in that $10 million to $11 million range going forward?","Steve Farris","Well, I think the absolute debt is not as important as what we consider what our debt structure should be overall. In terms of our debt going up a little bit this year, I mean, this quarter, I think Gary has pointed out and I think, I pointed out earlier. We made some strategic buys of undeveloped acreage and what you\u2019re seeing is you got a timing difference between we\u2019re selling non-core assets, which should come in the fourth quarter. And the acreage acquisitions that we\u2019ve seen in the third quarter, so those two should balance out over the year.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Michael Hall with Heikkinen Energy Advisors.","Michael Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","Thanks. Well, one of my have been addressed. I guess, just one on East Texas, I\u2019m just curious on those wells and maybe, I might have to wait but I figure I\u2019ll ask. What the hydrocarbon splits look like on those wells, on average and then maybe high and low case splits?","John Christmann","I mean, we\u2019ll get into that in detail when we -- we\u2019ll show some data on November 20th but they really -- I mean, we mentioned the first couple pads have come on in the Reveille of average 690 Boes a day and that\u2019s in a lower GOR area. One thing across our acreage that GOR does move, so it just depends on the area but we\u2019ll go through that in detail on November 20th.","Michael Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","Okay. Steve. Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Campbell with Tuohy Brothers Investment Research.","Jeffrey Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research","Good afternoon. A little while go you called out the Montney and the Duvernay, but I found it interesting that you have three rigs devoted to the Bluesky formations in the Kaybob. And could you provide a little color here? Is it vertical or is it horizontal, is it developmental or expiration? Why is Bluesky attracting this rig?","John Christmann","Jeff, they\u2019re just economics, they\u2019re good wells, they are all horizontals and the economics are fantastic on them. So we can get the rigs in there and we\u2019ve got three elements there. They\u2019re cheaper, they are not as expensive and they help the program so. But the economics are very compelling.","Jeffrey Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research","Okay. Kind of staying on this sort of theme. We\u2019ve had earlier discussions of the pan shale as more of a standalone horizontal target. But this quarter you showed us three highlight vertical wells that featured the 10 combination with the Strawn and the Wolfcamp. Were these expirations wells preparing for later horizontal drilling, or does this vertical drilling have legs of its own?","John Christmann","No, that\u2019s another area. I mean, you\u2019ve got to look across the counties and we\u2019ve got some areas where we are drilling horizontally in the Pan and the Strawn and we will show little bit of that on November 20th. In this particular area, we highlighted some wells that are North of Odessa and the [Gustav Bay] (ph) area and some vertical wells that we can stack those and they are also very compelling. We saw fantastic rates from those so. It shows you the variety in the Permian and you\u2019ve got lots of zones, lots of area and different plays but they are very economic.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Richard Tullis of Capital One.","Richard Tullis - Capital One","Hey, thanks. Good afternoon. Steve, I don\u2019t think this area has been touched on. How does the remaining Gulf of Mexico shelf assets fit into your strategy going forward in this lower oil price environment. I know in the past you\u2019ve mentioned that you expect it to perhaps begin drilling some of the deeper shelf targets in 2015?","Steve Farris","Yeah. Right now, we are building inventory. I might point for those listening we have --we kept half of the deep rights when we sold our shelf. And we have about 500 blocks of deep rights under our existing shelf acreage that we sold. And truthfully that\u2019s -- if we have a very good idea there, we\u2019ll fund it otherwise that we will continue to build inventory.","Richard Tullis - Capital One","Okay. And just as a follow up, what sort of price is required to -- oil price to generate expectable rate of return in the shelf for the type of well as you anticipate drilling?","Steve Farris","Actually the shelf rates of return are very, very strong. And especially if you are drilling them, the reason we kept the deep rights is we sold 700 platforms. And so most of the deep rights are in and around the existing infrastructure. So you time back quicker and you can get them on quicker. And you don\u2019t have the infrastructure cost that you do when you are under deepwater going out and doing expiration.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of John Herrlin of Societe Generale.","John Herrlin - Societe Generale","Yeah. Hi last one for me. With the ceiling test, how much of it was the unamortized deepwater cost and was that all a U.S. pull or was there some Canada in there as well?","Anthony Lannie","It was about 50-50. And it was all in the U.S.","John Herrlin - Societe Generale","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Leo Mariani with RBC.","Leo Mariani - RBC","Hey, with respect to your 2015 budget, trying to get a sense of when we would get a look at that? And I guess would we get a sense of spending on November 20th in terms of your North American on throughput?","Steve Farris","Yeah. We are going to roll out what our 2015 and then our forward plan is, what our outlook is over the next several years. And our capital budget for 2015 will be part of that.","Leo Mariani - RBC","All right, that\u2019s helpful. And I guess just in terms of the international sales. I guess, it\u2019s an ongoing process here. Clearly, I guess, we are in position now where oil prices have come in. Just trying to gauge your apatite in terms of spinning things off versus sales here?","Steve Farris","I think they are both viable. I will tell you the one thing we\u2019ve said and I think we\u2019ve constantly done, we are not going to sell something just to get rid of it. And ultimately the separation will partly be, I am sure a span of some of our assets.","Operator","And we have no further question in queue at this time.","Gary Clark","That concludes the call. Thank you all for joining us and we\u2019ll talk to you on November 20th.","Operator","Thank you. This does conclude today\u2019s conference call and you may now disconnect."],"1999":["Apache Corp.

Sir, the floor is yours.","Gary T. Clark - Apache Corp.","Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us on Apache Corporation's second quarter 2017 financial and operational results conference call. Speakers making prepared remarks on today's call will be Apache's CEO and President, John Christmann; Executive Vice President of Operations Support, Tim Sullivan; and Executive Vice President and CFO, Steve Riney.","In conjunction with this morning's press release, I hope you have had the opportunity to review our second quarter financial and operational supplement, which can be found on our Investor Relations website at investor.apachecorp.com. On today's conference call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the differences between these non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the supplemental information provided on our website.","Consistent with previous reporting practices, production numbers cited in today's call are adjusted to exclude noncontrolling interest in Egypt and Egypt tax barrels. Please note that all currency references in our prepared remarks are in U.S. dollars.","Finally, I'd like to remind everyone that today's discussions will contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions based on our current views and reasonable expectations. However, a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from what we discuss today. A full disclaimer is located with the supplemental data on our website.","I will now turn the call over to John.","John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.","Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. On today's call, I will: review our approach to navigating the lower-for-longer oil price environment; discuss the strategic rationale and financial benefits of our pending exit from Canada; provide current operational highlights, including Alpine High; and conclude with our thoughts around balancing funding and spending in 2018.","Since the beginning of 2015, we have restructured our business to adapt and thrive in a lower-for-longer commodity price environment. The organization reacted swiftly to the downturn in oil prices. We stressed the importance of properly aligning cost structure with commodity prices as well as achieving and maintaining cash flow neutrality. We completed a series of transactions that simplified our portfolio. We reduced operating costs, overhead, and capital commitments, and significantly improved the balance sheet.","With regard to our asset base and strategy, we successfully expanded and enhanced our organic unconventional North American acreage footprint and technical capabilities.","We also focused our international capital spending to deliver strong and sustainable free cash flow from our core businesses in Egypt and the North Sea. These efforts were supported by significant improvements in our planning and capital allocation processes, which helped drive our strategy of returns-focused organic growth.","In early 2017, WTI oil prices were trading above $50 per barrel, with the out years of the NYMEX strip trending even higher. We had concerns about the fundamentals underpinning this oil price optimism and the corresponding cash flows from operations. At the same time, we had just announced our discovery at Alpine High, a very attractive large-scale opportunity which would require significant near-term investment. Given our strong financial position, a cost structure that was now properly aligned with commodity prices, and a deep inventory of fully burdened high rate-of-return projects, we believed it was appropriate and value creating to budget a moderate outspend for the near term.","Our general philosophy was that the upstream expenditures and dividends should be funded within cash flow while using a combination of non-core asset sales and the balance sheet to fund a viable midstream build-out at Alpine High. Accordingly, on our fourth quarter earnings call in February, we announced a 2017 capital budget based on a $50 WTI oil price, which at the time was conservative relative to the prevailing strip.","We also announced that we had protected the 2017 capital program with put options at $50 WTI and $51 Brent for the majority of our oil production in the second half of the year. This helped to ensure our ability to fund the Alpine High capital program, which was strategically important to our long-term returns-focused growth strategy through a potentially volatile commodity price environment.","Today, through the combination of expected cash flows from operations and proceeds from recent asset sales, our planned 2017 CapEx and dividends are funded. As a result, our $3.1 billion capital program remains unchanged. We expect to end 2017 with more cash and less debt, and we will have significantly higher production levels in the Permian Basin.","I'd now like to comment on our exit from Canada, which we anticipate will be finalized upon the closing of two transactions later this month. From a strategic perspective, the sale of Canada further streamlines our portfolio and increases our North American leverage to the Permian Basin, which can be seen in our financial and operational supplement.","While the Montney and Duvernay plays in Canada offer long-term growth potential, they are strategically disadvantaged relative to the other opportunities within our portfolio.","Financially, Apache will realize several important benefits from the Canadian divestiture. In addition to the roughly $700 million headline sales price, the present value of asset retirement obligations on our balance sheet will be reduced by approximately $800 million. Gross cash overhead costs plus other corporate program costs will be reduced by approximately $70 million annually. Average cash margins per BOE, earnings per share, and free cash flow will be positively impacted, and return on capital employed at the corporate level will improve.","I will conclude my remarks on Canada by noting that Apache is very grateful to the many employees who built this region over the years. We believe the employees and the assets will be well served under the new owners, who are eager to make significant capital investments in the business.","Turning now to results and highlights from the quarter, oil and gas capital investment was $738 million in the second quarter, two-thirds of which was in the Permian Basin. Of this amount, Alpine High midstream expenditures were $128 million. Total first half 2017 capital investment of $1.4 billion is consistent with our planned full-year CapEx of $3.1 billion.","As a reminder, this year we budgeted for an average well cost increase of 10% to 15% versus 2016 levels. And while we have seen price increases of 30% to 40% for certain service lines, our increased pad drilling operations coupled with other efficiencies and cost initiatives have resulted in average well cost at\/or below budgeted levels. Tim will discuss this more in his remarks.","As anticipated, our total daily production bottomed out in the second quarter, and we have shifted to a growth trajectory. We expect continued production volume increases at Alpine High and in the Midland Basin as well as our international regions during the second half of 2017.","Now, I'd like to discuss some of our specific regional highlights, starting with Alpine High. As noted previously, we achieved first production at Alpine High in early May and exceeded our June 30 target of 50 million cubic feet per day of processed gas. Currently, our net sales gas exceeds 60 million cubic feet per day, and we anticipate this will increase to more than 100 million cubic feet per day by the end of September.","Due to the timing of infrastructure build-out and gas takeaway, the majority of our Alpine High production thus far has come from our northernmost acreage. The drilling in this area has primarily been lease-retention-focused, and these wells are generally deeper and, thus, have a lower liquids content. The liquids ratio should increase as we drill and connect more wells in other areas of the play, and as we commission additional processing facilities.","In the month of June, total Alpine High sales, net to Apache, averaged approximately 7,400 BOEs per day, of which approximately 10% was oil and natural gas liquids. As just mentioned, this liquids ratio should increase in the second half of the year. On the midstream side, we invested $270 million in the first half of 2017.","Managing midstream internally provides Apache with operational flexibility and cost control benefits as we delineate the upstream and move into early-stage development. By retaining 100% ownership, we are investing in an asset that we believe will significantly increase in value as the upstream production and reserve potential are further demonstrated.","Currently, our operational midstream facilities consist of 35 miles of 30-inch trunkline for gas takeaway, more than 40 miles of smaller diameter gathering lines, two central processing sites and eight central tank batteries.","In addition, we have several significant midstream infrastructure milestones coming up in the second half of the year. In August, we will bring online our third central processing site followed by a fourth and fifth site in September, one of which will be located in the southern portion of the play.","Also in September, we will connect our 30-inch trunkline to a market pipeline in the southern portion of the play, which will be capable of moving gas south to Mexico or north to the Waha Hub. Around year-end, we plan to have our sixth central processing site operational.","In terms of new activity, we drilled four appraisal wells in the oil window of the Wolfcamp, Bone Springs parasequences at vertical depths ranging from 9,000 to 10,000 feet. We are excited about these wells, which have confirmed an over-pressured regime and 42-degree to 44-degree gravity oil.","One of the wells, an approximate 4,500-foot lateral drilled in the Wolfcamp formation recorded a 30-day average rate in excess of 1,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. With an oil cut of 70%, this well has cumulative production of approximately 37,000 barrels of oil in 75 days. A second well in the Wolfcamp is still cleaning up and producing around 400 barrels of oil per day.","The third and fourth wells will be completed and begin flowing back shortly. We are pleased with the indications thus far from our oil bearing parasequence test at Alpine High. Early results from mapping and testing these zones gives us confidence at minimum in hundreds of drilling locations, and there is still a considerable amount of acreage in numerous landing zones to be tested.","Optimization work is underway at Alpine High, and we are testing a number of different parameters across multiple formations to determine the best patterns, spacing, well-bore placement and completion designs. This process will be multifaceted and continuous. As we gather data and reach key conclusions, we will discuss them further with the market.","On the costs side, we have made excellent progress and remain comfortable with our previous estimated average drilling and completion cost of $4 million to $6 million per well, despite the rising service cost environment. Overall, Alpine High operations are on track to progress to development. Trunkline and gathering system construction and takeaway connections are proceeding as expected, and our processing facilities are actively optimizing liquids recovery.","From the wells connected and flowing thus far, we are seeing decline curves and pressure data consistent with our EUR projections. In addition to the Wolfcamp and Bone Springs parasequences I just mentioned, we continue to be very confident in our more than 3,000 wet-gas well location count, which remains highly economic at current or even lower prices.","Turning now to the Midland Basin where our activity is primarily focused on multi-well pad drilling to the Wolfcamp and Spraberry formations. In April, we brought the nine well Schrock 34 pad online at the Azalea field in Glasscock County. This pad exhibited strong performance with 60-day cumulative production exceeding our expectations. Average well costs were only $4.3 million, underscoring the significant efficiencies we are achieving in pad operations. In the second half of 2017, we have five additional multi-well pads scheduled to come online in the Midland Basin, which Tim will discuss in a moment.","Internationally, we continued to generate strong free cash flow during the second quarter. In Egypt, our exploration program included two high-rate exploration discoveries with material potential for more activity in the Matruh Basin. As previously mentioned, we have received approval and expect to have signed agreements soon for two new concessions in Egypt. Combined, these blocks add approximately 1.6 million acres to Apache's footprint in the Western Desert, a 40% increase. With the opportunity set provided by these new concessions and the modern vintage 3-D seismic we are accumulating across our acreage in the Western Desert, we are very excited about the long-term potential in Egypt.","Moving over to the North Sea; at Callater, we completed our facilities tieback ahead of schedule and proceeded with testing of the 18x discovery well in June. In July, we successfully tested a second well in an adjacent fault block. Both wells were recently brought online at a combined facilities-constrained rate of approximately 19,000 BOEs per day net to Apache, of which approximately 70% was oil and liquids.","I'd like to close with a review of our 2018 capital budget and the flexibility we have around this program. Adjusted for the pending divestment of Canada, our planned capital budget for 2018 is $3.1 billion. This plan, which we announced in February, was based on $55 WTI oil and $3 NYMEX gas, and was designed to approximate cash flow neutrality, excluding Alpine High midstream investment. Our 2018 budget is flexible and can be adjusted in response to macro conditions, as every $5 per barrel change in oil prices impacts our cash flow by roughly $350 million. If necessary, we have numerous options available next year to manage a lower oil price environment.","To begin with, we are maintaining the operational flexibility to reduce planned activity across most, if not all of our regions. Second, we believe costs in a sub-$55 oil price world would be lower than what we have estimated in our plan; and hence, the same overall activity set could be delivered for less than the $3.1 billion budget. Third, we could continue with the small asset package divestitures.","Fourth, we have multiple options with respect to our Alpine High midstream assets, possibly initiating a monetization process or seeking third-party funding. And lastly, we could choose to utilize a portion of our significant cash position. What you can count on is that we will enter 2018 well prepared to manage a capital program commensurate with the prevailing price environment. We will do so with a keen focus on long-term returns, and we have no intention of stressing the balance sheet or diluting our shareholders.","To wrap up, Apache is executing well on all fronts. Production is now growing in the U.S., as our Permian teams deliver strong drilling results in the Delaware and Midland Basins. In Egypt and the North Sea, we are bringing on several key wells which will provide production momentum in the second half of 2017. Across the company, we are successfully managing cost pressures and working diligently to manage LOE and G&A. In terms of our long-term growth and return expectations, we are making excellent progress incorporating or merging Alpine High outlook into our multiyear plan. As that full field development plan evolves, we will look to communicate some of the key elements of the multiyear plan to the investment community.","Apache's balance sheet remains in great shape and our expected cash flow from oil production is well protected in the back half of this year. We look forward to entering 2018 in a strong financial position and continuing to create value with our differentiated, organic, unconventional exploration capabilities.","I will now turn the call over to Tim to provide more operational details.","Timothy J. Sullivan - Apache Corp.","Good afternoon. My remarks today will cover operational activity and key wells in our focus areas, new technologies we are applying to improve our performance and service and supply cost trends.","Our second quarter production results reflect the lingering impact of last year's reduced capital and development activity. These effects, combined with the scheduled maintenance activities in Canada and the North Sea, contributed to a 3% production decrease on an adjusted basis from the preceding quarter.","With those events behind us, we are shifting to a growth trajectory for the remainder of the year and beyond. During the second quarter, we increased activity at a measured pace, averaging 35 operated rigs worldwide with 17 in the Permian, 1 in the Mid-Continent, 13 in Egypt and 4 in the North Sea. In North America, second quarter 2017 production averaged 244,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, down 3% from the first quarter. In the Permian Basin, production of 146,000 BOE per day was flat compared to the preceding period.","I'll begin with an overview of Alpine High in the Delaware Basin, where we have six rigs operating today. At quarter close, 11 wells were connected and producing into our midstream facilities, five of which were constrained to control flow as we commissioned newly-installed equipment and evaluated initial reservoir performance. Six wells were in various stages of flowback and testing, and 17 wells were waiting on completion, or shut-in waiting on infrastructure. Subsequent to quarter-end, we have connected additional wells, and production continues to impress.","In addition to the Alpine High parasequence wells that John mentioned, we also recently completed a Barnett well with a test rate of more than 7.7 million cubic feet of gas, 400 barrels of oil and 450 barrels of NGLs per day from a 3,300-foot lateral. I would also note that we are seeing much more competitor activity around Alpine High. Offset operators have drilled or were drilling 16 wells with another 28 competitor wells permitted.","As we drill more wells, we are also seeing improvements on the costs side. We are utilizing a spudder rig to set surface casing in an effort to reduce shallow hole cost associated with high-demand larger rigs. In addition, we have been successful in the elimination of the casing string in some areas, and reduced drill time in the intermediate and lateral sections of the well. All-in costs for these wells are on track to fall within our targeted range of $4 million to $6 million.","Elsewhere in the Delaware Basin, in our Mentone field north of the Alpine High, we brought online a five-well pad at the Magpie unit. These wells were drilled with 1-mile laterals in the third Bone Springs and achieved an average 30-day IP rate in excess of 1,000 BOE per day and an average cost of $4.5 million per well.","In the Midland Basin, we are primarily focused on drilling larger multi-well pads. The nine-well Schrock 34 pad in our Azalea field is contributing strong performance. This mile-long pad was designed as a spacing and landing zone test with completion in the Wolfcamp A1, B1 and B3. In addition to this pad, we drilled the Calverley 2932 1H, a 1.5-mile lateral that is the first well of a future nine-well pad. 30-day IPs from these 10 Azalea wells averaged approximately 950 BOE per day, with a 75% oil cut.","In the Powell Field, we completed the first two wells on two separate pads, where we plan to drill a total of 12 wells each in the Wolfcamp B formation. One pad has a mile laterals and achieved a 30-day average IP rate of nearly 900 BOE per day. The other pad has a 1.5-mile laterals and achieved an average 30-day IP rate of just under 1,300 BOE per day. During the second half of 2017, we plan to bring online approximately 30 Midland Basin wells, most of them having extended laterals of 1.5 miles or longer.","I'll turn now to our international assets. Adjusted production in Egypt, which excludes minority interest and the impact of tax barrels, increased slightly from the first quarter 2017 to 89,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. We had several exploration and development highlights from the Egyptian drilling program during the second quarter, primarily in our legacy Matruh Basin. We are developing new concepts in this mature basin, which is leading to greater results from great rock.","We tested two zones at the Herunefer West 1X well. The AEB tested 5,900 BOE per day, and the Lower Safa tested 4,500 BOE per day. The discovery established our thickest pay interval to date within the basin, logging approximately 400 feet of total net pay in the Safa and AEB formations. It also sets up several development locations and derisks additional exploration prospects on trend. Also in the Matruh Basin, the Bravo 2X tested at nearly 4,100 BOE per day from 78 feet of pay in the Safa, with additional pay behind pipe.","In Egypt, during the first half of 2017, we have drilled a total of 43 wells with a 77% success rate. Notably, 22 of the 33 producers have exhibited extremely high test rates exceeding 1,000 BOE per day, with successes spanning five different basins. Keep in mind that these are vertical wells with completed well costs of approximately $3 million. We have also performed 18 recompletions this year, with flow rates also exceeding 1,000 BOE per day.","I'll move now to our North Sea region. Due to scheduled maintenance activity at the Beryl platforms, our production declined to 55,000 BOE per day during the second quarter of 2017. This was better than expected, as equipment deliveries necessary for the planned maintenance turnarounds were delayed, so the tar started later than planned.","We used this delay to accelerate testing of our first well at Callater, the 18x. As previously disclosed, the lower half of the 18x tested at a peak 24-hour rate of more than 15,000 barrels of oil and 28 million cubic feet of gas. This was stronger than expected and nearly equivalent to the rate that we had forecasted for the entire well. Subsequent to the second quarter end, we tested the upper half of the Callater 18x, and it flowed at a peak 24-hour rate of more than 19,000 BOE per day with a 69% oil cut.","As John noted, we also recently completed a second well at Callater in the adjacent fault block. The CB2 tested at a very strong 24-hour rate of more than 11,000 BOE per day with a 65% oil cut. With both wells flowing at Callater, we expect the North Sea will deliver higher production levels in the second half of the year.","In addition to the progress at Callater, we drilled the BLB, an infill well at Beryl Bravo platform. This well flowed at a 30-day initial production rate averaging nearly 6,400 barrels of oil equivalent per day, with an 82% oil cut from the Nansen reservoir.","Please refer to our financial and operational supplement for more details on our second quarter production.","Across our portfolio, we are implementing new technologies to improve the data we use to explore the subsurface, increase operational efficiencies, reduce costs, and improve hydrocarbon recoveries while optimizing net present value. We are taking an integrated geoscience and engineering approach to these initiatives.","In the Permian, both in the Delaware and Midland Basins, we are collecting massive amounts of data from multiple sources. On a single pad, to better understand reservoir performance, we have obtained or installed downhole microseismic data, surface vertical seismic profiles, fiber optics collecting pressure and temperature data, downhole pressure monitors, and oil and chemical tracers. This data collection and analysis will provide us unprecedented insight into the effect of our stimulations on the rock fabric. Ultimately, it will allow us to optimize well placement and spacing.","Apache also has been building new state-of-the-art water treatment and recycling facilities, including large, highly engineered water storage pits in both Midland and the Delaware Basins. These facilities directly add value to our projects by reducing water costs and increasing reliability and flexibility.","Finally, Apache is developing new workflows and technologies that allow for rapid characterization of thousands of feet of core and quickly getting this into the hands of geologists and engineers for faster characterization of shale plays and landing zones.","Overall, we are building a far more robust understanding of our conventional and unconventional plays and their performance than was previously possible. Instead of just gathering data, we are owning, maintaining, validating, and optimizing the use of the data to add value to our assets.","I'll move now to service costs. This is a positive execution story, as we've been able to effectively maintain the lower cost structure achieved in 2016. As John noted, we anticipated much of the inflation we're seeing today and have been successful offsetting it with operational efficiencies and service contracts. Overall costs for North America were essentially flat in the second quarter of 2017 compared with the first quarter. We do not expect rising service costs to materially impact our activity or budget for the remainder of 2017.","We continue to see cost inflation for certain services and supplies, primarily for pressure pumping and sand in West Texas, where spot market prices continue to trend upward. Hoping to offset this, we are sourcing low-cost sands that are delivered from local mines in the Permian Basin, reducing transportation costs considerably. We also entered into contracts with pricing indexed to WTI, which protects against a portion of those increases.","Internationally, costs are tracking as expected. During the third quarter, the current contract on Ocean Patriot expires, and we've renewed the semisubmersible drilling rig at a considerably lower day rate. This will reduce our North Sea drilling costs in 2018 and 2019, with an option for a third year.","I will conclude by noting that we have increased activity in North America at a very measured pace and generally avoided direct competition for equipment and services at spot market rates. We are focused on generating strong, fully burdened returns. And as indicated by our guidance, growth will follow in the second half of 2017. Despite industry cost pressures, we believe our 2017 North America operations are more capital efficient than in previous years.","I will now turn the call over to Steve.","Stephen J. Riney - Apache Corp.","Thank you, Tim, and, good afternoon, everyone. On today's call, I will review our second quarter financial results. I will provide an update on quarterly and annual guidance items, which will reflect the full anticipated effect of Apache's exit from Canada. And lastly, I will comment on our updated hedges and the continuing strength of our financial position.","Let me begin with second quarter financial results. As noted in our press release, Apache reported net income of $572 million or $1.50 per diluted common share. Earnings were positively impacted by a net deferred income tax benefit related to a financial restructuring in Canada in preparation for the exit. This consists primarily of a $678 million reduction in a U.S. deferred income tax liability with respect to untaxed foreign source earnings. Together with some other smaller adjustments, the total tax benefit excluded for purposes of calculating adjusted earnings is $670 million. Results for the quarter also included a number of other items outside of our core earnings that are typically excluded by the investment community in published earnings estimates.","These include a $26 million unrealized mark-to-market gain on our commodity price hedge positions, $25 million of unproved acreage impairment and $18 million of loss related to recent divestitures. Excluding these and other items, our adjusted loss for the quarter was $79 million or $0.21 per share. Note, this adjusted earnings still includes the effect of dry-hole costs incurred of $46 million or $0.08 per share after tax. Cash flow from operations in the quarter was $751 million. This includes a working capital benefit of $148 million. Our cash position on June 30 was $1.7 billion, a slight increase from the previous quarter.","Turning to costs, lease operating expenses in the second quarter were $8.81 per parallel of oil equivalent, an increase over the first quarter rate. This increase was anticipated and is primarily attributable to seasonal maintenance activity in our North Sea business. Our first half 2017 LOE was $8.27 per barrel of oil equivalent, which is in line with our guidance for the full year of $8.25 to $8.75 per BOE. Exploration expense in the second quarter was $108 million, $85 million of which was attributable to dry-hole expense and unproved leasehold impairments.","Now I'll move to guidance, and today we are mending several of our 2017 guidance ranges to reflect the impact of Apache's pending exit from Canada. As previously announced, we are exiting our Canada business via three separate transactions. Our 2017 updated guidance is provided on pages 22 and 23 of the supplement.","All new guidance now reflects Canada results through the actual or anticipated transaction closing dates. As a reminder, the first of these three transactions closed on June 30, and the other two transactions are expected to close in August.","Additionally, on pages 19 through 21 of our supplement, we have provided new adjusted quarterly production guidance which excludes Canada from all quarters in 2017. I will walk through some of these guidance items, but my comments will be relatively brief. So feel free to follow up with Gary and his team with any questions you may have.","Beginning with our adjusted North American production guidance on page 19 of the supplement, we have removed actual and projected Canadian production for all of the periods shown. We have also tightened our forward-looking guidance ranges reflecting more clarity around our second half production ramp, particularly at Alpine High.","On the international side, our adjusted production guidance remains essentially unchanged. However, I would like to note that Egypt tax barrel guidance for reporting purposes has decreased by 10,000 BOEs per day, which is primarily driven by a lower commodity price outlook and thus lower taxable income in Egypt.","With regard to capital, our $3.1 billion 2017 budget is not impacted by the Canada exit, since most of the capital allocated to the Canada region this year will have been spend by the time the transactions have closed. The exit from Canada will reduce our planned 2018 capital budget by approximately $125 million.","Turning to guidance for expenses, on page 23 of the supplement, you will note that we reduced annual guidance for G&A expenses by $25 million and for gathering and transportation expenses by $20 million to $30 million, both primarily to reflect the Canada exit. Note that our DD&A guidance for 2017 has increased slightly on a BOE basis since our Canada business had a relatively low carrying value.","Moving now to hedging, in addition to our oil PUDs, we have begun adding some gas hedges. For the second half of 2017, we have now swapped an average of 33,750 MMBtu per day of gas volumes at an average price of $3.36.","More significantly, we have begun hedging our first quarter 2018 gas volumes with 150,000 MMBtu per day swapped at an average price of $3.39. As a reminder, the primary goal of our hedging activity is to protect the pace and delivery of a strategically important capital program at Alpine High. This continues to be the case as we look to 2018. We do not use hedging to speculate on price.","I would like to conclude by emphasizing Apache's financial strength. This is a product of our disciplined approach over the last few years. As I indicated previously, our cash position has been growing and net debt is down $355 million since the beginning of the year. For the remainder of the year, our cash flow is well protected with our price hedges, so our ability to fund the capital program and dividend payment without utilizing the balance sheet is secure.","We are well prepared for continued volatility in oil and gas prices. We continue to balance the need to flex the capital program commensurate with the price environment, while also funding our long-term strategy. Throughout this effort, we focus on investments that will deliver sound full-cycle economics at current or even lower commodity prices.","With that, I will turn the call over to the operator for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question is from the line of Bob Brackett with Bernstein Research.","Robert Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","A question on the Midland Basin. There's been a lot of talk amongst investors about rising gas-oil ratios in that play and the potential that they're displacing forecasted oil type curves. What's your view on that? How do we think about your GORs in the Midland?","Timothy J. Sullivan - Apache Corp.","This is Tim. In the Midland Basin, our shale wells, they're performing in line with our type curves. We really haven't been surprised by the GORs. We understand the producing characteristics of our different areas that we operate in. And our GORs are performing as we would have expected.","Robert Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay, great. Thanks. The other is, do you have an estimate of where you were Alpine High sort of end of \u2013 or currently or call it the end of 2Q?","John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.","Actually in the prepared remarks, Bob, we said we produced 7,400 BOEs a day net to Apache. 10% of that was liquids and almost all of that was oil in the month of June.","Robert Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Got you. Thank you.","John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.","You bet. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah. Good afternoon. John, I wondered if you could give us a little bit more detail. In your prepared comments you talked a little bit about how you expect Alpine High to perform in the northern part of the field versus the south. So I wondered if you can give us a little bit more color around that.","John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.","I mean, Arun, I think the good news is, is we got online early. We were scheduled to bring everything on July 1. We have some of the stuff to talk about in the second quarter, because we were able to bring things on in early May. Things are progressing really as planned. We were able to sell net to Apache 7,400 BOEs a day in the month of June.","And like I said, we've been bringing up the CPFs. If you look at kind of where we are today on the infrastructure, we now have 35 miles of the 30-inch trunkline in. We've got over 40 miles of gathering in. There are two CPFs that are operating with eight tank batteries. And then in August and September, we've got our third CPF coming in \u2013 coming on in August, fourth and fifth in September, as well as a connection to the south.","And so what we've said is, our volumes are \u2013 we're currently producing about 60 million a day net to Apache. You're going to see that grow to 100 by September. And you're going to see the liquids ratio grow as well, especially as we start to bring on more NGLs. So a lot of exciting things. We only had 11 wells on in the quarter, and really five of those have been constrained. So we're really, really just getting started.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got you. Got you. And then, just in terms of \u2013 you talked about by year-end getting to six CPFs. What type of productive capacity do you get from six CPFs?","John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.","We've said that we're going to be bringing on these CPFs in increments, 50 million to 100 million a day. They're all going to be able to be incrementally added. So what we've done is given you volume forecast and guidance. Right now, we are constrained, but we hope to resolve that as we catch up, as these things come on in the next couple of months. And then, from there, we hope to have more capacity than we'll have volumes.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got you. And just my follow-up is just in Egypt, what is your plan to explore on some of the new licensed acreage that you've received, I think, earlier this year?","John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.","It's going to \u2013 it depends on the timing. Right now, as we've said, we're shooting a brand new high-res 3-D across our existing acreage. And as well, we'll be shooting the new permits as soon as we get the final documents signed. Everything's approved. We're just waiting on the final documents. So that should happen here pretty soon. We'll get started on the seismic in this fall, and we could potentially drill our first well this fall.","We see a lot of low-hanging fruit, and we're very, very excited about the potential. I mean, they're very large concessions. We know a lot about them. And \u2013 I mean, they're going to be a real, real shot in the arm. You got to go back to over 10 years since we've had two new concessions. Not anything of this size either, so it's going to be a real shot in the arm for our Egypt production, maybe late this year, most likely as you start to go into 2018, 2019, and beyond.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of David Tameron with Wells Fargo.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","All right, good afternoon. John, could you talk about \u2013 do you guys have a definitive timeline as far as when we'll get more clarity around the potential resource at Alpine High?","John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.","David, as we've said, we're ramping up most of our wells, like the wells we disclosed on the last earnings call. We cleaned them up and shut them in. Most wells have been waiting. We've got \u2013 as Tim said in his notes, we've got a lot of wells waiting on the infrastructure. Now that we have the facilities and things, it doesn't make a lot of sense to be flaring volumes and things. And so, as we bring more things on, I think you're going to continue to see a lot of data coming. And when we get to a point that it makes sense to talk more definitively, what we really want to do is get the processing facilities lined out, get more time behind the wells, continue with our optimization work, and at some point, we'll come back with something very meaningful and very definitive.","But I think what we've continued to state is that we feel very, very good that we have more than 3,000 wet gas locations. Your best EURs would be to look at what we disclosed at Barclays almost a year ago. And now we said with the two Wolfcamp wells that are, by the way, in two different zones in the Wolfcamp, in a significant distance between those wells, we feel very confident now that we have hundreds of locations in the Wolfcamp, so \u2013 that will be oil locations. And \u2013 so we'll come back as we get more data. We're really just getting started with our infrastructure and being able to bring things on and produce them into ideal production situations.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. I think \u2013 let me just stay with Alpine High then. Midstream, future funding, there's been a lot of talk about whether you sell it, whether you bring a partner in, whether you're going to go out alone. Any additional color you can give us on that?","John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.","Well, I think what you've seen is this year we had an outspend on our infrastructure side and now we've more than covered that. As we look at 2018, we \u2013 the 2018 budget had originally looked at $55 as a price target. We've said that there are lots of options we have on that. Our spend in 2018 is planned around $500 million. We're probably going to pull some of that into this year as we stated within our $3.1 billion budget. So we feel very comfortable that we're going to be able to handle that funding without having to stress the balance sheet, issue equity, or really put ourselves in a bind.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","All right, thanks.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Jeoffrey Lambujon with Tudor, Pickering, Holt.","Jeoffrey Restituto Lambujon - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Good afternoon, thanks. In the Alpine High, specifically on the oil zone test, I realize that it's early. But can you speak to your initial thoughts on the deposition of both the Wolfcamp and Bone Spring across your position?","John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.","It's going be very similar, the parasequences. So they were laid down at a time when you had very rapidly rising sea level. And so there is some discontinuity in them just like there is in all of the Delaware Basin, so very similar. And so you've got a lot of mixed things in there. But we're very excited about what we've got. And these two wells are going to perform very similar to the other wells in the Delaware Basin.","Jeoffrey Restituto Lambujon - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Great. And then staying in the Alpine High but on optimized completions, can you give us some detail on what you're testing, when we can expect to hear more, and what early indications you have, if any?","John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.","When we talk about optimization, there's really a lot of things. It involves targeting, spacing tests, pattern tests, landing zone, lateral length, the orientation, and in the completion design. And even in the completion design, you've got your fluids in terms of your volumes, your sand concentrations, the stages, clusters, everything.","So we have begun the optimization process. We've actually had 11 wells into the system at the end of the quarter. As we bring more in, clearly we're going about it very methodically like we have the whole play. And as we get to points where we draw some conclusions, we'll start to make those more clear. But we're doing a lot of things. We've got some longer laterals. We've got some larger fracs, targeting, azimuth, everything.","Jeoffrey Restituto Lambujon - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Good afternoon.","John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.","Hey, Brian.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","A couple follow-ups on the capital allocation question. When you say moderate outspend for the near term, can you add more color on the length and threshold for that outspending? And I guess relatedly, if Alpine High midstream is where you see the outspend happening, when does the midstream achieve critical mass, and then when would we expect the outspend to end?","John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.","When we think about \u2013 right now we're just talking 2017 and 2018 is what we've been looking at. So if you look at 2017 and 2018, that would be that time period. I think the important thing with our infrastructure at Alpine High is it's going reach a critical mass where we really believe middle of next year we could be in a position to start to monetize a portion of it or do something there. So we'll look at 2018 as we start to roll into \u2013 later this year or early next year, we'll start to give another look into 2018 and beyond. But we're looking right now at 2018.","The other thing I'll say about 2018 as our original budget had it \u2013 which is really flat activity to this year, had a $55 deck in there. $5 in oil price means about $350 million of cash flow to us. And so we see we have a lot of flexibility with our program. One, we can reduce activity. Two, if we really are in a sub-$55 world next year, then our cost structure is going be lower than what we have in that budget. So there will be the ability to get more for that activity set. I think we've shown this year we can do some non-material asset sales, which I would not put the strategic exit from Canada in that bucket. I've touched on the Alpine High midstream, and then we also have a very nice $1.7 billion of cash on the balance sheet.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great, thank you. And then switching to the Alpine High Wolfcamp oil well, the first well that you announced where you talked about 1,000 BOE a day, it looks like that would imply about 700 barrels a day of oil in the first month, and then about 350 to 360 barrels a day for the remainder of the 75 days. I just wanted to check in on both your expectations for well costs for these wells and then if these rates are in line with your type curve and what rates you're looking for from the next batch of wells.","John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.","It looks really good. I think the thing we'll say, number one, it's approximately 4,500 foot lateral. It has come on 70% oil. And the 30-day average is actually greater than 1,000 BOEs a day, and it did produce 37,000 barrels of oil in the first 75 days. A lot of the research this morning has come out tagging that as BOE, which is not correct. Very typical profile to a lot of the other Delaware wells. Good charge. We'll have more water than we'll have in our resource zones in the Woodford, Barnett to pin, so it's going to be very typical characteristics and very, very strong profile, and performing very, very well.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Charles Meade with Johnson Rice.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Company LLC","Good afternoon, John, to you and the rest of your team there.","John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.","Hi, Charles.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Company LLC","Thank you. You guys have fielded a lot of Alpine High questions, so I'm going to go a slightly different direction. I think you \u2013 perhaps Tim hinted at this in some of his earlier comments. When I look at the wells you guys have drilled already, you've drilled 1-mile laterals with a significantly lower completed well cost than your peers have been delivering in the area. But I think what I heard is that going forward, at least in the back half of 2017, you guys are going be going after longer laterals which presumably will have some higher completed well costs. And I wonder if you could characterize for us where you think you are on your optimization of your well design and your completion time design for those Midland Basin wells.","Timothy J. Sullivan - Apache Corp.","Charles, what we've been doing primarily is we've been drilling mile laterals in our three core focus areas; Wildfire, Powell, and Azalea. If you go back to 2016, we changed our completions dramatically since then. And one thing I might note though, if you look at our completed costs from 2016 to today on those mile laterals, our completed well costs have remained relatively unchanged at about $4.5 million. And a lot of that has been the conversion from drilling one-offs to going to pad drilling and getting the efficiencies obviously from batch drilling and the savings that we see there.","Going forward, we've got about 30 wells. We've got about five different pads that we anticipate we're going bring online in the second half, and most of those are going be mile and a half type laterals. And we are still doing a little bit of spacing testing and landing zone testing along with this development drilling that we're doing as well.","So the completions are still \u2013 we're still working on them, and every area is a little bit different, so I don't think we'll ever get to one completion design that will be standardized across the entire play. It's going be tailored to the type of rock that we've got at each field that we have. So it's something that we will continue to optimize, and we'll really never be done with that process.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Company LLC","Okay, thank you for that, Tim. And then if I could ask a question about the North Sea, and you had those impressive well results with Callater. And I'm wondering if you can guide our expectations a bit with respect to North Sea results going forward. Should we look at Callater and particularly at the idea that this most impressive well was on offset fault block? Should we be looking for more sorts of results like this, or is this a one-off sort of thing that we ought not look for a repeat?","John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.","Callater is a well we disclosed in 2015. It was a new discovery. There will be some offsets. We announced another fault block there with that, so we're very excited about the area.","I think the best thing to do in terms of forecast is just look at what we've guided to, Charles. I mean, we've had this well planned in and this development baked in. It's really a function of the exploration program. We've had a series of announced discoveries over the last couple of years that are in the queue to be coming on in the future, and Callater is kind of in the first of those that we're tying in, in 2017, so...","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Evan Calio with Morgan Stanley.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey. Good afternoon, guys. Maybe I'll bring it back to the Alpine High. And maybe I missed it, but when do you guys expect to reveal the larger development plan you discussed in the call? Is it \u2013 is that in connection with the 2018 CapEx budget? And if there's no specific date, what still needs to happen there before you feel confident in that plan?","John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.","Well, we feel confident in the plan, Evan. I mean, obviously, we gave guidance this year for a two-year look. We've given you a 2018 4Q exit rate, and we didn't touch any of those numbers this quarter. In fact, didn't really touch our guidance at all, other than adjusting for Canada. So we have a plan that we're working on. We're always updating it with new data. We've still got a lot of areas we are testing and bringing things in, but we have a base plan and we gave you a two-year look at it this year. Obviously, we'll choose as we're phasing in and bringing things on. We've said we're at 60 million a day net today, and we'll be north of 100 million in September. And as we get more color and continue, we'll come at it sometime in the future and give you a longer look. But we gave you a good two-year look, and for now, we have a lot of confidence in that.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","And maybe to follow up on that, the 100 million guide, can you walk us through how that estimate is billed? Meaning, how many wells are connected and what percentage of them will be on constrained flow because it's harder to \u2013 it's harder to kind of model for us?","John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.","The better thing to do is look at the numbers we gave you and run off of those, because we've gone end of the first \u2013 end of the second quarter we had 11 wells on and five of them are constrained. And we should get to a point where we don't have constrained wells as we get these next three CPFs up over the August and September timeframe.","But we haven't given an absolute well count, as that's dynamic. But what we have given you is ranges, Evan. And we said, in June we produced 7,400 barrels of oil equivalent a day net. It's not gross; that's net. And it was 10% liquids, and almost all of that was oil. And the liquids ratio is going to grow as the volume grows in the future.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of James Sullivan with Alembic Global Advisors.","James Sullivan - Alembic Global Advisors LLC","Hey. Good morning \u2013 good afternoon, guys, there. I just wanted to go back to that Wolfcamp oil well real quick. You talked, John, about there being a nice charge in that well there, and a couple of comments on the overpressure there. Could you just talk about how you released that well, I mean, in terms of initial chokes and how you were kind of letting it out there? Any color you can give on that would be great. And on pressure drawdowns, too.","John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.","It's just a very, very strong well. We've flown it back naturally, and there is a sub pump in there today. And it's very typical to the other wells we have and the other areas of the Delaware Basin.","James Sullivan - Alembic Global Advisors LLC","Okay. Great. Sounds good. Just on \u2013 over to the North Sea real quick, you guys did the turnaround over there. Can you quantify the amount of volume that was offline there for the quarter?","Timothy J. Sullivan - Apache Corp.","For the second quarter, it was just under 7,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. That was offline. Some of that turnaround got pushed into the third quarter. So we'll see some downtime from turnarounds in the third quarter as well.","James Sullivan - Alembic Global Advisors LLC","Okay. And then Q4 will be more like your run rate?","Timothy J. Sullivan - Apache Corp.","Correct.","James Sullivan - Alembic Global Advisors LLC","Great, thanks so much.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Michael Hall with Heikkinen Energy Advisors.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Thanks. I guess just a couple on my end. As it relates to the DUCs and wells waiting on infrastructure and just I guess general backlog in the Alpine High, how many of those at present are currently in the oilier zone?","John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.","Yeah. Right now, Michael, we've got a mix. We haven't given breakdowns on that. You've got a range, some of those are going be wet gas wells. Some of them are going to be \u2013 there's a few we've got several that are in flow-back. So it will be a mix kind of like we have across our play.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Okay. But specific to the Wolfcamp or Bone Spring, you don't, by chance, have that available?","John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.","There's going be more than two, and I'll just say that.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Okay, fair enough. And then I guess the other was just still on the Permian, but higher level. I was just curious when you guys think you'll see oil volumes in the Permian turn around? They've been obviously on decline, but you've got a big back-half ramp that you've outlined. Do you think we'll see sequential growth in oil volumes in the third quarter or how should we think about that?","Timothy J. Sullivan - Apache Corp.","Yeah. So, we have turned the corner now on growth, not only in international and in North America, but just on North \u2013 our Permian oil growth will be \u2013 continually grow quarter-after-quarter.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Okay. Appreciate it. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Jeffrey Campbell with Tuohy Brothers.","Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Good afternoon.","John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.","Hey, Jeff.","Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Hey, John. In the Permian Basin, many producers are moving towards completing all the locations of a given zone or maybe even several zones and wants to avoid well interference and enhance efficiencies. I was just wondering what is your completion approach as you're increasingly focusing on drilling more wells and zones per pad.","John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.","That's a novel idea. We've always talked about \u2013 ultimately you do your testing, so you can get to pad development, and that is the optimal way to do that. So you want to get in the pads where you can develop the rock and produce it in the best way, shape or form. So it's exactly the approach we're taking. That's \u2013 we've got some 10, 11 well pads coming on later this year in Midland Basin. So I mean it's clearly the direction you want to go with all of it.","Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Okay. Thanks. And my other question is in Egypt. With the large increase in acreage, how will you allocate capital there over the next year or two? I mean, obviously you're having great success in the areas where you have concentrated operations. So I'm just wondering how will exploration spend on the new acreage look relative to the spending as a whole.","John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.","It's probably going be pretty similar to how it's been. I mean, we drill quite a few exploration wells in Egypt every year anyways. So as Egypt continues to generate more free cash flow, potentially you could see more capital. But we're not going to change philosophically how we're thinking about that. But it's an exciting place. I mean, I think we're going to find ourselves with better \u2013 some pretty strong deliverability things, much like Ptah and Berenice have been over the last couple of years. So a lot of low-hanging fruit that should help us with volumes and also with the ability to generate more free cash flow and also reinvest more.","Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And our last question is from the line of Doug Leggate with Bank of America.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks, everybody. Good afternoon and thank you for getting me on, John. John, you guys are...","John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.","Only for you, Doug.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I'm trying to take advantage of you a little bit here, John, because you're uniquely qualified with your background and your vertical well inventory for the history of Apache to really opine on this issue that, I guess, Bob brought up earlier. Obviously, sector is getting annihilated in the back of this GOR issue. So I'm wondering if you could take just a little bit of time and just maybe do the market a favor and explain what you meant by the type curve or the gas breakout, the GOR has not changed adverse to your expectations.","And what I'm getting at is the difference between the pressure drawdown in the vertical versus the pressure drawdown in the horizontal. What are you seeing there? Is there anything different in the oil recovery in your Midland Basin wells versus what you expected and versus what you've planned on based on that vertical well history? Because there seems to be a little bit of a panic going on that this is actually a deterioration of oil recovery as opposed to an enhancement of gas and NGL recovery. Could I ask you to...","John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.","I'll say a few things. Number one, we've always forecasted our oil and gas streams separately. Like \u2013 I mean, it's just fundamental petroleum engineering. Anybody forecasting BOE curves and you've got changing dynamics out there you have to model it. I mean, it's like anything else though, Doug. You do your core work, you do your fluid analysis, you look at your pressure and temperature data. And we can model that. We've got a lot of history and we do a lot of time modeling that. And so our wells are producing and \u2013 as our type curves are laid out. And we have not had any surprises in terms of the forecasted volumes with how they are performing.","Areas behave differently. And if we go back to some of our earlier areas where we drilled some wells in 2010 and 2011, they were in a little less mature area, a little higher GORs, they're going to behave differently. We've got a lot of history and have a deep understanding of how this works. And so we're not surprised by the GORs and you have to examine those very carefully. And \u2013 but every rock, every area, the rocks will differ depending on the play, and that's why it takes time to collect the data properly, do the core work, do the fluid work, do the pressure work and create your material balance just like you would in conventional rock. But there's a difference.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I appreciate that.","John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.","There's just a real difference between how conventional and unconventional reservoirs behave and there's a difference how they behave over time. And you'll see contribution from different types of the fabric as it goes forward.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So just to be clear, I know we're out of time here. So if I could just add two quick pieces to that, one is, related to that, the vertical pressure drawdown versus a horizontal pressure drawdown, would you concur with the idea that the horizontal is getting the gas breakout quicker but not changing the material balance?","John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.","I wouldn't say that rock is going to drawdown and break out exactly how it's exposed to the surface. So that's just a function of temperature and pressure and the drawdown. The orientation of the well isn't going to have as big of an impact as just how the rock is going to behave under pressure and temperature and how the makeup of it is.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And my last one is more Apache-specific. What do you need to see to declare a broader oil inventory in the Alpine High? Obviously, you've given another couple of wells today. And if I may, when that happens, I assume it's going to happen at some point, would it change your targeting on how your initial development plan versus \u2013 oil versus gas? And I'll leave it there. Thank you.","John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.","I'd say any incremental well, obviously, you tweak your plans as you go through it. You'll see more from us as we bring more wells out. We've had 11 wells on the end of June, half of them, or five of them were flowing constrained. We've just got a lot of data coming over the next couple of quarters. But it's very exciting. We're going to be very deliberate on what we disclose. We're not going to come out with big location counts unless we're confident in those location counts. And there's a lot of rock to test even in our parasequence zones.","So there's a lot of exciting things. We've got a big thick column, 5,000 feet of hydrocarbons over a 65-mile area down there, and a lot of rock to work with, so you're going to see a lot more locations coming out of us in the future.","Operator","And that does conclude the Q&A portion of this call today. Thank you for your participation. Ladies and gentlemen, you may now disconnect."],"1688":["Apache (NYSE:APA) Q3 2012 Earnings Call November  1, 2012  2:00 PM ET","Executives","Brady Parish - Vice President of Investor Relations","G.

[Operator Instructions]","I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Brady Parish, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","Brady Parish","Thank you, Regina. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us for Apache Corporation's Third Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call.","For all of you who have been impacted by Hurricane Sandy, we wanted to let you know that our thoughts are with you and your loved ones.","This morning, we reported earnings of $161 million or $0.41 per diluted share. Adjusted earnings, which excludes certain items that impact the comparability of results, totaled $861 million or $2.16 per diluted share. Cash flow from operations totaled $2.4 billion for the quarter.","On today's call, we will have 3 speakers making prepared remarks prior to taking questions. First, we will hear from Steve Farris, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; followed by Rod Eichler, President and Chief Operating Officer; and finally, Tom Chambers, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","We prepared our quarterly supplemental data package for your use, which also includes the reconciliation of any non-GAAP numbers that we discuss such as adjusted earnings, cash flow from operations or pretax margins. This data package can be found on our website at www.apachecorp.com\/financialdata. Today's discussion will contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions based on our current views and most reasonable expectations. However, a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from what we discuss today. A full disclaimer is located with the supplemental data package on our website.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Steve.","G. Steven Farris","Thank you, Brady. And good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today.","As I'm sure you've all read in our release this morning, during the third quarter, we accelerated our drilling momentum. Across our portfolio, we've got excellent results. In the U.S., we continued to step up our play activity and now run 63 rigs, 50% more than we did at the beginning -- had at the beginning of the year. And Rod is going to go on a lot more detail, but we've got outstanding well results in a number of plays, including the Cline, Wolfcamp and Wichita Albany and the Canyon Wash and the Permian Basin and also the Granite Wash and the Anadarko Basin.","During the quarter, our growing drillbit momentum was also notable on the international front. In the North Sea, after consolidating our expanded portfolio early in the year, we're having very good drilling results with excellent flow rates from all discoveries across our fields. And the value of Apache as operator, I think, has just been endorsed by a major, with Shell last week announcing their purchase of half this [ph] position and many of the Apache-operated fields in the region.","In Argentina, we completed our first Vaca Muerta horizontal well, which was a relatively short lateral. It was about 1,900 feet with only 7 fracs. It's early days, but the well results have been very encouraging. We continue to set the economics of the play. We have 4 additional horizontal tests that's planned over the next few months. We have 450,000 net acres in this play, and it has enormous resource potential.","After a very successful portfolio expansion phase over the last 2.5 years, we really focused -- refocused back to the drillbit. We hold a leading position in some of the most attractive basins and plays around the world, and we intend to actively exploit this resource potential for the benefit of our shareholders.","As we disclosed by our press release last month, our third quarter reported production reflects approximately 25,000 barrels of oil a day of production downtime, which were due primarily to hurricane disruptions in the Gulf of Mexico and the scheduled North Sea platform turnarounds. Our third quarter production averaged about 771,000 barrels a day. And if you put 25,000 barrels on top of that, which is all back on right now, we're -- we've -- we're producing today approximately 800,000 barrels a day. The important thing is we remain on track to deliver our production growth guidance for the year and we're going to stay within our $10 billion exploration and development budget.","One final note. And as we continue to build and execute our global pipeline of exploration activity, we're testing 2 wells, 1 in the Williston Basin -- both which we have large acreage positions; and the Mississippian Lime. The good news is we've had good oil shows from the logs and the formations that we were targeting. We're currently completion -- in the completion phase of our initial wells in each of these plays, and we'll be experimenting with our frac designs to give us optimal results.","We secured a number of blocks in the recent Gulf of Mexico lease sale. We have captured a highly sought-after deepwater block in Suriname, which is on trend with recent play opening and discoveries.","You should expect our drillbit momentum to continue. We have built the foundation of this portfolio over the several years, and this is personally the most exciting time for me over the last 25 years. We have the asset depth, financial strength and delivery expertise to stand out in this sector, and that's exactly what we intend to do.","Now I'll turn it over to Rodney.","Rodney J. Eichler","Thank you, Steve.","Our total reported net production for the third quarter was approximately 771,000 boe per day. Hurricane Isaac in the Gulf of Mexico and outages in the North Sea due to scheduled maintenance activities reduced production by 13,000 boe per day and 12,000 boe per day, respectively. Currently, all of this production is back online and we have entered the fourth quarter with record worldwide net production.","During the third quarter, we continued the conversion of our extensive onshore oil and hydrocarbon liquids-rich inventory into production and cash flow. We rank among the most active drillers in North America, having operated an average of 66 drilling rigs in our U.S. regions during the quarter, including 35 in our Permian region and 24 in our Central region, with outstanding results. Our Permian and Central region averaged combined net production of approximately 184,000 boe per day during the third quarter, nearly 1\/4 of our total worldwide net production. Moreover, this represents an increase of 15% over the second quarter averaged net production of 160,000 boe per day and an increase of 30% over third quarter 2011 net boe production of 141,000 boe per day. With the inventory of over 67,000 locations in these 2 regions alone, we remain on track to deliver double-digit growth in the oil and liquids-rich Permian and Central regions for years to come.","In addition, we are continuing our very active new venture exploration program. Steve already elaborated on our encouraging results in the Mississippi Lime and Williston Basin and Vaca Muerta shale, so I'll not address these plays here. In Alaska, we are on track to spud our first well in the Cook Inlet during the fourth quarter.","Finally, in October we signed a new production shoring agreement to explore a high-potential area in Block 53 offshore Suriname in the equatorial margin fairway. We were awarded 100% interest in this block and expect to commence a 3D seismic program during 2013.","Now turning to more detail in our regions. The Permian had another outstanding quarter as we continue to grow through drillbit. Third quarter production averaged nearly 112,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, a 7% increase over the second quarter, with part of the increase resulting from additional NGL processing at the Deadwood plant as it became fully operational.","Our substantial acreage position continues to provide Apache the flexibility and optionality to test new plays and concepts. During the quarter, we added 230,000 gross acreage to our overall acreage position, the majority of which was in the Midland Basin and the Wolfcamp play. We now hold over 3.7 million gross acres across the hydrocarbon-rich Permian Basin. We are now the most active driller in the basin and, during the quarter, averaged 35 rigs, drilling 201 wells of which 26 were horizontal. We expect to continue our shift to more horizontal drilling in the fourth quarter and into 2013 when we anticipate nearly half of our drilling rigs will be horizontal.","Drilling at Deadwood and Yeso continue to be a large contributor to growth, while Irion County Wolfcamp horizontal activity and potential continues to expand. At Deadwood where we are targeting the Wolfwood and Fusselman with vertical wells, we averaged a 15-rig program for the quarter. Earlier in the year, we acquired additional 3D seismic data, with the first migrated data arriving earlier in third quarter. This new seismic information greatly enhanced our ability to target the prolific Fusselman accumulations, and new locations are continuing to be identified.","A couple of our most recent Fusselman successes are the Squire 9 #5 well, which flowed at 339 barrels of oil per day and 677 Mcf per day; and the Reilly [ph] 37 #8, which produced at a rate of 166 barrels of oil per day and 256 Mcf per day.","Drilling in the Deadwood area will complete the main active throughout 2012 and into 2013. We operate 2 horizontal rigs in the Deadwood area, targeting the shale of the Wolfcamp, Atoka\/Barnett and the Lower Cline formations. The latest Cline well in Deadwood is Apache's best well to date. The [indiscernible] 45-2H was drilled on the Southeast edge of our Deadwood acreage.  The well was drilled to a TD of 13,350 feet measured depth with a 1,300-foot lateral, and after an 11-stage frac, the well obtained a peak rate of 810 boe per day. The well has averaged 623 boe per day in its initial 30 days production and has produced nearly 26,000 barrels of oil equivalent to date, with a preliminary EUR of about 600,000 barrels. The average EUR of the last 5 Cline wells is now 452,000 [ph] barrels.","Also in Deadwood, a lower Wolfcamp Deadwood shale lateral was drilled 1,300 feet to a TD of 12,900 feet measured depth and tested at peak rate of over 200 barrels of oil per day and 200 Mcf per day. Additional appraisal wells are planned for the Wolfcamp and Cline shale plays in 2013, and commercialization of these shales could add hundreds of potential locations to the 560 locations already identified in the Cline shale.","We have additional -- also drilled a horizontal well in the Barnett Shale. And after a 14-stage frac, the peak rate exceeded 380 barrels of oil per day and 613 Mcf per day. In the Barnhart Wolfcamp play, Apache has drilled 13 wells, 8 producing and the remainder either in drilling or frac-ing or flow-back stages. Since March 2012, these 8 wells have produced 234,000 barrels of oil and 509 million cubic feet of gas or 319,000 boe from the upper Wolfcamp Shales only. Current Wolfcamp production is 2,150 boe per day. Two middle camp -- two middle Wolfcamp wells are currently drilling, and a Cline horizontal well on Ketchum Mountain will spud soon.","In the other Midland Basin and eastern shale properties, we have had some notable results in the Wilshire area such as the well at McElroy Ranch that tested as high as 289 barrels of oil per day and 735 mcf a day from the Spraberry through 10 [ph] intervals on a submersible pump. In the Yeso area of New Mexico, we ended the quarter running 4 vertical rigs. 27 vertical wells were spud during the third quarter and 22 wells are completed and producing.","Notable wells from the quarter include the Lee Federal #59, which averaged 168 barrels of oil per day and 403 Mcf per day during September; and the Tony Federal #39 whose 30-day well test averaged 119 barrels of oil per day and 287 Mcf per day. Our fourth rig, recently transitioned from drilling vertical wells to commencing our multiyear Shear [ph] Lake horizontal drilling program.","We continue to have good results from the Central Basin Platform where we are applying horizontal drilling to historically conventional fields and reservoirs with outstanding results. In the Three Bar shallow unit, we have tested the Wichita Albany, an interval characterized by air bed [ph] limestones and dolomite frosty zones at measured depths of 7,000 feet. Results from the first 2 wells include the 10-1H, with a 30-day average production of 848 barrels of oil per day and 465 Mcf per day, and the 105-H, with an 18-day average production of 620 barrels of oil per day and 754 Mcf per day. We plan to run one rig in the unit during the fourth quarter.","As we drill more, we learn more, and we are able to improve the efficiency of our exploration and operations activities, as evidenced by these widespread encouraging results. We continue to be excited about the abundant opportunities and growth prospects of our Permian Basin position.","In our Central region, we are also seeing excellent results in new ramp up activity across our nearly 2 million gross acres. Production was 72,300 boe per day, up 31% from the second quarter. Adjusting for acquired Cordillera production, growth was 24% quarter-over-quarter as we realized the benefits of our active oil and liquids-rich drilling program. The growth was driven by a 42% increase in oil production and a 20% increase in gas production. Our opportunities in the region continue to expand, following our May acquisition of over 312,000 net acres and subsequent 18,000 additional acres in the heart of the Anadarko Basin. During the third quarter, this region operated an average of 24 drilling rigs, 23 of which were horizontal and drilled 40 wells with 100% success. During the same period, we completed 26 new wells, for an average daily rate of 485 barrels of oil per day and 2,700 Mcf of gas per day.","We continue to work numerous plays across our acreage position. Notable highlights in the quarter include strong results in the oily Tonkawa, Marmaton and Cottage Grove, a new horizontal play we're testing on our Stiles Ranch, and other properties.","In the Tonkawa, for example, our Karen 1-25H averaged 525 barrels of oil per day at 1.8 million cubic feet gas per day for the first 30 days of production, and the Steward 1-20H averaged 654 barrels of oil per day and 758 Mcf per day.","In the Marmaton, we also had positive results, including the Standing [ph] Eagle 1-16H, which averaged 514 barrels of oil per day and 5.8 million cubic feet of gas per day and the Maddole [ph] 1-18H, which averaged 1,116 barrels of oil per day at 8.9 million cubic feet of gas per day.","The Cottage Grove also provide strong results, with the Stiles 24 68H averaging 893 barrels of oil per day and 1.2 million cubic feet of gas and the Stiles 12-1H averaging 1,652 barrels of oil per day at 1.6 million cubic feet of gas per day.","The Granite Wash continues to be a significant focus of our drilling program, and during the quarter, we tested the Weatherlee [ph] 6-1H, which averaged 672 barrels of oil per day and 5.7 million cubic feet of gas per day. In general, we were finding enough oil in the Granite Wash that remains economic despite low NGL prices.","In the Texas Panhandle, drilling success continues in the Canyon Wash on our 200 square-mile Bivins Ranch acreage. During the quarter, we completed our 9th and 10th successful wells, which tested 1,050 barrels of oil per day and 950 Mcf per day and 1,447 barrels of oil per day and 1,199 Mcf per day. This is an encouraging validation of Apache's play concept. Keep in mind, these 1,000-plus barrel a day wells are for vertical wells. To debottleneck our growing production, we completed a 9-mile pipeline in transport stranded natural gas during the quarter, thereby securing our takeaway from the area, which has grown from 0 to over 5,000 barrels of oil per day in 14 months. The line is currently selling 3.3 million cubic feet of gas per day of 1,450 BTU gas with NGL recoveries. Additionally, we added a second rig in the Bivins Ranch area.","During the third quarter, low ethane prices at Conway resulted in ethane rejections for the region. The ethane rejection was limited to the month of July and August as ethane prices at Conway dropped to record lows in early July. At that time, Conway ethane was trading at approximately at 90% discount to Mont Belvieu. In the end of the third quarter, this discount was reduced to approximately 42% to Mont Belvieu. Currently, Conway ethane is discounted 44% to Mont Belvieu.","Turning to the Gulf of Mexico Shelf. Quarterly production was down 8% to 90,000 boe per day as a result of approximately 10,000 boe per day of curtailments due to Hurricane Isaac. This was due primarily to the storm's impact on third-party facilities as Apache's infrastructure was relatively unharmed. With shut-ins behind us, we are currently running 8 rigs, 2 of which are focused on P&A work, year-to-date, we have TD-ed 21 operated wells, offsetting some of the downtime experience during the quarter with positive well results with our shelf drilling program.","For example, the Main Pass 315 well came online at 634 barrels of oil per day and Eugene Island, the 118 B#1, sidetrack penetrated 45 feet of gas and a few [ph] sand. At Ship Shoal, the 126 B well came online at 522 barrels of oil per day and 3.8 million cubic feet of gas to date. And 2 new wells at Main Pass 308 came online for a combined rate of 1,555 barrels of oil per day.","The total platform rate is currently 2,596 barrels of oil per day, but production is being curtailed due to facility restrictions. Modifications are currently being designed to remedy the situation.","We've now been awarded 60 -- 61 blocks from the June 20 federal lease sale, adding to our inventory of opportunities in the Gulf.","Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we plan to increase our rig count by 1 when a rig finishes the 7-month shipyard project. By the end of the quarter, we plan to complete the Main Pass 308 drilling program. The last location is drilling and one recompletion is remaining. Our Eugene Island 330 drilling program will also continue through the end of 2012, with 2 additional locations to be drilled.","In the deep Gulf, third quarter production was relatively flat as a full 3 months of production from our Wide Berth and Mandy fields was offset by Hurricane Isaac downtime. We anticipate bringing our Bushwood field near future as capacity is freed up from [indiscernible] depletion. This will add approximately 4,500 net boe per day to the region's production.","During the second quarter, we announced our participation in the June 20 Central Gulf of Mexico lease sale. The awards have now been completed and we received 28 blocks. During 2013, we are taking delivery of 2 rigs to begin exploring these prospects.","In our Gulf Coast Onshore region, average production was up 8% over the second quarter to 27,000 boe per day as additional takeaway capacity was installed at our Atchafalaya Bay field and production was reestablished in the Lake Paige Field. These additions, coupled with new production volumes and continued drilling success at our Chapman Ranch in South Texas and Golden Meadow Fields onshore Louisiana helped to offset production deferrals due to Hurricane Isaac.","A notable highlight from this region was the Scottsdale [ph] #1 well in South Louisiana, which tested 20.2 million cubic feet of gas per day and 199 barrels of oil per day at 47-degree API gravity oil. We plan to complete the installation of a 4-mile, 8-inch flowline connecting the well to our Atchafalaya Bay production facility before year-end.","Apache's Gulf Coast Onshore region initiated production this morning to a newly installed 12-inch pipeline connecting our Atchafalaya Bay production facility to TransCanada or ANR's 30-inch pipeline 5 miles away. We are currently ramping up production to 50 million cubic feet of gas gross per day, with plans to increase production to 75 million cubic feet of gas gross per day over the next few days. This marks the completion of Phase 1 of our Atchafalaya Bay infrastructure project. Phase 2 is anticipated to be complete during the second quarter of next year, which will bring gross production from our Atchafalaya Bay wells up to 220 million cubic feet of gas per day, an increase in current producing rates by an incremental 170 million cubic feet of gas per day. Apache has a working [ph] interest of approximately 48% to 50% in these wells.","Looking ahead, we intend to have 6 operated rigs running during the fourth quarter as we focus our efforts on oil opportunities in Southeastern Texas, Southern Louisiana and Southern Mississippi.","Heading north to Canada. Production in the third quarter was steady as the region continued to transition to more oil and liquids-rich production. Drilling has focused on several plays across our extensive acreage position such as Dunvegan, Bluesky and Sparky. Well highlights from these areas include the first 3 of 4 operated Dunvegan horizontal oil wells in the Kaybob area, with 1 well already in production. Initial oil rates range from 159 to 320 barrels of oil per day. Drilling of the fourth well and production start-up of all wells will occur in the fourth quarter.","In the liquids-rich Bluesky area, we continued our horizontal program, completing 3 wells during the quarter. Very strong results received, particularly in the third well which tested at 11.7 million cubic feet of gas per day and 600 boe per day of liquids.","Lastly, the Sparky program in the Consort area continues to play a significant role in our program. And during the quarter, we operated 3 rigs and drilled 24 wells. Oil production in Consort increased from 1,250 barrels of oil per day to 1,792 barrels of oil per day in the third quarter, of which Sparky program provided 300 barrels of oil per day, with 1\/3 of the third quarter drills tied in and proving up. Production start-up of the remaining wells will occur in the fourth quarter.","Moving outside North America in the North Sea. Third quarter production average 67,800 barrels of oil equivalent per day was down quarter-over-quarter due to turnarounds and continued challenges with ESP failures, as previously disclosed, resulting in deferrals of approximately 12,000 boe per day. All operated Forties platforms are back to full production, as are Scott and Telford. Nelson is scheduled to return to production in mid-November.","During the quarter, the region operated 4 rigs and drilled in the produced 6 gross wells with 2 further wells in progress. Well highlights for the region included Bacchus West, the second-successful horizontal development well in the Bacchus Field. The well encountered 889 feet of net pay in the Jurassic Fulmar sandstone reservoir. It was completed in late July, with initial production of 8,500 barrels of oil per day gross. Apache is the operator in the field with a 50% working interest.","The Bacchus Field commenced production in May of this year and is currently producing around 10,000 barrels of oil per day, 5,000 barrels a day net, through the subsea tie-back to Apache's Forties Alpha platform.","Looking to Forties. We also brought on 3 new wells with average IP of 1,633 barrels of oil equivalent per day. We made continued progress on the installation of the Forties Alpha Satellite platform. The jacket was installed successfully west of the Forties Alpha platform on September 8. The platform topside will be lifted into place in the second quarter of 2013, followed soon thereafter by development drilling through its 18 well slots.","We continue also to have drilling success in our Beryl field where, during the quarter, Apache's Beryl Bravo's B73-Y [ph] development well tested at 8,161 barrels of oil per day and 5.9 million cubic feet of gas per day from a Jurassic Manson [ph] reservoir containing 71 feet of net oil pay. The well began producing at the end of August. The well also encountered 245 feet of net pay in 3 additional zones that will be produced in a later date. We have a 50% interest in the well.","The U.K. Department of Energy and Climate Change announced this month the award of 11 new North Sea licenses to Apache, the highest of any operator participating in the 27th Seaward Licensing Round. These awards covered 19 full or partial blocks, 613,000 gross acres or 2,482 square kilometers. Included in these blocks is all the available acreage around our Beryl field plus 2 key licenses near Forties.","Apache also was awarded an interest in another non-operated license. The economic prospectivity of these areas was enhanced by recent improvements in the U.K. tax allowance mechanism involving small fields in high-pressure, high-temperature formations.","Looking to the fourth quarter, we plan to drill wells on Forties Charlie and Forties Echo as well as reinstating wells on Forties Bravo and Forties Delta. The Beryl Bravo platform will be down for a planned par [ph], which started 26 October, returning to full production on 22nd of November in order to perform routine maintenance.","Turning to Egypt. Our operations continued unabated. We averaged 26 rigs operating and reported quarterly averaged net production of 153,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Because of the terms of our PSC to provide for lower nets with higher oil prices, we reported a 4% decrease in the preceding quarter. On a gross basis, however, we essentially held production flat. In addition, during the quarter, we saw record turnarounds on development lease approvals after seeing delays of 9 months or more during 2011. The most recent approvals for development leases took just 34 days, a positive sign that the new leadership at petroleum ministry EGPC is finally finding its footing.","In Khalda, we had several discoveries of note this quarter, including the Samaha North 1X [ph] which drilled to a TD of 17,362 feet in the Lower Safa. The well encountered pay intervals in 4 zones, and a test is pending. The earlier discovery, Samaha 1X [ph], tested at a rate of 20.8 million cubic feet of gas per day and 913 barrel of condensate per day from the Lower Safa and 23 million cubic feet of gas per day and 1,997 barrels of condensate per day for the Upper Safa. And the Samaha East 1X [ph] tested at a rate of 28 million a day and 711 barrels of condensate for Lower Safa and 14.5 million cubic feet of gas per day and 1,110 barrels condensate for the Upper Safa.","KPC or Khalda Petroleum Company's current oilfields also saw a high level of activity. During the quarter, a total of 13 wells were drilled or are currently being drilled in these properties. In the Eunice field, 7 wells were drilled, including 3 injectors. And recent initial tests of the Unis 2 Upper Bahariya reservoir resulted in 1,800 barrels of oil per day. The Eunice field started production this year and, as of October, is already producing in excess of 5,500 barrels of oil per day gross.","Looking to Australia. We continue to make significant progress toward development of our large infrastructure projects in the region. The BHP-operated Macedon project is reported to be over 70% complete and on schedule for first gas in mid-2013, which will add approximately 45 million cubic feet of gas of net production when 2 new contracts come on in 2013 and 2014.","All contracts have been executed on schedule for our Balnaves project, with the Armada Claire FPSO currently in the shipyard undergoing refurbishment and replacement construction preparing for Balnaves 2014 [indiscernible]. Our Julimar gas development in support of the Wheatstone LNG project is progressing on schedule, with recent contract awards announced for various subsea project components. Third quarter net production was 64,000 boe per day or 3% down from the previous quarter  likely [ph] due to anticipated decline at the Van Gogh field.","Looking ahead in the fourth quarter, 2 new wells both commenced at Stag in late October, while Van Gogh and Pyrenees are forecast to continue declining slowly through the remainder of the year.","The first Stag well, the Stag 44H, came online this week and is currently producing 1,800 barrels of oil per day, adding to the Stag 45H production that came on the week before at around 1,500 barrels of oil per day.","A planned turnaround of the Yara fertilizer plant that began in late September has experienced delays to an unexpected equipment failure. It is anticipated by our partner, the operator of the plant, to be offline until late November. Offsetting these deferred volumes at Yara are recently signed commercial gas contracts for additional Reindeer and John Brookes volumes in the fourth quarter.","Finally, in Argentina, production during the quarter averaged 48,000 boe -- 48,500 boe per day, a 3% decline quarter-over-quarter. During the quarter, our total Gas Plus production averaged 111 million cubic feet of gas per day out of 214 million cubic feet of gas per day of total net production, with 98 million cubic feet of gas per day or 88% of the volume sold at Gas Plus prices which averaged $4.97 per Mcf.","In the Neuqu\u00e9n Basin, we drilled and completed successfully the NL 62 well at 2.5 million a day from the pre-Cuyo formation. The well has been approved at Gas Plus, and we are currently selling gas at $5.47 per Mcf. In total, the Neuqu\u00e9n Basin 7 wells reached TD in the third quarter under Gas Plus, and a total of 8 wells were initially completed, delivering a combined growth rate of 17.1 million cubic feet of gas per day and 1,595 barrels of oil per day, which is 4,445 barrels of oil equivalent per day.","As Steve already mentioned the encouraging initial results for our Vaca Muerta exploration program, I won't elaborate further here.","That concludes our many operational highlights. And I'll now turn it over to Tom Chambers.","Thomas P. Chambers","Thanks, Rod. And good afternoon, everyone.","As Steve and Rod mentioned, we are actively focused on our significant inventory of drilling opportunities and realizing the potential we've built through these acquisitions. Record rig counts continue to increase in our Permian and Central regions, and significant infrastructure investments in all the regions has set the groundwork for a positive momentum adding into year-end.","Underpinning this activity is our ability to generate strong consistent revenues and cash flow. For the third quarter, we reported earnings of $161 million or $0.41 per diluted share and adjusted earnings of $861 million or $2.16 per share when we adjust for certain items that affect the comparability of results.","Third quarter adjustments totaled $700 million and include a noncash property write-down in Canada, a change in tax rate on decommissioning expenditures for North Sea oil and gas facilities, a foreign currency fluctuation adjustment and some small merger acquisition and transition costs. The noncash after-tax write-down of our Canadian oil and gas properties totaled $539 million, which brings the year-to-date amount to $1.4 billion. Our Canadian regions reserves were over 77% natural gas at year-end 2011 and a decline in natural gas prices over the prior year continues to impact us under full-cost accounting rules.","The other large noncash item impacting earnings was the $118 million charge related to decommissioning facilities in the North Sea. As you'll recall, in 2011, the U.K. increased the corporate income tax rate on North Sea oil and gas profits from 50s -- 50% to 62% and at that time also proposed that the tax relief attributable to decommissioning expenditures remain at 50%. The decommissioning-related legislation was not formally enacted but was included in the finance bill introduced in 2012 and enacted in July of this year, necessitating the change in the quarter.","Production drove results in this quarter and fueled our -- fueled by our extensive drilling program. Production averaged 771,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day, a strong performance despite downtime in the Gulf of Mexico associated with Hurricane Isaac and maintenance downtime in the North Sea. Higher oil prices contributed to the total revenue of $4.1 billion for the quarter and a record $12.6 billion on a year-to-date basis. This compares to $4 billion in the previous quarter and $12.5 billion year-to-date in 2011.","Our revenues and, ultimately, our ability to maintain operating margins translates into cash from operations which totals $2.4 billion for the quarter. Cash flow from operating activities before changes in working capital was 2% higher than the previous quarter.","Year-to-date, our cash flow from operations was down only 2% over the prior year-to-date period despite lower worldwide price realizations, with natural gas and NGL prices down 16% and 27%, respectively, and oil prices up only 2%. International price realizations helped to mitigate the decline in the quarter in earnings and cash flow, with oil price realizations up 10% sequentially and 3% from the prior year quarter. Additionally, with Brent currently trading at over a $20 premium to WTI, we will continue to reap the benefits of our global oil position.","International natural gas prices were up 3% from the prior quarter and 13% from the third quarter 2011. For the past 3 quarters, we have realized over $4 per Mcf on our international gas production, a significant premium to North American prices which average well below $3 per Mcf over the same time frame when we exclude the impact of hedges.","International regions represent just over 1\/3 of our worldwide gas production. A key point I'd like to emphasize is that both international oil and gas price realizations were 20% higher than North American average realizations, a true testament to our global portfolio of balance and reach.","Our cash margins for the third quarter remained strong. At $41.54 per boe, our cash margins increased 5% from the sequential quarter but decreased almost 10% from the prior year period. Our cash costs were slightly higher than we would have liked to see this quarter, particularly lifting cost, which were primarily impacted by an increase in nonrecurring repairs and maintenance costs tied to corrosion repairs at our Grand Isle facilities and plant turnarounds in Canada and the North Sea. We also increased workover [ph] activity in nearly every region. Besides providing very good rate-of-return projects, they supported our base production.","Coupled with the continued growth in our onshore North American operations, our labor costs have increased accordingly. As production rises in the fourth quarter and into next year, our rates should fall back accordingly. Rest assured we will remain focused on optimizing our margins and managing our costs while not compromising safety.","You can find a detailed calculation of our margins, adjusted earnings and cash from operations in the financial supplement located on our website.","Turning to the balance sheet. We have continued to maintain a strong and flexible balance sheet, with a debt-to-cap ratio of 27%. We ended the quarter with $318 million in cash and a total debt of $11.6 billion.","Moving on to taxes. As I mentioned on the prior call, our earnings would be impacted this quarter by a change in U.K. tax law, which it was, and I detailed earlier in my comments. The third quarter effective tax rate of 79% was impacted by this charge in the Canadian ceiling test adjustment as well. Absent these adjustments and foreign exchange movements, our effective tax rate would have been a more typical 45%. We would expect a deferred tax percentage of approximately 20% for the year, absent these adjustments.","In closing, we had another solid quarter of production revenues and cash flow driven by our drilling program.","And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Brady.","Brady Parish","All right. Thank you, Tom. That concludes our prepared remarks. I do want to apologize to the listeners on the call if you hear any background noise. But I'll turn it over to the operator now, and we're ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Arun Jayaram with Credit Suisse.","Arun Jayaram - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Steve, we've seen some pretty interesting announcements regarding majors, including Exxon, I think, some pretty high valuations for Canadian gas acreage. I just wanted to see if you could maybe comment on some of the potential implications for Apache. Are there opportunities for you to monetize some of your acreage in places where you're not spending capital? And does this have any implications? Could you partner with Exxon regarding Kitimat where the market is concerned about?","G. Steven Farris","Two different questions. I'll take the first one, about the acreage. Interestingly -- and I think the number is correct because I asked our guys and gals in Canada. We have about 300,000 acres in that same play that just traded. And in fact, we're starting to drill some wells there at the end of this year and in the first of next year. How we actually exploit all of that acreage? We got 6.5 million acres in Canada and we just went through the same process that we've done in the Anadarko Basin and the Permian Basin in the -- in our Canadian region in terms of resource potential, and we're going to be rolling that out here in the coming months. But the potential for liquids and liquids-rich gas in Canada are actually much stronger than I thought they were. In terms of partnering with Exxon, I can't comment on that. But despite some of the things you hear in the press, we're -- Kitimat is still going forward, and we have -- we're very positive about it.","Arun Jayaram - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, I'll leave it at that. Obviously, Steve, this year, you've had some production disruptions. It sounds like those are in the rearview mirror. How comfortable are you, Steve, with your 6% to 9% target for 2013? And I just wanted to also see if we could get a little bit more color on the next couple of quarters for the North Sea given -- with the ESP issues back online, things like that. So some more color on the North Sea.","G. Steven Farris","Yes. In terms of -- there's nothing -- honestly, if you -- and I -- this is an excuse and I don't like to give excuses, but if you were to adjust our production, which you can't do because we didn't get the cash and we didn't get the production, but if you were to adjust it, we would have been right on our -- for the hurricane, which you can't do a damn thing about, and the events in the North Sea would be right on our production forecast. And I know that sounds like an excuse, but as we move to the drillbit, those kind of things, we've got to get over. We've got to get past those kind of things. So far, I will tell you, from an outlook for the fourth quarter, we're very positive about it. And there's nothing changed with respect to our forecast for 2013, 6% to 9%. I mean, I think we have the inventory and we have the asset base in order to do that.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Bob Brackett with Bernstein Research.","Bob Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","A question on Beryl. If anybody knows what the value of Beryl is, it's you folks. You saw Shell take out Hess' interest. What's the sense there? Why didn't you either match or beat the bid? And is that a sign that you got too many things to do and you don't want to do more bolt-on acquisitions?","G. Steven Farris","I really can't comment on that at the present time.","Bob Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay, I'll try again, moving to a different country. Can you -- a bit more color on the Vaca Muerta then?","G. Steven Farris","Yes, I will. We're a -- it's a little early to give rates. I will tell you we were pleasantly surprised by the initial rates that we got out of that well. We've been -- we've had it on now almost a month. I will tell you, it's still making 300 barrels a day. And for a well that's been frac-ed 7 times in only 1,900 feet of lateral, it's -- we're very satisfied with it.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I -- a couple for me, please, if I may. Steve, it's obviously pretty nice to start seeing the momentum picking up in the Lower 48. Can you tell us where you see the rig count going in terms of relative capital allocation between, I guess, international and U.S., particular, Lower 48 in particular, 63 [ph] now. Where do you think that tops out? Or are you at a level now where you think you're -- you've got enough to say grace over?","G. Steven Farris","Well, I think -- as I said in my prepared remarks, I think you're going to see that momentum build. Certainly, from an opportunity standpoint, we have the opportunity to -- and I'm going to be redundant. But if you remember in 2010, we spent $500 million in the Permian, then we went to about $1 billion. This year, we're going to spend a little over $2 billion, and in next year, we're going to spend more than that. We'll probably run 40 rigs next year in the Permian. And the Anadarko Basin, our results there, actually better than we expected. So we're going to -- you're going to see an increase in the Anadarko Basin also, which speaks to the allocation of capital. Certainly, we haven't allocated our capital for 2013 yet. We're going to do that in December. But it's certainly -- we're going to put it into best projects, wherever those projects are.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And then Steve, this might be a dumb question as a follow-up, but I'm going to have a go, anyway. Your stock prices, when you did the BP deal last time, your share equity was above where the share price is now. You obviously -- you've done Analyst Day, you've given us insight to everything that's going on, and you spent a lot of money buying assets. As you say, you've got a very deep portfolio. One could argue that you could buy back reserves cheaper by buying back your own stock. I'm just curious as to how that plays into how you're thinking about trying to address some of the recent performance in the share price which seems to contrast with the tremendous portfolio you've built up.","G. Steven Farris","Yes, and I -- we've had this discussion before. I think, in terms of the rates that we're getting for the investment dollars that we have in our portfolio -- it's -- other than perception, would be rates of return, which would be cost of capital to buying our stock back. We're not -- at the present time, we're not considering diverting capital from the base program to buy our stock back.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So what do you think it is the market is missing here? Because I'm just really going to take your perspective as to how patient you're going to be on this.","G. Steven Farris","Well, I -- the -- I -- obviously, we're disappointed that we had the down time. I'm optimistic that we'll have a good quarter in the fourth quarter and I think we got to continue to post quarters.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Pearce Hammond with Simmons & Company.","Pearce W. Hammond - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","I was just curious, just thinking broadly about 2013 CapEx spending. Is it roughly fair to think, in terms of it mirroring the growth in cash flow year-over-year, that it might move up in lockstep with that?","G. Steven Farris","Yes, we're going to -- we have the opportunity base. It's -- we're going to spend our cash flow in the E&P business.","Pearce W. Hammond - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","And then a second question is to follow up if you can kind of broadly compare and contrast the economics and opportunities of LNG projects in Australia versus those in Canada.","G. Steven Farris","Well, for different reasons, they're very similar, actually. I mean, obviously -- let's assume that the pricing of the LNG is exactly the same in Australia versus they are in Canada. I will tell you a -- the add-ons of trains in Canada would be much more lucrative than they would be in Australia just because of the cost. So that project really is a long-term project. And there's tremendous amount of gas in the United States and\/or in British Columbia right now.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of John Freeman with Freeman James (sic) [Raymond James].","John Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","I didn't know that I took over the company. The -- on the North Sea, the 12,000 that was offline, the -- specifically just to the ongoing pump issues, how much of the 12,000 was related to just the pump issues?","Rodney J. Eichler","It's only about 2,000 or 3,000 barrels of oil per day specifically attributed to the pumps. We had 9 ESPs that were off and those are being cycled into the drilling, scheduled to be replaced, along with new drills that we do that -- based on economics so that -- we haven't got all of those 9 replaced yet, but they probably will be by the -- in the second quarter of 2013.","G. Steven Farris","But the real down -- production off was the -- was our turnaround at Alpha.","John Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Right. And I think you all mentioned that Nelson returns in November. How much of a production impact is that?","Rodney J. Eichler","That's 1,900 barrels of oil a day net. And that's been down for about almost 100 days.","John Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then last question for me, it's still on the North Sea. Did the 3D seismic killer [ph] you're shooting on Beryl, did that get completed last month?","G. Steven Farris","It's only partially completed. We have about -- 30% of it was acquired in the current shooting weather window this last summer. The balance of it we  acquire in 2013.","G. Steven Farris","But the 40% is we're currently processing.","Rodney J. Eichler","Right.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of John Herrlin with Societe Generale.","John P. Herrlin - Societe Generale Cross Asset Research","Just some quick ones for me. With Suriname, will you shoot the seismic and then bring someone out to promote [ph] ?","G. Steven Farris","Yes, well, let me put it this way. We're not that -- we wouldn't go drill that well 100%. And we -- and -- but frankly, John, we've already had a lot of interest. That's a very good block, frankly.","John P. Herrlin - Societe Generale Cross Asset Research","Yes, I would assume so. Yes, Atlantic margin turbidites are in. What about services cost, Steve? We're seeing -- or hearing on a lot of the other conference calls that prices for rigs and frac-ing are coming down. What are you seeing?","G. Steven Farris","Oh yes, they're -- actually, frac-ing costs came down really in the third quarter in a big way, and you're starting to see rigs come down. If you look at the rig count in the Permian Basin over the last 2 months, I mean we're -- it's the historic or the continuous ebb and flow of prices, service costs and capital. And what you're seeing right now is we were on the back end of all those service costs going up, we're on the front end of it now because we -- I think they'll continue to go down.","John P. Herrlin - Societe Generale Cross Asset Research","Okay. Last one for me. Would you consider ever doing not a stock buyback but a more competitive common stock dividend? You've got a great balance sheet, you're very diversified and you're suffering benign neglect.","G. Steven Farris","I -- we did that many years ago, actually. And I mean, honestly, we consider pretty much all avenues of what -- how to reward our shareholders, frankly, from a cash dividend to a stock dividend to stock buybacks. And frankly, when you look at our portfolio, all we have to do now is deliver honestly. Our -- as I told our planning meeting group, we have 280 people in Dallas and we have nobody to look at but ourselves. We just need to perform because we've got the asset base and we've got the people, so...","John P. Herrlin - Societe Generale Cross Asset Research","Okay, last one for me. Steve, would Mississippi Lime be a good water disposal access?","G. Steven Farris","I'm sorry. What, John?","John P. Herrlin - Societe Generale Cross Asset Research","Would the Mississippi Lime be a good water disposal access, wells being wells.","G. Steven Farris","Yes, you're going to -- I mean, you're going to get -- yes, it would. I mean, that -- if you've looked at not just us but all the operators out there, that's a good oil play, but you've got to move a lot of water, which we anticipated.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Matt Portillo with Tudor, Pickering, Holt.","Matthew Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Just 2 quick questions for me. Firstly on the CapEx side. Looking at Q3, it looks like the run rate CapEx spend is about $2.7 billion for drilling and then also gathering. Is that a reasonable rate that we should think about going forward? And then as we head into 2013, kind of can you talk a little bit about the rig count that you're currently employing by basin and then -- and how that may change over time? I think you mentioned the Permian will increase to about 50% horizontal rig. So I'm just trying to get a sense of how those rigs are shifting around.","G. Steven Farris","I think we've got 34 rigs. I mean, I might be off one, but I think we have 34 rigs in the Permian. We've got 24 or 25 in the Anadarko Basin. I think we're up to 7 in Canada and we've got 8 offshore Gulf of Mexico. That's not exact, but that's pretty close.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Can you refresh us on Australia, on production trajectory and your latest thoughts on Van Gogh platform remediation and just what we should expect production trajectory-wise over the next 4 to 7 quarters?","G. Steven Farris","Yes. I mean, Van Gogh has been very good. It's paid out 9 months. We're still producing, I think, about 16,000, 17,000 barrels a day there. We have a turnaround on our FPSO coming in about the middle of -- I mean, middle of 2013. And the real reason that's important is we're going to -- when we bring it back. In the meantime, we're going to be drilling Coniston wells, which is a sister field to the north of Van Gogh that will start ramping up our oil production going through that FPSO. But frankly, we've seen the peaks of the production at both Van Gogh and Pyrenees. And the way we replace that is we've got Balnaves, which is about a 20-million-barrel oil field we should have on broad win [ph] 2014.","Thomas P. Chambers","2014.","G. Steven Farris","2014. We also got Macedon, which is gas, but it's not like North American gas. It is -- that contract is north of $7. So we've got Macedon coming on in the third quarter of 2013. So we've got -- we're going to see a little dip in Australia and then we're going to see a big ramp-up again.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And I guess, when we think about that ramp-up on the oil side, does that ramp-up just kind of get back to the levels that you've been producing, which has been relatively consistent for this year in the 28,000 to 30,000 barrels a day range? Or does it step up beyond that?","G. Steven Farris","Well, I don't have that. I can't answer that question. I just -- and it's not that I wouldn't, I just don't have it in front of me. I don't know what our profile looks like.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And lastly, in Egypt. Can you just talk to any discussions with the government you've had since your last update? And any thoughts on royalty rates and overall government take?","G. Steven Farris","Yes, I had. And in fact, both Rod and I spent a week in September in Egypt. I happen to be the Head of the U.S.-Egyptian Business Council. And we had 48 U.S. companies there,  some of the largest companies in the world. We met with the president, the prime minister. I think we had government officials with us from the U.S. Quite frankly, we've been very pleased and very positive about not only that trip but our relationship with the government. Rod alluded to that we have a new Petroleum Minister, who is, frankly, a breath of fresh air. We've got more things done in the last 90 days than we got done in the last 2 years in terms of development leases approved, issues that we needed to get solved, a new gas contract at Hydra, so -- and honestly, I'm very positive about their direction, at least for our sector.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question will come from the line of Eliot Javanmardi with Capital One Southcoast.","Eliot Javanmardi - Capital One Southcoast, Inc., Research Division","Yes, guys, just wanted to see if you could speak to the increase in LOE for this quarter. I noticed a significant amount of it was related to repair and maintenance, and just wanted to see if that would essentially roll off for next quarter and come back down?","Thomas P. Chambers","That will roll off next quarter. We had -- we talked about the Grand Isle 43 corrosion issue that we had. That production was off in the second quarter. That cost hit us in the third quarter, that's a onetime cost. And then we had the North Sea tire cost and some of the Canada SemCAMS plant downtime cost, turnaround costs in there as well. So those are all one-period type costs. So you should see that coming down. And with the production back up, the per boe should drop as well.","Eliot Javanmardi - Capital One Southcoast, Inc., Research Division","Very good. And also then in regards to exploration in Gulf of Mexico, what wells could we see just expecting to come forward then -- as far as results are concerned? Is there any left this year? Or is it in 2013? Do you have some 1Q '13?","G. Steven Farris","No, it's going to be -- it'll be 2013. We don't pick up our rate until, I think, the first quarter of 2013 for our drilling, our first prospects.","Rodney J. Eichler","In the deepwater.","G. Steven Farris","In the deepwater. We have a well going right now at Heidelberg, a development well by Anadarko -- I'm sorry, Lucius, that Anadarko is drilling, but that's development drilling. So you won't see any real impact from our drilling activity in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico until next year. And we're actively drilling shelf well, Gulf of Mexico shelf wells as we speak.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of David Tameron with Wells Fargo.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Back to the Permian Basin. It -- kind of the Midland, parts of the [ph], I guess I'll call it the Deadwood area. What would you characterize as your best part of the basin?","G. Steven Farris","Well, I'll tell you, it's hard to tell. I mean, we thought the stuff we were doing down in the -- hang on one second. I've got -- now he's going to give me a chart here. Well, actually the best results we've had so far in the individual wells is the Wolfcamp Shale, but I don't know that, if you caught -- if we drilled a well on the Central Basin platform in the Wichita Albany, those wells came on 900 barrels a day, still making about 8 -- over 600 barrels a day, both of them. And we have about 23 locations to drill in there. So the one thing I would say about the Permian Basin and the reason we started getting in there in 1991 and made a number of acquisitions before we made BP is exactly where we are today: We've got a tremendous acreage position. It is the oiliest place in North America, oiliest place in the world outside of Russia. So it has a lot potential for horizontal drilling. And I think Rod mentioned we're going from -- I don't -- we're going to drill 123 wells this year horizontal. Next year, we're -- it's going to be more like half of our wells. We're just on the cusp. Not just us, everybody is, in terms of understanding the Permian Basin and the kind of oil that's out there.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then a follow-up. You guys talked about -- at the Analyst Day talked about some similar basin, drilling you're doing, it was 15 to 20 wells you're going to drill out there. Any comment -- and maybe I missed it in the prepared remarks, but any comment on kind of overall the results from that program and what you're seeing over there?","Rodney J. Eichler","As I said in my prepared remarks, in the Delaware, the Yeso, in particularly [indiscernible] is our principal area outside the Central Basin Platform in the Midland Basin. The program there has been vertical up to this point, but will be turning horizontal soon. It certainly met our expectations per drill.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay, okay. So you're just -- you got nothing from the Avalon and Bone Spring.","Rodney J. Eichler","No, it's -- the main part of the Delaware is the Bone Spring for you. It's a modest part of our portfolio compared to the other drilling we've been doing out in the basin.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Charles Meade with Johnson Rice.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division","I was curious, is there an update you can share with us on the Mbawa well offshore Kenya and, if you have any results or indication there, what the implications might be for the [indiscernible]?","G. Steven Farris","I think we've talked about it at the last conference, I mean, call. But we found gas. It had a real chance of finding gas. We thought we'd find an oil leg. We drilled on big structure, we found some gas. That's not what we were looking for. We're now reevaluating that block. We got 1 million acres there. So we're reevaluating that block. I happened to see we're too low, just drilled another oil well onshore Kenya. But we're -- this -- what we were looking for is not in the same horizon that Tullow is drilling onshore. And I think they're in the Cretaceous.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division","My apologies if I missed that. And the follow-up question, going back to the Permian Basin. Are -- you mentioned there are -- you guys mentioned in your prepared remarks some good Cline results, I thought. And I wondered if you could offer your thoughts on the relevant maturity and attractiveness of the Cline horizontal play versus the Wolfcamp horizontal play.","G. Steven Farris","I think Rod pointed out that well is making 600 barrels a day. So it tested -- first 30 days, I think, 600 barrels a day. And I -- and if you look at our acreage position and what we showed at the resource potential and what we're looking at now, I mean, it's different. It's bigger because what we found is just -- we drilled the Barnett Shale well in the Deadwood area. We didn't drill it that far horizontal, it's made 300 barrels a day. I'll go back to my statement from a question earlier, and that is, we -- as an industry, we haven't yet fully evaluated the most important plays in the Permian Basins. And I'll go back to the Wichita Albany. I mean, I'm shocked that the Wichita Albany is making 900 barrels a day.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Mario Barraza with Tuohy Brothers.","Mario Barraza - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Just had a question more on the -- was it the cottage? I'm sorry.","G. Steven Farris","Cottage Grove? Hello?","Mario Barraza - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","The activity for this level in the Granite Wash?","G. Steven Farris","Well, we drilled a couple of Cottage Grove wells. Actually, more than that, I think we drilled 4. It's a very good play. The Anadarko Basin has sands from the Tonkawa all the way down to the Atoka, and as you get deeper, it gets gassier. But that's another area that we've just scratched the surface as an industry and finding things, like Hogshooter. I mean, we go down there and drill a couple of Hogshooter wells and 2 or 3 of them make 4,000 barrels a day. And I can't emphasize enough, you want to be in basins that have a lot of thickness and a lot of hydrocarbons, and we're in 2 of the best. And I will tell you, one of these days, the western sedimentary basin of Canada is going to look like this. They're just way -- they're a lot further back in terms of their learning curve and exploiting it.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Leo Mariani with RBC Capital Markets.","Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Wanted to dig into each of the [indiscernible] a little bit more here. So if I'm looking at  the numbers right, your gross oil production on a gross basis in Egypt has kind of dropped for it looks like the past 4 quarters here. That had been an area that you had grown for years and years and it's kind of reversed trend. Has that been kind of a slowdown with the transition government you talked about? Maybe getting more traction here with the new energy minister? How should we expect gross Egyptian oil production to sort of change gears [ph] again into '13?","G. Steven Farris","Yes, and we're going to have to put on a little presentation. It's -- or maybe put something out. Actually, our gross production, gross operated production in Egypt is higher than it was at the beginning of the year. And our gross operated gas is higher than it was. What happens is, is that you get -- because of the way that the concession agreement works, if -- the price of crude oil has an awful lot to do with what you report for net production. So we need to start putting out our gross production and our net production because it's -- Egypt is still very good and going to continue to be good. And we're going to continue to see bumps in our net production based on oil prices.","Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay, I guess I was looking at some of those numbers in your supplement, and I guess maybe I was looking at them wrong. But I saw you did 211,000 gross barrels a day this quarter. And I saw like...","Rodney J. Eichler","No, that\u2019s about right. And what do we do in the quarter before, 216?","Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I saw 215 in the first quarter of '12 and it was, like, 220 in the third quarter of '11. So it's kind of been slowly coming down. So I wasn't sure if that was sort of a Permian issue or bottlenecks or you guys just weren't...","G. Steven Farris","Yes, there's -- some of that is. I will tell you. Yes, we had a plant turnaround at Terric [ph] for the third quarter.","Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay, got you. And you mentioned getting good traction in last 90 days with the new Petroleum Minister over there. I guess, do you expect that to really kind of change things as we get into 2013 in Egypt for you?","G. Steven Farris","Right. I -- we've got 26 rigs running. We -- it still gives us the highest rate of return in the company. And I don't -- that's probably what we're going to run all of next year.","Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. I guess, looking at your gas production in Egypt, the other thing I noticed was that it looked like your net take in the third quarter was a fair bit lower, I'm seeing about 36% of the gas versus the gross. And previously, it had always kind of been 40% or higher. Is there anything in particular that happened in the third quarter? Should we expect it to stay at that kind of a 36% level going forward, or is that going to rebound? How should we think about that?","Rodney J. Eichler","There's been no material change in the gross gas production, except for the turnaround we just mentioned. Some of this is PSC related and which Steve just mentioned. But I should point out that the value of the gas, all that gas we produce in Egypt, is only about 18% on a revenue basis compared to the value of the oil. So all the value in Egypt is coming from the oil and condensate we produce.","Operator","Our final question will come from the line of Robert Christensen with Buckingham Research.","Robert L. Christensen - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","A little bit more on the Williston Basin, if you might. Just you've got, I think, 3 permits, maybe 1 well drilled and testing. And just a little more color on that, that's question one. Question two, I've heard you've been actively leasing up there even more land. And question three, have there been any other well results by other companies that have been encouraging to you?","G. Steven Farris","We are in the process, actually, of frac-ing our first well up there and we're drilling our second well. I think, yesterday, we were at 2,700 feet. So we're going to have 2 wells down by the end of the year. We're not picking up big amounts of acreage before filling into the land block that we've put together, which is -- I think is about 300,000 acres or so. And there have been some other operators, it's not right next door, that have announced pretty good results. I mean, the play is moving that way, so hopefully, it moves all our way. We're going to find out here pretty quick.","Operator","I would now turn the conference back over to Brady Parish for any closing remarks.","Brady Parish","We just wanted to thank everybody for participating today.

Speakers making prepared remarks on today's call will be Apache's CEO and President, John Christmann, and CFO, Steve Riney. Also joining us in the room is Tim Sullivan, Executive Vice President of Operations.","In conjunction with this morning's press release, I hope you've had the opportunity to review our quarterly earnings supplement, which summarizes key financial and operational data for the fourth quarter and full year 2015, along with details regarding our 2016 production and capital spending outlook. We have revised and streamlined the structure and content of our earnings supplement and believe you will find it more useful.","Also, please note that we've changed our capital expenditure guidance convention to reflect a more comprehensive picture of our spending. Specifically, the 2016 capital spending range we provided in this morning's press release includes all exploration, development, gathering, transportation and processing expenditures.","It also includes budgeted leasehold acquisition costs and capitalized interest and capitalized G&A. The only element of our 2016 program that our guidance will continue to exclude is capital attributable to our minority interest partner in Egypt.

However, a number of factors could cause actual results to materially differ from what we discuss today. A full disclaimer is located with the supplemental data on our website.","And I would now like to turn the call over to John.","John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Think you, Gary. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. I'd like to begin with a recap of the significant progress Apache made in 2015. I will then provide some highlights from our fourth quarter and full year results and conclude with some specific thoughts on what to expect for 2016.","Apache underwent a significant transition in 2015. While the external environment remains challenging, we entered 2016 better positioned to operate and thrive in a lower-for-longer commodity price environment.","In addition to completing an extensive refocusing of the portfolio, we have taken other decisive actions to position Apache for an extended low price environment, which included aligning our capital spending with cash flows, attacking the cost structure, continuing to high-grade and build an inventory of attractive opportunities that will deliver strong returns under a low oil price environment, and strengthening our financial position and liquidity.","While we have made tremendous progress, we are not yet finished with these efforts. We streamlined our portfolio, exiting Argentina, Australia, much of the Gulf of Mexico and two world scale LNG projects. We are now focused on three principal areas, a substantial onshore North American acreage position with an abundant inventory of high-value growth opportunities, anchored by our extensive Permian footprint, and sustainable free cash flow generators in our higher cash margin North Sea and Egypt businesses, each with many years of low risk drilling opportunities and significant exploration potential still ahead.","In the current low oil price environment, our more conventional international assets continue to generate strong cash flows and better rates of return than many of our operations in North America. In the North Sea, we are uniquely positioned. We have two large-scale hydrocarbon accumulations in Forties and Beryl, available high-quality platform and pipeline infrastructure and per unit cash operating costs that are one-half the industry average. These advantages make tiebacks to existing infrastructure very economic even at current oil prices.","In Egypt, we benefit from the cost recovery aspect of our production-sharing contracts such that they help to mitigate the impact of declining oil prices on our cash flows. Our international positions clearly differentiate our portfolio, play to Apache's long-standing strengths and remain economically attractive in this low oil price environment.","A year ago, Apache took more decisive action than many of our peers and reduced activity levels in pursuit of cash flow neutrality. We anticipated the lower-for-longer oil price scenario and recognized the importance of protecting value through more disciplined investment. Accordingly, we reduced capital by more than 60% in 2015 from 2014 levels and focused on bringing cost into alignment with the current oil price environment.","Specifically, this time last year on our fourth quarter 2014 conference call, I stated that \"We would consider using our balance sheet only to capitalize on lower acreage cost and other potential opportunities that may occur, rather than to drill wells and chase production in a depressed and volatile oil price environment\". We stuck to that view throughout 2015 and continue to do so today one year later. At the same time, we instituted an even more rigorous capital allocation process through which we continually monitor the delivery of the capital programs and reallocate capital as value maximization demands.","Motivated by the deteriorating oil price environment and a goal to achieve cash flow neutrality, we attacked our cost structure in 2015 with a thorough review of G&A, LOE and capital costs. Specifically, we rationalized our entire organizational structure, eliminating layers of management and consolidating office locations. And we reduced staffing levels to more closely align with forward-looking activity levels.","As a result, today, our run rate gross G&A costs are more than 30% below where they were in the fourth quarter of 2014, and we're a much more streamlined and efficient organization. Our lease operating costs, on a per boe basis, were down approximately 10% year-over-year when excluding the tax barrel impact of our Egyptian impairment charges. Our lease operating costs, on a per boe basis, were down approximately 10% year over year when excluding the tax barrel impact of our Egyptian impairment charges.","Our average drilled and completed well costs in North America were down 35% from fourth quarter of 2014 to fourth quarter of 2015. Furthermore, we strengthened our financial position and liquidity in 2015. A portion of our asset divestment proceeds were used to reduce debt by $2.5 billion and to build our cash balance.","Apache began 2016 with approximately $5 billion of liquidity, including nearly $1.5 billion in cash. We value this position highly and we'll be very thoughtful in this price environment as to when and how we utilize it.","One of our primary operational objectives both last year and in 2016 is to assess, refine, optimize and add to our extensive inventory of captured drilling locations in North America in the context of lower-for-longer oil prices. This is a comprehensive process that involves acreage delineation, wellbore redesign, completion optimization, spacing and landing zone tests, acreage swaps, purchases and sales and the creation of full field development plans.","In addition to these activities, extensive science and testing continues on our new play concepts which could lead to significant growth opportunities down the road. The goal of this work is to fully define and prioritize the highest rate of return, highest growth and most efficient North American opportunities to leverage in a better investment environment.","Apache is now very well positioned for whatever lies ahead. We are living within our means and anticipate being cash flow neutral in 2016 and beyond, until such time that the price environment warrants higher investment levels. We have a very competitive cost structure and continue to drive overhead, LOE and capital costs lower. We are building high-quality drilling and exploratory inventory for the future. We have the financial strength and liquidity to sustain us through a prolonged period of potentially lower oil prices and to propel us into a better investment environment.","Our sound decisions and decisive actions in 2015 leave us much better positioned today. We have improved our financial position without raising equity and without reducing or eliminating the dividend. At this time, we plan to be cash flow neutral in 2016 and to invest primarily to enhance our long-term prospects for future growth. Maintaining strong credit quality through disciplined capital allocation is a prudent approach in this environment, thus we re targeting either unchanged or lower net debt levels by the end of this year.","Now I'd like to turn to the fourth quarter and full year 2015 results. We are very pleased with our delivery around items that were within our control. We exceeded our production goals across all of our regions in both the fourth quarter and for the full year 2015. We accomplished this on a capital program of $3.6 billion, which was at the low-end of the original guidance range we established on our earnings call a year ago.","During the fourth quarter, North America Onshore production averaged 308,000 boes per day, which, as expected, was a sequential increase from the third quarter production of 306,000 boes per day. The increase was primarily due to the timing of completions and solid well performance.","In the Permian Basin, despite some fairly significant weather downtime in December, our fourth quarter production achieved an all-time quarterly high of 174,000 boes per day, up 2% sequentially from the third quarter. Growth was driven by the Delaware Basin, where we completed 13 new wells, primarily targeting the Bone Springs formation at Pecos Bend.","In the Midland Basin, Central Basin Platform and Northwest Shelf, we completed 61 new wells and delivered very good results in the Wildfire area, with our first three lower Spraberry tests as well as three strong wells in the Wolfcamp on our June Tippett pad. We also drilled some excellent wells on the Northwest Shelf at our prolific Cedar Lake Yeso play. Please refer to our quarterly earnings supplement for details on some of these key wells.","As we look ahead to 2016, our Permian rig count will fall from 10 at the beginning of January to four by mid-year. Permian well completions are expected to be down 75% year-over-year. These actions clearly demonstrate that we are willing to let our Permian production decline until we are in a better investment environment.","Turning to the North Sea, volumes were approximately 72,000 boes per day in the fourth quarter, a 2% decline sequentially from third quarter production levels. We brought three new development wells online during the fourth quarter at very good rates, but these were offset by a maintenance turnaround at the Beryl Bravo platform.","2015 was an excellent year for Apache with the drill bit in the North Sea. We brought online 19 new development wells with an average drilling success rate of 83%. We also confirmed three significant new exploratory successes with the previously disclosed Callater or K, Corona and Seagull discoveries, which we expect will contribute very material reserve and production adds in the coming years. In 2016, we are significantly curtailing our North Sea development drilling program and plan to employ no platform rigs during the second half of the year. As a result, North Sea production will decline slightly in 2016 compared to 2015 production of just over 71,000 boes per day.","In Egypt, gross production declined roughly 3% sequentially from the third quarter. Total liquids volumes declined 2%, while downtime and bottlenecks at certain gas processing facilities reduced our natural gas volumes by 5%. On a net basis, excluding Sinopec's minority interest and the effect of tax barrels, production actually increased 5% sequentially to 102,000 boes per day. This a function of the significant oil price decline from third quarter to fourth quarter, which resulted in Apache receiving more cost-recovery barrels under our production-sharing contract agreements.","The key driver in Egypt during 2015 was the tremendous success of our drilling program and production ramp-up at Ptah and Berenice. As of year-end, we had 12 wells producing in these prolific low GOR oilfields. Since November 2014, Ptah and Berenice have produced more than 8 million barrels of oil. In 2016, we plan to stabilize gross production from these fields near 30,000 boes per day. Overall, our gross production volumes are expected to decline in Egypt this year. However, net volumes should increase as falling oil prices drive an increase in cost recovery barrels per our PSCs.","On the cost side, I noted earlier that our average North American Onshore well costs were down approximately 35% from a year ago. We are continuously improving on this front and continue to see significant well cost decreases since the beginning of the year.","Some of the key plays where we are seeing exceptionally low drilling and completion costs include: the Delaware Basin, where we have visibility to Bone Springs and Wolfcamp wells of approximately $4.5 million; the Midland Basin, where horizontal Wolfcamp and lower Spraberry wells are projected to be drilled and completed for less than $4 million; the horizontal Yeso play on the Northwest Shelf in the Permian, where our well costs are trending below $2.3 million; and the Woodford\/SCOOP, where our latest pacesetter was drilled and completed for only $7.5 million.","In 2015, we reinvigorated Apache's culture of cost and returns discipline. While we have made great progress on costs, they are not yet fully aligned with the current price environment. Further reductions are planned for 2016 and it is imperative that we remain relentless in our efforts to drive costs down further.","To achieve this, we will foster innovation and utilize technology that redefines the cost structure of both Apache and the industry. The key takeaway is that these are not just belt-tightening efforts in response to price weakness. Apache is implementing structural changes that will continue to accrue to our bottom line, regardless of where oil prices and service costs go in the future.","To that end, we believe that approximately one-half of the well cost reductions achieved over the past year are permanent, while the other half will fluctuate with future service cost changes. Regardless, Apache will always focus intently on controlling what we can control and remaining highly disciplined through the cycle.","As we turn our focus to 2016, strip oil prices are now roughly 30% to 35% below where they were a year ago. This underscores the importance of continuing to foster a new mindset and approach to capital allocation and managing our cost structure. Similar to our approach in 2015, we are using a conservative price deck for 2016 budgeting that reduces the risk of inadvertently putting ourselves in the position of a material outspend and helps to sustain our credit quality.","Our capital allocation process for 2016 is built around four key themes: living within our means and achieving cash flow neutrality for the year at $35 oil, focusing capital spending on protecting the asset base and optimizing and building inventory, maintaining a relentless focus on both capital costs and operational expenses and remaining flexible, opportunistic and ready to react as conditions change. With this in mind, we announced in this morning's press release a 2016 capital budget of $1.4 billion to $1.8 billion, the midpoint of which represents over a 60% decrease from 2015 and over an 80% decrease from 2014 levels.","In our North American Onshore portfolio, Apache is fortunate to have the vast majority of our high-value leasehold already held by production and only four rigs under longer-term higher day rate contracts. As a result, our obligation spending is relatively limited this year. At $35 oil, we do not believe spending on development wells and attempting to maintain production levels is a prudent or economic use of our precious capital dollars. We would rather leave those barrels in the ground and come back to them in a higher price environment or as drilling and completion costs become more aligned with oil prices.","The majority of our capital spending in these onshore regions will focus on strategic testing and delineating our vast acreage position, such that we optimize our growth potential and efficiencies when it is appropriate to put more rigs back into the field. In light of these considerations, our capital allocation to North American Onshore plays is approximately $700 million or 45% of our total capital budget. At this level of investment, we anticipate a pro forma production decline of 12% to 15% in North America Onshore compared to 2015.","Our decision to reduce North American Onshore investment by more than 70% and to allow production to decline in 2016 is simply due to our desire to preserve our financial position in the current investment environment. It is not indicative of our asset depth or quality. We are confident that our North American asset base can withstand this reduction in investment without any deterioration of the future opportunity set or impact our ability to arrest the decline and begin to grow again at the appropriate time in the future.","To provide some context around the sustainability of our onshore North American asset base, we estimate that, in the current price environment, it would require a spending level of approximately $1.6 billion or an incremental $900 million of capital above our planned 2016 program in order to hold North America Onshore flat with the 2015 average of 309,000 boes per day. This $900 million dollars of incremental capital is roughly equivalent to the amount of incremental cash flow Apache generates annually with a $10 per barrel increase in oil prices.","This implies, with an average oil price of $45 per barrel, Apache's North American production base could be held flat with 2015 levels. At current drilling and completion costs, this maintenance spend would equate to an incremental annual average program of approximately 20 rigs in North America.","I mentioned earlier that Apache is looking for a better investment environment before we materially increase our capital program, let alone, consider outspending cash flow on an annual basis. We have the luxury of waiting for an environment in which oil prices and service costs are fully synchronized such that fully burdened and full-cycle economics in our North American drilling programs achieve double-digit rates of return. It is not enough to deliver the 15% to 30% unburdened wellhead returns at $35 per barrel oil that are routinely quoted in industry presentations.","At Apache, we have elevated our standard for investment of shareholders' capital. Our drilling programs must deliver full-cycle fully burdened rates of return in the mid-to-high double-digits in order to deliver an acceptable return on capital employed for the shareholder. That said, we are thoroughly assessing our entire North American footprint and will be prepared to put rig lines back into each of the Pecos Bend, Evergreen and Waha areas of the Delaware Basin and our high rate of return horizontal Yeso play in the Northwest Shelf. We could add several incremental rigs in our Midland Basin, Wolfcamp and lower Spraberry plays, where we have 200,000-plus net acres in four core counties.","Our Woodford\/SCOOP position will support an incremental drilling program for several years to come, and we have numerous high-volume multi-well development pad locations ready to go in the Duvernay and Montney in Canada. When oil prices rally further, our Eagle Ford and Canyon Lime will come back into play and contribute to North American growth.","On the international side, Egypt and the North Sea continue to deliver projects with solid rates of return and strong net present values. Because both are economically advantaged under our assumed $35 oil price, we are allocating approximately $800 million or 50% of our 2016 capital budget to these regions. We project pro forma production from our international and offshore regions this year will be relatively flat compared to 2015.","The budget I just described is based on specific oil price and service cost assumptions. If oil prices recover or if average well costs decline such that our cash flow is higher than we have budgeted, we anticipate directing the majority of the incremental dollars to onshore North America. This could in turn mitigate a portion of the decline implied by our guidance.","Before I conclude, I would like to outline some of Apache's potential future growth drivers as we look beyond 2016. With higher oil prices and access to more internally generated cash flow, our North American Onshore production will stabilize and return to growth. This growth will come from lower cost wells that generate better returns than Apache's historical North American programs.","High-graded plays with years of running room across our 3.3 million gross legacy acres in the Permian will drive growth from the Bone Springs, Wolfcamp, lower Spraberry, Yeso and other formations. This would be supplemented by the Woodford\/SCOOP, Montney and Duvernay post 2016. Additionally, we have acquired a substantial amount of relatively low cost acreage since early 2015 that could be incremental to the growth potential that resides in our legacy Permian and Anadarko positions.","In the North Sea, we also see excellent growth potential. In mid-2017, we plan to bring our Callater Discovery online at a 30-day IP rate of approximately 15,000 boes per day, net to Apache. Following that, in mid-2018, we anticipate bringing online our first tertiary injectite discovery, Corona, at a rate of 5,000 to 10,000 boes per day net. Looking out a bit longer term, Corona has de-risked a string of exploration prospects that will be drilled in the future.","Over this same timeframe, we will conduct exploration activities on our 2.3 gross million acres offshore Suriname. While it is still early, we're excited about the potential for this area, which lies in the newly confirmed oil province. We have included a map of our Suriname position in our quarterly earnings supplement for your information.","In closing, Apache is well-prepared for a lower-for-even longer oil price environment. As experts debate when or if oil prices will increase and to what levels, Apache will continue to focus on the things we can control. Our primary strategic objectives in 2016 are: manage to cash flow neutrality after dividends and end the year with unchanged or lower net debt levels; preserve our strong financial position; protect our asset base; and optimize and expand our high-quality inventory of growth opportunities through strategic testing and exploration.","Our goal is to emerge from this commodity price downturn with top-tier financial strength, a robust inventory of high rate of return drilling opportunities in North America and a sustained capacity to generate free cash flow from our international assets in Egypt and the North Sea.","While we don't know when prices will recover, we do know that the prudent choices we're making today will enhance our long-term success. Quite often, it is during downturns like these that the choices companies make can either set them up for long-term success or set them back. I believe we have significantly strengthened Apache Corporation despite the challenging price environment and we are positioning ourselves to succeed through the recovery.","I will now turn the call over to Steve Riney.","Stephen J. Riney - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, John, and good afternoon. As John indicated, Apache had a very good year in 2015. We made outstanding progress high-grading the portfolio, driving down costs, aligning capital programs with cash flows and proactively strengthening our financial position. We entered 2016 well-positioned for the challenges our industry will face. Today, I will highlight Apache's financial progress, which includes our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2015, progress with our ongoing cost reduction efforts, a review of our financial strength and liquidity, and our outlook for 2016 production and capital spending.","So, let's begin with the fourth quarter financial results. As noted in our press release, under generally accepted accounting principles Apache reported a loss of $7.2 billion or $19.07 per common share. Our results for the quarter include a number of items outside of our core earnings that are typically excluded by the investment community in published earnings estimates, the most significant of which are ceiling test write-downs, impairments and tax adjustments associated with these items. As in prior periods, these write-downs resulted from the continued low commodity price environment. Our loss for the quarter adjusted for these items was $24 million or $0.06 per share.","Before I turn to other items, I'd like to comment on our reported production volumes, which include a significant downward adjustment related to the Egyptian tax barrels. The terms of our Egyptian PSCs provide that the payment of income taxes attributable to our entitlement will be made by EGPC from their share of production. We then gross up our results for these taxes which are paid on our behalf. Egyptian income taxes are calculated based on book income and are recorded as tax expense with an equal and offsetting amount in oil and gas revenues. Thus, there is no impact on net income as the revenues and tax expense we record each quarter offset one another. The revenue effect of this gross up is also recorded as production volume in our operating results. These are referred to as Egypt tax barrels.","In the first three quarters of 2015, we recognized book income, tax expense and, thus, tax barrel production volumes. In the fourth quarter, we incurred a $1.3 billion charge related to impairments and write-downs in Egypt, driven by the continued fall in oil prices, which resulted in a significant loss for the quarter. This loss has the effect of offsetting nearly all of the previously reported tax expense and tax barrels in the first three quarters, thereby, resulting in a large negative income tax expense and negative tax barrel production in the fourth quarter.","The total impact of the impairment is a loss of 38,280 barrels of oil equivalent per day of volumes in the fourth quarter or 9,649 barrels of oil equivalent per day for the full year 2015. Because the Egypt tax barrel volumes have no economic impact to Apache and, as we see in the fourth quarter, can fluctuate materially from quarter-to-quarter, our pro forma production guidance always excludes tax barrels. We believe this non-GAAP view of production is more reflective of underlying economic production volumes.","Now, let me turn to capital expenditures and costs. In 2015, Apache's intense focus on driving internal efficiencies along with the significant downward pressure on third-party service costs resulted in substantial efficiency gains in both capital and operating costs. Capital spending came in at $678 million for the fourth quarter and $3.6 billion for the full year. This was at the low-end of our original guidance range. As a reminder, our 2015 capital spending guidance excluded capital attributable to our one-third partner in Egypt, capitalized interest, opportunistic leasehold purchases and capital associated with divested LNG and associated operations.","As Gary noted at the outset of this call, we are changing our CapEx guidance convention in 2016. Our guidance now includes all anticipated capital spending categories, except capital attributable to our minority partner in Egypt. This should make it easier to track our capital spending plans for the year. On the lease operating expense side, our fourth quarter LOE was $10.04 per boe, which is 3% higher than the fourth quarter of 2014. For the year, LOE average $9.49 per boe, which is 9% lower than 2014.","Underlying improvement in these metrics is masked by the negative Egypt tax barrel volumes in the fourth quarter. On a like-for-like basis, excluding this impact, our lease operating expenses were down 4% and 10% per boe, respectively, in the fourth quarter and full year 2015. We have also spoken to you about progress on our G&A costs.","As a reminder we consider G&A to be our gross cash expenditures for all costs above field operations. The stated goal was to exit 2015 with a G&A run rate of $700 million, a decrease of over 30% from our run rate in the fourth quarter of 2014. I'm happy to say we achieved this goal. As we look ahead to 2016 we continue to find overhead efficiencies and we are reducing our G&A cost estimate for this year to a range of $650 million to $700 million.","Next, I would like to make a few comments regarding our financial strength and liquidity position. In 2015, we reduced our debt levels from year-end 2014 by $2.5 billion, ending the year with $8.8 billion of total debt. We retained $1.5 billion of cash, which we may utilize to further pay down debt. We ended the year with net debt of $7.3 billion. Our latest 12-month net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio as of December 31, 2015 was just under two times.","Apache's nearest long-term debt maturity is in 2018 and only $700 million or 8% of our total debt portfolio matures prior to 2021. We restructured and refreshed our $3.5 billion credit facility, which now matures in June 2020, and combined with our cash position, we now have total liquidity of approximately $5 billion.","At this time, our financial condition and liquidity are very strong, and we have accomplished this without issuing equity, without reducing the dividend and without selling core strategic assets. And to ensure that we sustain this strong position, we have chosen to reduce our capital spending this year to a level where we can attain cash flow neutrality at $35 oil.","Both John and I have mentioned the term cash flow neutrality a few times in reference to our overarching goals, so let me be clear what we mean by this. Cash flow neutrality means the capital program, debt service and the dividend are all funded through cash from operations, with little or no underpinning from financing or portfolio actions. Cash from operations includes all operating costs, including corporate overhead, and includes movements in working capital. At this time, we anticipate only small, non-core, non-producing asset sales will be necessary to achieve cash flow neutrality in 2016 assuming $35 oil prices.","We could choose to spend more capital. But as John outlined, we believe that preserving our strong financial position and our credit quality through cash flow neutrality is the best approach for our shareholders in this price environment. In the event prices improve during the year, we stand prepared to ramp-up our investment activity within the constraint of cash flow neutrality.","Now I'd like to provide some more detail on our 2016 capital program. As John discussed, our budget of $1.4 billion to $1.8 billion is the product of a $35 oil price assumption for the year. Since we are in a very volatile price environment and our overarching goal is for cash flow neutrality, the capital budget will flex up or down with price movements. Capital in 2016 will be allocated on a prioritized basis to protect the asset base, further optimize and build high-quality inventory for the future, conduct certain longer-cycle high-impact exploration activities and to pursue higher-return development activities which remain economically very attractive at these low prices.","There are two types of spend required to protect the asset base. First, we have to maintain the assets and keep them running efficiently. This includes workovers, recompletions and maintenance, and will represent approximately 30% of our capital program. Second, in some places, we have to engage in activity to maintain ownership of the mineral rights or to preserve leases. This includes continuous drilling activity or lease-holding production maintenance and will represent approximately 5% of our capital program.","We will allocate roughly 30% of our capital to key exploration activities and new play tests to continue building and high-grading our drilling inventory for the future. This will include continuing our highly successful North Sea exploration program, key play tests on some of our existing acreage in the Permian and Anadarko Basins and seismic commitments in offshore Suriname.","The remaining 35% of our capital program will go to development activity. Most of this will be allocated to the North Sea and Egypt, where we continue to see development opportunities that work very well at low oil prices. This is primarily due to contract structures and tax regimes that provide favorable capital recovery mechanisms and higher average cash margins. We suggest our investors review our earnings supplement for additional detail regarding region-by-region netbacks.","We also have a number of onshore North America drilling locations in the Permian Basin and Woodford\/SCOOP that remain economically attractive. However, these areas will receive less allocated capital due to the capital budget being constrained by cash flow. While we have reduced development activity on these assets, the leases are preserved and development will ramp back up in these assets and several other areas when oil prices and costs are better aligned to deliver more attractive returns.","Our reduced 2016 capital spending level is appropriate and prudent for a $35 oil environment. The end result is that we expect our total pro forma production to be in a range of 433,000 to 453,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. This will represent a decline of 7% to 11% from a comparative pro forma volume of 486,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2015. These volumes exclude Egypt minority interest, Egypt tax barrels and the effect of divested volumes from the 2015 base. If prices rise allowing more capital to be deployed, we anticipate most incremental investment would be directed to onshore North America and this would offset some of this anticipated decline.","In 2016 we will continue to optimize LOE, but given our expected production decline and a mix shift to slightly higher-cost international production, we do not anticipate materially lower operating costs on a per barrel of oil equivalent basis.","In terms of 2016 income taxes, we expect our adjusted earnings global effective tax rate to currently be in a range of 15% to 20%. Obviously, lower than what we would typically expect, our effective tax rate is being driven primarily by an expectation of very low book income. Going forward, we will be able to provide updates to this rate as the year progresses.","Also, we can provide some guidance around expected cash tax payments. We will pay the remainder of the income tax accrued for repatriating 2015 foreign sales proceeds of $85 million in the first quarter. Given the low commodity price environment, we currently believe that our cash tax payments in 2016, including cash taxes associated with the Petroleum Revenue Tax in the UK, will be minimal.","For the first quarter, we are providing pro forma production guidance for North American onshore of 290,000 to 295,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Our international and offshore production is guided to 180,000 to 185,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, which excludes Egypt tax barrels and the Egypt minority interest. Our projected capital spend in the first quarter is $500 million to $550 million, or approximately one-third of our full-year 2016 budget.","In closing, our prudent approach in 2015 has put us on firm ground and helps ensure resiliency in this difficult and unpredictable environment. As a result, we are prepared to endure a potentially lower for even longer commodity cycle while retaining our ability to dynamically manage our activity levels up or down as commodity prices and service costs dictate. Through all of this, our primary goals will remain unchanged. We will live within our means, maintain our strong financial position, build quality development inventory for the future and invest to improve returns and grow value for our shareholders. We look forward to a successful 2016.","And I would now like to turn the call over to the operator for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And your first question comes from the line of Pearce Hammond with Simmons & Company. Your line is open.","Pearce Wheless Hammond - Simmons & Company International","Good afternoon. John, does the Egyptian government help drive your thinking regarding capital allocation among your different regions? I assume the Egyptian government wants you to produce as much oil and gas as possible to bolster both domestic energy security as well as the Egyptian treasury. And so just curious if it limits your capital allocation flexibility in any ways.","John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, Pearce, clearly they would like us to invest more money, but like everything else, we decide where we put the investments in place, so it has not had an impact. We are going to generate cash flow in both Egypt and the North Sea, and they understand that. And it obviously will flow with our budget as we're flexible.","Pearce Wheless Hammond - Simmons & Company International","Great. And then my follow-up around the offshore Suriname blocks, if this is a legacy position from when Apache had a more defined exploration program like in New Zealand, Cook Inlet and places like that, is this a bit more of a one-off or is this a type of business that you want to build over the next few years?","John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, I think it is something \u2013 it fits with our international portfolio. Actually, we've got a lot of questions about that position, Pearce. We felt like it was important to go ahead and get a map out there. We drilled the well this year, our Popokai well, and we actually had picked up the other block prior to either Exxon drilling there Liza well or our well going down. So, we've got those two blocks there, not a huge capital commitment. We're going to be shooting seismic over block 58 this year, and we'll go from there.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Good afternoon.","John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hello, Brian.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","With regards to the CapEx and activity reductions, when we think about your cost base and your lowered cost, including on the SG&A side, when it's time to ramp back up, what is your operational and scale flexibility to do this? And what flexibility, if any, may be reduced, at least, temporarily? I mean, in other words, if you wanted to take the Permian and bring it back to a 10 or 15 or 20 rig count again, would this require re-staffing and the passage of time to make that happen?","John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Brian, with the way we've done our staffing, we strategically designed this organization for a $50 plus world. So, we do not envision needing to add a lot of staff to be able to flex back up. Clearly, I think if you get into a significantly lower time period where you've got lower prices, 24 months, 36 months out at that point you'd probably reduce further. But, we've maintained the flexibility so we can ramp up our capital programs when appropriate.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thanks so much. My follow-up is actually a follow-up to Pearce's question on exploration. You made a couple of references to adding exploration opportunities. Was that specifically the Suriname reference that you've already kind of spoken to here or are there other opportunities including the onshore that you're pursuing from a more exploratory perspective? And can you give us more color beyond Suriname if the answer is yes to that?","John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, I mean, it obviously includes Suriname. We did a good job of highlighting our North Sea exploration program last November, so we've got some exploration wells to drill in the North Sea. We brought on two discoveries late-2014 in Egypt in Ptah and Berenice, so we have active exploration programs both North Sea, both Egypt, Suriname and then obviously in North America. We have acknowledged that we acquired some acreage last year at some low prices that we think can be prospective. And while we've shut down for the most part our development drilling in North America, we will be doing some strategic testing in and around our existing asset base, and on some acreage that we've picked up.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Evan Calio with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good afternoon, guys. I appreciate the color and added disclosure. My first question, you guys cut CapEx, I think, deeper than expectations to get within cash flow post-dividend and avoided, at least, so far, some moves made by peers. And maybe you alluded to this in your opening comments. Yet to be clear, on the strip, do think that these moves mitigate the risk of needing to issue equity or losing your IG rating at Moody's?","John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Clearly, at this point, we took actions and we're very aggressive last year. So you look back to 2015 and 2016, we've had a track record of reducing activity and really trying to gear our business and mirror our activities to the price environment we're in. We've done that, we worked hard last year to improve our financial position, which we demonstrated we did. If you look back over second quarter, third quarter of last year we had an outspend of approximately 14% which was significantly lower than most of our peer group. So it put us in a position where we have been working to gear our spending levels to a lower price environment.","So, clearly, we worked on that, and we do have cash on hand this year. Obviously, we're making a conscious decision again in 2016 to live within the current price environment and within cash flow here such that we end the year with flat net debt. So it puts us in a position where we would anticipate not having to do some of those things at this point. And obviously protecting our investment grade rating is important to us, and it's something that we take seriously.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. And I guess \u2013 go ahead. Sorry. Oh, that's me echoing. Sorry. I, in my second question, follow-up, I mean, while not the case currently on your credit rating, but how should we or how do you think about potential impact to operations inside, outside the U.S. working capital levels if you either did see one or more non-IG credit rating?","Stephen J. Riney - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. Thanks, Evan. So, this is Steve. We're not going to really deal with the types of hypotheticals of what would happen if this happen, what would you do if the credit rating went down multiple notches. We're doing everything that we can to prudently run the company financially as John outlined. We've taken a number of steps to protect the financial position of the company. And we think we're actually in pretty good shape.","We've done a lot of stuff in 2015 in the last year to strengthen the financial position, build liquidity, make sure that we don't have a lot of refinance risk. And so, S&P has already come out with their rating, BBB, a downgrade to BBB and stable. Fitch continues to have us at BBB+, and we're waiting on Moody's. And I think we've done the things that we need to do and we'll continue to do the things that we need to do to remain investment grade. And we've got $1.5 billion of cash on the balance sheet. And if we need to use some of that, as I said in my script, to pay down a little bit of debt in order to protect that, then we would certainly be willing to do that.","So, we obviously think about what we would do and what we would be required to do because we need to be prepared and prudent about that. We don't spend a lot of time worried about that. We worry about protecting the investment grade rating.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of John Herrlin with Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Your line is open.","John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC","Two quick ones. For Suriname, when will you get the bird stack in on the seismic?","John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","John, we will be shooting that later this year. So, it will be a summer program.","John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks, John. With respect to your unconventional activity that you have planned, is this all going to be internal science done by Apache or are you going to be interfacing with the industry or what?","John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Clearly, it'd be internal programs that we'd be doing on our own. So, I mean, we participate in some wells in some areas and we learn from what we can and we've got partners in some places, but clearly, the work we are doing is all internally generated, and for the most part, it's done on our behalf for 100%.","John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC","Okay. Last one for me. Historically, you've made a lot of acquisitions; not of late, but a lot of people are experiencing some pain. Will you be more opportunistic in terms of property front in terms of buying things beyond what you have done?","John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I mean, John, we always are aware of what's out there and look at things carefully. The thing I would say, we find ourselves today in a very enviable position and we're opportunity-rich. With where we've scaled our capital back, there are a lot of excellent opportunities that we are choosing not to fund and that we think we would pursue at a higher price environment. So, as we think about things, they would have to be something that would be incrementally additive to our current inventory and portfolio. And so, I mean, it'd be a pretty high bar to be able to \u2013 something that we would want to bring into the door.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Michael Hall with Heikkinen Energy. Your line is open.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Thanks. Was just curious going back to Egypt a little bit, is there anything \u2013 any feature within the PSC that kind of limits your downside flexibility around spending? I'm just trying to think through if there's any sort of reduced cost-recovery barrels or anything along those lines if you cut too much.","John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","No, Michael, there really isn't. The nice thing about what you're seeing on the international portfolio is a lot of these PSCs and so forth were designed for lower price environments. And quite frankly, the way they work, the government takes a greater percentage in higher prices. And so, as we look at the international portfolio and we look at North America, there's greater leverage in North America to higher prices, and there's less leverage on the international side. So it makes sense to allocate more capital into those projects right now because the returns are superior. And there's no requirements or commitments on the spend level that would cause us to have to spend more or anything along those lines.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Okay. That's helpful. Appreciate the color. And North America, if I just think about the 2015 fourth quarter rate and then take a linear decline through 2016, I'm showing about 20% plus decline year-on-year 4Q 2016 versus 4Q 2015, is that directionally reasonable or is that anything I ought to revise in that thinking?","John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, I would say you'd probably end up a little bit steeper on the backside, but it's all going to hinge on how flexible we are with the capital and prices.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of David Tameron with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning or I guess afternoon. John, I'm just trying to think about 2017. If you think about it, if you get a modest uptick, obviously, cash flow, you guys have a lot of leverage to that. Your cash flow goes up. How are you thinking about the next two years? Is it spend within cash flow? Is it \u2013 it obviously would take a little bit of time to ramp to get there, but how would you thinking about that in, say, a $45 world?","John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, I think the important thing is if you look at 2016, we're guiding to relatively flat international. We said earlier on the call in the prepared notes that an additional $900 million incremental capital in North America would keep North America flat to slightly growing, which translates to about a $45 world.","So 2016, we could live within cash flow and be flat to relatively slight growth. So, as we look ahead into 2017, there's a couple of things going on first and foremost. We're in the second year now of a significantly reduced CapEx budget. We reduced aggressively last year, again this year. So we've got fewer wells that were brought on than historical. So our rates will be flattening slightly as we go into 2017.","Secondly, it will not take as much capital in 2017 to keep it flat, especially with North America. We're already investing at levels right now on the international side. Additionally, we've got some catalysts that will be coming on in 2017. If you look at the North Sea, our Callater well, potentially more than one well there that could be coming on.","So, we've got some catalysts. And quite frankly, with the capital efficiency we're seeing, the other thing I'll say is, as we look at the 2016 budget, we've already seen well costs coming in significantly under what we planned this year. So the capital efficiency is the other big thing. So, I think as we get out into 2017, it's going to take a lower oil price for us to be able to stay flat and potentially grow.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And then one follow-up, just to clarify. So you said that you're going to have four rigs in the Permian or that's where you get to. Where \u2013 maybe one or two of those doing some R&D, can you talk about where the activity is going to be?","John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","We've got four long-term contracts, so we will ramp down to those four rigs. There'll be a couple of them working in the Delaware, two to three. And there will be at least one up in the Midland Basin, Central Basin Platform as we continue to test all of our plays.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Edward Westlake with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Good afternoon and thank you very much for talking about returns and fully-loaded returns at that. So as we go out on the other side of this trough, however long it lasts, what is the hurdle rate for investment fully-loaded that you're looking to develop? I appreciate oil price is going to move, the cost structure is going to change, but I'm trying to think about what hurdle rate gets you to invest.","John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think the key is we want to get to fully burdened corporate returns that are in the low-double digits. And I think that's where we need to be striving and that's where we plan to get to.","Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Yes. Good that you have a returns target because historically the returns have not been as good for the industry even at $100 oil. Just a question then on the Permian and Delaware. You've got acreage, but it's not all contiguous. I'm just wondering if there's any update on people being willing to block up to get some efficiency gains?","John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","The nice thing is we've got 3.3 million gross acres, so we've got lots of acreage. We have done a lot of small trades and we are doing a lot of things. We are trying to block some things up and have had some success. So they're not things that hit the press in terms of radar screen, but we're continually looking to block and swap. We're interbedded with a lot of the operators and there's lots of things we're doing to try to core up those positions and put together drilling units where you've got more control.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Bob Morris with Citi. Your line is open.","Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thank you. John, on the four rigs at mid-year in the Permian, will you have a rig running in the Woodford\/SCOOP or anywhere else, or will it be just those four?","John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","At this point we've got flexibility there, Bob, but I would anticipate those being in the Permian.","Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. And then on the drilled but uncompleted inventory, how will that trend through the year? Do you have an inventory starting out the year, will that be drawn down or how will that contribute to the production during the year?","John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","If you look at last year, we consumed about 70 horizontal drilled but uncompleted wells and about 50 vertical. As I was pretty vocal early last year the wells we drill we intended to complete, and we drew down a lot of our DUCs. I would envision us doing the same thing this year. You could see that number come down a little bit, but it's at a level now where we don't have a lot that we haven't already completed.","And the thing I'll add, too, is we have the luxury of not having a lot of rig contracts and a lot of leases that require drilling of wells right now. So we're not in a position where we're having to build DUCs because we don't think that's a prudent use of capital.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate with Bank of America. Your line is open.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. John, I wondered if I could try two, please. I don't know if I missed this, but could you give us some idea of exit rate to exit rate in North America Q4 to Q4 2016 just to give us an idea where you're going be running at going into next year?","John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Doug, we did not give any guidance around that specific. I would say probably the best thing to do is take \u2013 we gave first quarter guidance, we gave the average ranges for the year and I would just probably extrapolate from that. I will say going into 2017, we expect to see capital efficiencies and things come into play where we have a much better picture for 2017 than we do currently for 2016 at these capital levels.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. I can join the dots. If I may, I want to go back to Suriname from the earlier question. And I'm just trying to understand a little bit about what's going on there with your longer-term thinking. Are you getting carried, John, on the activities there? And I'm just wondering are you retaining this really more as an option in case (1:01:04) spills over into your block? Or is that a little bit more strategic that this is really something that would be a core part of your portfolio going forward? And I'll leave it there. Thanks.","John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, what I'll say is when we originally took the block several years ago, the first block, 53, we viewed it as being in a very potential prospective area. I think what you now see is you've got a proven oil hydrocarbon province. We've got two blocks that are centrally located. There is a system there. We did drill one well last year.","Prior to drilling that well, we did bring in partners and were promoted on the one well in Block 53. We picked up Block 58 on our own just as protection. It was not a huge commitment. And I think we now have the luxury to see what we do with it. It is a bid option. We own it 100%. And clearly it's an area that's very prospective and is getting a lot of attention.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Bob Brackett with Bernstein Research. Your line is open.","Bob Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","The strategic allocation of capital, could you contrast what you call a development CapEx versus a base maintenance CapEx, say, in the Permian? And what does strategic capital mean in that exploration bucket?","John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think first and foremost in terms of maintenance, there are just certain things you have to do on your existing fields. So basically, Bob, we're not drilling development wells in the Permian which would be to generate further growth. So that's going to be the difference.","The other thing is going to be just your bread-and-butter maintenance things that you do with your base. And that's repairing subs, doing those types of things. In terms of strategic capital, we would put that as things that potentially sets up new drilling programs, test new zones, test new concepts, helps us better define what are going to be the inventory of growth opportunities in the future.","Bob Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","So testing stacked pay on an existing development you'd throw-in on the strategic side?","John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","If it had running room and could open up something significant, then yes. If it's something small on the Central Basin Platform or some areas where we've got just a few locations identified, then it wouldn't be in that category.","Bob Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. I think that's clear.","John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","It'd have to have potential scope to it for it to be strategic.","Bob Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Mike Kelly with Seaport Global. Your line is open.","Mike Kelly - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Hey, guys. My question was asked. I'll hand it back. Thanks.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Charles Meade with Johnson Rice. Your line is open.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Good afternoon, John, and to the rest of your team there. I appreciate you guys sticking around to answer all these questions. If I could ask what one about your dividend and your thinking there. You guys made a lot of moves and you've reviewed a lot of them on this call to adapt to a reduced commodity price early, but leaving the dividend intact stands out as an anomaly there. So I'm wondering if you can tell us a little bit about your thinking. And I know the board's thinking is really what comes to bear on this, but if you could give us some thoughts on your posture there.","Stephen J. Riney - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, this is Steve again. So you make very good points. We cut early, we took a lot of actions in 2015 that a lot of our peers didn't. And I think for that reason, we feel like we're very well positioned not to have to cut the dividend now. We've done all the things to strengthen the financial position, the liquidity position, our refinance risk on the debt portfolio.","We've chosen to live 2015 and 2016 as close to cash flow neutral as possible. We've done that because we believe that, especially in North America, the opportunities for investment are going to be better in the future than they are now. There are some good ones now, but we believe they're going to be even better. So we've chosen to be cash flow neutral. So we've added $1.5 billion of cash on the balance sheet, chosen to be cash flow neutral, we don't really need to reduce the dividend at this point in time.","And we do discuss that with the board. We discuss it with them every quarter and I imagine we'll continue to discuss that with them every quarter. But we just don't think we need to be doing that now. We'll probably reconsider it at some point in time in the future when prices and costs are better aligned and we all kind of figure out whatever the new normal, if we ever get to normal, in our industry will be in the future, then we can look at what our dividend yield is and whether that's appropriate for the situation that we're in at that point in time. But, at this point in time, we just don't have any compelling reason to have to cut it. We do realize that the dividend yield is pretty high for the situation that we're in right now, but we're okay with that for now. And that's why we went ahead and declared the regular dividend with this last quarter.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","That's helpful, Steve. Thank you. And then if I could dig down into the details on one of your Permian well results. I think, John, earlier in your prepared comments, you talked about the June Tippett well, and looking at that, even though it was kind of a short lateral, on a lateral-adjusted basis, that looks like it's \u2013 at least one of the wells there, it looks like a real standout in the Midland Basin. And I'm wondering if you could tell me if you share that point of view and if you do, where the Midland kind of ranks? Because it seems like you're ranking the Delaware Basin, generally, in front of your opportunities in the Midland Basin.","Timothy J. Sullivan - Senior Vice President-Operations Support","Yes. This is Tim Sullivan. We did drill \u2013 this was at a Wildfire lease. We did drill five well pads in the June Tippett lease. Three of them actually came online in the fourth quarter and two of them online in early 2016. And what we have done here, these are mile laterals. We had acquired some additional core data out here and tweaked our landing zone, targeting a higher TOC and lower clay content area.","And the 30-day IPs for the average of those five wells was 980 barrels of oil equivalent per day, and 75% of that is oil. And if you compare that to a well or a pad that we had drilled early in the air which was a mile-and-a-half pad, this mile pad is outperforming those. So we are pretty excited about that and we do have quite a bit of running room.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Michael Rowe with TPH. Your line is open","Michael J. Rowe - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Thanks. Just a question on the North Sea. I appreciate that there are a number of discoveries coming online in 2017 and 2018 to arrest decline. That said, can you talk about the base decline of this asset and what these productions or what these discoveries, excuse me, will do to aggregate production growth in those years?","John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","At this point, we see the North Sea being able to hang in there pretty strongly with the capital levels we're at. We have not looked at what price decks we'd use, and a lot of that will hinge on how many platform rigs we have, do we add those back in, in 2017 and 2018. We mentioned they would not be there the back half of this year, so a lot of that's going to hinge on capital as we lay out those future years. But we've got good running room now and a lot of nice things coming on.","Stephen J. Riney - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Michael, this is Steve. I'd also just point you to the presentation we made, the webcast that we made back in November. It's got some information that I think you'd find helpful.","Michael J. Rowe - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Understood. Thanks. I was just trying to see if there's been any change in thought process there. But maybe just my last question would be just a question on the goal of spending within cash flow and the comment you made on cash flow movements with each change \u2013 dollar per barrel change in the oil price. Of your 2016 operating cash flow, do you have a sense for how much of that is attributable to North American Onshore versus your International business at $35 oil? Thanks.","John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I don't have that number off the top my head. You're going to have more cash flow coming out of the International in terms of on a per barrel basis just because our cash margins are higher. But I'll let \u2013 we can follow-up with exactly that split. I'll have Gary follow up with a better idea on the ratio.","Operator","And our final question comes from the line of Jeffrey Campbell with Tuohy Brothers. Your line is open.","Jeff L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Thank you for taking my questions. Steve mentioned that cash flow neutrality remains the approach whether oil prices rise up or down. I was wondering if hedging might also be part of the method, particularly if oil prices rise somewhat, to protect the timing of any increased spending exposure.","John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Jeff, at some point, obviously, if we were going to commit a lot of capital, we would start to look at using hedging. I think you're in a period today where we don't have a cost structure that's not synchronized with price environment. But it is something in the future. If we were to put a lot of capital back to work that we would consider as a tool to offset or mitigate some of the risk to ensure that we can deliver the return objectives that we're focused on.","Jeff L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Thanks, John. My follow-up is, can you review the very low Permian well cost guidance that you gave, again, with average lateral links that correlate to those costs? And also do those estimates include more intensive completions?","John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","In terms of our Permian well cost, we see things coming down and even further this year. As a rule, we're looking at mile-and-a-half laterals. We have seen the intensity of the frac concentrations going up. So those are the types of parameters we're going to use or using in those estimates.","Operator","And I would now like to turn the call back over to the presenters for closing remarks.","Gary T. Clark - Vice President-Investor Relations","That's going to wrap up the call, Kim. There's no more questions. We look forward to speaking to you all next quarter, and please give myself or Chris Cortez a call if you have any follow-up questions. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call, and you may now disconnect."],"2157":["Apache Corp.

My name is Lisa and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Third Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you.","Gary Clark, Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.","Gary T. Clark - Apache Corp.","Good morning and thank you for joining us for Apache Corporation's Third Quarter 2018 Financial and Operational Results Conference Call. We will begin the call today with an overview by Apache's CEO and President, John Christmann. Tim Sullivan, Executive Vice President of Operations Support, will then provide additional operational color. Steve Riney, Executive Vice President and CFO, will summarize our third quarter financial performance. Also available on the call to answer questions are Apaches Senior Vice Presidents: Brian Freed, Midstream and Marketing; Mark Meyer, Energy Technology, Data Analytics and Commercial Intelligence; and Dave Pursell, Planning Reserves and Fundamentals.","Our prepared remarks will be approximately 25 minutes in length, with the remainder of the hour allotted for Q&A. In conjunctions with yesterday's press release, I hope you have had the opportunity to review our third quarter Financial and Operational Supplement, which can be found on our Investor Relations website, at investor.apachecorp.com.","On today's conference call we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the differences between these non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the supplemental information provided on our website. Consistent with previous reporting practices, adjusted production numbers cited in today's call are adjusted to exclude non-controlling interest in Egypt and Egypt's tax barrels.","Finally, I would like to remind everyone that today's discussions will contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions based on our current views and reasonable expectations. However, a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from what we discussed today. A full disclaimer is located with the supplemental data on our website.","And with that, I will turn the call over to John.","John J. Christmann IV - Apache Corp.","Good morning and thank you for joining us. On the call today, I will discuss Apache's strategic positioning, provide a preview of 2019, comment on our strong third quarter performance and review our key focus areas. Apache is a very different and much improved company from four years ago when oil prices began their prolonged downturn in the fall of 2014. We acknowledged very early on that the industry including Apache needed to make significant changes, not only in terms of reducing activity levels and overall cost structure, but equally to reestablish long-term returns discipline in the capital program.","At that time, we chose to significantly curtail our drilling program, allowing production to decline rather than pursue growth in an environment where commodity prices and costs were not properly aligned. We refrained from participating in high-cost acreage acquisitions in the heart of proven plays, choosing instead to build our unconventional exploration capabilities","An important outcome of this strategy was the discovery of Alpine High. We have frequently stated our philosophy that an E&P company should be capable of living within cash flow from operations, generating sustainable long-term reserve and production growth while also returning capital to shareholders.","After significant upfront investment at Alpine High and the pending completion of our Altus Midstream transaction, Apache has turned the corner and is well positioned to deliver on this philosophy for many years to come. We continue to generate steady production growth on a flat activity set and are poised to deliver positive free cash flow in 2019. This can be sustained over the long term through development of our extensive inventory. It will be supplemented by organic exploration, including discoveries in hand today, and a refreshed portfolio of new opportunities.","Lower F&D costs, increasing returns and continual portfolio hydrating will accompany our growth and drive sustainable shareholder value growth through time. This is the investment proposition Apache offers and it is one that we strongly believe in, as evidenced by our decision to begin repurchasing shares in September under an existing authorization. Recently, our Board of Directors approved a new authorization for the repurchase of 40 million shares, which represents more than 10% of shares outstanding.","Now I would like to provide a preview of 2019. For more than a year, Apache has operated at a relatively constant upstream activity level, which has enabled us to deliver operational efficiencies, effectively control costs and generate sustainable liquids production growth. We anticipate maintaining a similar activity level next year, but on a lower capital budget. If changes in expected cash flow dictate, we have the flexibility to reduce our activity levels accordingly.","In 2019, assuming commodity prices in line with the current strip, Apache expects upstream capital investment of approximately $3 billion, which is consistent with our current guidance and is lower than 2018. Adjusted production at the high end of our 410,000 to 440,000 BOEs per day guidance range, representing more than 15% growth in the U.S. and 10% growth overall, positive free cash flow and continued return of capital to shareholders. This is well-aligned with the philosophy I outlined at the beginning of the call and we look forward to providing a more detailed 2019 outlook in February.","Our performance-to-date in 2018 underpins our confidence in this outlook, as we have demonstrated excellent growth and exceeded our guidance for three consecutive quarters. In the third quarter, we delivered very strong earnings and cash flow, driven by our significant Brent and LLS oil price leverage, robust NGL realizations and solid production results. We've seen our positive production trends continue into the fourth quarter and are again raising our full-year 2018 U.S. guidance. Notably, we expect a meaningful increase in fourth quarter oil volumes.","Internationally, we delivered robust cash flow in the third quarter of production that was in line with guidance. In Egypt, our drilling program continued to achieve a high success rate and gross production remains relatively steady. While net adjusted production was reduced by the impact of higher oil prices, on our production-sharing contracts, cash flow trended higher in the third quarter on strong Brent oil prices.","In the North Sea, production was impacted by routine seasonal maintenance, but was also in line with expectations. We anticipate significant growth in the fourth quarter, with positive momentum continuing into 2019.","Turning now to Midstream. We achieved an important milestone during the third quarter, with the announcement of Altus Midstream Company. Altus accomplishes the primary objectives that we have previously articulated to the market; it enables Apache to maintain control of the midstream infrastructure buildout and establishes an entity capable of funding all future midstream investments at a lower cost of capital. Since the announcement, we have spoken with many of our largest institutional shareholders. The feedback has been overwhelmingly positive, and we look forward to the closing of the transaction in November.","Now I would like to provide a strategic overview of Apache's key operating areas. In the Midland and Delaware Basins, the strategic testing we have conducted over the past three years is paying dividends, as we shift a much greater percentage of our capital to full-pattern development. This is generating significant improvements in cost and productivity. And today we believe that we are drilling some of the best wells in both basins.","In the Midland Basin, development drilling continues in the Powell, Wildfire and Azalea areas with excellent results. We recently expanded our activity outside of these areas as we focus on increasing Apache's inventory of high-graded opportunities. In the Delaware Basin, we are delineating acreage in the New Mexico Slope play and adding landing zones in our Dixieland and Pecos Bend areas in Texas. Our drilling inventory in these areas continues to increase and will support a multi-rig program for the foreseeable future.","Moving on to Alpine High. While testing and delineation activity will continue for some time, given the magnitude of the total resource, we are transitioning now to a multi-well pad development designed to optimize spacing, pattern and completions configurations.","We have previously discussed the framework for monitoring our progress at Alpine High in the context of well costs, well productivity and inventory. On well costs, we have achieved an approximate 25% reduction in drilling, completion and equipment costs per lateral foot year-over-year through the first three quarters of 2019, which is in line with our goal.","In terms of well productivity, we are beginning to extend our laterals where applicable, and we are seeing a high correlation between productivity and lateral length in our Woodford and Barnett wells. We are also beginning to modify completions design, including higher profit loads, which is delivering a step change in well productivity.","Turning to our delineation program in the shallow Wolfcamp Bone Spring sequence formations, we recently began flow back on a 10 well pad which incorporates larger frac geometries and is designed to test the productivity of patterns and spatial relationship. The pad is developing roughly a half section and contains four wells in the Wolfcamp A, four wells in the Wolfcamp B and two wells in the Bone Spring formation. Aggregate production from the eight Wolfcamp wells is currently around 3,300 barrels of oil per day. We are very encouraged by the performance of these wells, which are still cleaning up and have not reached peak IP rates. We are in the early stages of bringing the two Bone Spring wells online and will provide an update on the progress of this pad in the future. Tim will provide some more detail on our Alpine High program in his remarks.","Turning now to the international region. In Egypt, we have been investing at a pace that has maintained gross production at a relatively flat level. Our drilling success rate is very high and very consistent, while our inventory of opportunities is growing significantly through the addition of new acreage concessions and high density 3-D imaging. Egypt delivered some of the best returns in the portfolio, and we are confident this region can return to growth in production of free cash flow for many years to come.","Our current drilling program in the North Sea consists of two platform rigs and one semi-submersible, which we believe is an appropriate pace to deliver our strategic objective of sustaining production and free cash flow generation.","Capital efficiency has improved significantly in the North Sea and we anticipate delivering higher production in the fourth quarter and in 2019 with a flat capital profile. Production growth will be driven by the tie-in of three significant wells in the barrel area: a development well at Caliber, a discovery well at Store (11:46) and our discovery well at Garten, which we have now accelerated into 2018. Longer-term, the Garten discovery has lowered the risk profile of several analogous exploration prospects, some of which we will likely test in 2019.","Moving on to exploration. In Suriname, we continue to progress our technical evaluation and are looking at a multitude of prospects. We will initiate a drilling program next year on Block 58, where Apache currently owns 100%. This block is untested and adjacent to the Exxon Mobil operated Stabroek Block in neighboring Guyana. In the U.S. we have a strategy of expanding our portfolio through organic growth opportunities at a low entry cost. On-shore unconventional exploration teams are acquiring acreage in multiple respective areas focusing on oil. Our third and fourth quarter capital reflects some incremental activity in this regard.","Before turning it over to Tim, I'd would like to address reports that Apache is actively marketing certain assets in our U.S. portfolio. We regularly review the strategic value of holding assets in our portfolio. If another party is willing to fund assets that are not attracting capital for Apache and an opportunity exists to increase value for our shareholders through a sale, our approach has always been to notify the market upon execution of a sale agreement for any material asset disposition and refrain from commenting prior to that. To the extent we do complete asset sales, return of capital to shareholders is a high priority use of proceeds.","With that, I will turn the call over to Tim Sullivan who will provide some operational details on the quarter.","Timothy J. Sullivan - Apache Corp.","Good morning. My remarks will briefly cover third quarter 2018 production and operations performance, including drilling highlights and activity in our core regions. Operationally, we had another very good quarter and saw improvement in many key areas. We achieved company-wide adjusted production of approximately 401,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, a 13% increase from the same period a year ago and up 3% from the second quarter 2018. The Permian Basin continues to drive our growth. Compared with the third quarter a year ago, oil production in the basin increased 16% and total production grew 38%.","These are impressive growth rates on a large production base, which reflect the success of our ongoing development in the Midland and Delaware Basins and the continued ramp up at Alpine High. We averaged 18 rigs and five frac crews in the Permian Basin during the quarter. Compared with the preceding period, we held our oil production steady, up 1%, and with the completion schedule skewed toward the back half of the year, there will be a larger contribution to oil growth in the fourth quarter and even more so in 2019.","In the Midland Basin, we placed 13 wells online in the third quarter, all of which were on multiwell pads. This includes a nine-well pad at our Powell field, comprising a mix of mile-and-a-half and two-mile laterals. In addition, we drilled a four-well strategic plan pad in our Hartgrove field in Reagan County, testing four separate Wolfcamp landing zones with very encouraging results.","In the Delaware Basin at Dixieland, we placed on production 10 high-rate wells with one-mile laterals. Eight are producing from two proven-Upper Wolfcamp landing zones, while the remaining two successfully tested two additional landing zones in the Lower Wolfcamp, adding inventory across the field. Please refer to the Quarterly Supplement for production details.","Production at Alpine averaged approximately 49,000 BOE per day during the quarter. We are currently producing approximately 55,000 BOE per day on a net basis. For the full year 2018, we are tracking toward 44,000 BOE per day net, down slightly from our 45,000 BOE per-day guidance. This reduction results primarily from a processing upset that sent moisture down the pipeline, requiring a two-day field shutdown to dig the lines.","At Alpine High, we placed 27 wells on production during the third quarter. We will remain on track to place more than 90 wells on production this year. John mentioned the results we've seen thus far on our 10-well Cypress pad, so I will note a few other results year.","Recent Barnett completions during the quarter include the Mohican 201, which averaged a 30-day initial production rate of 7.7 million cubic feet of rich gas and 319 barrels of oil per day; the (16:30), which averaged a 30-day IP rate of 7.3 million cubic feet of rich gas and 256 barrels of oil per day. Both wells were completed with laterals averaging 5,700 feet and standard proppant loads of 1,970 pounds per foot. They produce extremely rich gas with an average BTU content of nearly 1,300. And assuming cryo-processing, we yield up to 160 barrels of NGLs per million cubic feet of gas. We have many analogous Barnett wells scheduled for multi-well pad development in our 2019 drilling program.","I also wanted to provide an update on the 12-well Blackfoot pad which we discussed last quarter. Recall that the Blackfoot tested 660-foot spacing in three Woodford landing zones. These wells were relatively small completions, treated with only 1,600 pounds per foot of sand. The pad peaked at a 30-day IP rate of nearly 105 million cubic feet of gas and 280 barrels of oil per day following our last quarterly call.","The majority of the gas is being recovered from the upper two Woodford landing zones. Based on our frac geometry and production results, we believe we can recover most of these reserves with fewer wells and larger fracs, which will significantly enhance pad economics. This strong performance from the upper Woodford landing zones on tighter spacing has a positive impact on our location count.","On the cost side, Apache is successfully navigating a challenging inflationary environment in the U.S. Our initial 2018 budget contemplated a 10% to 15% average surface cost increase. However, steel tariffs, rising fuel and chemical prices and higher labor costs, particularly trucking and construction, have resulted in incremental inflation. We are managing these dynamics with improved wellbore and completion designs, longer laterals, multi-well pad drilling and proactive investment in water management infrastructure.","As we look into 2019, we are likely to see a continuation of higher labor, steel, fuel and chemical costs. However, as we move through the tender process, we are realizing reduce costs for rigs and pressure pumping crews. Net-net, we believe these cost trends roughly offset each other in 2019, and we plan to budget for a relatively flat or slightly down year-over-year service cost overall.","Internationally, in Egypt we drilled and completed 24 gross wells with an 83% success rate. Noteworthy results are included in our Supplement. These are primarily high rate oil wells, all with Brent Index pricing. Our seismic acquisition on the Western Desert continues. To date, we have acquired close to 1 million acres of a planned 2.6 million acre seismic shoot, completing acquisition in our legacy West Kalabsha and Shushan areas.","We have recently initiated seismic acquisition in our new Northwest Razzak Concession. Fast track processing is bringing very exciting results. We are seeing faults in geologic surfaces, especially in the deeper section, that we could not image before. We have identified several new leads and prospects just from this initial data review.","Moving to the North Sea, production averaged approximately 51,000 BOE per day per the quarter as operations were impacted by maintenance turnarounds. Production has begun to rebound in the fourth quarter and should continue to ramp up. In late September we brought onstream our fourth development well at our Callater Field at Beryl. This well is having a positive impact both on production and reserves and is currently producing 3,500 BOE per day net to Apache. Apache owns a 55% working interest.","Also, as John noted, we have accelerated development at Garten. The Beryl near field discovery we announced in March with first oil expected later this month. By locating this test well near existing infrastructure, we have been able to reduce our cycle time, minimize development costs and bring this well into production in only seven months for $80 million, which we expect will translate to a very attractive F&D cost of less than $10 per barrel.","We anticipate achieving our highest average production rate for the year in that North Sea during the fourth quarter. To sum up, operationally, we remain on track for a very good year with growing momentum heading into 2019. We are focused on building on this success in quarters ahead.","I will now turn the call over to Steve.","Stephen J. Riney - Apache Corp.","Thank you, Tim. As noted in the press release issued last night, under generally accepted accounting principles, Apache reported third quarter 2018 net income of $81 million or $0.21 per diluted common share. Results for the quarter included a number of items that are outside of core earnings, which are typically excluded by the investment community and published earnings estimates. The most significant of these is a $75 million after-tax loss we incurred as a result of the bond tender exercise in August. Excluding this and other smaller items, adjusted earnings for the quarter were $244 million or $0.63 per share.","Third quarter financial performance was good across the board. Production volumes were strong and we anticipate this will continue into fourth quarter and 2019. Our average realized oil price exceeded $69 per barrel in the third quarter as nearly 70% of oil production received Brent or Gulf Coast linked pricing. NGL realizations were also very strong, up 18% from second quarter.","Costs continue to trend well both on a per unit basis for LOE and DD&A and on a gross basis for G&A and exploration expense. All are tracking below previous full-year guidance ranges, which we have reduced accordingly. Note that cash tax guidance has been increased for the year to reflect higher income levels internationally, primarily as a result of the strong Brent oil prices. Capital investment in the quarter was $966 million dollars, which includes $122 million for Alpine High and Midstream.","As highlighted in our financial and operational supplement, upstream activity level for the prior four quarters have been remarkably consistent. Upstream capital investment has averaged between $700 million and $750 million per quarter on a steady global rig count. We plan to maintain a similar level of baseline activity through 2019 resulting in typical quarterly capital investment of around $750 million. As John indicated, this would result in a $3 billion capital program for 2019. We believe this is a prudent level of investment and remain prepared to reduce it further should industry conditions warrant.","Through a combination of the timing of capital activity and some incremental lease acquisitions and extensions, third quarter upstream investment was $844 million. Fourth quarter upstream investment will be approximately $800 million, which also includes some significant lease acquisition investments. With the combination of strong operational performance and recent price levels, financial returns have improved and will continue to do so. Our cash return on invested capital through the first three quarters of 2018 was 23% on an annualized basis. We ended the third quarter with $593 million of cash on hand.","In terms of balance sheet management, in the third quarter we took certain steps to improve our debt portfolio. We issued $1 billion of new 10-year senior notes, repurchased $731 million of outstanding debt and paid off $400 million of maturing debt. These actions extended our debt maturity profile, reduced our average cost of debt, modernized our standard debenture terms, and reduced debt by $131 million. This is in addition to the $150 million debt reduction we affected earlier in the year.","I will conclude with comments on midstream and marketing. There continue to be many concerns about transport, and now fractionation capacity to accommodate growing Permian Basin production volumes. For the upstream industry in general, these concerns are well-founded, and the underlying situation is likely to extend through much of 2019. The good news is that much of the Midstream investment is already underway, and Apache has taken the necessary steps to mitigate the short-term impact of these issues.","As an interim solution, we entered into swaps on Waha gas basis back in late 2017 and early 2018 to lock in an average $0.51 differential on a significant quantity of gas production through much of 2019. As a part of the longer-term solution, Apache's midstream business is contracted for transport on multiple pipeline projects across all three commodities. In many cases, our contracting was critical to enabling FID on the project. As such, the midstream business was able to secure equity participation options in those projects and will become an important piece of Altus Midstream Company.","We have talked extensively about the gas and oil transport projects. With the recent concerns around NGL transport and fractionation, let me share a few more details on our agreement with Enterprise. This agreement will accommodate NGL transport and fractionation, ramping up to 205,000 barrels per day, beginning with the commissioning of the Chinook NGL Pipeline Waha lateral. The agreement has a 10-year primary term with a very attractive fixed transport and fractionation fee structure. At Apache's option, the agreement can be extended under the same terms for two additional five-year periods of time. The pipeline's lateral is anticipated to be operational shortly after the completion of the first Cryo facility at Alpine High.","We are currently with working with Enterprise and other parties on interim solutions in the event the Cryo facility is operational before the pipeline lateral is commissioned. The Enterprise agreement will access attractive Mont Belvieu pricing for our NGLs and contains certain options that enable further margin expansion possibilities. In 2019, the value of the NGL margin uplift for Alpine High will become much more apparent.","We are closing out 2018 and entering 2019 in a very strong financial position and with great momentum: lower debt, robust cash flow and increasing returns, all goals we set at the beginning of the year. I look forward to reporting on our full-year financial performance in February and further discussing our outlook for 2019.","And with that, I will turn the call over to the operator for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We'll pause for just a moment to compile a Q&A roster. And our first question comes from the line of Gail Nicholson from Stevens. Your line is open.","Gail Nicholson - KLR Group LLC","Good morning, everybody. You guys had really strong Permian NGL price realizations this quarter. I was curious, what percent of your Permian NGLs are ethane? And then how is that to change post the Cryo facilities coming online in Alpine next year?","Stephen J. Riney - Apache Corp.","Hey, Gail. So this is Steve. So I don't have at hand an exact number of the percent of NGLs that are ethane. Might see if we could get that before the end of this call. But that obviously will be impacted quite a bit as we actually bring on three Cryo units in Alpine in 2019, the first one by the middle of the year and then two more before the end of the year. In aggregate, we produce about 60,000 barrels a day of NGLs in the U.S. and most of those \u2013 those are all basically priced based on net back Mont Belvieu type of pricing, with a deduction for transportation and fractionation costs. And quick turnaround on the first part, about 42% is F8 in the Permian.","Gail Nicholson - KLR Group LLC","Okay. Great. And then the market we tend to be overly focused on your U.S. onshore execution, but you have some really high-quality international assets. Can you just talk about what could potentially be on the horizon in the North Sea and Egypt in 2019, specifically maybe in Egypt as maybe you return that asset more to a global asset.","Stephen J. Riney - Apache Corp.","Yes, Gail. Thank you. If you look at Egypt, we've got a big three-day program that's underway and we've got a lot of new concessions, and so, it's a 2.6 million acre shoot. We shot over 1 million of it. Things are progressing well and, I tell you, the early looks on the seismic are very exciting. There's just a lot of rock to deal with out there, it's high productivity, and we've got such a massive infrastructure, backbone in place, that it will be easy to bring things on. So, we are very excited about Egypt and we are excited about getting more of the 3-D in and starting to migrate our inventory there, which really has become very robust.","Historically we have about two years of inventory that we could see because it took so long to build. Today we've got a much, much longer time horizon on our Egypt portfolio, and gives us the ability \u2013 you know, we believe we are going to be able to grow the free cash flow as well is grow production over the next several years on the new acreage. So that's the first thing.","If you look at the track record in the North Sea, Garten this year was a big discovery for us, and as we said on the notes this morning, we are going to be accelerating that from early next year into the fourth quarter. So we are excited about that. It will be a very high rate well, it's a big structure, and there's potential in there, we'll just have to see how it outperforms, even add more wells. But most importantly, it also de-risked several other structures that are very similar to Garten.","So we continue to have success in the barrel area with tiebacks. We've got store coming as well, in 2019 we brought on another well in Callater. So we've got a lot of momentum going into 2019 in the North Sea, not to mention the work we are doing a 40s as well with the water injection. We are really starting to see some stabilization of the decliner rates there, and flattening of that which has big ramifications. So, you know international portfolio has provided a tremendous amount of cash flow, it's Brent pricing and we get really high gas prices in the UK as well, and we're excited what that's going to continue to do for us for the foreseeable future.","Gail Nicholson - KLR Group LLC","Great. Thank you so much.","Stephen J. Riney - Apache Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from line of Charles Meade from Johnson Rice. Your line is open.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Good morning, John, to you and your whole team there.","John J. Christmann IV - Apache Corp.","Good morning, Charles.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","I wanted to \u2013 I feel like you guys talked a little bit about that para sequence test you have, and I think Tim said that was the Cyprus state pad, did I catch that right?","John J. Christmann IV - Apache Corp.","You did.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Okay. And so, John, I recognize it's early days there, but can you give a little bit more color. I know you said the wells are still cleaning up. I did a quick math and it looks like those four Wolfcamp tests are right now a little bit over 400 barrels a day of oil each. I wonder if you would talk about how much water you are seeing? Where you think that, what would be a good result in your view on where those wells go? And also maybe you could talk a little bit about the decision to do all eight wells at onetime, rather than just kind of weigh generally into that test?","John J. Christmann IV - Apache Corp.","Well, first of all, Charles, we are very excited about it. It's a 10 well oil pad test. There are four Wolfcamp A's, there are four Wolfcamp B's and two Bone Springs. Really, really high productivity. It's very early. I will tell you we were gas lifting all eight of the Wolfcamp wells. There's extreme deliverability and productivity and they are really just starting to cleanup. So, they started cutting oil pretty early.","There's a tremendous amount of fluid to move, and we are very optimistic and encouraged by those. They are still short laterals, larger fracs, about 4000 pounds a foot. This is really 10 wells in a little over a half section. So it's like we've talked about the name of the game is getting the pad development, understanding the spacing from a spatial and pattern position.","And we're excited about these. They are going to continue to clean up, when we look at the IPR curves, there's a lot of room for these wells come up and we expect them to hold in for quite a while. So we're very encouraged. The two Bone Springs we've just really started and we've run sump pumps in those two wells. So \u2013 and they're both cutting oil but just really getting started. So it's early and is 40 gravity oil, it's black oil and well costs were very reasonable for the size jobs we pumped, and we're very optimistic.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Got it. It sounds promising. We'll just have to stay tuned on that. And then if I could go back and touch on \u2013 you guys talked about the CapEx outlook for 2019, but that's really a piece of the free cash flow outlook for 2019. And you guys also talked about the possibility of asset sales, and that would be the scenario which you'd look to return more cash to shareholders.","So I think you guys already have a dividend. You've maintained it through the whole downturn, but can you give us a little bit of your thoughts? Are you thinking about, how would you \u2013 if you did have more free cash flow through an asset sale or just through sustained strength in quality price, how are you thinking about maintaining or increasing your dividend going with a special dividend? And then also, you guys announced this $40 million share repurchase authorization. Can you give us how those priorities sort out in your mind?","John J. Christmann IV - Apache Corp.","Well, Charles, that's a lot of questions. I'll try to summarize in a couple points and then give you a chance to come back if we didn't answer them. But first of all, as we look to 2019, we've been running a pretty flat activity set, going back to the back half of 2017. So we're very comfortable what the capital forecast is going into next year. We figure for $3 billion, we can deliver pretty fat flat activity set, which sets us up very nicely when you look at the corporate level in the U.S. growth which, of course will be driven by Permian.","So we also believe that we will be in a position to generate some free cash flow and clearly, a high priority with that free cash flow right now, especially with where share price is would be to supplement our dividend policy which we've maintained through the downturn. I mean we're one of the few that did not cut our dividend, and so we see that buybacks is something we can do to supplement our dividend policy as we return incremental cash flow to the shareholders.","So everything I'll say about the capital program going into next year that can easily be flexed up as we have significant inventory to do that. But also it'll be very easy ratchet back if things change in the environment. So we'll have more color on the call in February, but very comfortable with the rates and pace we've been running at. I think we're set up for a really strong 2019 after a really good 2018, and we do see us being able to increase the stuff back to shareholders.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Thanks, John. That was the overview I was looking for. Go ahead. I'm sorry.","Stephen J. Riney - Apache Corp.","Yeah, sorry, Charles. I'll just add to that. Just in terms of what potential we might have on that, we ended the third quarter with $600 million of cash, with positive free cash flow planned at strip for 2019. Through the end of 2019 and after paying the dividend and after retaining a bit of cash on the balance sheet for operational purposes, you're probably looking at as much as $500 million to $1 billion of cash available, depending on price, available for either debt reduction or further share buybacks. And that would exclude any proceeds from asset sales.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Thanks, Steve.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brian Singer from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you. Good morning.","Stephen J. Riney - Apache Corp.","Good morning, Brian.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Wanted to touch on Alpine High well productivity. You talked to some of the success and endeavors you're taking, extending laterals and also greater proppant loads. Can you add a little bit more color on what you're seeing, and more specifically whether when you talk about the improvement in productivity that is increasing EURs in recovery rates, or that is just bringing forward production?","John J. Christmann IV - Apache Corp.","Yeah, Brian. I think the thing we've determined and we now have substantial flow time on it is that the larger fracs are definitely increasing productivity. We're also seeing that in the Woodford and the Barnett, and longer laterals are pretty much one to-one in terms of lateral foot for the productivity. So in both cases we're getting benefit from longer laterals as well as the bigger fracs.","The last pad we brought on, the Blackfoot, was the smaller fracs. We did that even knowing going into that we knew the larger fracs were doing more but we needed to see the data point in terms of the number of landing zones and the spatial placement between those.","And it's confirmed what we believed that we're probably going to be able to develop at Woodford with two landing zones, drop the As and Bs a little bit lower with a little larger fracs. And then we've got to come back and pump the bigger fracs on those to then figure out the optimal number of wellbores. But the good news is our location counts have had very conservative assumptions.","We've proven that at less than 2,000 pounds we can place the wells 660 feet apart and our well count assumptions were 925 to 1,000. So well count is going to go up when we come back and quantify that, but we've still got some more work to do in terms of what's going to drive the greatest return and PV per capital dollar invested with how we develop these patterns. We've got the 12 wells in the Blackfoot. We're going to come back right now. We're in the process of completing 10 wells in the Barnett and at a later date you'll see us come back with a pair sequence. So at the Mont Blancs right now we're in the process of flowing back or starting to flow back some Woodford and Barnett tests, which have a little larger fracs. So there's a lot of data that's coming and has been designed to help us yield what's going to be critical to the development scenario. So a lot of good work and a lot of progress, and at some point we'll come back and unfold a lot of that for you.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you for that. And then my follow up is with regards to use of capital Permian and M&A. Can you just kind of talk to, to what degree M&A opportunities are competitive or not competitive relative to share repurchase for use of free cash and where the Permian outside Alpine High plays into that if at all?","John J. Christmann IV - Apache Corp.","Well, I mean, I think if you look at us today first of all, as I said in the closing part of my comments, if there's an asset that we're not funding and there's an opportunity for somebody else to put capital in that asset, then there may be an arbitrage and the ability to create some value for shareholders.","So we're constantly looking at the portfolio and you've seen that historically with us. We exited Canada last year. So it's something we're constantly looking at.","Clearly, right now, if you look at our portfolio, we're very excited about where we are in the Midland Basin. We've been predominantly working three areas and, as Tim mentioned, we branched out past those three areas in the Permian. But if you look at those three areas, it's less than 20% of what we'd call our core Midland Basin acreage and we've really developed less than 20% of the locations we see in those.","So there's tremendous amount of running room in our Wolfcamp and Spraberry locations in our Midland Basin. And then if you look at our portfolio from an expiration standpoint, we believe today you're better served \u2013 the best impact's going to be through organic well-designed expiration. And Alpine High was a result of that.","We've put together a tremendous portfolio over the last few years on the conventional side. We've got a block down in Suriname that we're very, very excited about and we've also got some new plays that we've been working on the unconventional side. As you know, it's a depleting business and you have to continue to find areas, and we think organically through the expiration if you can do it with low-cost, high-impact areas, we think that's the best way to create value. And it's also why we also like our share price right now.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Herrlin from Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Your line is open.","John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC","Yes. Thanks. Just one quick one for me. Are you going to be buying puts for next year's oil production?","John J. Christmann IV - Apache Corp.","John, historically we've put things in place to protect our programs. And I think fundamentally we like to stay away from hedging unless we feel like we need to do something. And at times when we felt like we had a capital program like the midstream and Alpine High we've done things to protect that cash flow or through acquisitions there's ways to fund those. So I think as we go into 2019 we're in a position today where with the capital program, we can ratchet that up or down if necessary. So it's just something we'll have to kind of look at.","John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC","Okay. No, that's fine. I didn't figure you'd be putting any on, but I was just asking. And then Altus closes this month, end of month, mid-month, or...","John J. Christmann IV - Apache Corp.","Yeah. I'll let Brian...","Brian W. Freed - Apache Corp.","Yeah, this is Brian. The proxies were mailed out on October 22 and we've got the Shareholder Meeting scheduled for November 6 with the close and funding scheduled for November 9, and at that point in time the ticker symbol will change to ALTM and the name will change at closing to Altus Midstream from Kayne Anderson Acquisition Company.","John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you. Good morning, everybody. John, I wonder if you could help me with really a bit of a production visibility question for next year, and it's really about how we should think about the fractionation start-ups and how we could see your liquids yield evolve from the wet gas you've got currently. Because, obviously, that's going to be a pretty significant catalyst, I think, for your step change in cash flow as you go over the next year or so.","John J. Christmann IV - Apache Corp.","Yeah, I think, Doug, clearly 2019 will be an inflection-point year for the NGLs at Alpine High. If you look at 2018 to 2020, we showed a transition where our NGLs would grow from 10% in 2018 to 30% in 2020. We've got one Cryo coming on in the second half \u2013 or the back end of the first half of the year. Then, we got two coming on in the second half. So, it'll all happen, kind of start happening second and third quarter of next year.","Stephen J. Riney - Apache Corp.","Yeah. And, Doug, I'd just add to that. Our contract with Enterprise provides for a ramp-up of volumes to 205,000 barrels a day and that's a fixed contract. They've got to take it. It's a fixed-fee structure for transportation and fractionation. And as I said in my prepared remarks, we actually have some options to even further enhance margins beyond just a Mont Belvieu mixed NGL barrel pricing netted back to Alpine High.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Steve, just to be clear, when would you expect to fill that capacity? I know it's a bit of a stretch question, but can you provide any visibility as when you would expect that volume to be achieved?","Stephen J. Riney - Apache Corp.","No. Not at this time, Doug. I think what I'd recommend is let's wait until the next plan rollout in February and we could probably have a better view of that kind of stuff. But, obviously, I'll just state the obvious and that is as we \u2013 we're bringing on three Cryo facilities in 2019, two more in 2020. That won't be the end of it. But, obviously, as we bring on Cryo facilities, the goal would be to have a drilling schedule that fills those as quickly as possible.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you. My follow-up, John, I don't know how you want to deal with this one. It's on Egypt. It's about, I guess, seven or eight years now since everything kind of went toes up in the country and things have changed dramatically, as you know. I'm just curious, we haven't really had a formal update on your plans for Egypt with the new seismic program and so on.","The visibility for the sustaining business sort of growth plan going forward. And it strikes me that the market could probably benefit from getting a refresh on that. I'm just wondering if you can update. Do you have any intention of doing that and any high-level plans that you can share as you think about the next several years?","John J. Christmann IV - Apache Corp.","Well, I mean, if you look back, we've been able to maintain our Egypt production level with a much lower rig count. We were running 28 rigs in Egypt in 2014 and we got down as low as six or seven. We've been running around 12 rigs, and we've been able to really stabilize that, and that's with the (48:22) starting to get towards the point where it would go on decline. So we've done a really, really good job. And I think our productivity and capital efficiency in Egypt has gone up significantly, and that was really two discoveries Ptah and Berenice, which helped drive that, which we had in early 2015.","If you look at the new seismic, I think, as we \u2013 with the new concessions, and we get the new seismic back, we would be in a position, Doug, to kind of unfold some of that as well. So, we've expanded a lot over the last three years. We've landed a lot of acreage in Egypt. And as I mentioned earlier, we've got great infrastructure and a great track record.","And so we look at Egypt as an area we can continue to grow the free cash flow. You can't underestimate what we've done with that and what it's been able to do for us over the last several years and grow our production. So Egypt's actually an improving position for us as well, and we've got better there over the last couple of years. And I think once we get the new seismic back, and then we would be in a position to unfold that a little.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Just one closing comment from me, John, if I may. It's just an observation more than anything else. This asset obviously throws off a lot of free cash. The market still seems to apply a data discount to that asset. And if you could provide some visibility on the sustainability of that free cash, I think it would really pay dividends. That's really what I was getting at. So I appreciate your answer. Thanks.","John J. Christmann IV - Apache Corp.","That's a great comment, Doug. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Leo Mariani from Nat Alliance. Your line is open.","Leo P. Mariani - NatAlliance Securities","Hey, guys. I wanted to dig into the forward plans at Altus a little bit. Obviously, I know the vote is a handful of days away. I guess you've got a central closing coming up soon as well. But assuming everything closes as planned, how do you see, sort of, the progress over the next couple of quarters? I know you guys have some significant options to purchase some equity interests and some rather large pipelines. I know you guys have talked about our other organic growth opportunities. Can you just, kind of, refresh everyone in terms of what you plan to do here in the short term when all this post close?","Brian W. Freed - Apache Corp.","Yeah, this is Brian Freed. I'll address that a little bit. I mean, quite frankly, what we have in front of us, we've got a lot to say grace over in front of us in terms of the work we've got in front of us. We've got the Cryos that John mentioned that need to come on in 2019 and the equity options that we will start exercising by the end of this year.","We've got a supplement out on the website that shows when some of those option exercise dates are, so you can dig into the details there. So I won't burden this call with all of that. But we do expect to start exercising these options by the end of the year, and then we have a lot of gathering and processing to continue to build out through the rest of this year and into 2019 as well, too.","Leo P. Mariani - NatAlliance Securities","Okay. That's helpful. And I guess just jumping over to Suriname, obviously an area you guys are quite excited about here. I wanted to see if you could give us a little bit more color on, sort of, the capital plan there for 2019 in terms of how much money you plan to throw at it and how many potential wells you guys could drill.","John J. Christmann IV - Apache Corp.","Well, I mean, it's a large area. We've got about 1.4 million acres. There are number of prospects that are very high quality. We will drill at least one well in 2019, and there will be options to make that program much larger. So that's one of the things we're looking at. But we'll include at least one well.","Leo P. Mariani - NatAlliance Securities","Okay. That's helpful. And I guess, is that well likely to, kind of, come by midyear? What can you tell us on timing there?","John J. Christmann IV - Apache Corp.","I would \u2013 I'd probably say late second, early third quarter, likely, but...","Leo P. Mariani - NatAlliance Securities","Okay. Thank you. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Richard Tullis from Capital One Securities. Your line is open.","Richard Merlin Tullis - Capital One Securities, Inc.","Hey. Thanks. Good morning, John. Just a couple of questions on the exploration side. I know that's not a topic discussed all that much in E&P land these days. But regarding the planned Surinam well next year, how are you able to use that data from the other recent unsuccessful wells drilled offshore Surinam by all the operators? And then you had your own well there. How useful was that data in trying to plan your 2019 well?","John J. Christmann IV - Apache Corp.","Well, I mean, I think if you go back and look at our Block 53, the two wells that we've drilled over the last, call it, three years, we've learned a lot from both of those. You look at 58, it's positioned differently. It's in a different part of what's a very large basin. It's a very large block, so we feel like that Block 58 is ideally positioned. And it really \u2013 the results outbound the Block 58 will not have an impact on our view of Block 58.","Richard Merlin Tullis - Capital One Securities, Inc.","Okay. John. Thank you for that. And then just to continue with exploration, you talked a little bit about expiration potential in the portfolio. What areas globally look interesting to Apache at this point, either as operator or non-operator? And what percentage of the budget, as you start to generate the excess cash flow moving forward, 2019 plus, what percentage of the budget could expiration represent going forward?","John J. Christmann IV - Apache Corp.","Well, it's something you've got to keep in check. If you look on our international portfolio, of our international capital, we spend some expiration dollars in both the North Sea and in Egypt, right, so. And those are continual programs that we've had great results from, so there's a small portion there. Suriname is the one place outside where we operate today that we will be active next year.","And then on the unconventional side, it's more you U.S. focused and it's more oil focused, and those are things where we don't spend a lot of money because we're looking at things that are off the radar from other companies where we think we can add value, pick up meaningful acreage positions at low cost that could have a really high impact. And so that's how we approached the unconventional side. But you've got to keep it in check. You've got to have the lion's share of your capital going into your development programs that are driving your returns and your volume growth and the cash flow.","John J. Christmann IV - Apache Corp.","That's it for me. Thanks a bunch, John.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Hall from Heikkinen Energy Advisors. Your line is open.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Thanks. Good morning. Maybe following up a little bit on the last couple on Suriname and exploration. How are you thinking about ownership on that Block 58? You currently have 100% on it. Is that something you likely want to sell down? And is that probably something you'd do before, or would you wait for the results after the first test on that block?","John J. Christmann IV - Apache Corp.","Michael, it's something we own 100% today; there is quite a bit of interest in the block. And so that's just something we'd have seen the future.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Okay. Sounds like you're up for taking the full interest on the first well?","John J. Christmann IV - Apache Corp.","We're definitely prepared. We like the risk to upside profile. Wells are not real expensive. You're probably $55 million to $60 million tops for one of the deeper water wells. So it's something we can easily do a couple wells on. So we'll just see. It's a block we are very excited about, and we'll just kind of see how it unfolds.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Okay. That makes sense. That's helpful. Thanks. And then I guess bigger picture, just thinking about the 2019 outlook relative to the kind of back half experience here in 2018. I know obviously, we've been \u2013 you've been executing on production, taking that up, pointing to the high-end of the 2019 production guide or prior guide. But at the same time, capital has also been moving higher in the last couple of quarters. How do we get comfortable with that planned ramp down and quarterly spending rate? What are the key drivers of giving you confidence in planning around that at this point?","John J. Christmann IV - Apache Corp.","Yeah, I'll let Steve give you some specifics. But if you look at our last six quarter, we've been running a pretty flat activity set. And if you look at the actual EMP capital, it's been pretty flat. I mean you saw little bit of a rise in the back half this year and that's been toward acreage, but I will let Steve give you little bit more color.","Stephen J. Riney - Apache Corp.","Yeah, I think that's the story, Michael. I mean for four quarters in a row, leading up to third quarter, we've spent less than $750 million per quarter on upstream capital, if you just set aside the Midstream stuff and Alpine High. In the fourth quarter, of 2018, we've guided to $800 million, but $65 million of that is going to be exploration land acquisition, kind of a one-off land acquisition, so really we're under $750 million underlying kind of baseline upstream spending in the fourth quarter of 2018. The third quarter, there's a bit of a lumpiness to it.","Again, there's about $800 million excluding land acquisitions in the third quarter, and that's just a bit of lumpiness, why that's over $750 million. There's a lot of lumpiness around activity on completions. Remember, we took the completion holiday and we had some backlog there. We upsized quite a number of those completions, so there's some lumpiness and some facility spending and some other type of stuff. So I would say that the exception was the third quarter at $800 million on an underlying baseline upstream spend rate as opposed to the second half.","The other way to look at it is second half of 2018, we'll spend, in round numbers, $1.65 billion. We've got a little over $100 million of land acquisitions, lease extensions and acquisitions, so we're just \u2013 we're a little bit over $1.5 billion in the second half of 2018 and running at about $1.5 on a half year basis going into 2019. So I just, I think that the number in the third quarter was the anomaly and the exception. It's not underlying, we're spending at or even possibly slightly below for most of the last four quarters $750 million a quarter in the upstream. And we're not meaningfully changing activity levels here.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Okay. And I guess on that land acquisition site in the fourth quarter, that $65 million you highlighted, sorry if I missed, where is that roughly?","Stephen J. Riney - Apache Corp.","We have not, Michael, we have not disclosed that. It's part of our unconventional programs that would be areas that at some point in the future we would talk about.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","In the U.S....","Stephen J. Riney - Apache Corp.","Some portion of that, Michael, is lease extensions ending and some of it is new lease acquisition.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Okay. Thanks very much.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Mr. John Christmann.","John J. Christmann IV - Apache Corp.","Well, thank you all for joining us today. I would like to leave you with three key takeaways from today's call. First, Apache had an excellent quarter both operationally and financially. We significantly exceeded consensus earnings and cash flow estimates. We beat and raised our production guidance for the third quarter in a row and we outlined a strong 2019 view.","Second, we are planning a year-over-year reduction in upstream capital in 2019 and upon closing, Altus Midstream will fund our Alpine High infrastructure spend. This creates good visibility to free cash flow for which a high priority will be share repurchases. And lastly, we are realizing significant benefits from our diversified portfolio and strong leverage to oil prices. In 2019, as we ramp are wet gas volumes at Alpine High in conjunction with Cryo installation, we will see a step function change in margins and cash flow from the play.","I look forward to sharing our ongoing progress with you in the future.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call.

Before I dive into our results for the quarter I would like to take a step back to highlight the progress we have made so far this year.","We have significantly streamlined and high graded our portfolio. The result is a focused North American onshore position with significant visibility and an international portfolio, which delivers tremendous free cash flow and very good exploration upside, as evidenced by our announcement last week regarding recent discoveries in the North Sea, along with our consistent exploration success in Egypt.","We have strengthened our balance sheet and liquidity. We used the proceeds from asset sales to pay down debt and to increase our cash position. During this time, we also refreshed and extended our credit facility. Apache's balance sheet is now a leader amongst our peers, which we have accomplished without issuing new equity.","Over the last third quarters, we reduced our drilling and completion program to a level that is appropriately aligned with the current commodity price environment. Notably, we generated a cash flow to CapEx surplus in the second quarter and would have maintained a surplus in the third quarter if commodity prices hadn't further eroded. This need for spending discipline is something that many in the industry are just beginning to realize and pursue. We have now achieved a nearly 30% reduction in our average well cost compared to a year ago. We have relentlessly pursued cost reductions both through supply chain efficiencies, as well as self-help through such things as improving wellbore and completion design. We made significant reductions in our run rate for both LOE and G&A costs, and we are taking steps to realize additional savings through the fourth quarter and into 2016 and beyond. We have delivered production growth both domestically and internationally, despite a dramatically reduced activity level. This result has been supported by our low underlying base decline, and today, we are again increasing our 2015 production guidance.","And lastly, we continue to leverage our technical expertise and experience to seek out potentially high impact, new resource plays by consolidating acreage and expanding our footprint within our existing operational basins. We remain highly disciplined in this effort. And it is important to note that we are not paying the high prices for acreage that are common in the high profile resource plays. Now let me turn to our third quarter results.","The third quarter was another good one for Apache as we delivered on our operational and financial guidance, made excellent progress on our cost reduction initiatives, and had tremendous success with the drill bit, most notably in the Permian Basin, Egypt and in the North Sea. As a result, we are increasing our 2015 production guidance range for both North American onshore and our international and offshore regions.","During the third quarter, WTI oil prices deteriorated to an average of $46 per barrel, which was a 20% decrease from the second quarter average. However, the impact on our capital program for the quarter was relatively small as we had the foresight to pace our spending based on a $50 WTI plan price for 2015.","As we indicated on our second quarter earnings call, our North American onshore production decreased sequentially in the third quarter, but the drop was less than anticipated. The decrease was primarily driven by facility downtime in the Permian, natural decline rates and the timing of well completions. We continue to expect North American onshore production volumes to increase for the fourth quarter, and we should exit the year with solid production momentum. Currently expect to finish the year at the high end of our upwardly-revised North American onshore production guidance range of 307,000 boe to 309,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, which reflects normal fourth quarter weather-related downtime. Should we experience unusually severe or extended weather disruptions, production may potentially move to the middle or low end of our new guidance range.","As I mentioned earlier, both Egypt and the North Sea have been performing very well this year. Production from our international and offshore regions averaged 180,000 boes per day during the third quarter. The key factors contributing to this strong performance were excellent production efficiency or uptime, strong sustained production from existing wells and significantly better-than-expected contributions from new wells completed during the quarter. As a result, we have increased our 2015 international and offshore guidance range, which Steve Riney will discuss along with other updated guidance items shortly.","Our CapEx in the third quarter, before leasehold, capitalized interest and non-controlling interest, was $762 million. This is down 16% from the second quarter and 38% from the first quarter and puts us well within our full-year guidance for 2015. Across all of our regions, we are continuing to pursue and deliver substantial capital cost improvements. For example, in the third quarter, our North American onshore well costs were down approximately 30% from a year ago, which represents an improvement from the 25% decrease we cited last quarter.","Now I'd like to turn to some of our key regional highlights for the quarter. During the quarter, we operated an average of 28 rigs companywide, 12 in North America, 10 in Egypt and six in the North Sea, which represents a decrease of six rigs from the second quarter. For the last two quarters, we have essentially been running our business at an activity level where cash flow was roughly equal to CapEx under a $50 WTI oil price deck. Given the decrease in oil price during the third quarter, we elected to defer the addition of two rigs in the Permian and one of our two planned rig additions in the Eagle Ford. As a result, we are decreasing the high end of our 2015 capital spending guidance range by $100 million to $3.8 billion. The deferral of these three rigs will not materially impact our 2015 production, but will result in a lower drilled-but-uncompleted well count at the end of 2015 than we previously expected.","In the Permian Basin, our production was 170,000 boes per day, down 2,100 boes per day from the second quarter. This was driven by a combination of facilities downtime and the timing of well completions. Despite these factors, our Permian production remained strong. This underscores the importance of our relatively low base decline rate of 22%.","Some notable activity during the third quarter came from new completions on our Condor lease at Pecos Bend in the Delaware Basin. We completed four wells that materially exceeded our type curve on a per lateral foot basis in their first 30 days. Returns in the Delaware remain very strong, as we have achieved average well cost reductions of approximately 40% since 2014.","In the Midland Basin, we brought our first well pad online at Azalea in Western Glasscock County and are seeing encouraging early results. This area has the potential for multiple landing zones, including upper and middle Wolfcamp and lower Spraberry targets. We also brought online four good wells in our Powell-Miller area, three with an average 30-day IP of more than 800 boes per day, and another with a 24-hour test rate in excess of 1,600 boes per day.","In the Central Basin Platform and Northwest Shelf, we are continuing to see excellent results from our horizontal Yeso play at Cedar Lake, which is delivering very attractive returns at these low oil prices. We have also dedicated resources to our water flood effort and other low-decline EOR opportunities. We have a significant low decline base in the Central Basin Platform, which helps underpin our lower underlying decline rate that I referenced earlier.","While our overall Permian activity levels are down substantially from 2014, we remain committed to testing the resource potential of several new areas across our significant acreage position and to identifying and unlocking additional resource for the long term.","Turning to the Eagle Ford. We brought eight wells online during the quarter in our Ferguson Crossing area with an average 30-day IP of 1,545 boes per day. We have made great progress in optimizing the completion design and increasing the productive capacity of these wells, while at the same time, continuing to drive down costs. We have one rig working in the Eagle Ford for the remainder of 2015.","In the Woodford\/SCOOP, we are in the early stages of delineating our approximately 200,000 acres gross and 50,000 net acres. During the third quarter, we brought online the Truman 28-6-6 #1H, which recorded a strong average 30-day IP rate of 1,949 barrels of oil equivalent per day. We have two rigs running in the Woodford\/SCOOP for the remainder of 2015 to continue delineation and to advance our understanding of this attractive acreage position.","In Canada, we put our seven-well Duvernay pad online in late October. Completion and connection of the pad came in under budget and the flow results we have seen to-date are very encouraging. The team is doing an excellent job with costs in Canada and we plan to drill another Duvernay pad during the upcoming winter season.","On our Montney acreage in the Wapiti area, we have received substantial interest from third parties regarding a potential joint venture with Apache and we are advancing these discussions. Our objective for the JV is to fund early-stage drilling and infrastructure. This will enable us to jump-start the investment program and begin to generate cash flow without having to divert our capital dollars from other areas of the portfolio.","Turning to our international operations; during the third quarter, Apache became the largest oil and gas producer in Egypt on a gross operated basis. We are very proud of this achievement and the fact that our gross production has returned to peak levels established back in 2011 and 2012. The key here is that while production is at peak levels, our percentage of oil and our margins are now considerably higher when normalized for commodity prices. It should be noted that these production levels have been achieved despite a 35% reduction in capital spending year-to-date compared to 2014.","This highlights the operational success for our teams and our ability to do more even in a reduced capital environment. Our strategy in Egypt is to target primarily oil and liquids reservoirs and to keep our production profiles as stable as possible. Our late 2014 discoveries of the Ptah and Berenice fields have helped advance this goal in 2015. During the third quarter, gross production from these two fields peaked at over 26,000 barrels of oil per day. Our objective is to sustain production from Ptah and Berenice at a high rate for as long as possible through the drilling of additional development wells.","In addition to Ptah and Berenice, we have seen new discoveries across multiple concessions this year, which will continue to support our production and free cash flow generation in Egypt.","In the North Sea, we had a strong third quarter as our sequential production grew more than 4,200 barrels of oil equivalent per day from the second quarter. We set a new production efficiency record of 92% uptime in the third quarter as we experienced minimal platform maintenance downtime. We also benefited from better-than-expected performance from new wells drilled in both the Forties and Beryl fields. As we look ahead to the fourth quarter, I should point out that we are likely to experience more weather-related downtime, some of which has already occurred in late October and early November.","On October 30, we issued a press release, which announced three significant discoveries at our K, Corona and Seagull prospects, along with two high-rate development wells in the North Sea. While still early in the development phase, the ultimate reserve potential of the three discoveries combined could be greater than 70 million barrels of oil equivalent net to Apache. This represents a potential 50% increase over the 145 million barrels of total booked proved reserves for the North Sea at the end of 2014.","For more information on these discoveries and a review of our extensive North Sea exploration and development inventory, please join us for our North Sea Region Update webcast on November 17 at 9 a.m. Central Time. Similar to my comments on Egypt, it's important to note that the outperformance in the North Sea has been accomplished despite an approximate 25% reduction in capital spend year-to-date compared to 2014.","In closing, as we look to 2016 and beyond, our organization and our balance sheet are well prepared for the possibility of lower for longer oil and gas prices. We have in place the planning, capital allocation and operational structure and focus that will enhance shareholder value, despite the challenging commodity price environment. Our singular focus is to optimize the growth of our enterprise, while improving returns.","We have made great progress so far; recognize that we have more to do. We are now working from a position of strength. We have a premium acreage position in North America and we have the people and the technology to grow it. We have best-in-class businesses running in the North Sea and in Egypt. These are prolific hydrocarbon basins with many years of exploration and development ahead of them. We have invested heavily in infrastructure in these regions over the last decade, and keeping this infrastructure full by its nature leads to very high rate of return projects.","We have right-sized our activity level and we have driven efficiency improvements relentlessly on both capital and expense. We have a strong balance sheet and good long-term liquidity. And most importantly, all of these improvements are starting to show up with strong results for 2015 and good momentum as we look forward to 2016.","We will remain focused on driving the expansion of our North American portfolio, as it is our primary growth engine for the future. However, our international businesses have a demonstrated track record of delivering very high rates of return, along with the ability to sustain production volumes through time and provide significant free cash flow back to the corporation. These are franchises that we will continue to invest in for the long term.","I will now turn the call over to Steve Riney.","Stephen J. Riney - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, John, and good afternoon. As John indicated, Apache had a very good third quarter. We have made excellent progress on both operational and financial fronts. We also still have much more to do. Today, I will highlight Apache's financial progress, which will include our financial results for the quarter, the results so far from our relentless focus on costs, a review of our balance sheet strength and liquidity position, our outlook for the remainder of 2015, and an update on our strategic planning process along with some very preliminary thoughts on 2016.","So let's begin with the third quarter financial results. As noted in our press release, Apache reported a GAAP loss of $5.7 billion or $14.95 per common share. Our results for the quarter include a number of items outside of our core earnings that are typically excluded by the investment community in published estimates. The most significant of those items is a ceiling test write-down of our oil and gas properties totaling $3.7 billion after tax.","As in prior periods, the write-down in the third quarter resulted from the continued low commodity price environment. Under full cost accounting, our upstream assets are carried at historical costs. Each quarter, we compare this cost basis to discounted after-tax future net cash flows, which are calculated using trailing 12-month average oil and gas prices with those prices and period-end costs held flat into perpetuity.","To the extent the net book value of the assets exceeds this amount the result is a ceiling test write down. Based on strip prices as of September 30, we anticipate a further ceiling test write-down in the fourth quarter. This expectation is detailed in our 10-Q.","In addition to the ceiling test write-down, other unusual charges during third quarter included a $1.5 billion charge for an increase in the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets, primarily due to a price environment which is unlikely to allow the realization of those tax assets for the next several years. And $446 million of other items, consisting primarily of $148 million for the impairment of our investment in the Australian fertilizer plant, $146 million for mostly price-induced impairments for gathering transportation and processing facilities, and $95 million of trailing tax effects associated with our previously-discontinued operations.","Our earnings for the quarter adjusted for these items totaled a loss of $21 million, or $0.05 per share. Offsetting the low-price environment were positive results on the operational side, including strong delivery of production volumes across all regions, continued improvement in costs as our extensive efforts to reduce G&A and operating costs are showing through to actual results, and great progress in capital efficiency, as we are getting more from every dollar invested.","Let me now turn to costs. The low oil price environment and reduced activity across the industry are continuing to result in downward pressure on costs. As oil and gas prices began to soften late last year, Apache moved decisively to ensure a leading-edge position to capitalize on cost deflation in the oil service industry.","Since that time, we have made continual progress reducing both capital and operating costs. Capital spending year-to-date continues to track in line with our expectations. We have invested $3.8 billion through the first nine months of the year. As we have stated in the past, our guidance on capital spending excludes capital attributable to our one-third partner then Egypt, capitalized interest, leasehold purchases and capital associated with divested LNG and associated operations.","Excluding these items, we have spent $2.9 billion through the first nine months of 2015. This level of spending is tracking in line with our prior guidance. On the lease operating expense side, our third quarter LOE was $9.03 per boe, which is 18% lower than the third quarter of 2014.","On a year-to-date basis, we are averaging $9.33 per boe, which is 12% lower than the same period last year. So we continue to make significant progress on bringing down operating costs.","On our second quarter conference call, we reported a 25% decline in our run rate of gross G&A costs. At that time, we stated our goal was to enter 2016 with a gross G&A run rate of approximately $700 million, representing a decrease of over 30% from our run rate of more than $1 billion in the fourth quarter of 2014.","As we further refine our 2016 budget, we continue to find additional G&A reduction opportunities and are now tracking slightly ahead of our goal. We will discuss this in more detail when we announce our formal 2016 budget in February.","Next, I would like to make a few comments regarding our balance sheet and liquidity position. Over the past year, we implemented a number of measures, which has significantly improved our overall financial strength. Today our balance sheet and liquidity are amongst the strongest in the industry and we have accomplished this without issuing additional equity. We have made tremendous progress in a very short period of time and I believe this will serve us well as we continue through a difficult and unpredictable industry environment.","So far in 2015, we have paid down $2.5 billion of debt. Currently our net debt is less than two times annualized 2015 adjusted EBITDA. We have extended our nearest long-term debt maturity to 2018, with only $700 million maturing prior to 2021. We have restructured and refreshed our current credit facility at $3.5 billion, which now matures in June 2020. And we have retained $1.7 billion of cash liquidity.","And to ensure that we sustain this strong position, we have reduced our activity to a level where we can attain cash neutrality in the current price environment.","I would like to remind everyone that as previously discussed, the repatriation of proceeds from some of our foreign asset sales has triggered a U.S. income tax payable of approximately $560 million. Actual cash payment of this liability will occur in the fourth quarter of this year, thus some might consider our net debt of $7.1 billion at the end of the third quarter as closer to $7.7 billion.","However, so far in fourth quarter, we have signed agreements for the sale of non-upstream assets, which will bring in approximately $500 million in cash proceeds. $391 million of this is for our interest in the Australian fertilizer plant, which we have already closed and proceeds have been received. The remainder is associated with various non-core assets with no associated reserves or production. We expect to close those transactions in the fourth quarter or early 2016.","In total, the proceeds from non-core asset sales largely offset the impact of the previously-mentioned tax payment on our net debt the end of the third quarter. Apache's strong balance sheet and liquidity position provide both security for the near-term, as well as tremendous flexibility for the long-term. We can comfortably fund the highest-quality projects across the portfolio, as well as our exploration, strategic tests and new play programs. We can do this within our continued cash flow from operations, while retaining significant flexibility for any strategic opportunities, which may arise in the future.","We anticipate a successful finish to 2015, as Apache continues to deliver strong operational results. Therefore today, we are increasing our production guidance and decreasing our capital guidance for 2015. We are increasing our full-year guidance for 2015 North American onshore production to a range of 307,000 boe to 309,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. On a pro forma basis, this represents more than 2% year-over-year growth, despite significantly-reduced capital spending.","John highlighted the extensive drilling and operating success we are enjoying internationally as well. Accordingly, we are raising our full-year 2015 international and offshore production guidance to 172,000 boe to 174,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, up 6,000 boe from our previous guidance of 164,000 boe to 168,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. On a pro forma basis, this represents year-over-year growth of 10% to 12%, despite significantly reduced capital spending and demonstrates the quality of our international portfolio.","With regard to our 2015 capital spending, we are lowering the top end of our guidance range to $3.8 billion from $3.9 billion. This reflects our decision not to pick up three rigs in the onshore U.S. during the back half of the year, which John spoke about in his prepared remarks.","In the planning front, Apache has taken significant steps towards achieving our objectives of enhancing returns, while living within our mean on a cash flow basis. As we refine our plan for 2016 and beyond, we will continue to make further progress.","Our plan includes a rigorous process for capital allocation to our highest-quality opportunities, while achieving an appropriate balance between short, medium and long-term capital investment horizons. This is particularly important considering the price environment we are in today and the outlook for the future.","As we look specifically at 2016, we are actively evaluating multiple scenarios with respect to commodity pricing and capital allocation. We are not in a position to provide guidance ranges for 2016 as our review is still underway. I will share, though, that the plan will be based on a few key things, which we have established this year. Notably, we will plan a capital program, which we believe will keep us cash flow neutral for the year. We will not attempt to balance cash flow within each quarter, but instead to level-load activity for the year. We will fund the capital program from operating cash flows; we will not use asset sales.","We have not yet finalized the capital allocation plan for 2016 and are not prepared to provide a view on production volumes. However, we are prioritizing capital to projects providing the best combination of highest rates of returns, greatest value for the future, and a bias toward near-term production and earnings. We will provide more specific guidance, including our production outlook in February, when we discuss the 2016 plan in more detail.","Finally, I would like to address one of our accounting methodologies, which we are examining for a possible change. In order to more closely align our financial reporting and to create more comparability with our large cap E&P peers, we are evaluating a conversion from full-cost accounting to the successful efforts accounting method. The primary reasons we are contemplating the change is because successful efforts is more commonly used by our comparable peers, creates less long-term price-related volatility on the balance sheet, and more accurately reflects the matching of expenses within the period in which they are incurred, especially as it relates to exploration expense. We'll have more to say about this in coming quarters.","In closing, as we plan for the future, we are not idly waiting for commodity prices to recover. We have already taken calculated steps consistent with today's environment. As a result, we are well positioned to continue to profitably grow Apache, through an actively managed investment program in a potentially lower-for-longer commodity cycle. I look forward to a successful conclusion to 2015 and would now like to turn the call over to the operator for questions and answers.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from Pearce Hammond with Simmons & Company.","Pearce Wheless Hammond - Simmons & Company International","Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Just to follow-up on the commentary just now about matching cash flow with CapEx, would that include the dividend or would the dividend be upside of that?","Stephen J. Riney - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes. For 2016, our goal would be to match that including the dividend. So it would be cash flow neutral.","Pearce Wheless Hammond - Simmons & Company International","Including the dividend. Okay, great. And then I know you're working through this still, but could you provide any color on what you think maintenance CapEx might be to hold exit rate 2015 production flat through 2016?","John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hi, Pearce, this is John. What I would say is the best thing to do is look at 2015 right now. I mean, we've guided to $3.6 billion to $3.8 billion of CapEx spend. As you will recall in February, we guided to relatively flat North American production and slight growth internationally. When you look at the CapEx levels, we had $1 billion outspend in the first quarter alone for this year. When you look at the capital numbers, clearly now, with the updated ranges today, at 307,000 boe to 309,000 boe on North America and 172,000 boe to 174,000 boe on international, we're showing 2% plus growth in North America and 10% to 12% growth on the international side on that type of capital program.","I think the best thing we can do given this price environment; the commodity price is going be a big driver. As Steve mentioned, we're going to live within cash flow. And so as we start to pour that plan, that's a big key. And I'd say, looking into 2016 with the reductions we've had on the cost structure side, specifically on the costs we have in the house at this point at 30% down, capital's going to continue to go further. I can also tell you that a lot of that CapEx this year was spent early in the year when we had higher costs. And we see things even now that are going to point to lower costs going forward. So, the best thing to do is look at what we've done this year and kind of translate off of that.","Operator","Your next question comes from Evan Calio with Morgan Stanley.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good afternoon, guys. Maybe just a follow-up on that, the 2016 budget parameters. I mean you say that living within cash flow excludes asset sales and includes the dividends. So, do asset sales then just create a buffer on your balance sheet? How do you contemplate the redeployment of those proceeds such as the $500 million announced in the quarter? I mean it's been a relatively sizable program and just curious how you think about that capital coming back into the business.","Stephen J. Riney - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. I'll let John comment on this as well. But I think at this point in time, the right answer to that question is the fact that we're not contemplating any material asset sales in 2016. And therefore, we're not planning to spend the proceeds on any of those. And therefore, cash flow neutrality needs to be on an operating basis. Now, that's \u2013 I'd just caution all of that with the fact that we're not going to get dogmatic about being cash flow neutral. And we reserve the right to not be cash flow neutral. But it's going to be \u2013 it's a prudent assumption going into the year at this point in time. And then 2016, I have no doubt, will be just as exciting as 2015 has been. And we'll, no doubt, adjust plans as we go through the year. But I think the prudent thing to do at this point in time is to go into the year planning on being cash flow neutral.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it, I would agree. Maybe my second, if I could, following up on the comments on the JV process, the positive progress there and then the plans to run three rigs in Canada next year versus zero today. Can you discuss the cost environment in Canada and how you kind of see those returns stacking up against the rest of your portfolio? I presume that the JV details could also augment those returns for you. If you could.","John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","In general, Evan, we want to remain cash flow neutral in Canada. I mean what I don't want to do is take cash flow from our Lower 48 properties and spend that in Canada. So that's the main reason why we are looking at and are making progress on a JV in the Montney. And the way that would be structured is we would be using other capital to get that program kicked off.","In terms of how the Montney and the Duvernay compete in terms of \u2013 they compete very nicely with the portfolio. And I'm going ask Tim Sullivan to dig in a little bit on the cost structure we're seeing on the Duvernay at this point.","Timothy J. Sullivan - Senior Vice President-Operations Support","Yes. As John mentioned, we just put on the first Duvernay pad that we drilled. This was a seven well pad. It was a spacing test. Half of the section was designed to test eight wells per section; the other half to test six wells per section. We're going through a third party facility. So, we're a little bit curtailed, we only have four of the wells online. But those four wells are doing just under 13 million boe (34:50) a day and 3,350 barrels of condensate per day. Again those are curtailed with the flowing tubing pressure of over 3,300 pounds.","Next week we hope to have that facility up and running and we'll be able to bring the other three wells online. And we should have everything flowing at capacity on December 1.","Now to the cost structure question, last year we spent about $18.1 million drilling one-off wells out there. We went to pad operations. This year where we had two walking rigs and we batch drilled each section of the well. We were able to reduce our well cost by 36%, 8% of that savings was due to foreign exchange, but the rest of it was primarily due to cost savings and operational efficiencies.","And most of those operational efficiencies were made up on the completion side. In those seven laterals we did 124 different frac stages and we pumped that in just six days. We averaged 7.9 fracs per day, with only 34 minutes between stages. And we got down to as low as 6 minutes between two of the stages.","So we were pumping 82% of the time when we had the equipment on location. And really the Canadian team there, we're really leveraging the learnings that we had from the Horn River drilling that we've done in the past.","And we see future costs there as we get our water facility in place even going down further and we think we can get these costs down to $8.5 million to $9 million per well.","Operator","Your next question comes from Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, good afternoon, everybody. John, I appreciate the disclosure I guess on the pursuit of a joint venture. If I could just have a quick follow-up. If we look at your position up there, it seems that, if I'm not mistaken, the bulk of your locations is in the area where you have the lowest working interest. And the highest working interest I guess you've got about half the number of locations, so I'm thinking Duvernay being the one with the small working interest. So when you think about structuring a joint venture and I guess getting someone to fund you or carry you, is that the kind of structure we should think about? In which case, what kind of working interest would you anticipate getting to and how would you think about that? I've got a follow-up, please.","John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, Doug, I got to be a little bit careful. We're talking about the Montney and it's an area we have 100%. So we do not have partners. We're not at this point looking at the Duvernay. The area you're talking about, the current wells we've got about 37.5%. We're in there with Chevron and, of course, their joint venture partner.","So, we're really talking about an area in the Montney where we have 100%. And that is the area we're looking at and I don't want to get into too much color because we're in the heat of battle of negotiations. But it would be structured where we would obviously be able to keep the majority and would get significant carry upfront, and which would unease our infrastructure and costs going, over the next couple years.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I appreciate that. I don't know if I missed that earlier. That would make perfect sense given your working interest there. Thank you for that. My follow-up is really about \u2013 I realize you don't want to give production guidance, but if you look at the spend level in the third quarter \u2013 and obviously there's a lot of moving parts on production declines and so on. But if you continue to spend at the third-quarter level, based on what we saw in Q3, what would you say your underlying decline rate would look like?","John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, I mean in terms of our decline rate, if I take North America, we're still running about a 25% overall decline, our Permian's about 22%. I do anticipate those numbers coming down as we start to look at the pace because we just haven't drilled as many new wells this year as we have historically. So I think those numbers will be dropping slightly, but it's early. We're still working through those planned numbers. The one thing I would say about the back half of the year, as we alluded to on the call, with the drop in prices we held off picking up three rigs, two in the Permian and one in the Eagle Ford. And it's going to have very minimal impact; we're still in a position to raise guidance on our North American position. So, we feel good about our properties, we feel good about how we're executing and we're really starting to see efficiencies drive into the numbers.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great stuff. I will jump back in queue. Thanks, John.","Operator","And your next question comes from Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs.","Brian A. Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Good afternoon.","John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hi, Brian.","Brian A. Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","How are you thinking about the role of the international assets here, particularly in light of some of the positives you reported on in Egypt and the North Sea? Are there any changes in, A, how these areas are competing for capital relative to the rest of the portfolio, and B, the strategic thoughts on retaining versus divesting?","John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","No, Brian, I think at this point, when we look into the future, our primary growth is going to come from North America. I think you have to recognize the benefit of the portfolio. And we came out with that early in the year with the drop in prices, and the international both are less sensitive to the drop in oil price and you've seen that come through in cash flow from both those operations.","Secondly, if you take Egypt and take Ptah and Berenice, tell me how many places in the world you can have a discovery and within seven, eight months you're producing from two handfuls of wells to 26,000 barrels of oil a day? So we've got quick tie-in, quick infrastructure to those things, so very high rates of return.","In the North Sea, there's a couple of things there. Number one, we've invested in the infrastructure. We spent $1.3 billion over the last decade at Forties and that infrastructure is in really good shape. That's why we can operate at 92%. In our Beryl area we spent over $300 million on the infrastructure there.","So, I don't want to steal the thunder from our November 17 update on the North Sea, but with those three discoveries, one of them is a little longer cycle time, Seagull, but the other two, I think you'll be surprised at how quickly we can bring those projects on through tie-backs to the infrastructure that's already in place.","So, we look at it as a portfolio. Our long-term growth is going to come from North America clearly, but in this price environment right now I've got a lot of optionality in the international and a lot of very high rate of return projects that bring immediate volumes that compete extremely well that we can tie in and complement. I think we've also proven through the exploration success that both of the international assets, those franchises have a lot of running room. And we'll get into more color on the North Sea here in just less than two weeks.","Brian A. Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great, thanks. And my follow-up shifts to the Permian Basin. I believe you said in the ops update here there are no rigs currently in the Barnhart area, which had been a source of your development. As you've shifted more towards the other parts of the Permian, can you talk about how we should look at execution and growth relative to when you were a bit more Barnhart-focused, and what you see as differentiating or we should expect as differentiating Apache's Permian position relative to others who are in the region?","John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, I mean I think the first and foremost thing, Brian, is we've got a very strong position across all the basins and that gives us lots of flexibility and optionality. Right now in the Permian we're really not in development mode, we are still doing a lot of strategic tests. We're in the process right now of drilling our three Spraberry shale wells that we're very excited about. So I think as we moved into the deeper parts of the basin, we've seen better results in the Midland Basin and I think the Delaware, we've got strong results in the area we've been active there, Pecos Bend and our Waha.","So I think what you'll see is we know how to execute, we've been in position where we've done a lot of pad drilling, and so we know what that means and our asset quality is just as good as anybody's. We just happen to be spread out across the multiple basins. So as we look at 2016, we won't be, and it depends on the price environment we're in as to how much development dollars we shift into Permian, but the big thing we're going be focused on right now is trying to mirror our cost structure to that price environment. And we're making headway there. And I think the one thing that you can look to is just our results on some of the plays. And I think we stand up well with anybody.","Operator","Your next question comes from Bob Morris with Citi.","Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thank you. John, in the Permian and pulling back two rigs you originally intended to add, does that mean you're going to ramp up now to only 16 rigs by year-end? And where are you right now?","John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Right now, we're at 14 rigs, Bob. I think we really just deferred. And all that's really done for us is we will end the year with fewer drilled-but-uncompleted wells. But we felt like that's the prudent thing to do right now based on where oil prices are and trying to feather our programs going into 2016, living within cash flow.","Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","And so the two rigs you won't add, where had you intended to add those rigs in the Permian?","John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","They were going to be predominantly Midland Basin, Central Basin Platform.","Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. And then the drilled-but-uncompleted inventory you ran, where is that? And is that steady-state or is that an inventory that you can draw down further in 2016?","John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, I mean first and foremost, we had guided to on the last quarter a range in the 80 to 100 range of drilled-but-uncompleted horizontals in North America. We now see that number ending the year around 60 plus. And it's not that during the quarter we consumed a lot of drill \u2013 picked up our completion pace. We just elected to wait. And the main reason is we've got visibility on costs coming down further. We've got a few drilling rigs that some term is rolling off in the next 30 days. And we're going to see those rig rates drop 37%, 38%. So we made a decision over this last quarter not to, in fact, we lowered the top end of our capital guidance range by $100 million. We decided not to spend that $100 million now, and we can wait and spend those in the future.","Operator","And your next question comes from John Herrlin with Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Generale.","John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC","Yes. Hi. Not trying to preempt the North Sea discussion that you will have in two weeks, but is it fair to say that you may dedicate a little bit more CapEx in 2016 to the North Sea?","John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","John, I wouldn't see, mix is changing too much. I mean, we've had, if you look at our capital this year, North Sea actually is down 25% over last year. So I don't see a major shift. You're not going to see us shift a ton of money by any means. But I think you're going to see we've got a lot more running room. And we've got some very material things that could come on that can be very impactful.","John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks, John. Regarding the switch to successful efforts, any kind of a ballpark sense about what kind of a balance sheet hit it would be?","John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I'll let Steve jump in on that one.","Stephen J. Riney - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I was hoping you'd answer that, John. No, I think it's too early to say. We've got in the 10-Q what we believe the fourth quarter hit to the balance sheet will be because of staying on full cost accounting and further softness in the commodity prices. But it's too early to say at this point in time what will happen if and when we switch to successful efforts to the balance sheet.","Operator","And your next question comes from Ed Westlake with Credit Suisse.","Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thanks for taking the question. Just coming back to the Midland. Obviously the industry has had success delineating various different zones in the Delaware. I mean you've got some very good wells out at the Pecos Bend. You've got a lot of wells or you've got some acreage, Wildfire, Azalea, Powell-Miller, over on the Midland. I'm just wondering if you are able to give us, having had more time working with the acreage, some kind of, as others do, inventory that works at say $50 in terms of well locations and then $60, $70. So some un-risked sense of the inventories in those two particular areas.","John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","What I would say, Ed, is we have not done a \u2013 I mean, obviously we're working those areas. We continue to test lots of zones. You look in the Midland Basin, we've got multiple zones in there we're testing. As I mentioned, we're about to drill or in the process of drilling Spraberry shale wells. You look at our Pecos Bend area; we've gone in now and added a second landing zone within the 3rd Bone Springs. So, we continue to make progress. We continue to test zones and really scope opportunities and work on the cost structure so that when we get to a position where we feel like it makes sense to put more rigs and more capital to work, we're ready to do that.","In terms of counts, we have not come out with a bunch of updated numbers. Really, the best look would be going back to what we did a year ago where we did a very deep look at North America on November 20, 2014. And obviously, we've got areas where things have, you know, we've drilled some things and things have expanded, but we haven't really come out with any major announcements or counts at this point.","Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","I guess the issue was the oil price was a lot higher and the cost structure is very different today, so I was just trying to get an update on that. But maybe switching to break-evens, I mean the Seagull discovery, I mean have you \u2013 I don't want to \u2013 again steal thunder from what's coming in a few weeks, but what sort of oil price do you think it would take to get that hooked back into infrastructure?","John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Not going to really get into that right now, but I can tell you the nice thing about the North Sea is the deliverabilities and the high rates those rocks bring. They're very forgiving; tremendous rock. We announced in the press release a very substantial test rate on a very, very low drawdown. So the deliverability is going be fantastic there, but I'm not in a position today to disclose F&D. That will be a longer \u2013 a little longer-range project. It's four miles kind of south of our Forties area, but we will have some color on November 17.","Operator","And your next question comes from John Freeman with Raymond James.","John A. Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","So nice well results in the Delaware Basin, but what really jumped out at me in particular was you completed 22 wells in the area versus 12 last quarter, despite still using just the one frac crew. And so I'm trying to get an idea of \u2013 you completing nearly twice as many wells with the same number of frac crews. Is that all huge efficiency gains or is there some other moving parts that doesn't make the quarters comparable?","John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","No, I think, number one, is just the pace at which we had them, but number two, we are making tremendous headway on efficiencies everywhere. We also are getting wells drilled significantly faster as well as getting more wells fracked. Tim gave you some color on the Duvernay pad, how quickly those went off. We're seeing tremendous success operationally everywhere, and that's just a function of it doesn't take as much equipment to go as far as it did a year ago.","John A. Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay, great. And then on Egypt you disclosed that you've initiated this large seismic reprocessing project that you hope to have done by the end of the year. I guess I'm just curious sort of what kind of took place in the field that kind of drove the decision to have it; what you hope to kind of get out of that shoot or reprocessing? Excuse me.","Timothy J. Sullivan - Senior Vice President-Operations Support","Reprocessing?","John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","In Egypt.","Timothy J. Sullivan - Senior Vice President-Operations Support","Yeah.","John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","In Egypt.","Timothy J. Sullivan - Senior Vice President-Operations Support","And where is it, or?","John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","He asked the scope and what we thought we could get from it with the large reprocessing in Egypt.","Timothy J. Sullivan - Senior Vice President-Operations Support","Well, as you're well aware, the whole basis of our success in Egypt is that 3D seismic, and with continued technological advances, improved processing and basically combining previous shoots, adding new data, we just get a more clear picture of the same areas we've been working for years. So, all this is going to do is help us identify previously unseen prospects and continue to deliver inventory in future years.","John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And two perfect examples are Ptah and Berenice. I mean they're right there at our Khalda Offset area, right near our existing stuff. So, it's just a function of taking the technology up that can quantify and get really solid ties and \u2013 to the \u2013 some of the plays out there.","Operator","Our next question comes from Charles Meade with Johnson Rice.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Good afternoon, guys. John, last quarter you and Steve spent some time laying out your new planning process where you guys were running scenarios at three different price points for WTI, or for oil I should say. I was wondering if you could give us an update if you've moved where those prices are in your scenarios. And perhaps more broadly, as you've been working that process over the last several months, if you're finding any areas that are surprising to you either in terms of their rigidity or new areas of flexibility you've discovered.","John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Charles, we did move those. I mean we started the year with a \u2013 kind of a $50, $65 and $80, and we planned on $50 at the start, and then in April, May timeframe when things ran up into the mid-$60s we were using those decks. Clearly, we've moved those down. In the last call we talked kind of $45, $55, $65. We're not too far off of those cases as we think about things today. The one thing I would say is the resiliency of the projects moves a little bit. The bigger tie is what are you doing with gas prices and how does that link in with some of these plays that we've got that have a little higher GOR and gas rates? But in general, we're seeing projects and wells in every play that works very well and it's really a function of the cash flow that comes off of those scenarios and the cost structure assumptions are the biggest variables we're trying to get pinned down right now.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Got it, that's helpful. And that's also kind of a good lead in to my next question where I wanted to ask about the Eagle Ford, where you guys have turned in really some really good-looking rates there. But one of the things that I attuned to there is that you have 80% liquids and a lot of times that can include NGLs, which are kind of actually the lowest molecule on the totem pole right now. So can you \u2013 and I know the oil, gas, and maybe the NGL mix varies a bit as you go up and down dip in this play, but these most recent wells you've had in your Area A \u2013 the Eagle Ford, the Lambert and (54:58) where do those fall on the percentage of black oil?","John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I'll have Tim give you that exact number. I still think we're in the 55% range roughly in terms of black oil. The Area A wells, those are still within our Ferguson Crossing area. So if you go back to our November 20 update a year ago and you look at that type curve Area A, Charles, they're going to layer right in on those \u2013 on that type curve, which I think we gave those numbers specifically there. I'm looking over here if we've got the percentages from that type curve, but I know we disclosed those.","Timothy J. Sullivan - Senior Vice President-Operations Support","Yes, we can get back with you on those, Charles. We've got those numbers for that area.","Operator","Your next question is from Leo Mariani with RBC.","Leo Mariani - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey, guys. Just a question around the acreage acquisitions that you all were talking about. Looks like you did a healthy portion. You guys commented that you're sort of paying prices which were a lot less than some of these hot high-profile deals we've seen recently. Can you guys just let us know where are you concentrating the acreage acquisitions? Is it sort of Delaware, Midland, or Midcon? Can you just help us with where you're looking to buy?","John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Number one, we're within our core areas. Number two, we are looking at some things that would be significantly lower than what I'd call the retail prices that are being paid. And it's where we're applying technology and science and we think we've got some things that could be material. It is new ventures acreage, so there's always risk with that and that's why we wouldn't want to talk about it now. But we're talking significant multiples lower in terms of what that acreage might be viewed as and what it potentially could be worth. And I think that's the zip-code that we feel like makes the most sense in this price environment because we can pick it up and we can work the science and you can have something that could be material.","Leo Mariani - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. I guess jumping over to Egypt; you obviously had good performance in terms of your increases in gross production in the third quarter. I noticed that the net production, though, went down a fair bit in 3Q versus 2Q, despite lower commodity prices. What's driving that and how should we think about that going forward?","John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","It's the tax barrels. I'm going let Steve Riney give you the exact color on that.","Stephen J. Riney - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, Leo. As you said, rightfully, so gross production in the third quarter was about 3.5% above second quarter. And actually net entitlement to the venture owners, us and Sinopec, was also up about a little over 3%, about 3.5%. The issue is around tax barrels and tax barrels on a three-thirds basis for the PSC owners, tax barrels were down 20,000 barrels a day between oil and gas. And the reason for that, there's no economic effect of that. It's the in-quarter reimbursement of taxes associated with income taxable in Egypt. And the bottom line issue is in the third quarter, prices had declined to a point where there was practically no taxable income. As a matter of fact, in one month I think we had a negative tax barrel effect.","And so therefore both the tax, income tax expense and the barrels associated with reimbursing that income tax expense were much lower.","Operator","Your next question comes from Mike Hall with Heikkinen Energy Advisors.","Michael A. Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","A lot of mine have been answered, but I guess just curious on the longer-range outlook. You guys have talked about providing that in the past. Should we expect to hear about that in February as well, or what sort of I guess timeframe in your current thinking; when we will hear about that?","John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, Michael, we obviously will give you a full-year 2016 update in February, and we'll see how things look at that point. So, clearly we're working multi-year plans. But obviously with the volatility and the uncertainty around the prices right now, we're going to continue working that.","Michael A. Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","Okay. And then just looking at the mix of production in North America; got a bit more NGL relative to our expectations in gas. Is there anything driving that from an infrastructure standpoint or is that more the focus of the capital program from a reservoir perspective?","John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","No, I mean actually I think when you look at our numbers, and you look at 2014 and 2015, and our percent oil in 2014 averaged about 52.7% for the year, we'll be 52.5%. We're right in line. In fact if you add our NGLs in 2014 and 2015, 65%. So you step back, big picture there's virtually no change in our mix. And we have the luxury of being more liquids rich and heavy than a lot of others. I will say you see some small swings when we've ramped our programs down to some of the GORs and some of the programs.","For example, last quarter we brought on some gas here, Area A, Eagle Ford wells. If you look at our North Sea production, we've shifted more to the Beryl area where we've got a little higher GOR than we do at Forties, but I should say we get a very premium gas price up there, over $7.","When you look at the Permian right now, we've had as a percentage more in the Delaware. Those wells had the luxury of having very flat GORs, but they come on at higher levels. So it's just a function of the portfolio, but in general, if you step back and take a big picture look, it's virtually where it's been historically.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jeff Campbell with Tuohy Brothers.","Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","The first question I wanted to ask is if we could talk about the Canyon Lime upper interval. You highlighted shallower declines. I was wondering, are you doing anything to influence the decline? And while we're at it, how pervasive do you think the upper interval is throughout your acreage?","John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes, I'm going to \u2013 I'll let Tim Sullivan comment on the Quanah well on the Canyon Lime.","Timothy J. Sullivan - Senior Vice President-Operations Support","The Quanah well is a new landing zone. It's the only well that we've got in that landing zone. It's been producing about 2.5 months. The IP 30 on that was about 1,662 barrels of oil equivalent per day. In that 2.5 months it's cumed already 91,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day and is still doing just under a 1,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.","So, it is a standalone well, but it's just a function of getting the spacing right. We have not been curtailing production or anything. It's just a shallower decline and we're excited about that zone.","Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Okay, thank you. And I wanted to just ask another broader question. Not too long ago there was talk about revived industry interest in vertical Permian drilling based on returns. I was just wondering have you increased your vertical drilling any on that basis?","John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Jeff, we haven't. But I think, one thing I'll say we've got the luxury of having about 60 water floods and seven CO2 floods in the Permian. And we have a ton of vertical locations; infill locations that do make economic sense. And right now we do not have any vertical rigs running. That's an option that we could have for next year. But we have not made any decision at this point yet.","Operator","Our final question for today comes from David Tameron with Wells Fargo.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi, glad I got in. John, can you \u2013 if I think about the Permian and just obviously the slowdown in the rig count and look at production quarter-over-quarter down-ticking a little bit, gas up, oil down, when should we anticipate that inflection point as far as when we see stabilization and then move higher?","John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, I mean I think that really comes down to when we feel like it's time to go back to work with more rigs. And so I mean that's just a function of how much capital we want to spend and we made a decision not to add two more rigs here within the last quarter. We'll go and do 16 and see, but I mean that's all going to hinge off of cash flow and investable projects. I mean we've got a ton of inventory that they're chomping at the bit to drill, but it's just a function of trying to go back to our guiding principles of living within cash flow, focusing on our returns, focusing on the cost structure and growing value for our shareholders.","David R.

My name is Paige and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Apache Corporation Fourth Quarter and Full-year 2016 Results Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session.","I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Gary Clark, Vice President, Investor Relations. Sir, the floor is yours.","Gary T. Clark - Apache Corp.","Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us on Apache Corporation's fourth quarter and full-year of 2016 financial and operational results conference call. Speakers making prepared remarks on today's call will be Apache's CEO and President, John Christmann; Executive Vice President of Operations Support, Tim Sullivan; and Executive Vice President and CFO, Steve Riney.","In conjunction with this morning's press release, I hope you have had the opportunity to review our fourth quarter financial and operational supplement, which can be found on our Investor Relations website at investor.apachecorp.com.","I would like to note that the supplement posted this morning includes expanded production and financial guidance for 2017. Production numbers cited in today's call have been adjusted to exclude our non-controlling interest in Egypt and Egypt tax barrels. Please also note that we are now providing guidance for our Egypt-based operations that includes non-controlling interest and tax barrels such that analysts can reconcile their estimates to Apache's reported production numbers.","I would also call your attention to the updated production guidance we are providing for North America. We are now providing specific production guidance for the Midland and Delaware Basins, combined which represents Apache's primary growth engines.","Another minor change we have made for 2017 is that we are now including the Gulf of Mexico in our North American guidance. We're also providing more comprehensive capital guidance, which now includes all oil and gas capital investment, leasehold acquisition, capitalized interest and capitalized G&A, and we are continuing to exclude Egypt non-controlling interest capital from our guidance.","Finally, I'd like to remind everyone that today's discussions will contain forward-looking statements and assumptions based on our current views and reasonable expectations. However, a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from what we discuss today. A full disclaimer is located with the supplemental data on our website.","I will now turn the call over to John.","John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.","Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. On today's call, I will review our 2016 accomplishments, outline our 2017 strategic and operational objectives, discuss our capital spending plans and production outlook for the next two years, and I will conclude with an update of our Alpine High play.","First, I'd like to step back and take stock of the last two years and how we have repositioned Apache. The collapse in commodity prices which began in 2014 required a strategic response to improve the company's financial standing and our operational capabilities and to position Apache to thrive as prices recovered. We have accomplished all that and more.","The cornerstone of our approach has been strict capital discipline and cost structure rationalization, both of which have significantly improved the quality and economics of our underlying inventory as well as our ability to access and exploit its value for the future. We accomplished this through a rigorous and more centralized process for capital allocation, a more detailed long-term planning process, and through significant cost reductions in our operations and in our overhead structure.","For example, we significantly reduced activity Onshore North America where costs were not aligned with lower commodity prices, dropping from 91 rigs in the third quarter of 2014 to eight rigs at year-end 2016. And since 2014, we drove down average onshore well costs by 30% to 40% across key plays in North America. Our LOE per BOE is down 24% and we have reduced our gross overhead cost structure by more than $300 million.","As a result of these efforts, we were able to preserve our dividend, avoid issuing equity and maintain our investment-grade rating. We are now well prepared for a more constructive, albeit lower price environment, than prior to the downturn.","With the proven quality of our Midland Basin acreage and the recent addition of the Alpine High in the Delaware Basin, we have an inventory capable of delivering robust organic growth for many years. Though some commodity price softness may continue, we are comfortable increasing our capital investment, which will leverage the quality of our inventory and the progress we have made on costs over the last two years.","Now let me recount some of our key 2016 accomplishments. This was an exceptional year for Apache and another step forward in the positive transformation of the company. We exceeded our original production target, significantly lowered our cost structure and discovered an enormous new resource play in the Delaware Basin at Alpine High. Our operational improvements and exploration successes have positioned the company to deliver returns-focused growth for many years to come.","On this call last year, I outlined a series of strategic and operational objectives designed to guide the company through a potentially lower-for-longer commodity price environment. We delivered on all of them. Most notably, we focused our North American capital on strategic testing and completion optimization, and in doing so, significantly expanded our economic drilling inventory and demonstrated our ability to deliver well results better than offset operators.","We worked to streamline our North American portfolio through new acreage leasing, trades, and sales. We now have a more concentrated and contiguous position in the Permian Basin. We continued to drive cost efficiencies throughout the organization and achieved a 16% reduction in LOE per BOE from 2015 and we began the year with a conservative budget, which enabled us to increase activity levels late in the year as commodity prices improved. All of these efforts were necessary to position Apache for a strengthening commodity price environment. Our long-term focus has consistently been on delivering fully burdened returns-focused growth.","In the lower commodity price environment, allocating capital toward our free cash flow positive assets in the UK, North Sea and Egypt while investing in exploration was the optimal use of our capital. As commodity prices strengthened, deploying a greater proportion of our capital into developing our world-class Onshore North American assets, is better.","Our objective going forward will be to deliver returns-focused growth and our plan to support this objective includes: budgeting conservatively and maintaining flexibility to accelerate activity, if warranted; continuing our focus on costs and well optimization to maintain the structural efficiencies achieved over the last two years; increasing capital allocation to the Midland and Delaware Basins, where we have an extensive high quality inventory; initiating an optimized development program at Alpine High; investing to sustain long-term free cash flow generation from Egypt and the North Sea; and, finally, actively managing our portfolio and redeploying capital to higher-value opportunities.","Now I'll turn to the 2017-2018 capital budget. Our capital budget for this year is $3.1 billion, which is up more than 60% from 2016. Our 2017 plan assumes $50 per barrel WTI, $51 per barrel for Brent index crude, $3.15 per Mcf for NYMEX natural gas, and $5.25 per Mcf for UK indexed gas. At these price levels, our capital program will exceed anticipated operating cash flow. The gap will be covered by proceeds from non-core asset sales, $400 million of which has already occurred, and a realization of prices at the current strip. We have also put in place some oil price hedges to protect against downside price movements. Steve will cover these in more detail.","Our 2017 capital plan allocates nearly two-thirds or $2 billion to the Permian Basin. Of this amount, 90% will be directed to the Midland and Delaware Basins. This includes approximately $500 million for infrastructure construction at Alpine High, which will fund multiple pipeline connections along with the necessary compression, gathering, centralized processing facilities and tank batteries that will more than accommodate our planned volume ramp.","Internationally, we will invest to sustain long-term free cash flow generation in Egypt and the North Sea. Total international spending represents approximately $900 million or 29% of our 2017 budget, split fairly evenly between Egypt and the North Sea. We have also included $37 million for an exploration well in Suriname, which we expect to spud next week.","Outside of Suriname, our 2017 international opportunity set is primarily focused on development drilling and lower risk step-out exploration, where we have a long-standing track record of success. We are particularly excited about two exploration concessions that we recently received in the Western Desert of Egypt, our first award there in over 10 years. Should commodity prices further improve during the year and cash flows allow, incremental capital will be allocated primarily to the Midland and Delaware Basins.","Turning briefly to 2018, our preliminary capital outlook is for $3.2 billion in investment. This program is supported by anticipated volume growth and higher plan prices for 2018. Like 2017, our 2018 plan will be heavily weighted toward Permian investment. Our 2017 and 2018 plan capital program will initiate a significant and prolonged production growth ramp. I would note specifically the magnitude of our anticipated production growth in the Midland and Delaware Basins.","To assist in the production outlook discussion, we have provided a series of slides on pages 22 to 26 in our financial and operational review issued this morning with our earnings results. This includes a production forecast through the end of 2018. While our capital program has increased to reflect the objective of delivering long-term returns-focused growth, our production response will have a brief lag before transitioning to a strong growth trajectory.","We anticipate total production will decline to approximately 372,000 BOEs to 384,000 BOEs per day in the second quarter of 2017. This will be a result of three primary drivers. In preparation for the start-up of our Callater discovery in the third quarter of 2017, we have accelerated our annual North Sea maintenance turnarounds into the second quarter. These turnarounds would typically occur later in the year.","We have significant gas plant maintenance downtime scheduled in Canada for the second quarter of 2017 and investment in our lowest-margin North American assets was severely curtailed over the last two years and these assets are currently in decline. Importantly, none of this projected decline is in our higher-margin Midland Basin production, despite very low activity levels last year.","In the second half of the year, the North Sea should rebound sharply with the start-up of Callater. More notably, North America will begin a rapid and relatively consistent quarterly growth ramp, which should continue through the end of 2018 and beyond. This will be driven primarily by the combination of accelerating oil production in the Midland Basin and the start-up of Alpine High in the Delaware Basin. Our projected oil growth in the Midland Basin is underpinned by the impressive performance we are seeing in our most recent vintage wells. Tim Sullivan will provide more detail on our Midland Basin wells in his remarks.","At Alpine High, we anticipate having our first major sales line connection by July. Well connections and facilities commissioning will take place through the end of the year, accompanied by a material ramp in wet gas production. To put some numbers around our two-year growth profile, we expect total company production to increase by approximately 10% annually from the fourth quarter of 2016 to the fourth quarter of 2018.","Our Midland and Delaware Basin assets are projected to grow at a compound annual rate of 50% over the same time and drive the vast majority of Apache's overall production increase. Oil production growth in the Midland and Delaware will also be very strong with an annual growth rate of approximately 18%. We're very confident that Apache's portfolio can deliver on our production expectations through the end of 2018 and beyond. We are seeing outstanding drilling results in the Midland Basin and Alpine High continues to surprise us to the upside.","With that, I will conclude with a brief update on the Alpine High play and review our next steps as we begin to phase in well optimization and fuel development activities. Since first announcing Alpine High last September, we have made tremendous progress delineating the play. We have confirmed several things thus far. We have an extensive play fairway, which spans 55 miles and a 5,000 foot vertical column encompassing five geologic formations, each with multiple targets.","The hydrocarbon phase of this column ranges from dry gas to wet gas to oil. The entire Alpine High fairway is over-pressured with higher pressure gradients to the north and to the south. We have a second landing zone in the Woodford formation and most likely a third. We have productivity in the Pennsylvanian formation. And in the southern portion of the play, we have encountered the entire hydrocarbon column, improving productivity in the Woodford.","With these results, we now believe that Alpine High's resource and location count has increased significantly since last September. And we haven't changed our view on well economics. We will provide updates to these numbers in the future.","Importantly, we are beginning to optimize our wells using customized zone targeting, larger fracs and, in some cases, longer laterals. Combined with multi-well pad drilling we are confident this will demonstrate the economic value of the wet gas interval of Alpine High over the coming months. We continue to refer to Alpine High is a wet gas play, because that is what we have confirmed thus far.","As we have previously noted, we are delineating from the bottom-up and this process is not yet complete. This is a prolific wet gas play from which we expect a minimum of 3,000 drillable locations. A significant enhancement to the economics of the source rock interval at Alpine High is the lack of water in the target formations.","Once these wells produce the frac load, water production declined sharply, which results in significantly lower operating costs. Additionally, the field development program is not constrained by the need for extensive water handling infrastructure. As a result, even in the lower commodity price environment, this play is going to be very economic.","Turning to midstream and marketing, our efforts at Alpine High are advancing quickly. Because the play lies in an area with very little existing infrastructure, it provides the unique opportunity to design a greenfield fit-for-purpose system that optimizes processing and transportation of our production and will service Alpine High for the full life of the field. For now, we own 100% of the midstream as it allows us to control the pace and scope of the build out.","Alpine High is ideally situated with three major transportation lines located within 10 miles to the north and one major line to the south. The Waha hub which is located roughly 45 miles east of our acreage provides additional options for access to a wide range of domestic markets. Our location places us at the front of the line to deliver gas to Mexico as well as being advantageously positioned with LNG and petrochemical markets on the Texas Gulf Coast. Contract negotiations are well underway, and we see no near-term takeaway constraints as we prepare for first gas and the follow-on production ramp.","On the marketing front, we have been inundated with interest for both our natural gas and NGLs. Potential customers are looking for certainty of supply, and the thick hydrocarbon bearing zones at Alpine High can provide it.","In conclusion, Apache begins 2017 with an excellent opportunity set. Momentum will start to build around mid-year, with increased contribution from our pad drilling in the Midland Basin and the commencement of first residue gas sales at Alpine High. The Permian Basin will clearly be the driver of strong growth in the second half of 2017 through 2018 and well into the future.","While commodity price volatility may not be completely behind us, we have come through the downturn with a very strong financial position and the ability to fund future growth through cash flow and portfolio high-grade. We continue to have no desire to add leverage or dilute our equity holders.","Over the last two years, Apache demonstrated that we can play very good defense, and we now look forward to showing you our offense. With the plans, we have in place, we believe we will deliver highly competitive returns and top-tier Permian-driven growth.","I will now turn the call over to Tim.","Timothy J. Sullivan - Apache Corp.","Good afternoon. My remarks today will focus on 2016 production, expected activity in each of our regions during 2017, and a perspective on supply and service costs that we're seeing, particularly Onshore North America.","Turning first to production; our fourth quarter results reflect the impact of reduced CapEx and development activity throughout 2016. During the fourth quarter, North America Onshore production averaged 252,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, a 7% decrease from the third quarter. Our Permian operations produced an average of 149,000 BOE per day, down 6% from the third quarter.","As John noted, we expect overall North American production will continue to decline into the second quarter before shifting to a strong growth trend. Most of this decline will occur outside the Permian in regions where we have made relatively little capital investments over the past four quarters.","In the North Sea, our production in the fourth quarter returned to more normalized levels at approximately 70,000 BOE per day, a 12% increase compared to the third quarter, which was impacted by extended facility turnaround issues.","We are in initial planning stages for development of the store discovery that we announced on the last conference call. Our high-risk Canord (21:29) exploration well reached TD in the fourth quarter and did not encounter commercial quantities of hydrocarbons. We have drilled three successful exploration wells and only one dry hole since acquiring our 3-D seismic survey over Beryl in 2013.","Our gross production in Egypt during the fourth quarter declined approximately 2% on a sequential quarterly basis. On a net basis, excluding tax barrels and Sinopec's minority interest, production was approximately 90,000 BOE per day, a 7% decline from the third quarter, as higher realized prices resulted in Apache receiving fewer cost recovery barrels under our production, sharing and contract agreements. Please refer to our financial operational supplement for more details on our fourth quarter and full-year production.","Turning to operations; last year, our focus on operational improvements and strategic testing established a solid foundation for achieving the company's 2017 goals. As a result, we are now drilling more productive wells more efficiently, and you will begin to see the impact of these improvements this year as we increase development activity primarily in the Delaware and Midland Basins.","Our financial and operation supplement highlights some recent performance results from well optimization we implemented last year in the Midland Basin. This includes the use of improved targeting, drilling longer laterals, and more advanced completion designs. We have updated these cumulative curves with additional wells and more days on production since we first showed them in September. The bottom line is that we continue to see wells on our core acreage in the Midland Basin outperforming peers in the area.","Apache concluded 2016 by adding three additional rigs in the Midland Basin, bringing our total rig count in the area up to five. We were at only one rig for most of 2016. These rigs are dedicated to long-term pad development drilling and our core acreage will enable us to place 25 wells on production during the first half of 2017. This is a significant increase from the nine Midland Basin wells placed on production in the second half of 2016 and will put the Midland Basin on a positive growth path.","We are excited about moving forward with a multiyear, multi-rig drilling program that is designed to generate production from some of our best wells and our best rock. Most recently, our five-well Lynch pad at Wildfire came online last quarter with production from the Middle Spraberry, Lower Spraberry and Wolfcamp B formations. This pad exhibited excellent 24-hour IPs, 30 day IPs and cumulative 60 day oil production. Our next pad at the Powell field is in early stages of flow back on six wells and began oil production last week. Following that, a nine-well pad at Azalea will go online in April.","During 2017, we expect to average 15 rigs in the Permian Basin and drill approximately 250 wells. Our 2017 Permian Basin rig count comprises five rig lines and two frac crews in the Midland Basin. Three rigs drilling in the Delaware Basin outside of Alpine High, one rig on the Northwest Shelf drilling in the Yeso play and one vertical rig dedicated to improved recovery in the Central Basin Platform.","In addition, we will have a four-rig to six-rig program at Alpine High. To accelerate well completions and data collection, we added a second frac crew at the start of this year. Elsewhere Onshore North America, in Oklahoma, we will run a targeted drilling program in the SCOOP\/STACK play. We have a large inventory of locations in this play and total drilling costs have come down as we've improved our completion techniques. We expect to drill four wells in the MidContinent this year primarily for the purpose of holding acreage. In Canada, we plan to drill a total of 10-wells this year.","In the first half of the year, we will drill out a six well pad in our Kaybob Duvernay play with production from those wells anticipated around mid-year following winter break up. We'll also drill three Montney 10 year wells in our Wapiti area in 2017.","In the North Sea, we will operate an average of three rigs for the year, which includes two platform rigs and two semi-subs on rig sharing agreements. We plan to drill 15 wells to 16 wells this year. We've pulled forward our annual plant turnaround in the North Sea to accommodate first production at Callater. The net effect of this downtime and new production is that we expect the first half 2017 North Sea production of approximately 55,000 BOE per day and second half production at roughly 70,000 BOE per day.","Our gross production in Egypt during 2017 is expected to be down slightly, about 2% from last year. This is primarily the result of an expected decrease in lower margin gas production as our large cost of field begins to decline. We will run eight rigs to 10 rigs during the year and drill 90 wells to 100 wells. The two new concessions awarded to Apache in November should be signed during the second quarter, and we plan to commence drilling operations in the fourth quarter.","To support development on our existing acreage and the exploration on our new concessions, we will initiate a large continuous 3-D seismic survey program. This will take place over the coming months and provide newer vintage, high resolution imaging of the substrata across our Western Desert position, allowing us to build and high-grade our drilling inventory.","Offshore Suriname, we are getting ready to spud the Kolibri #1 (27:24), an exploration well and Block 53, where Apache holds a 45% working interest. The rig is currently moving on to location and we expect to begin drilling next week, reaching targeted depth about 10 weeks later.","With the move up in commodity prices and the subsequent increasing demand for drilling rigs, we are seeing an uptick in costs, particularly for certain services in North America Onshore, such as pressure pumping and sand. Our move to pad drilling operations in the Midland Basin brings efficiencies that will help offset some of these increases and protect some of the cost savings that we have captured over the past two years.","We continue to look for ways to optimize our operations and improve our margins. This includes finding alternative sources and services to mitigate inflation and preserve well economics. We are finalizing contracts to secure fleets in West Texas with terms that include indexing prices to WTI and extending contracts with favorable rates. Our international operations have not seen the volatility in service costs as compared to North America Onshore. For example, service costs in Egypt remain very competitive and are among the lowest in the world.","I'll conclude by noting that we have structured our capital allocation process and our operations to respond quickly as circumstances warrant. We are pleased to be back at work drilling more wells. As you can see from the recent data, we believe our 2017 North America development program will be more productive and capital efficient than in previous years.","I will now turn the call over to Steve.","Stephen J. Riney - Apache Corp.","Thank you, Tim. Today, I will highlight the company's fourth quarter and full-year 2016 financial performance. I will also outline our 2017 financial guidance and outlook.","2016 was a very successful year as we continued to progress a very important transformation of Apache Corporation. From a financial perspective, we re-based our capital investment programs to deliver competitive returns in a lower-for-longer price environment. We delivered on our overarching goal of cash flow neutrality, protecting the strength of our balance sheet and our liquidity. We maintained our investment-grade rating, and we delivered an exceptionally smooth transition to the successful efforts method of accounting.","Many analysts and investors have noted Apache's conservative and disciplined approach. We remain grounded in the belief that a strong balance sheet, conservative planning and budgeting, and rigorous investment economics based on full-cycle, fully burdened returns deliver the greatest amount of long-term value for our shareholders. We are proud of this approach and it has served us well for the last two years. We have improved our financial position, strengthened our investment programs for the future. And, at the same time, we accessed and advanced a world-class discovery at Alpine High.","Let me now review our full-year and fourth quarter 2016 results. As noted in our press release issued this morning, under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, Apache reported a loss of $182 million or $0.48 per share for the fourth quarter. These results include a number of items outside of our core earnings that are typically excluded by the investment community in published earnings estimates, the most significant of which were asset impairments.","Adjusted for these items, the fourth quarter result was a loss of $22 million or $0.06 per share. Note this adjusted loss still includes dry hole costs, which amounted to $27 million or $0.07 per share after tax. For the full-year 2016, Apache reported a loss of $1.4 billion or $3.71 per share and an adjusted loss of $430 million or $1.13 per share. In the fourth quarter, Apache generated $819 million in net cash from continuing operating activities and $2.5 billion for the full-year.","We maintained our strong liquidity position throughout 2016, ending the year with $1.4 billion cash on hand. Our net debt position at year-end 2016 was $7.2 billion, down slightly from year-end 2015. 2016 capital spending was $537 million for the fourth quarter and $1.9 billion for the full-year. Approximately $900 million of our investment during 2016 was directed to the Permian Basin, of which approximately $500 million was directed to Alpine High. We invested approximately $700 million in our international businesses, consistent with our strategy of investing to sustain the cash flow generating capacity of these assets for the long-term.","Lease operating expense for the full-year averaged $7.85 per BOE, a 16% decrease from 2015. In the fourth quarter, lease operating expense was $8.39 per BOE, down 17% from the fourth quarter of 2015. For 2016, we set a gross overhead cash cost target of $650 million. Actual overhead costs for the year were $639 million. We reported expensed G&A of $410 million or $2.15 per BOE.","During the fourth quarter of 2016, Apache entered into transactions to sell certain non-core assets. These included midstream assets in the North Sea and two mostly non-producing leasehold packages in the Midland and Delaware Basins. The net production impact from these sales is approximately 1,500 barrels of oil equivalent per day and is reflected in our 2017 production guidance, which John provided earlier.","Now I will move on to our 2017 capital program and other financial guidance. As John outlined, we have a clear line of sight to closing the funding gap in our 2017 plan. While we believe that now is the time to outspend cash flows, we also want to protect our balance sheet. We have worked hard to build a strong financial position and we will not put that at risk to near-term price volatility. As such, we have put in place some protection against further price downside.","Over the past several weeks, we have entered into put option contracts providing a floor of $50 WTI and $51 Brent for most of our second half 2017 oil production. With this protection in place, we will move forward with our Permian Basin capital program knowing that any price weakness will not cause a funding shortfall. We chose to use put options to mitigate the risk, while maintaining full exposure to upside price potential.","In terms of other guidance, we have chosen to expand annual guidance around selected production and financial metrics. This is provided in our quarterly financial and operation supplement. John has already covered production and CapEx, so I will move directly to financial items. Please note that all guidance is based on our plan assuming $50 WTI and $51 Brent. My comments here will be relatively brief, so please feel free to follow-up with Gary and his team for any questions as you incorporate the data into your models.","In 2017, we will continue to focus on lease operating expense and enhancing our margins. However, given our production declines in the first half of the year and some expected service price inflation, we see lease operating expense rising to somewhere between $8.50 and $9 per BOE.","We estimate gathering and transportation costs will be $200 million to $250 million. Our portion of 2017 cost expense to G&A on the income statement is projected to be around $450 million and our capitalized portion of interest should be around $65 million. Cash income taxes should be approximately $125 million, which is driven entirely by the profitability of our North Sea operations.","Finally, we are forecasting approximately $150 million of exploration expense in 2017. This includes recurring exploration overhead costs and planned exploration expense activities. This excludes any dry hole expense or unproved property impairments, which are difficult to project in terms of timing and magnitude.","In closing, Apache took a prudent approach to capital spending through the downturn. This has put the company on firm ground going into 2017. We are now very well positioned to fund the capital program that will deliver long-term returns-focused growth, primarily from the Midland and Delaware Basins. We look forward to a successful 2017.","And I would now like to turn the call over to the operator for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And your first question is from John Herrlin of Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale.","John P. Herrlin - Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale","Yes. Thank you. For the Midland wells and the curve improvements that you've demonstrated, can you kind of attribute what you thought the improvements were in terms of landing zones, fracs, well length? Or is it just too hard to generalize?","John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.","No, John, I mean, we took time and, really over the last two years, worked on our programs. We focused on targeting there, we did a lot of core work and really zoned in on where do we want to be landing the wells. I can tell you, in general, we went back to higher fluid volumes. They are more stage numbers they're closer together and we actually reduced our sand concentration significantly, so it really is part of the optimization process. We're very excited about the results and since we're flowing back in pads versus one well per section, we're very confident in those results and it's really attributable to the work that the team's done at the detail level in integrating core into the completion optimization process.","John P. Herrlin - Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale","Okay. Thanks, John. My next one from me is on the Alpine High gas. You mentioned that you've had a lot of interest from industry. Are you looking for index contracts, long-term contracts? I mean, how are you thinking about things?","John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.","I mean, I think right now, most of it will be priced off of Waha, is how we're thinking about it. We're very early. The thing I think that we've seen is that on the longer-term view there is a need out there for supply and so I think we'll have some optionality and we're really starting to think about that and think longer-term with larger volumes.","Operator","Your next question is from Edward Westlake with Credit Suisse.","Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Yes. Good morning, and thanks for the update last week as well. So, you've further de-risked more of the Alpine High in your statements last week, at multiple landing zones in some of the wet gas. But when we look at the well results outside of the Northwest of the play, where you've had some really good wells, Redwood, Spruce, and Mont Blanc. The market is really just not being impressed by the flow rates. So, maybe just a reiteration of what excites you in the rest of the acreage that the market's not been pleased by?","John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.","Well, thanks, Ed. I'd say first and foremost, we've been drilling kind of cookie-cutter wells that are designed to test the rock in the stratigraphy. I think the important piece of information we brought forward was the overpressure to the south. In fact, now, if you look at the pressure gradient across the whole play in the bottom zone, it's all lower pressure.","Clearly, as we move to the far northwest, you're deeper and there's even more overpressure. But as we look back, the one well we disclosed, a couple of different wells, but the Hidalgo well actually, we believe, we had to spud that well before we had the 3-D in. And we believe it is drilled. In fact, we now know it's not on the proper azimuth. We've got a couple of wells coming that we're excited about that will be on the proper azimuth.","But what was impressive to us was how flat the well has been. It leveled off and hasn't budged and the water is continuing to come down. So, we're very impressed with it. The pressure gradients were higher and the thing that we've been able to see is the entire column as well. So, if you look back, the process we've taken, the very first Woodford wells were all in the middle part of the section. We've now validated there's a stronger upper zone. We believe there's a third landing zone as well on the lower, which would give you three landing zones in the Woodford alone. And if I take you back to the Barclays disclosure in September last year, we really assigned just one landing zone on part of our acreage to the Woodford and the Barnett.","So, I know everybody wanted big flow rates. We don't have the processing facilities in place yet to do that. We are under flaring rules and so drilling longer laterals with bigger fracs right now is just not the optimal use of our dollars. But, we are moving into a phase where we have line of sight now on connection to the gas markets, where we can start to stretch some things out and actually start to demonstrate what we know this rock will do.","So, we're very excited to be shifting gears as we start into the optimization process, but bottom line on it is that there are many, many landing zones, a vast resource, and we're excited about the potential across the whole hydro-column, all the way from the dry gas to the wet gas up into the oil zones, which we're about to get to.","The last thing I'll say, I was at your conference last week, we said we have eight wells that are currently in process that will be targeting shallower zones from 9,500 to 11,000 feet. So, we know the gas gets richer and the liquids content is going to go up and we do anticipate seeing some oil as well. So, we're excited.","Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","And then we're all watching the data, but the other big item obviously is getting this pipe in place, maybe just an update on the progress in terms of getting the infrastructure in place to be able to flow these wells a little bit more optimally?","John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.","Well, we've got July circled on the calendar and...","Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","July 4?","John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.","...we're obviously on a path to get there and the way we give guidance and things, I would expect we'd be able to make what we've told you we'd be able to do.","Operator","Your next question is from Scott Hanold with RBC Capital Markets.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks, good afternoon. Maybe a little bit on the King Hidalgo well. You obviously saw some area that there was overpressure there. It looks like the well, based on your presentation a week or two ago, indicated that it was flown with ESP. Can you discuss, is that in-line with your expectation? Or would you have expected that to be flowing naturally a little bit longer?","John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.","No, Scott, I mean, if you look at the well, still a lot of load coming back. I mean, most of these wells we've moved ESPs in early to get the water off of them. You see a trend on that well that's coming down.","As I mentioned, it's not on the optimal azimuth, and we've seen that in some of the wells in the other parts of the play. Getting them on the right azimuth will make a difference as well. But, we're absolutely thrilled with the well and think when you start to look at the curve and realize that really from about day 33 on through we're now over 100 days, the thing has not budged. The oil's been slowly coming down, and it is cutting a little bit of oil with it as well. So, we're very excited about it. I will reiterate, this is only a 3,300 foot lateral and we had a limited number of frac stages in the small frac. And it's not on the optimal azimuth.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. And just to clarify then, then if you would have been on the proper azimuth, then obviously had a more optimal frac, you would have expected that to be flowing naturally a little bit longer? Is that a fair statement?","John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.","Well, there are different areas in terms of how the wells flow back. A lot of the wells we've run subs in early they get the water off of them. We've got some instances where they haven't needed them. And I think the different azimuth will relate to a different profile on the water, higher IP, and obviously we think the productivity is going to go up when we optimize the frac. So, I think it will change the shape and the IP capacity of the well and so forth more than anything.","Operator","Your next question is from Bob Brackett with Bernstein Research.","Robert Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hi, guys. Could you talk about the Suriname prospect; sort of days to drill, when we might get some news, the chance of success, and maybe a risk size, if you're willing to give that?","John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.","Bob, at this point, it's a well we're very excited about; Block 53 we own 45% of. We've got two partners in there. The rig is on its way to location now, as we speak. We should be spudding it probably late next week.","As Tim said in his prepared remarks, it's probably a 70-days, 10-week type well. I'll say it's an exploration well. It's a well we need to drill. We're excited about it. And that's all we've really disclosed on it. I will also tell you we're working the 3-D on Block 58, which we have 100%, we're really thrilled about as well. So, if I had my druthers, I might be drilling 58 first, but the timing is the opposite. But we're very excited about the Kolibri (46:41) prospect and we'll come back with the results in 70 days, 80 days, roughly.","Robert Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","And is it a fully strat trap, or is there a structural component?","John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.","It is a strat trap.","Robert Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you.","John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. Good afternoon.","John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.","Hey, Brian.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","My first question is with regards to decline rates outside of Permian Basin and outside of Alpine High. Given the focus on those two areas, can you just refresh us on how we should think about some of those decline rates in a budget that stays relatively flat in 2018 relative to 2017?","John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.","Well, what I would say, Brian, is overall our North American decline rates probably on average about 20%. It's come down significantly over the last two years as we have not been investing in a lot of those projects and plays. It's about where it would sit now. Some areas are a little heavier, some areas are a little lighter; but in general, that's kind of where that overall base decline rate would be today. As we start to go back to work in some of the other areas, we'll be bringing on some higher decline stuff and it'll start to trend back in the future.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","And what about the areas outside? And where are you at these days in Egypt and North Sea?","John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.","With the international, depending like you're seeing, we pulled the third quarter turnaround in the North Sea after the second quarter, so it's going to be lumpy at times. We see relatively flat for our international over the next couple years.","The one thing that drives Egypt is the price and the way the production sharing contracts work, so you're seeing our nets come down a little bit as prices started to improve late last year. And that's going to have a little bit of an impact as we look into the out years as depending on price, but pretty stable.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good afternoon. I just quickly want to go back to the press release and you guys commented how your budget of $3.1 billion would exceed your planned cash flow for ops. Guys, is that inclusive of the dividend when you all made that comment?","John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.","Arun, it is and it's also at the $50 price deck. So, what we state in there was with the sales that we have already in the house, over $400 million and with where strips would be today, that would cover dividend and everything.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. So that comment was including the dividend as well?","John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.","Yes.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Great. That's helpful. And thanks for the longer-term disclosure and thoughts through 2018. I was wondering as we work on our models, if you could help us think about the oil and gas and the liquids mix, particularly as we get into 2018, just given how Alpine High is going to be more on the wetter gas side of the equation?","John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.","Well, what we've done, Arun, we gave you a corporate level numbers. We showed you kind of a North American production outlook and then we really broke down the key driver, which is Midland, Delaware. We showed you an overall number and we've showed you the oil piece. What we did not show you is the liquid yield on the gas and, quite frankly, Alpine is going to be the driver there. And the big thing is by July of this year, we'll have facilities up and running. We'll have more data. We can come back then and start to update the NGL yields and some of those things.","I'll also tell you that given the program we have today, which is more wet gas driven with a lot of tests in the oil zone still yet to come, we've got a pretty conservative mix dialed in. So, there's a good chance you get out to 2018 or even later this year where we will be updating those and giving more color. But we didn't want to get into that until we really had the facilities up and running and could really shed some light on the NGLs. And, quite frankly, we've got a lot of well still yet to test that can make things oilier.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of David Tameron with Wells Fargo.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Afternoon. John, a lot's been asked on the Permian. Let me get back to the cost. I remember year ago or so you were talking about unbundling the service costs and maybe doing something along those lines. Kind of, where do you see your current, I guess, cost progress and how should we think about it over the next 12 months? And are you having luck on that unbundling, if you will, of service cost?","John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.","Well, the answer is absolutely, David. I mean that's kind of the model we've taken. We did see the pumping pressure go up in December. If you look at our overall well costs \u2013 and I can have Tim give some more color in just a second to kind of add on to what I'll say here. We have forecasted some inflation in total, probably around 10%. What we don't have dialed in is efficiencies. I think areas like Alpine High where we're still very early we've got a lot of room to move on the efficiency curve as we get in to drill these things. Quite frankly, a few of the laterals that we drilled in the upper zones, we were surprised that the pressure gradients were higher and we had to run some shorter laterals than we had originally planned.","So, as we learn those you're going to see things come down, but we've unbundled. Tim pointed out in his comments there that we've done some things, the frac crews, where we've indexed some portions with commodity price. So, we're trying to get creative on how to make it really a win-win as we work through this. But absolutely, still unbundling, very confident in where our cost structure is. We've secured most of our services for the next couple years. So we feel good about what we've got in our numbers. Is there anything you want to add, Tim?","Timothy J. Sullivan - Apache Corp.","The only other thing I might mention, about half of our Permian rigs, a little bit more than half, we do have under longer-term contracts, anywhere from six months to 1.5 year contract. So, we don't see a big push on that. As far as pumping services go, we've seen an increase to-date between 15% and 20%. And on our sand, we've seen an increase to-date about 10%. But, as John mentioned, we do have agreements in place that are tied to WTI. So as we see a 10% increase in WTI, we will only see about a 3% to 5% increase in service costs.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. That's helpful. And then, John, Central Basin Platform, how should we think about? Is there any capital going to that this year?","John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.","There is a little bit, David. I mean, it's a cash cow for us. It's why we split it out from the numbers in terms of where the growth investment is. We're excited about \u2013 I mean we remain optimistic and excited about the Central Basin Platform.","Quite frankly, with more cash flow, there's more projects to do there. But there are things we don't have to do. And so there's a fine line of balancing. One of the things that we should be doing versus what you can be doing. But we've got slight decline there. It's much lower than the North American numbers that I gave, well under 10% on average, and it's a significant source of volume and cash flow for us.","After Egypt \u2013 Egypt, Central Basin Platform and North Sea are really the three cash drivers \u2013 cash flow generators for the corporation right now. So, an important part of our portfolio and the nice thing about it is the longevity.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question is from Jeffrey Campbell with Tuohy Brothers.","Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Good afternoon. I just want to make sure I understood the slide 25, when I look at it, the 50% compound average growth rate in Permian. Should I think of most of Alpine High's early potential as built into this forecast? Or can Alpine High represent some upside to the forecast? And if it could, could you discuss the high level variables?","John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.","Well, I mean, Jeff, it is built into that forecast right now. We roped it in. Now, I'll tell you, like we always do, we're going to guide in things that we feel like we can deliver. So, it's not our Permian. That's just the Midland and Delaware. So, I think there were a few folks that got that mixed up this morning in their notes and forgot that we've got 72,000 BOEs a day on the Central Basin Platform, but that is just the Midland and Delaware Basin curves. It does have Alpine in it. I think it is a good look, conservative look for us for right now and it's liable to get stronger and liable to get more oily. But I'll leave it. For right now, that's what we put out.","Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Okay. And the other question I wanted to ask was with regard to slide eight, the Other North America. I was just wondering, if this primarily includes the Montney. Is there something else in there? I'm really asking just because it seems like Apache's continuing to try to simplify the portfolio to the Permian Basin and international assets?","John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.","Well, that's going to be predominantly our Canadian assets and what we call our Houston region, which would be our conventional Anadarko and our Eagle Ford assets. So that's heavily influenced by Canada as well as the \u2013 I think we've got Guam in there as well, but just a much smaller volume.","Operator","Your next question is from Charles Meade with Johnson Rice.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Good afternoon, John, and to the rest of your team there. I wondered if you could give us an update perhaps on the two wells that you talked about. In your conference last week, you talked about were flowing back the (57:31). I believe it's the 7H in the Penn and also the Redwood well. I believe it's 4H that was the horizontal in the Wolfcamp. And I'm specifically wondering on the Redwood well. Is that in that same part of the Wolfcamp that gave you the 700 barrels a day from the vertical drills in test back last year?","John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.","Well, I mean, at this point, we have not provided updates, Charles, on either of those wells. We are in the area where we were seeing the DST. What I'll also tell you, though, is we had a lot of open hole above us and that's where we, obviously, took a big pressure kick. We let it flow, flowed for about 10 days, was making 700 oil. But we had a lot of column above us.","And we showed in the Credit Suisse package that we thought that was probably in a more gassy regime. So we will see. There's a good chance that oil may be coming from some of the up hole zones that also look fantastic as well. But you know, the DST, you had open column but that is where the tool was when we took the kick. So, still to be determined as we delineate and get to that.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","No. That's helpful color, John. I think it just emphasizes how much there is still left to figure out here. And then second question, if I could switch over to the Midland Basin, Tim, you went through the, some of the big pads you have coming online early in 2017. Once we get to the back half of 2017 and into 2018, are we going to be at or are you going to be more at a steady-state of bringing pads online? Will you have built-up enough momentum at that point? Or should we expect ongoing lumpiness in the Midland Basin program?","Timothy J. Sullivan - Apache Corp.","Yeah, the difference is, as we mentioned, in 2016, we only ran one rig for the majority of the year. And we just added additional rigs toward the back-half of the year, and now we're just now getting some pads online.","Now we've got the pad we talked about, we've got one that's flowing back today. Now, we've got a nine-well pad at Azalea that will be coming back on in April, and then we've got another six-well pad back at Powell that will come on mid-May. And then you get into the back-half, again, we will be drilling with pads, but we're going to have continual operations. It will be a bit lumpy because it is pad drilling, but I think you're going to see a much more steady stream of wells coming across in the back-half.","John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.","The other thing I would say there is if we've got more cash flow, that's going to be one of the first areas that you can see us pick up some more rigs and activity. I mean, Midland, Delaware are going to be the areas that you'll see, you know, if prices were to move up, we have more cash flow, that's where you'd see us accelerating.","Operator","And your last question is from Paul Sankey with Wolfe Research.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Hi, guys. Appreciate the color. Could you just go back to a high-level question? In terms of your infrastructure spend in the Alpine High, what are really your long-term assumptions here? Where do you think this is going in terms of the ultimate volumes over time? How are you going to sell the gas? And what your assumptions are for spending as much money as you are right now? Thanks.","John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.","Well, Paul, I mean, I think if you lay out, we spent $200 million last year, we've laid out $500 million the next two years. We're very excited. I mean, the first two phases of this are going to take us several years in. We won't have a decision point to make on staying with re-fridge, which is kind of the base case we have in the field right now, or do we go to cryo?","But as I said on the earnings call last August, we're not talking hundreds of millions of cubic feet of gas here a day, we're talking multiple Bcfs, a very rich gas, wet gas, NGLs, and we think there's going to be also a lot of oil to go with it. So, we're very excited about what we have in front of us.","I think once we are able to get the processing equipment in the field and things running, you'll start to see some things in terms of lateral lengths, optimized fracs, and we'll start to show you really what this resource is capable of doing. So, we're very excited about it, and I think it's going to be a big underpinning item for Apache and our Permian for a long, long time.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","But you don't \u2013 can you share \u2013 I mean, you must have assumptions on where you're going to here, given the upfront spend. And we're just trying to get to a long-term sort of present value idea of what you guys are basically assuming?","John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.","Yeah. And what I'll say, Paul, is just look at what we've given you. We've given you now a look into the end of 2018. I've said, it's likely conservative on what Alpine and what our Permian can do. We gave you some location counts at Barclays. We've come back now and said we've got a minimum of 3,000 confirmed locations in the wet gas window.","We will unfold more as it continues to progress, but we remain very optimistic, very excited. But one thing I'll say about this field is it gets bigger. I know there was a little bit of a negative reaction to some of the rates, because everybody's expecting us to be optimizing and scaling-up our fracs and things, but we're very pleased with where we are, and the scope and scale of this field has done nothing but get bigger since our initial disclosure in September of last year.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Got you. Could I ask just one very specific one? Your Midland results have looked good. What percentage of the acreage there do you think will go to longer laterals? And I'll leave it there. Thanks.","John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.","Yeah, most of that, we're now got 1.5 mile to two miles dialed in. We did a lot of work over the last two years buttoning down some trades. So most of the wells we're going to be drilling are 1.5 mile to two mile laterals now. So, we're excited about that as well.","Operator","This concludes our Q&A portion.

My name is Rachel, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the 2Q Earnings 2013 Earnings Release Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker\u2019s remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Thank you.","I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Brady Parish, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin your conference.","","Brady Parish","Thank you, Rachel. Good afternoon everyone, and thank you for joining us for Apache Corporation\u2019s second quarter 2013 earnings conference call. On today\u2019s call, we will have three speakers making prepared remarks prior to taking questions. I will start by giving a brief summary of the second quarter results, and then we will hear from Steve Farris, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; followed by Rod Eichler, President and Chief Operating Officer; and finally, our CFO, Tom Chambers is out today so he has asked me to pinch it for him with respect to his remarks.","We've prepared our quarterly financial supplemental data package for your use, which also includes the reconciliation of any non-GAAP numbers that we discuss such as adjusted earnings, cash flow from operations or pre-tax margins. In addition, we have prepared an operations supplement to summarize our activities across the various Apache operating regions. These can both be found on our website at www apachecorp.com\/financialinfo.","Today's discussions will contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions based on our current views and most reasonable expectations. However, a number of factors could cause actual results to defer materially from what we discuss today. A full disclaimer is located with the supplemental data package on our website.","This morning, we reported second quarter 2013 earnings of $1 billion or $2.54 per diluted share. Cash flow from operations before changes in working capital totaled $2.6 billion.","Adjusted earnings which exclude certain items that impact the comparability of results totaled $801 million or $2.01 per diluted share. In the second quarter total net production averaged approximately 790,000 boe per day with liquids production constituting 54% of the total. This represents an increase from the 782,000 boe per day reported in the first quarter and the 774,000 boe per day reported in the second quarter of 2013 was negatively impacted by a decrease in North Sea production of 6000 boe per day from the first quarter partially due to deferred production as a result of unplanned facility maintenance at the Forties Field as well as natural fuel decline in some of our other international regions.","One final item of note before I turn the call over to Steve. An effort to further provide transparency with respect to our disclosure of oil and gas production we\u2019ve included within our quarterly financial and operation supplements say more detailed breakout of net production for our Egypt region. As you can see on the bottom of pages five through seven of the financial supplement. We have provided three separate line items for Egypt production.","Gross production, net production with tax which is gap and net production without tax. For the terms of our production sharing contracts the state owned petroleum company EGPC pays our Egyptian income taxes on our behalf using the share of it's profit oil.","As a result for accounting purposes we record income tax with an equal and offsetting increase in our oil and gas revenues. As you can see this accounting treatment is both earnings and cash flow neutral. However it does result in Apache recording additional production volumes what we call tax barrels, because the recording of the tax barrels is both earnings and cash flow neutral we\u2019re disclosing Egypt net production with tax barrels which is GAAP and without tax barrels for completeness.","If you were to exclude tax barrels from total reported production, our second quarter 2013 net production would have been 751,000 boe per day versus 727,000 boe per day excluding tax barrels in the second quarter of 2012 which is a 3.3% increase. This compares to the 2% increase based upon our reported net production which includes tax barrels. We have included an illustration of our Apache\u2019s production breakdown on page four of the operational supplement for your review because Egypt tax barrels introduce additional variability in our reported net production. We have included this additional disclosure in an effort to assist you and estimating production on a quarter-to-quarter basis. We will be posting a presentation at a later date that includes a detailed illustrative example of the mechanisms and accounting for a typical EPSC to help further enhance transparency.","With that I\u2019ll turn the call over to Steve.","","Steve Farris","Thank you Brady and good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us. As Brady said Apache reported a strong results for the quarter, we generated over a $1 billion of earnings and more importantly $2.6 billion of cash flow from operations. I think the most important thing about the last quarter is we are transitioned towards more North American onshore growth was evidenced again this quarter with each of our four onshore North American regions significantly increasing liquids production both year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter, which are at attractive rates of return. As a result, our onshore North American liquids production increased to 175,000 barrels of oil per day and that constitutes 41% of our total worldwide liquids production and over 22% of our total overall production. This represents an increase of over 6% quarter-to-quarter and nearly 42% from second quarter of 2012.","In addition, our onshore North American crude oil production increased to nearly 120,000 barrels a day, an increase of 26% versus second quarter of 2012 and now it comprises over 15% of our total production. Digging more, our U.S. onshore resource base continues to deliver sector leading performance. Apache is the most active U.S. onshore driller with 81 rigs currently running. During the second quarter, we averaged to combine production of 214,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day from our Permian and Central regions alone, or 27% of our total production. This represents more than a 34% increase over second quarter of 2012 and a 28% increase after adjusting for the Cordillera acquisition which we closed on April 30, 2012.","In the Permian, we are currently running 45 rigs. In the Anadarko Basin, we are running 35 rigs. And as a result of this drilling activity, we remain on track to achieve our guidance of greater than 25% North American onshore liquids growth during 2013.","I would like to turn to Egypt right now. During the second quarter and throughout the recent political unrest, our operations have remained uninterrupted. In fact, I traveled to Cairo, last Thursday night I was in Cairo Friday through Tuesday of turning our quarterly operational review at an opportunity meet with the new minister of petroleum in a number of new administrations who have reiterated the importance of Apache\u2019s investment in Egypt. Frankly, it was business as usual. We are currently running 26 rigs in Egypt. This morning we announced several impressive discoveries across our vast position in Western Desert. These discoveries continued to highlight the prospectivity of our $9.7 million gross acreage position.","Now, moving from the second quarter results, I would like to provide a brief update with respect to our portfolio review process. I mentioned in our first quarter earnings call after significantly both during our onshore North American asset base over last 3.5 years. Last fall, we embarked on a strategic preview of our portfolio with the ultimate goal of keeping the right mix of assets that generates strong returns, drive a more predictable production growth and create shareholder value. Since the beginning of this year, we have begun executing on multiple processes with respect to a robust list of priority divestiture candidates. On July 18th, we announced our first divestiture when we sign an agreement to sell our Gulf of Mexico shelf operations to Fieldwood Energy for $3.75 billion on cash, net of $1.5 billion of P&A liability. We also retained 50% interest in deeper rights, including what we consider exciting subsalt plays.","We are moving forward on our other processes and we will keep you at price of our progress. We hope to have additional transactions announced before year end. Given the highly confidential and sensitive nature of these potential transactions, we are not going to provide any further details at this time, but we will update you as progress unfolds. At the end, we intend to use the net proceeds to be received from the disposition of these priority assets to reduce depth and repurchase shares under our 30 million share authorization from our Board. And through the end of the second quarter, we have repurchased 2.9 million shares. The share repurchase program combined with our recent increase in our dividends I hope demonstrates our continued commitment to deliver value to our shareholders and reflects confidence in the underlying value of our business. Please keep in mind all of these potential transactions and the use of the proceeds received or subject to market conditions and I want to rest assure we\u2019re dead eye serious about rebalancing our portfolio and emerging from this process is even stronger company than we\u2019re today.","We want to continue to do what we think we do best which is export our vast inventory of opportunities rigorously allocate capital to generate great attractive rates of return and profitably and more predictably grow our production and create long term value for our shareholders. I would now like to turn the call over to Rod Eichler.","","Rod Eichler","Thank you Steve and good afternoon. We have once again compiled an operation supplement detailing our activities across all 10 of our regions. I would like to take a moment to highlight some of our activities in the Permian and Central region and in Egypt. As Steve mentioned we had an outstanding quarter drilling and completing wells across the globe and we continue to ratchet up production on our North America onshore liquid plays. During the second quarter we averaged a 116 rigs worldwide and completed 343 total gross wells with a 99% success rate, 248 of these wells or 72% were located onshore at North America. At our Permian and Central Regions alone we completed 215 gross wells or 63% of our total.","Our production in North America onshore liquids grew 42% over the prior year to a 175,000 barrels per day and was predominantly by our Permian and Central regions. Combined these two regions grew liquids production approximately 8000 barrels per day quarter-over-quarter or 6% to a 136,000 barrels per day which represented nearly 32% of total worldwide liquids production. Combined production of these regions was 214,000 boe per day representing 27% of total company production for the quarter.","In the Permian region we averaged a 123,000 boe per day 74% liquids constituting nearly 16% of our total production. This represents 18% production growth over the second quarter of 2012.","We continue to be the most active driller in the basin holding a record 41 rigs for the quarter. We spot 214 gross wells of which 58 were horizontal and completed a 128 gross wells during the quarter. Along with Deadwood, drilling at Barnhart is down leading the region in production growth along with three bar (ph) and a Yeso Play in New Mexico.","We continue to add strong results in our vertical drilling program and Deadwood and area acquired in the 2010 transaction we now have over 600 operating wells for this year in the field.","Second quarter drilling activity at Deadwood focused on the vertical (inaudible) play maintain a six rig vertical Wolfwood (ph) campaign and our Lower Cline Shale Development Program. The region continued it's successful (inaudible) program on four recent vertical wells in the play averaging IPs of approximately 300 barrels of oil per day, 70% oil.","The Lower Cline Shale program continues to increase inventory and results. Our 2013 11 wells have been drilled and there are 28 wells remaining for the year. Our 30 day average IP for 2013 Cline wells online through second quarter is 311 boe per day 81% oil.","Currently our lower Cline inventory is spread over more than nine sections. Well spacing for (inaudible) and for 3D seismic conversion interpretations are all being evaluated to optimize the development program.","Also during the quarter the Barnhart area was extremely active with key two production growing 32% on the second quarter of 2012 and averaging 4700 barrels oil per day and 13.5 million cubic feet of gas per day. We continue to run six horizontal rigs toward the upper and little Wolfcamp shale. By the end of the second quarter we had drilled 37 wells with a total 83 expected by year end. We now have a total of 26 Apache operated horizontal Wolfcamp wells producing in the field with average 30 day IP in excess of 600 boe per day. With respect to cost reductions one of our focus areas has been the conservation of water resources as frac operations have employed the use of 1.2 million barrels of recycled flow back water. After initial drill out of frac wells all flow back and produce water from the horizontal development is recycled for us in the future frac jobs thereby conserving the non-potable groundwater available in the area and reducing our overall water cost.","During the second quarter we also added two rigs to our Three Bar Shallow Unit with selling and development of the Wichita Albany reservoir. A total of 7 wells spud another successful horizontal completion was added to that field. One well of note was the Three Bar Shallow Unit 113H drilled to a measured depth of 13,200 feet with a 6,000 foot lateral section. After a 16-stage frac, the well began production on May 9 and recently tested at rates of 795 barrels of oil per day and 1.3 million cubic feet of gas per day. Six additional wells are in various stages of completions, flow back and tie-in. Two vertical and one horizontal rig continue to develop the Yeso play of New Mexico. For the second quarter, 27 new Yeso wells all verticals were brought on production. Gross production for the 2013 Yeso drilling program doubled from 1,500 barrels of oil per day and 3.2 million cubic feet of gas per day to about 3,000 barrels of oil per day and 6.3 million cubic feet of gas per day during the second quarter. Completion activity on 8 horizontal wells drilled to-date should commence later in the third quarter. Looking ahead to the third quarter of 2013, Permian expects to maintain an active rig count of 45 drilling rigs of which 20 will be horizontal.","Moving now to Anadarko Basin, we are in our central region we averaged 91,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the second quarter. This is approximately 4,700 barrel of oil equivalent per day, or 5% increase over first quarter 2013 production, and notably 100% of the quarterly growth came from oil and natural gas liquids. Our liquids production rose 12% quarter-over-quarter to 45,000 barrels per day. Liquids now represent nearly half of our total region production versus 29% in the second quarter of 2012. During the quarter, we accelerated activity in the Anadarko and Whittenburg basins. We further exploited our vast resource potential by running an average of 28 rigs of which 27 were horizontal and completed 87 gross wells. We are currently running 35 rigs in that region and remain on track to drill 300 wells during 2013. About a third of our program will target prolific liquids-rich Granite Wash with another third targeting the oilier Tonkawa. Rigs will also continue to work the Cleveland, Marmaton, Cottage Grove and Canyon Wash plays.","In our liquids-rich Granite Wash play, our wells continue to come on strong. Two recent well result highlights include the Ramp 26 #7H with an IP of 199 barrels of oil per day and 7.5 million cubic feet of gas per day the Ramp 27 #7H with an IP of 139 barrels of oil per day and 7.4 million cubic feet of gas per day. We still have many years of well locations and our resource inventory awaiting exploitation. In the oily Tonkawa play we had strong results in Roger Mills County with our three largest completions averaging over 500 barrels of oil per day and approximately 600 Mcf per day. Again, Apache has identified years of viable well locations in our resource inventory.","In Ochiltree County, Texas, we have a successful Cleveland program underway with our most recent four completions coming on with an average IP of 540 barrels of oil per day and 630 Mcf per day. The Marmaton formation is also showing strong results with recent completions averaging 400 barrels of oil per day and 4.9 million cubic feet of gas per day. We are also having tremendous success in our Cottage Grove play development and the Stiles #23-3H well came online at 790 barrels of oil equivalent per day, 82% oil.","In our Canyon Wash play in the Texas Panhandle, we brought on several strong vertical wells including the (indiscernible) with an IP of 1,237 barrels of oil per day and 1 million cubic feet of gas per day and the Boys Ranch 116 #10 at 984 barrels a day and 101.3 million cubic feet of gas per day. In addition, our two most recent wells are flowing back after frac at a combined rate in excess of 3,000 barrels of oil per day.","We are also continuing to drive down drilling and completion cost through detailed analysis of even smallest operations. In May, we reported $5 million of drilled and completed Tonkawa well. Thanks to the efforts of a number of Apache engineers, petrophysicists and geologists. We have lowered that number by nearly $1.5 million with production results equal to or better than before. During the second quarter, we also concentrated heavily in our Tonkawa bit, motor, torque, and drag combinations. Half of the 25 Tonkawa wells drilled in the quarter had significant rate of penetration increases with our last two wells drilled in under two weeks versus four weeks six months ago.","We mentioned on our last earnings call that we have lowered our average Granite Wash completing well cost by $1.3 million to $2 million per well. The same team that reduced our Tonkawa cost by nearly half is now focused on the Granite Wash, so we anticipate additional future cost savings by continuing to apply best practices we expect to reduce cost further and apply these technicians to our other plays. As Steve mentioned our operations in Egypt remain uninterrupted and we continue to find new oil and gas discoveries in the prolific Western Desert. In fact this morning we reported seven oil and gas discoveries across four basins at six concessions.","Our continued success highlights a geologic and geographic diversity across the company\u2019s 9.7 million gross acres in Egypt\u2019s Western Desert. The discoveries include the Riviera South West-1X on the Southern Plank of the Abu Gharadig Basin which test flowed 1500 barrels of oil per day and 2.8 million cubic feet gas per day for the Lower Bahariya sand.","And the Faghur basin we had four new discoveries including the Narmer-1X which encountered 85 feet of net pay in the middle of Jurassic Safa sand. The wells have flowed 1166 barrels of oil per day and 400 mcf of gas per day. Despite downtime in the North Sea we did have some positive news recently at our Bacchus field. Last month we completed our third successful development well Bacchus B1 which mobbed 257 feet of net oil pay along our horizontal wellbore and high quality Jurassic Fulmar sandstone.","Production commenced from the B1 during the fourth week of July adding 9400 barrels of oil per day of new rate taking the field to 17,600 barrels of oil per day with plants to further optimize the rates and operating conditions of the subsea infrastructure. During the third quarter we planned to acquire a new treaty seismic survey over Bacchus in order to identify further development opportunities. That concludes the operational highlights. I\u2019ll now turn the call back over to Brady.","","Brady Parish","Thanks Rod. This morning we reported earnings of 1 billion or 254 per diluted share. Overall our bottomline results reflect an another solid quarter of financial performance driven by increased production. Our production this quarter averaged 790,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.","Oil and gas revenues totaled $4.1 billion for the quarter flat with the first quarter; oil revenue was lower as higher production volumes were offset somewhat by a drop in the oil prices. Gas revenue was slightly higher than the first quarter as higher prices offset a slight decline in production. Oil accounted for 78% of total revenue. Including the impact at hedging second quarter oil prices averaged $97 and $0.93 per barrel down $3.79 from the first quarter our gas prices averaged to $3.87 up $0.15 per mcf for the first quarter. As a result we generated 2.6 billion of cash from operations before working capital items. We were able to consistently generate these cash flow levels given the fact that over 45% of our total production on a boe basis is oil which continues to sell for well over 20 times the price of North American natural gas. In addition our international gas portfolio is continued to bolster our realizations as our international realizations exceeded those in North America for the sixth consecutive quarter.","We head the portion of our 2014 production to secure prices in cash flows that will support our continued growth through our very active drilling program. We hedge 62,500 barrels per day at WTI crude oil at almost $91 per barrel and 62,500 at Brent crude at just over a $100 per barrel.","When you look at our income statement this quarter you will notice a new line item titled derivative instrument gains, losses, net. This line item represents the mark to market impact of our oil and gas commodity price financial derivatives and was segregated due to the magnitude of the amount of $247 million gain in the quarter. This line item will continue to appear each quarter as long as we have financial derivatives and be one of the components utilized to calculate adjusted earnings.","Our focused drilling program produced a 42% increase in liquids production in North America onshore properties from the prior quarter and 6% increase for the first quarter. This is primarily driven by continued strong results in the Permian and Anadarko Basins although as noted earlier each of our four North American onshore regions increased their liquids production from second quarter a year ago and sequentially versus the first quarter. Worldwide liquids production for the quarter averaged 426,000 boe per day an increase of 10% from the comparative 2012 quarter and 2% sequentially.","For Apache our liquids growth and drilling opportunities are primarily focused on crude oil. Over 84% of our second quarter liquids production is crude oil. Our production efforts directly translated into a pretax margin that exceeded 35%. Our operating costs for the quarter were up 5% sequentially driven by increased repair and maintenance and power and fuel costs. Typically repair and maintenance cost run higher in the second and third quarters each year as we compress this work into the favorable weather window. I also wanted to note that second quarter earnings were impacted by $59 million deferred tax expense for foreign currency fluctuations in addition to the after-tax commodity derivative mark-to-market gain of $156 million both of which are non-cash adjustments. Adjusting for these non-cash items, we were near $801 million or $2.01 per share versus $2.07 a year ago and $2.02 in the first quarter of 2013.","Turning to taxes, the second quarter effective tax rate of 37% primarily reflects the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on deferred taxes just mentioned. Absent this foreign exchange movement for the quarter, our effective tax rate would have been a more typical 40%. Similarly, this adjustment impact in our percentage of deferred taxes in the quarter. We would expect the deferred rate of approximately 25% for the year absent the adjustment. Detailed calculations for margins, adjusted earnings, adjusted tax rate, and cash from operations can be found in the financial supplement located on our website.","Looking at the balance sheet, our ability to generate consistent operating cash flows continues to support our robust drilling program and other planned capital expenditures. This quarter, our total debt balance increased slightly, but at the end of the quarter our debt to capitalization ratio was 28% the same as last quarter. However, as Steve mentioned earlier, we are working to rebalance our portfolio by actively pursuing asset sales to be completed in 2013. Proceeds from the first of these, the Gulf shelf sale for $3.75 billion will be used to reduce our debt including commercial paper balances and $400 million of debt maturing in September, and we purchased Apache common shares under a 30 million share repurchase program authorized by the board earlier this year. At the end of the second quarter, we took the opportunity to initiate the share repurchase program and buyback 2.9 million shares. The results of our efforts to rebalance our portfolio will enhance our debt maturity profile, preserve our balance sheet flexibility to fund operations and growth and enhance shareholder value.","This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we are now ready to open the line for questions.","","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","(Operator Instructions) And your first question comes from the line of Arun Jayaram.","","Arun Jayaram - Credit Suisse","Good afternoon, gentlemen.","","Steve Farris","Good afternoon.","","Arun Jayaram - Credit Suisse","And Steve understanding that you are not probably going to provide a lot of details, but I do want to maybe see if you could give us maybe some broad thoughts as you look to rebalance the portfolio obviously you announced the Shell, but from here will the portfolio look pretty similar to what you have today? I mean, are you thinking of more smaller types of transactions down the road or could we see something pretty meaningful where you really reduced the size of the organization to increase your leverage to the U.S. onshore properties which are growing pretty sharply? So, just trying to get your thoughts on from here what the scale of the asset sales could look like?","","Steve Farris","Well, I \u2013 thank you for the question. I think we said during our first quarter earnings call, we had a robust list of assets that we were in the process of marketing, which we still do. We have multiple processes going on at the same time. The end results of this and I have said it before, but the end results of this is we want assets that can grow or we want assets that can generate cash to fund that growth. And if you think about where that portfolio would lead you, it would lead you more towards North American onshore. The other thing we have said and I made a comment about being in Egypt and it was business as usual, I drove around Cairo for three days and it was very quiet and business as usual but we also recognize that we need to find a way to validate the value of Egypt for our shareholders and we continue to work on that also.","","Arun Jayaram - Credit Suisse","And Steve just a follow-up maybe on the North Sea you commented about, you had a little of maintenance related downtime, can you give us maybe some thoughts on how the back half of the year could like in terms of production. I know that the third quarter you generally see some turnarounds and things like that but just maybe some comments on the North Sea.","","Steve Farris","The North Sea does go through, we had some unplanned downtime in the second quarter, we had some planned downtime in the third quarter. We have a turnaround schedule, our production will be down a little bit from the second quarter and then our expectation for the fourth quarter is to be considerably stronger than the rest of the quarters of the year.","","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Pearce Hammond.","","Pearce Hammond - Simmons & Co. Int'l","Steve how should we think about total company production growth for on the divestiture the Gulf of Mexico Shelf in the past, we\u2019ve talked about kind of total company production growth of 3% to 5% then of course that included the shelf. So how should we think about that moving forward?","","Steve Farris","And that\u2019s a very good question and it really, when we come out of the other side of this when depending on how much we get done this year we still have the a large portfolio or a pretty robust portfolio things we would like to divest up. When we get through with that what we will see is by it's nature that our North American onshore will become a bigger part of our portfolio so we would expect our future growth to be stronger than our 3% to 5%.","","Pearce Hammond - Simmons & Co. Int'l","And then my follow-up is just a little bit how do you feel like you\u2019re progressing right now on the Wolfcamp currently and do you think there is an upward bias to the 350 million boe resource potential figure that you put out last year at the Analyst Day because it looks like you got some attractive acreage shelf over in Upton County and a little bit Midland County and Martin County as well where some other operators have had some good wells.","","Steve Farris","I\u2019m going to let Rod talk about the detail. So one thing I would say and for the most part we had a presentation back in June of 2012 where we did some tight curve. For the most part we have exceeded those tight curves in the Wolfcamp, in the Deadwood area and the Cline et cetera. But as Rod pointed out we have six rigs running, we continue to be very active there.","","Rod Eichler","We have 45 rigs currently operating as a Permian we have about 20 of those rigs were operating in the southern half of the Midland basin. Big concentration in Deadwood and Barnhart where we have a strong acreage concentration which I talked about but we have a lot of other blocks of acreage in Midland County area and I have some other operations I mentioned some results just in the last day or two, we have acreage in the cities, in fact we have two wells are currently drilling and testing offsetting some of those results that were just recently announced and we have great expectations, we continue to the success on the Wolfcamp. We\u2019re targeting two different landing zones in the middle Wolfcamp across the area.","","Steve Farris","I think to answer your question in broad terms you will probably see our resource potential in the Wolfcamp from what we put on June of 2012 we\u2019re going to have an analyst day later this year probably in the fourth quarter but I think you will see those resource potentials in the Wolfcamp go up from where it was.","","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Bob Morris.","","Bob Morris - Citigroup","Steve you last quarter mentioned a full year budget of $10.5 billion that you\u2019ve increased ","activity in both the central region and the Permian. What has been the impact on the budget apples-to-apples. I know there was some associated with the couple of Mexico shale but on an apples-to-apples basis what is the impact on that $10.5 billion from the increased activity seen on sort of North America.","","Steve Farris","Well at the present time we\u2019re running at a pace would outpace that a little bit but we intend to gauge our capital program with our sales proceeds and also our cash flow. We are also ahead a little bit on our cash flow.","","Bob Morris - Citigroup","So, that $10.5 billion apples-to-apples maybe goes up couple of hundred million or $500 million for the increased activity, source it elsewhere and (indiscernible).","","Steve Farris","Honestly, probably the higher number.","","Bob Morris - Citigroup","Okay, alright.","","Tom Chambers","And I will tell you honestly, I mean, we are talking about we are at the end of July. So, we still got five months of activity level yet, so\u2026","","Bob Morris - Citigroup","Alright, thank you.","","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Herrlin.","","John Herrlin - Societe Generale","Yes, hi. Quick one for you, Steve, in terms of the reconstituted Apache, conceivably could you be more like 70% on conventional and the rest conventional given the added North American focus?","","Steve Farris","That\u2019s a pretty strong number. I would say this Canada has to be a part of our portfolio going forward. We are in the Permian. We are in the Anadarko Basin. We are re-looking and doing a resource assessment in our Canadian region. We should start seeing some results of that in the next couple of weeks internally, and we\u2019ll make that presentation in the fourth quarter or at the Analyst day, but what we would like to have is three areas in North America that is predominantly unconventional. I doubt if we ever get to the 70% range, but it certainly will be a bigger part of our portfolio.","","John Herrlin - Societe Generale","Okay, that\u2019s fair. Next one from me and last one is your Permian well reserves you are giving 30 days what would the IPs be, because it looked like in the Central region you were giving shorter-term IPs and not 30 days. So, I was just wondering how these wells started?","","Rod Eichler","I believe that we use 30 day IPs across the board unless we say otherwise. That goes in the Central region as well as the Permian.","","Steve Farris","Obviously, Rod, yes, the initial 24-hour test would be, I don\u2019t want to say significant, it would be certainly quite a bit larger than what our 30-day IPs are.","","John Herrlin - Societe Generale","Okay, thanks.","","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bob Brackett.","","Bob Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein","Hi, good afternoon. Any update on Kitimat and we still in some of the LNG projects?","","Steve Farris","Wheatstone continues to move forward. We are finally getting in a range, where the end of 2016 isn\u2019t that far off. So, one thing I would say is is that based on our models and our partner\u2019s models, when that comes on, it will pay out in 4.5 years of all our costs and it will generate about over $1 billion a year net to Apache. So, as we get closer to that time it becomes more and more interesting. The Kitimat project frankly is we are going through a supplemental FEED with Chevron. Chevron has now taken over the operations of the downstream. We are operating the upstream. We had a meeting with our Chevron counterparts last week and went through a number of things. The predominant one was marketing, and although I can\u2019t talk specifically about it, they are high and behind the marketing side. Obviously, marketing is going to drive this program.","","Bob Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein","Great, thank you.","","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Freeman.","","John Freeman - Raymond James","Good afternoon. On the Central region, you announced a group of pretty solid Canyon Wash wells and I know that Rod, you mentioned that you are still sticking with the same game plan of third-year rigs on the Granite Wash, a third at Tonkawa, and a third in these other areas, and I am just curious if maybe not this year, but next year if Canyon Wash just based on the fact it appears to be pretty strong results, a lot oiler than some of these other plays if that might start to get some incremental rigs as its in the least developed of your central region properties?","","Rod Eichler","Of course, it\u2019s a new property for us having just started this discovery about two years ago. We have about 35 rigs operating in that region by year end. Well, probably one or two rigs continue to operate in the Bivins Ranch area. It\u2019s a vertical program. We drill the wells relatively quickly. We anticipate drilling into a water flood opportunity that exists in that (inaudible) field in the very near future. But we\u2019re very pleased with the results we have seen to-date.","","Steve Farris","Yeah we have about 130,000 acres there and I think they are actually going to drill a horizontal well in there fourth quarter this year. Number of operators on either side that are experimenting with horizontal wells.","","John Freeman - Raymond James","And just one follow-up from me, in the Permian another pretty good Wichita Albany well, can you remind me I know you\u2019re adding rigs there, what sort of the running room is there. Is that present across majority of your central basin platform acres, is it isolated into one area?","","Rod Eichler","In the three bar unit area we have probably about two dozen locations that we\u2019re currently exploring. It's been a very robust program to-date and we\u2019re just now been able to step out in other blocks of acreage we have in the same county to see if that same kind of high potential exists on those other acreages we have.","","Steve Farris","I think the most interesting thing about a number of other operators and ourselves is that the future of the Permian is still an emphasize, because it is a tremendous amount of oil in place there and you see quarterly and including ourselves trying new ideas and going horizontal in new plays and you really have a real tremendous potential continuous to be in the Permian basin that is untouched. People haven't even thought about it yet.","","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate.","","Doug Leggate - Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch ","I\u2019ve got two, one is on Egypt and the another one is maybe a little bit off the wall but the way things to Permian but. On Egypt, Rod there has obviously been another stream of tremendous success over there it's obviously not getting any purchase at the market currently given the situation but can you just tell us today as things stand how do you see the running room, the scope for additional growth and following your conversation Steve what is the risk that you see any changes, the tax regime or anything has really threatened your operation as thing stand today. And I\u2019ve got a follow-up.","","Steve Farris","All that Rod talk about the what our running room is in terms of our operational position and then on my comment on our view of what\u2019s happening in there from a political standpoint.","","Rod Eichler","Yeah Dough we\u2019re clearly running 26, 27 rigs in Western Desert. We anticipate drilling a similar program in 2013 probably about 2075 wells as we had 2012 so the program level of activity is continued to pace for the previous years, pre-revolution. Our gas production as an example is it's record levels. In fact we have some facility constraints our gross operating production is running about 920 million cubic feet of gas per day and in the second quarter we managed to finally put on the 24 inch pipeline from Abu Gharadig to Dashur which we have been working to restore to it's original operating parameters when it was held by BP and we now have half that line, half of the capacity being put into service.","So we anticipate to continue the same kind of program with a good prospect inventory and the every year we show this at Analyst Day presentation as the inventory both drilling and then completion opportunities as well as work over opportunities it seems to be no change in the actual amount of the inventory grown going from year-to-year even though we continue to grow 300 wells and do well over 1,000 work overs and rig completion opportunities every year.","","Steve Farris","And I'm going to prep with this with the comments that, we've recognized the uncertainty and how our shareholders view Egypt and we're working on how to validate that. Having said that I will say this and I have said it many, many times. Egyptians are Egyptian first and Arab second and I think if you see what's going on currently you get a pretty good picture of that.","I mean they want stability in terms of our position in Egypt we met with the Minister of Petroleum, we met with the Minister of Investment, we also met with the Minister of Industry and Trade and met with a number of business people over there that I have met over a period of years with the US-Egyptian Business Council. The importance to Egypt of Apache or the importance of Apache being in Egypt it is very big. We are the most active driller. We drill more wells than everybody else combined in the Western Desert. And I say this and it\u2019s a factual statement and I understand the uncertainty, but from the way we see it, would it be very difficult for Egypt to change our tax regime or change our position, because we are their oil growth in Egypt going forward.","","Doug Leggate - Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","I appreciate the answers, frankly, my kind of off the wall follow-up, so today one of your competitors, I guess smaller competitor Pioneer announced another stream of strong well results in the Permian stocks up significantly. I am just curious as to whether you would ever consider separating your Permian business as part of your broader portfolio, if you are given the value that\u2019s not been recognized in your portfolio that has been recognized elsewhere? And I\u2019ll leave it that. Thanks. Like I say it\u2019s a bit off the wall.","","Steve Farris","Yeah, truthfully, I think we are getting good value for our Permian assets. I think it needs the Permian and the Anadarko and some of the other things we are doing needs to be a bigger part of that portfolio, and that\u2019s what we set out to do. And honestly, we are (indiscernible) serious of doing that.","","Doug Leggate - Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Alright. Okay, fine. I will leave you there. Thanks.","","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joseph Allman.","","Joseph Allman - JPMorgan","So, Steve your comment about validating the value of Egypt that seems to imply some kind of monetization, could you just give us some color on that?","","Steve Farris","Well, there \u2013 obviously I have said those words a number of times and I have answered that question a number of times. There is a number of ways I think to validate the value of Egypt. Obviously, one of which is monetization, one of which is, if you look at the gamut, you could spin it out, you could list part of it, you could sell part of it, you could sell all of it. The most important thing about Egypt is it generates a tremendous amount of cash flow. And we just need to figure out a way to validate that value without giving up that value.","","Joseph Allman - JPMorgan","Got you. Do you think if you sold a small slice of Egypt, would that cause investors to value the whole asset using the same metrics based on selling a small slice?","","Steve Farris","Well, I think that would be, beauty would be in the eyes of the beholder honestly.","","Joseph Allman - JPMorgan","And in terms of the option of selling the whole thing, I mean is that really an option? I mean could you sell it or do you think there would be buyers out there with the government budget?","","Steve Farris","Well, we are getting in an awful lot of detail, but one thing I would say is that in fact I went to Europe with Brady the first part of June. The rest of the world has a different view of the events in Egypt than folks in the United States. Europeans and other parts of the world have a different view of Egypt. They see truthfully a little less risk there than U.S. investors, but not saying the right or wrong or the U.S. investor is right or wrong, that\u2019s just \u2013 that\u2019s a perception.","","Joseph Allman - JPMorgan","Got you. And then on other area, so the media seem to get it right in terms of the shelf, I think the media reported that you are going to sell a minority interest in the shelf and you end up selling the whole thing. The media also reported that you are going to sell the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and those reports came out even earlier. So, how do you view that deepwater Gulf of Mexico, it\u2019s a newer asset for you, how do you view that in the context of the overall portfolio in terms of returns and predictable growth and your ability to add shareholder value?","","Steve Farris","Well, we have said we have a robust list of assets that we might think are more valuable in somebody else\u2019s hands than our own. And we also want to get more predictable and consistent growth. We also have a number of large capital items weed stone being one and kitimat being another. I mean obviously we need to look at that and see how it fits in our portfolio.","","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Charles Meade.","","Charles Meade - Johnson Rice","Going back to the Permian in Mid-Continental areas, do you have a sense of how much you might be able to ramp your activity there from current levels before you started to run into above ground issues or organizational issues?","","Steve Farris","Well it depends on which one you bid. Certainly the Central region, right now we're 10 rigs behind the Permian and we could continue to ramp up there. We can continue to ramp up in the Permian Basin. It's a little and I use the analogy it's like when you have to add a new foreman an appeal I mean you get 16 pumpers in a field and then you got to add a new foreman. So I am not sure where that line is in terms of what it takes from an organizational standpoint to make a step change to add another foreman if you understand my analog.","","Charles Meade - Johnson Rice","I think I do.","","Steve Farris","But certainly we could ramp up from here.","","Charles Meade - Johnson Rice","Got it. Okay, in both those areas in both the Permian and Mid-Continent?","","Steve Farris","Yes.","","Charles Meade - Johnson Rice","Okay, great. That's exactly what I was looking for. And then if I could also just try to follow-up a bit on the questions that Joe Allman was asking, do you have a preference on the assets sales that you are pursuing? Do you have a preference for a complete exit from an area or an asset versus a sell down of selling the percentage of what you hold?","","Steve Farris","No different assets in a different way. So, there may be some that we have partners and there may be some that we have a complete access.","","Charles Meade - Johnson Rice","Got it. So, not an across the board preference but it is asset-by-asset?","","Steve Farris","Right.","","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Leo Mariani.","","Leo Mariani - RBC Capital Markets","Just yet another follow-up on the asset sales. Obviously it looks like you're going to be able to pay down all of your short-term debt with the shelf sale and you're clearly buying back a lot of stock as well. If there are large incremental asset sales where should we expect the proceeds to be directed here? Would it be even more stock buyback or potentially accelerating drilling in the areas like Permian and Central area?","","Steve Farris","I think it's important to note that the more assets that we sell whatever in terms of that are cash flow generating assets. It requires us to pay down more debt in order to keep our A rated and we intend to keep our A rated. So you may see more debt, but you'll have more proceeds. And then that will either depending on our, as we look in the future, it will either buyback additional shares or reinvest it in the business.","","Leo Mariani - RBC Capital Markets","Okay. And I guess in terms of some of your other kind of more fledging areas exploration stuff. Any update on Inland or Alaska or shale\u2019s in Argentina?","","Steve Farris","Yeah. The Cook Inlet in Alaska. In fact we\u2019re getting ready to do some work 3D seismic. Frankly, we were disappointed in the well results that we have there. We drilled the well and actually got too close to a fault (ph) so we really didn't evaluate that well. I am personally still very positive about the Cook Inlet. Obviously we're directing cash to different things right now. So, we've slowed down that activity but in terms of its prospectivity, I still think it has good value. What was the other question? I am sorry.","We have drilled or participated in four or five Bakken mode of (ph) wells. We drilled a couple of horizontal wells ourselves that were very short laterals. That area is politically challenged right now. What we have decided to do is spend our cash flow that we generate there. And so, we are pretty slow in actually continuing to evaluate the (indiscernible).","","Leo Mariani - RBC Capital Markets","Okay, thank you.","","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Singer.","","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs","Thank you. Good afternoon.","","Steve Farris","Hi Brian.","","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs","I wanted to follow-up on the running room topics on Egypt and the North Sea, because I think one of the challenges unrelated to political risk is assessing the impact on production growth of the discoveries that you regularly announced. If you look at production in both areas itself sequentially and I think in the update you highlighted in part declines in Egypt from new and legacy wells. So, I think the question specifically on Egypt since you touched on the North Sea earlier is what should we expect for oil production trajectory over the next few quarters? And can the discoveries that you have announced here drive growth or just reverse the declines that we have seen on a gross basis in the last couple of quarters?","","Steve Farris","Yes, I think it\u2019s \u2013 and Brady went through that the makeup of our production there. And it\u2019s very important to start being able to articulate that because under GAAP what we have to do is report tax barrels, but tax barrels is just a gross up of the revenue line and a gross up of the expense line on the tax side. In order to really look at our growth, because what we do in our plan for the year is we just use last year\u2019s percentages and try to roll them into this year\u2019s plan, because you don\u2019t have any other data to go by. And it plays havoc with really talking about what our percentage growth is, which is why we have worked hard over the last couple of quarters. And that leads into my next point.","If you look at our gross operated production, which is where you start in Egypt, our gross operated operation is basically flat for the year. If you look at our net because of the differences in the tax barrels, our production has been down which is why we are trying to make sure we articulate what is happening in Egypt. Right now, we are spending enough money to grow slightly our gross operated production. And it truly is a function of how much capital you want to spend, because with the opportunity set is still very robust. And what we have done right now is we are spending capital enough that we think we can grow gross operated production slightly for the year.","","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs","Got it. And is that going to be maintaining an equal mix of oil and natural gas or do you expect a further shift to more towards natural gas here?","","Steve Farris","Yes, we are about most of the things that we are drilling right now are oil.","","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs","Great, thanks. And then on a follow-up on the Cline shale you talked about your 30-day IP rates, can you just put into context how the Cline competes in your portfolio relative to the Wolfcamp shale and the Mid-Continent?","","Steve Farris","In terms of rate of return, Brian?","","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs","Exactly. And in terms of rate of return, how you think about where the next dollar of capital goes in the U.S. onshore?","","Steve Farris","Well, probably the Cline shale right now, because we are still \u2013 if you are talking about horizontal wells, vertical Clines are very economic. Horizontal wells are 20% \u2013 honestly, 20% rates of return. If you look at the things we are doing in the Anadarko Basin especially with any kind of oil at all, the rate of returns are in the 30%, because we are ahead of the game in terms of reducing our cost against our benchmarks in the Anadarko Basin than we are in the Permian Basin. We are still on the learning curve in the Permian Basin, Brian, but the Wolfcamp shale is its 30% rates of return.","","Rod Eichler","Our Wolfcamp development is also 18 months further developed in the Cline. And just in terms of share numbers and the things that we are doing out there, we are still learning a lot in the Cline. Our results are very good, but we are not as mature there as we are of our knowledge or the understanding of Wolfcamp shale in the same area.","","Steve Farris","And In fact I said on the European Roadshow, I mean throw us in that broader patch, I mean I can't name another company that can get cost down and production up like this outfit can and this is perfectly example of doing that. If you look at our Tonkawa wells we were, last year we were making about an 18% rate of return and we were $1.5 million more. This year you take out a $1.5 out of that cost side it's over 40% rates of return in Tonkawa. So, it's purely a margin game and I think we can play that game very well.","","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Hall.","","Michael Hall","I just want to make sure I\u2019m thinking about the kind of go forward 2013 production outlook correctly, let\u2019s get in the moving pieces. If I have to just hold the U.S. Gulf, the shelf assets let's say flat from the second quarter levels. Will that be with the 3% to 5% growth target that you spoke about previously this year, still be a fair target?","","Rod Eichler","Well I think in the Gulf of Mexico flat it's probably not a good assumption frankly. If you look at on a pro forma basis, where you would to take the Gulf of Mexico shelf operations out of the forecast for '13 and then do the same thing for '12. We projected that we would have a double-digit decline in the Gulf of Mexico shelf so therefore the 3% to 5% would obviously have been a higher number if you did on a pro forma basis. I think that's probably the right way to think about it.","","Michael Hall","I guess I am trying to understand the go forward pieces and how those are progressing well for the prior plan which maybe you will be able to walk through maybe through the key areas. It sounds like North Sea is down third quarter coming back up until fourth, Egypt we just walked through maybe it's around through some of the other?","","Rod Eichler","Yeah I think when you look at the third quarter we\u2019re not going to give specific guidance, but if you look at the onshore North American plays that we\u2019re doing, I would suspect that the third quarter growth would be fairly consistent with what we experienced in the second quarter with the goal obviously the guidance we've reiterated at 25% greater than 25% North American onshore liquids growth. When you look at the offshore Gulf of Mexico including the deep water and you also look at Australia, we had guided earlier in the year that they would be down roughly double-digits. So, I think that's the right way still to think about them, even though the shelf hopefully will close by September 30th we won\u2019t have them in the fourth quarter.","And then I think with the North Sea, Steve had already mentioned that we expected to be down in the third quarter a little bit because of the turnaround. You are going to have offsets because of wells coming on production, some of which we announced recently including the Bacchus well today. But you know that turnaround at the 40 field turnaround, on average for the quarter we expect it to be down 10,000 to 12,000 boe per day even though it will happen in the month of August; the average would be about 10,000 to 12,000 boe per day down. As a result of the turnaround but that's what we've already got built into our plan.","","Michael Hall","That\u2019s helpful and then if I could just follow-up in terms of Canada what you're doing of those assets perhaps just a little additional color kind of maybe what the underlying decline of the legacy activity looks like and how quickly you think you could turn that into a growth program with any of these new targets you kind of alluded to?","","Steve Farris","Well I think we have two things going on in Canada. One is we have got our transition into more of an unconventional play up there. And then we got to look at our legacy assets and decide what to do with them. And we're in the process of doing that frankly. We would like that region to come out is in a position to be able for 2014, being in a able position to be able to grow and adding a meaningful growth area for us in North America onshore.","","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of (inaudible).","","Unidentified Analyst","Steve, just a couple of questions regarding the deep shale for the subsalt in the Gulf of Mexico, I note that you retained half your interest there, what are the near-term drilling plans related to the subsalt play?","","Steve Farris","Actually, we have two wells that we are drilling as we speak, and it will be a continuing part of our portfolio. If you think about it in terms of reserve size to cost, we also have an agreement that we have a facility right on the current HBP acreage that we sold to Fieldwood, so that we can take them through those platforms. The two prospects that we are drilling right now, I think the un-risk predicted or expected reserves on one is 104 million barrels and the other one is 136 million barrels. And we are not down on either one of them, but that\u2019s \u2013 so when you think about what the infrastructure costs that you are foregoing and the reserve size that you are looking at, you have a real potential across that shelf to make that subsalt play.","","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. And if I remember correctly, you are involved with a 3D shoot in the Central Gulf of Mexico, is that still ongoing?","","Steve Farris","It is. We have a wide seismic shoot going on and that we won\u2019t have the results to the latter part of this year, actually the end of this year the actual process data, but we are continuing to shoot.","","Unidentified Analyst","Alright, thanks very much.","","Brady Parish","Hey, Richard, we do provide a little bit of detail on Main Pass 295, which is one of the wells that Steve is alluding to within our ops report.","","Unidentified Analyst","Okay.","","Brady Parish","As we go into the Gulf of Mexico shelf, there is a little paragraph on it.","","Unidentified Analyst","I appreciate that. Thank you.","","Operator","And I am showing that we have no further questions at this time.","","Brady Parish","Okay, excellent. Well, thank you very much for participating in the call, and again, if you have any additional questions, don\u2019t be shy reach out to us, and we\u2019ll be happy to help.

My name is Natalia, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Second Quarter 2019 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker's remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","Thank you. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Gary Clark, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin, sir.","Gary Clark","Good morning and thank you for joining us on Apache Corporation's second quarter financial and operational results conference call. We will begin the call with an overview by CEO and President, John Christmann. Tim Sullivan, Executive Vice President of Operations Support, will then provide additional operational color; and Steve Riney, Executive Vice President and CFO will summarize our second quarter financial performance. Also available on the call to answer questions are Apache Executive Vice Presidents, Mark Meyer, Energy Technology, Data Analytics and Commercial Intelligence; and Dave Pursell, Planning, Reserves and Fundamentals.","Our prepared remarks will be approximately 20 minutes in length, with the remainder of the hour allotted for Q&A. In conjunction with yesterday's press release, I hope you've had the opportunity to review our second quarter financial and operational supplement, which can be found on our Investor Relations Web site at investor.apachecorp.com.","On today's conference call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the differences between these non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the supplemental information provided on our Web site. Consistent with previous reporting practices, adjusted production numbers cited in today's call are adjusted to exclude non-controlling interest in Egypt and Egypt's tax barrels.","Finally, I'd like to remind everyone that today's discussions will contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions based on our current views and reasonable expectations. However, a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from what we discuss today. A full disclaimer is located with the supplemental data on our Web site.","And with that, I will turn the call over to John.","John Christmann","Good morning and thank you for joining us. On today's call, I will provide an overview of Apache's second quarter results, comment on our production outlook and capital investment program for the remainder of the year, outline our current position and initiatives in the Permian Basin, Egypt, North Sea, and offshore Suriname, and conclude with some thoughts on capital allocation in the context of the current macro environment.","The second quarter Apache's total adjusted production exceeded guidance with upstream capital spending of just under $600 million. Through mid year, we have invested less than 50% of our four-year budget of $2.4 billion. We are focused on strict capital discipline which is achievable given our level loaded activity set and relatively stable operational pace over the last couple of years.","Permian Basin oil volumes drove our guidance in the second quarter for a few reasons. Tim will provide more details. But in aggregate we brought online 15 fewer wells than anticipated and incurred a significant delay in initial production from several other wells. Most of these items are just timing related from which we will fully recover by yearend. Internationally and at Alpine High, volumes in the second quarter were in line with our adjusted production guidance.","Construction and commissioning of Altus Midstream's first two cryogenic processing plants were on budget and ahead of schedule. The first cryo plant has already exceeded nameplate capacity. The second plant is fully in service and ramping inlet volumes. And the third plant is scheduled for startup around year end.","For the remainder of 2019, capital will be at or below our second-half budget of $1.2 billion. With activity more heavily weighted toward completions, this should result in good production momentum as we exit 2019. We have revised our second-half Permian Basin production guidance to reflect the delays we experienced in the Midland and Delaware as well as projected third quarter gas deferrals at Alpine High.","Our fourth quarter Alpine High production target of 100,000 BOE per day is unchanged from prior guidance. This is based on a plan to return all deferred production to sales by the beginning of October with the GCX pipeline startup. It also assumes that Altus Midstream's cryo units are operating in full ethane recovery mode. We will prioritize value over production volumes and depending on the prevailing gas and NGL prices may to choose to reject ethane at Alpine High, which would impact our reported fourth quarter volumes.","Internationally, we continue to expect third and fourth quarter volumes to be in line with prior guidance. With that, I would like to offer some specific comments on our key operating areas of the Permian Basin, Egypt, and North Sea as well as offshore Suriname. In the Permian Basin, Apache has one of the industry's largest acreage footprints and a diverse inventory of opportunities. For more than two years now, we have been running a six to ten rig program focused on oil development in the Midland and Delaware basin, and a five to nine rig program focused on Alpine High.","In the Midland and Delaware basins, we are in full development mode delivering highly productive top tier oil wells at very competitive cost. We have a large inventory at oil prone locations that continues to expand with ongoing improvements and understanding of the resource base. This position will support a higher base right count should we choose to add or reallocate capital from other areas.","At Alpine High, we have a very large resource base, much of which has been advanced to development ready inventory. With that accomplished, Alpine High must now compete for capital with the rest of our Permian assets. In the short term, Alpine High economics were adversely impacted by very depressed gas pricing at Waha. In response, we are continuing to defer the majority of our lane [ph] gas and a portion of our rich gas production until the GCX pipeline enter service in late September.","From a cash flow and returns perspective, it is far more viable to wait a few weeks and produce into an improved price environment. At current gas and NGL prices, some portions of Alpine High are less competitive than other opportunities in our portfolio. If this pricing situation does not improve, some capital will be re-allocated to areas with more leverage to oil price most likely elsewhere in the Permian Basin.","Turning to Egypt, Apache is the largest acreage holder in the Western Desert and is the country's leading oil producer giving a strong leverage to Brent pricing with a substantial increase in our acreage position over the past two years and a 3 million acre broadband seismic acquisition program nearly two-thirds complete. We anticipate a significant refreshed inventory of oil focused opportunities. This should help increase capital efficiency and returns as we continue to generate a high level of free cash flow. Egypt provides tremendous long-term sustainable oil production potential.","In the U.K., North Sea Apache has some of the industry's best assets and one of the lowest cost operations, production recently reached a two-year high driven by continued exploration success in the barrel area and a shallower oil decline rate in the Mature Forties Field resulting from a sharpened focus on water flow and activities. Annual capital investment has been less than $300 million and with strong leverage to Brent oil prices, the North Sea is consistently generating substantial free cash flow.","In the fourth quarter, we will bring online another exploration discovery at store in the barrel area in a second development well at Garten. We have plenty of exploration running room in the North Sea with the ability to tie discoveries back relatively quickly and inexpensively to leverage existing infrastructure.","In Suriname, we currently anticipate receiving the Nobel Sam Croft drillship during the second half of August and spudding our first exploration well on Block 58 in September. We have secured this rig for a one well commitment with an option on three additional wells. We believe that Block 58 offers tremendous potential and multiple wells across the block will likely be warranted for proper evaluation irrespective of the initial wells outcome. While we intend to drill the first well at 100% working interest, we have continued interest from potential partners.","To summarize, our current portfolio Apache has an extensive inventory of high quality assets ranging from significant identified resource ready for short cycle development to large scale highly prospective exploration. This includes at scale in both conventional and unconventional resource covering the full spectrum of hydrocarbon potential from oil to liquids rich gas tilling gas. When we began 2019, the commodity price environment was volatile but planning based on a $50 to $55 WTI and a 250 to 280 Henry Hub for the long-term felt prudent, if not slightly conservative.","Oil prices so far are delivering on that expectation. But gas prices are significantly weaker. Additionally, NGL prices took a material downturn in the second quarter and are now trading near historic lows around 35% of WTI.","In this volatile commodity environment, a high quality diverse portfolio with the flexibility to redirect capital is a significant advantage. As we progressed our longer term planning process, we are closely monitoring macro commodity fundamentals and evaluating many capital allocation scenarios for 2020 and beyond under a number of different pricing decks.","We look forward to sharing our preliminary thoughts on this in the coming months. In closing, our strategy for creating shareholder value is straightforward. Flex our capital allocation and leverage our portfolio commensurate with the prevailing commodity price environment live within cash flow at reasonable oil prices and generate free cash flow to return to investors, fund the capital program capable of delivering a sustainable combination of long-term returns with a moderate pace of growth, execute on our differential high impact conventional and unconventional exploration opportunity set. I'm confident Apache can deliver on this strategy given our diversified and well-balanced portfolio, high quality drilling inventory, relatively low Permian oil base decline rate, attractive exploration portfolio and continuous focus on improving capital productivity and efficiency.","With that, I will turn the call over to Tim Sullivan who will provide some operational details on the quarter.","Tim Sullivan","Good morning. From an operational perspective, Apache's highlights for the second quarter 2019 include larger pads with longer laterals in the Southern Midland Basin, strong Barnett results at our Mont Blanc pad and Alpine High an oil discovery on one of our new concessions in Egypt and steady development work in the North Sea at store and garden.","Please refer to our second quarter financial and operational supplement for drilling pad and well highlights across our portfolio. Company-wide adjusted production was down from the first quarter 2019 reflecting the sale of mid-Continent assets during the period and deferred production at Alpine High. Year-over-year production was roughly flat. In the second quarter, we drilled and completed 67 gross wells, 54 in the Permian Basin, 11 in Egypt and 2 in the North Sea.","In the U.S. second quarter 2019 production totaled 264, 000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. As John mentioned, Permian Basin oil production was impacted by some one-off events or pads and wells are commencing production later than planned. We are trialing a new electric-powered frac fleet however, commissioning of the fleet took longer than expected and it arrived on our first location 30 days late impacting not only the initial pad but follow on pads as well. We have since fracked 11 wells on four different pads with this fleet operational efficiencies are improving and on a single well basis, we realized more than $250, 000 in diesel savings alone while reducing emissions an estimated 90%.","Also in the Midland Basin an early sidetrack during drilling operations coupled with flow-back limitations on the pad delayed peak production nearly a month from the Black Dog pad, which includes 9 wells drilled with 2 mile laterals. This pad is now producing as expected.","In the Delaware Basin, we drilled 5 wells at Dixie Land and have deferred the completions, while we remediate mechanical issues at two of the wells. We are working our completion schedule and expect to place these wells online later this year, but the precise timing is uncertain.","The impact of these production delays has affected second quarter results and will linger into the third and fourth quarters. We expect to be caught up with all this year's plan completions by year-end and we anticipate fourth quarter oil production to come in between 100,000 and 105, 000 barrels per day compared to our prior guidance of 105,000 barrels per day.","We are also benefiting from the start up of Altus Midstream, new cryogenic processing plants at Alpine High. Drilling and completion costs at Alpine High continue to improve on a cost per foot basis as we execute more development activity. Pad development continues to drive down costs into our projected range, drilling completing and equipping costs on one mile laterals are approaching $5.5 million per well. International adjusted production of 132,000 BOE per day came in as expected.","In Egypt, we drilled our first lower Bahariya discovery and our new East Bahariya concession the well flowed at an initial test rate of 3900 barrels of oil per day. This success of a number of additional low cost short cycle drilling locations, we are also building inventory with our 3D seismic survey across 3 million acres in the Western Desert, where we have completed over 65% of the shoot.","Turning to the North Sea third quarter production will be impacted by annual turnaround maintenance with production rebounding in the fourth quarter. The subsea tieback development at store remains on schedule for first production in the fourth quarter. We also expect to have a second producer at Garden drilled and completed by year-end.","With that, I will now turn the call over to Steve.","Stephen Riney","Thank you, Tim. On today's call, I will briefly review second quarter financial results and a few updates to 2019 guidance. Discuss the impact of our recent asset sales, and our continuing debt management initiatives and update the status of our promise for returning capital to investors.","As noted in the press release issued last night, under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, Apache reported a second quarter 2019 consolidated net loss of $360 million or $0.96 per diluted common share. These results include a number of items that are outside of core earnings, which are typically excluded by the investment community and they're published earnings estimates.","On an after-tax basis, the most significant items include $220 million for asset impairments, most of which were associated with our recent asset sales, $114 million of evaluation allowance on deferred tax assets, and $59 million for a loss on extinguishment of debt. Excluding these and other smaller items, adjusted earnings for the second quarter were $41 million or $0.11 per share.","Upstream capital investment was less than $600 million for the second consecutive quarter, demonstrating our commitment to running a level-loaded disciplined capital program and meeting our full-year upstream budget of $2.4 billion. Capital spending in the third quarter will be biased slightly higher than the fourth quarter due primarily to P&A work in the Gulf of Mexico, and development spending on store in the North Sea. LOE per BOE for the quarter was above expectations, primarily due to higher salaries in Egypt driven by in-country inflation and increased diesel consumption in both Egypt and the North Sea. Looking ahead, we have increased our full-year LOE per BOE outlook to capture the impact of these higher cost trends and ongoing gas deferrals at Alpine High.","Offsetting LOE costs, gathering, processing, and transportation costs were below guidance in the quarter. And our guidance for the full-year has been revised downward. This is primarily driven by the sale of assets. In May and in July, Apache completed the sale of midcontinent assets in two separate transactions, resulting in $560 million of net cash proceeds after typical closing adjustments. A portion of these proceeds was used to retire $150 million of bonds that matured in early July. During the second quarter, we refinanced $546 million of debt maturing over the next five years to enhance near-term liquidity. We also refinanced $386 million of higher coupon debt of various maturities to lower our cost of borrowing. Combined with the debt paydown the net result of these actions is that we reduced overall leverage and extended our debt maturity profile, significantly reducing near-term debt maturities.","In February, we announced our intention to return at least 50% of our incremental cash generation to investors before any increases to planned capital activity. In keeping with this commitment, we began returning incremental cash to investors with the debt paydown in July. In the meantime, our 2019 planned capital activity has not changed, and we have no plans to do so. While oil price and sale proceeds helped create capacity for further capital return to investors, the combination of historically weak gas prices in the Permian, a result in production deferrals, and now extremely weak NGL prices have more than offset the oil price benefit. We will monitor anticipated 2019 cash flows and will continue to prioritize returns to investors over increasing capital spend.","And with that, I will turn the call over to the operator for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question is from the line of Michael Scialla with Stifel.","Michael Scialla","Hey, good morning, guys. John, you mentioned\u2026","John Christmann","Good morning, Mike.","Michael Scialla","You mentioned Alpine High is going to have to compete with the rest of the portfolio with lower than expected NGL and gas prices. Just wondering what your preliminary thoughts are for next year in terms of the midstream, do you go ahead with any additional cryo plants there or how you're thinking about 2020 at this point for Alpine High?","John Christmann","Well, I mean if you look at where we were when we reported this year's plan we had an oil price of $53, and gas was at $2.80, and propane and ethane were at high levels, $0.75 and $0.30. So the gas and the ethane and propane have come down significantly. I think with where we sit today, Mike, and Altus will have their call at 1:00 o'clock. But with where we are today with cryo, two coming on now and three coming on in the fourth quarter, we're in pretty darn good shape on that front. So I think they'll be in a good position to have the infrastructure in place we would need for the capital we look at.","Michael Scialla","And then I wanted to see if you had any updated thoughts on the offset well at Haimara discovery and Suriname, and any thoughts there on any additional color you can\u2026","John Christmann","Well, yes, as far as Suriname, I mean we're obviously anxious. Looks like we're going to get the rig here in a couple of weeks, kind of mid to late August, so it's coming, and we should spot our first well in September. Obviously, from the public data we've analyzed everything we can. We've got 2D data and have looked very closely at all the activity that's going on next door, and we've kind of rolled that in. We have the benefit of a very state-of-the-art 3D with very good resolution. So we've worked our block very, very hard and in detail, and been doing it for multiple years. So we're obviously anxious.","If you look at the Block 58 it's a very large block, it's 1.44 million acres today. We have planned to start our program at 100%, and but there is continued interest in the blocks, I will say that. But when we look at it we have not given specifics on where the location will be. I will tell you we have a number of wells permitted. We have a pretty good idea where it's going, obviously with us about to get the rig, but there's seven play types, there's over 50 large prospects, and there's a pretty good chance that you'll see us lining up some of those targets with where we will choose to drill the early wells. I will tell you, it's going to take multiple wells in this block to fully evaluate it.","Michael Scialla","Very good. Thanks, John.","John Christmann","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of John Freeman with Raymond James.","John Freeman","Hi, guys.","John Christmann","Hi, John.","John Freeman","So sort of following up a little bit on Mike's question, when we look at sort of the really strong margins that you all are getting internationally, and I guess if gas prices and NGL prices sort of remain depressed, I guess just sort of how you're thinking about potentially increasing possibly the allocation of capital that goes international sort of on a go-forward basis now that you're basically saying that Alpine High will have to start competing more on a return basis going forward?","John Christmann","Well, we have a very elaborate dynamic planning process, and it's turned into kind of a 365-day-a-year process. And we're in the throes of that now. And when we look at the portfolio I think the first thing I'll say is we have a very diverse portfolio with many investment options, and none of those have been funding it full capacity over the last couple of years. So we've got a lot of opportunity. Secondly, I would say is that we have a very deep understanding of our asset base, which gives us the ability to make sure we're making those right calls on where we're going to put that capital. And the big thing is we're going to allocate capital to drive long-term value.","So when you look at where we sit today there are numerous places where we have been under investing where we have leveraged oil. Obviously our Midland and Delaware oil positions are two places. We've had a great track record of results there. Those are areas we could go to. When you look at Egypt, we're in the middle of working through the big 3D shoot, and so we're kind of anxious to see what comes out of that shoot, but I can tell you the early returns look very promising. So there are places we can do that as well. There are other oil zones up at Alpine High. And we've got some other places in the portfolio as well. So we have an abundance of deep places where we can put capital, and we'll work through that under normal course and come back later in the year on our plans as we see going forward.","John Freeman","That's great. And then just my follow-up question, you've done a great job on the CapEx front, and obviously are tracking below what would have been expected so far this year. And I guess when you sort of talk about anticipate spending at or below the $2.4 billion budget, I just want to make sure I'm sort of on the same page as the way you're thinking about it. So is it that you're sort of being conservative and you want to wait to see another quarter play out to make sure things still track the way they have so far this year, or is it possible that some of the savings that you're generating you're considering maybe reallocating, reinvesting back somewhere across the portfolio?","John Christmann","Well, there's a lot of factors that come into play. I'll say number one, we took a frac holiday Q1. Secondly, when we brought in our clean fleet, it was a lot -- 30 days late on the commissioning. So we actually are kind of back in loaded in the Permian and we are going to bring on, I think, 60% of our wells in the back half of the year in the Permian. So that's a little bit of a John. Secondly, we've got the Suriname oil out there that is moved. We've always thought most would be third quarter and fourth quarter span, but it's shifted a little bit, so some of it's timing. There are areas where we're seeing it Alpine High, our well costs come down. And so, we're seeing some areas that are helping us a little bit, but there's just a lot of factors that kind of leave us in that position. I think the point to underscore though, is you will not see us increase the activity set. And we feel very confident that we can deliver that activity set for the $2.4 billion or potentially less.","John Freeman","Thanks, John, I appreciate the answers.","John Christmann","You bet.","Operator","So our next question is on the line of Charles Meade with Johnson Rice.","Charles Meade","Good morning, John to you and your team.","John Christmann","Good morning Charles.","Charles Meade","Hey, I want to just pick up where you just left off there. Just a quick question, in Suriname, in answering the last question, you said the Suriname well, at least I think I heard you say that. But either guys are getting this rig in next couple of weeks for the September, you're going to have time on the calendar to drill at least one more well, so. So how many wells are in your plan or in that -- in the capital budget as it exists right now?","John Christmann","Well, in the 2.4, we had budgeted one well a 100%. So we have a one well commitment with the rig, we have an option for three additional wells. And, realistically, we've got one in the budget. And, that's where I'll leave that.","Charles Meade","Okay, got it. Thank you. And then John, going up back to Alpine High, wondering if you could talk us through the process of two things, what is the -- what's the sequence? And what's it going to look like for you guys? And what are you going to be focused on as that Gulf Coast Express comes on beginning of October, maybe mid of September? And how is that going to interact with your decision to recover or reject ethane?","John Christmann","Well, I mean, obviously, we have to watch the dynamics. I mean, we think GCX coming online is a big event for the basin, it's a big event for us and a big event for Alpine High, is we have a quarter of the volume on the 2 Bcf over from like 550 of the 2 Bcf a day is going to move. So, for us, first thing is we want to see what happens to differentials. We want to see the impact that that might have or the follow-through on the NGO prices. So we will be watching that very carefully. We want to make sure we're looking out and looking at longer-term views on things because you can't be shifting capital around need your short-term decisions, but -- so we're going to take a very methodical and deliberate approach. But we'll be cognizant of how those things, kind of play out over the longer-term and what it looks like they're going to do will dictate, how we run some of our capital programs. And we've got the flexibility with the inventory to plan for some multiple scenarios. And so, we'll be ready to go with multiple scenarios. And we'll kind of watch and see how that all unfolds. I think it's going to be good for the Basin. Dave, is there anything you want to add?","Dave Pursell","No. John, the one thing I'd add is on the ethane rejection side. The crowds are up and running. They've operationally flexed them for full rejection and full extract, ethane extraction mode. And so, we'll have the operational flexibility to react at the field to Waha pricing and Waha gas and Gulf Coast NGO prices. So, John is right, we're going to make long-term capital decisions based on long-term views but we will be able to react on a relatively short basis on the -- with the cryo operations.","Charles Meade","Thank you. That's helpful, Dave and John. Thank you.","John Christmann","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is on the line of Gail Nicholson with Stephens.","Gail Nicholson","Good morning, everybody. Question on the North Sea with the final agreement in barrel, can you talk about the potential opportunity set that there and what you guys are looking for with that first well in the fourth quarter?","John Christmann","Well, I mean. Again, we're excited about the North Sea. We've done a really good job over the last few years of being able to generate strong free cash flow from our operations, or you've seen the track record, with calendar and then Garten in terms of tie backs to the infrastructure. You know, what we've been able to do is leverage some of the little further out acreage; we've got a nice tertiary play there. And, you know, we had 100% of that acreage. And so, we are not able to bring a partner in, and we'll get a couple wells carried that I think are, are upside kind of to our picture, but we're very excited about there's been some tertiary discoveries, and we've got some very nice looking prospects that will be able to get drilled as you move into later this year, and then the next year.","Gail Nicholson","Great. And then, one for Steve a housekeeping question. How much PNA CapEx is in 3Q for Gham [Ph]?","Stephen Riney","Yes, there's Gail. I don't remember the exact number, but it's in. I think it's in the $50 million to $100 million range. It's probably a little bit less than that $50, around $50 million, Gail.","Gail Nicholson","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Bob Brackett with Bernstein Research.","Robert Brackett","Hey, good morning. I had a question on the line field process at Gulf Coast Express. I understand we're undergoing line field now. Is that a benefit to you guys in terms of either volume or price?","John Christmann","Bob? I would just say yes.","Robert Brackett","Okay. Second question, then the September spot in Suriname or that -- is that a 40 day well?","John Christmann","Well, it could be as short probably as 30. Or, we kind of looked at 30 to 60. But we'll see.","Robert Brackett","Okay, so 30 to 60 days. And would you plan to announce results immediately on TV, or is that something you'd wait for a conference call to announce?","John Christmann","We just have to see. So I mean, it's -- there's -- there will be multiple targets? And I'll just leave it -- it will kind of play that by year.","Robert Brackett","And by multiple targets, does that mean, you think you could hit perhaps Miocene and Cretaceous reservoirs with a single well born or maybe a sidetrack?","John Christmann","I won't get into as much detail but I think we will be able to stack several of our objective plays.","Robert Brackett","Great. Thanks for the color.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Doug Leggate with Bank of America.","Douglas Leggate","Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Good morning, John.","John Christmann","Good morning, Doug.","Douglas Leggate","John. I wonder if I can just take a twofer. If you don't mind, first of all on Alpine High in Midland, can you -- philosophically, it sounds like you're kind of rationalizing a pivot towards the more oil part of the basin. If that's the case, can you touch on the inventory that you have in the middle inside? And also the trajectory then for Alpine High would the objective then be to basically fill the cryo funds and hold it flat after that or what are you thinking about it?","John Christmann","Well, I mean, I think what you're -- what we're going to do is basically allocate capital based on how we see the commodity price dictate. And then, we've got the luxury to do that, we're at a point today at Alpine High, where we now have that luxury, we hold a lot of the acreage, it won't take a lot of drilling to hold the acreage that we view is very perspective for really rich gas NGO and gas production. And so, we're at a point today where we can let the economics and leverage our portfolio. So there's a couple different scenarios. I think the cryo is recognizing that we own 79% of Altus. And factoring that in is something we will factor into our calculus of how we look at the value proposition there with those -- with prices.","As far as the depth of inventory in the Midland Basin, we feel very good about that, we've been predominantly focused, and we've run more rigs than we run at a day in three areas in the Midland Basin Powell, Wildfire and Azalea. And in there we've drilled somewhere between 20% and 30% of the locations that we see there. We are now adding more landing zones. But you got to understand that that's really only about 20% of our acreage footprint. And you look at the other areas, we've gone out and drill some test wells, Benedum and Hartgrove fantastic results. So we've got a really deep inventory in the Midland Basin. We've been focused on getting to pad development. We went through a period, where we did a lot of testing and slowed down and make sure we get spacing, right, understood gas-oil ratios, where we could move forward and you're seeing the results of those programs. And so, we have a lot of inventory there that is sitting - ready to drill and we just kind of weigh that with the integrated economics in the price deck of how we look at the options in our portfolio.","Douglas Leggate","I appreciate the full answer. My follow-up is on, obviously is on [indiscernible] I just wonder if it sort of run something past get your sense of the - so it seems to me that when we think about the probability of geological success of the Exxon Haimara has basically de-risked some of the parameters that we contributed, particularly hydrocarbon system obviously, how do you guys think about the PG, the probability of geological success on the wells that you're going to drill and if that's the case, can you confirm or could you maybe speak to -- it seem to me that it wouldn't make a lot of sense at this point to drill in the immediate offset well behind Haimara. So, are you going to drill in offshore or is it's a completely independent prospect? And I'll leave it there, thanks.","John Christmann","Well, I mean, first of all, it is exploration. So if I try to pin my guys down there. I'll tell you, you're no better than one in four and that's just because it's exploration. Now that being said, they've moved into a phase where they're better than exploration right next door to us and you have a discovery on the International Water boundaries. So clearly that does two things. It proves that there are hydrocarbons in the system. When we look at the views across by kind of stitching together the 2D and the 3D data, you'll find that the geologic setting is not changing much, but you know, it's exploration. So I'm not going to come out and tell you that it's any higher than that at this point. But we're obviously very anxious to get started. And we're very comfortable going forward at 100% with our interest.","Douglas Leggate","John, just to be clear, any of the four wells potentially planned direct offsets to higher MRO?","John Christmann","We have multiple wells permitted, Doug. And we'll - I'll just say, we'll play them as we go and as we learn.","Douglas Leggate","Awesome, thanks for the answers.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Scott Hanold with RBC Capital Markets.","Scott Hanold","Yes, thanks. I was curious, you know now that I guess the cryo plant I, it has been up and running for a bit and the number two is obviously getting some traction here. Do you have a sense that you know what -- if you were normalized kind of commodity prices like, where do you all think sort of the mix of that NGL basket would be in terms of products?","Dave Pursell","Yes, this is Dave Pursell. Right now, these are the technology used in the cryos, we're removing almost 100% of the ethane. So as a result, if you compare it to an average NGL barrel, this will be a little more heavily weighted to ethane and propane. We're still lining amount - we would anticipate, as we move forward. We'll get a richer gas stream kind of the inlet of the cryos and so, ultimately the NGL barrel will look a little closer to what the traditional Midland barrel looks like with maybe a tad more ethane in it.","Scott Hanold","Okay, so that's sort of the next batch command, you'll get a better sense of that. Okay and then just to stand\u2026","John Christmann","One other thing there too Scott, it's going to change based on the formation. We're into a lot of what we're flowing through there right now is, and as you get into the bottom edge, it's going to get a little heavier as well, but so there is, a lot of dynamics that will, dictate that going forward.","Scott Hanold","Right, and that's all part of the capital allocation process for the future. All right, okay and so then if you look at what do - are some of those product prices, need to do to make Alpine High say compete to say your standard oily Midland. Well, I mean how much, how far off? Are we forward to being more competitive today?","John Christmann","Well, I mean, where we started this year, when we were kind of thinking 53 oil and 280 gas and we have $0.75 on propane $0.30 on ethane. We like the mix where we have. So, we're obviously not there today with where the NGLs have come down and gas specifically. So, clearly that's going to be somewhere between where we were and where we are today.","Scott Hanold","Okay, well that's a good benchmark to give us a sense of where it shifts. I appreciate that, thanks.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs.","Brian Singer","Thank you. Good morning.","John Christmann","Good morning, Brian.","Brian Singer","Just one question on our end, which is with regards to Egypt, you talked about this new discovery on the Bahia area. Can you just add some greater color, on how we should think about the resource potential? How that competes in the portfolio and any impact that could have to either capital investment or growth in Egypt?","John Christmann","Well, I mean if you step back and look. Egypt has got some of the highest returns in our portfolio. So it competes very, very well. We are shooting a large area in the nice thing about Egypt is, it's stack pays. But, they're conventional rock and so you can get a 3,000 or 4,000 barrel a day IP from a vertical well. It's going to cost you $2 million to $3 million. So it's tax out very, very nicely in the portfolio, and I think with the new seismic. If you look back over the last two years, we really kept Egypt flat with two discoveries at Peter and Bear Nice and just drilling offset wells there. So it doesn't take a lot to have a real impact on us and we're obviously anxious to get 3-D. The 3-D back, we think our capital productivity, can improve is the quality of the prospects goes up and we love the leveraged Egypt.","Brian Singer","I mean, I know you manage to cash flow and not the production mix, but as the wet gas picks up in Alpine High is there,-- any interest in kind of offsetting that with greater investments in either Egypt or the North Sea both to improve cash flow and mix?","John Christmann","I mean, we will look as we talked about, as I talked about answering some of their Rick questions. We'll look at the whole portfolio and we'll balance that and look at where you can move short term. It's easier to move into probably our Midland Delaware Basin. But we'll, clearly that will be factored into our capital. We love the Brent price, we love the Brent price exposure in the cash flow or on the international side.","Brian Singer","Great, thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of David Deckelbaum with the Cowen.","David Deckelbaum","Good morning, John and team. Thanks for taking my questions.","John Christmann","Yes","David Deckelbaum","I just wanted to follow-up on some of the discussion around your sensitivities next year and you commented on the NGL prices at Alpine High and gas prices. I guess with TCX coming online and they have to be a day that, you have on there? I guess how do you think about the asset, in terms of minimum activity that you'd be willing to pursue and may be considering the asset as a marketing asset near term to take advantage of that spread and I guess how wide would that spreads have to be for you to us this kind of treated as something where you would just benefit from the marketing margins for the time being?","John Christmann","Well, I mean I think that the thing you look at number one Alpine High. We like the asset, it's a large resources, we've proven there is tremendous rich gas potential. We now have a lot of the infrastructure in place that we need. And quite frankly, we hold a lot of the acreage that is important to us. So from our perspective, we're in a position where, we can continue to high grade acreage and maintain that footprint and keep the optionality. I think as GTx comes on line, we've been waiting for that, I think it's a big event for the gas help here that's kind of why we've elected to curtail some pads, that we're bringing on and wait until it does come online because, there were such a short time away from seeing some increased cash flow. So it's an asset that, we will look to leverage and try to maximize but the important thing is, we have a portfolio. When we only have limited capital, we can put in. So we have to balance that, in regard with our other assets.","David Deckelbaum","Got it. Thank you, guys. And you were successful in the mid-count asset sale, anything else in the hopper these days that you guys are looking at selling?","John Christmann","Not anything that I would call major that we'd have out there, but we're always looking at the portfolio, always looking to trim if there's things we're not going to invest in, if there is areas that others would put, what we would view as good value on our premium value. We're not afraid to turn things loose.","David Deckelbaum","Thanks for the color, guys.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan.","Arun Jayaram","Yes, good morning. Perhaps for Steve, I was wondering Steve, how you think your gas and NGL realizations will trend call it relative to benchmarks post the startup of GTx in the Permian of corporate wide.","Dave Pursell","This is David Pursell, Arun. Once GTx starts out, it would be our anticipation that Waha starts to trade in a more normal position relative to Gulf Coast less transportation. So I think our Permian and we think that will normalize some of the other hubs in the basin. So, you're likely going to see the Permian Basin realizations track in line with the Gulf Coast benchmarks less transportation. Steve, would you add anything to that.","Stephen Riney","Yes, the only thing I would add, David, is that there are some, significant events in terms of increased source or new sources of demand both for gas and for NGLs and for export capacity of NGLs coming online later this year. That would certainly potentially have some impact on pricing both on the Gulf Coast in back to Waha and back to the Permian Basin as well.","Arun Jayaram","Okay. And my follow-up is, you guys announced kind of an agreement which near on an LNG type pricing structure. I think, is in the beginning, I'm wondering if you could maybe shed some light on that and talk about maybe some of the longer term implications from that?","Dave Pursell","Yes, we're probably not going to shed a whole lot of details on that, but basically its structure. So first of all, it's 140 million a day, 140 million cubic feet a day. So, it's not a significant amount of volume that, we're producing and gas that's priced based on that. But it was, it's consistent with what we've always been talking about around Alpine High in the Permian Basin more generally and that is we want, to get a diversified portfolio if you will marketing based sources of realized price for the gas coming out of the Permian Basin and particularly Alpine High. And that's 140 million a day that gives us some flexibility in accessing various LNG markets around the world and getting netback from realized prices at landing points.","Arun Jayaram","Okay. Any details, just on the mechanism just trying to understand maybe the financial impact on that 140 million a day?","Dave Pursell","The mechanism is it's a relatively simple one. We have flexibility as to where the product goes in terms of pricing and it's a net-back based on tolling arrangements and shipping costs.","Arun Jayaram","Okay, fair enough thanks.","Operator","Your final question is from the line of Michael Hall with Heikkinen Energy.","Michael Hall","Thanks, good morning or good afternoon. Yes, I was just curious what the base case assumption; our thought process is on extending the rig to drill to follow-up wells in Suriname at this point? Well, you guys go ahead and drill those three wells. Is that kind of the base thought, or is that dependent on whether or not you secure JV partner in the area.","John Christmann","It's purely an option, Michael, and all we've said is we're committed to want to, we have the option to take the rig and drill 3 more and that the block is going to be going to need additional wells.","Michael Hall","And if you were to extend it and take and go kind of heads up on that on your own, is that - how would that kind of fall in the pecking order in 2020 in terms of capital allocation given that it's - there is no clear - commodity linkage yet.","John Christmann","I'll just say it would be exploration dollars with material upside and I'll leave it there.","Michael Hall","All right, fair enough. Thanks guys.","John Christmann","Thank you.","Operator","There are no further questions. I will turn the call back over to John for closing remarks.","John Christmann","So first, I want to end on a -- just a couple of points, approximately 60% of our planned 2019 Permian oil weighted wells will come online in the second-half of the year, giving us confidence in our year-end oil production exit rate. Second, our 2019 upstream capital spending is on track and will be at or below $2.4 billion. Next year's capital plan, assuming current strip around these levels will be $2.4 billion or more likely less. And lastly we are closely monitoring oil, NGL and natural gas fundamentals and we'll allocate capital within our portfolio in response to the longer-term price signals. Thank you very much.","Operator","This concludes today's earnings call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."],"1795":["Apache Corp.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Apache Corporation First Quarter Earnings 2015 Conference. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you.","At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Gary Clark. Sir, you may begin.","Gary T. Clark - Vice President-Investor Relations","Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us on Apache Corporation's first quarter 2015 earnings conference call. Speakers making prepared remarks on today's call will be Apache's CEO and President, John Christmann; and CFO, Steve Riney. Also joining in the room today is Tom Voytovich, Executive Vice President and COO of International.","In conjunction with this morning's press release, I hope you have had the opportunity to review our quarterly earnings supplement, which summarizes our operational activities and well highlights across various Apache operating regions. The supplement also includes information on our capital expenditures for the quarter, as well as a chart that illustrates cash sources and uses, and reconciles Apache's change in net debt during the first quarter of 2015. Our earnings release, the accompanying financial tables and non-GAAP reconciliations, and our quarterly earnings supplement can all be found on our website at www.apachecorp.com.","I'd like to remind everyone that today's discussions will contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions based on our current views and most reasonable expectations. However, a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from what we discuss today. A full disclaimer is located with the supplemental data on our website.","This morning, we reported a first quarter 2015 loss of $4.7 billion or $12.34 per diluted share, which includes an after-tax ceiling-test write down of $4.7 billion, primarily related to the impact of declining oil and gas prices. When adjusted for certain items that impact the comparability of results, the first-quarter loss totaled $139 million or $0.37 per diluted share. Cash flow from operations before changes in working capital totaled $900 million during the quarter. Worldwide reported net production averaged 601,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, with liquids production constituting 62% of the total.","I would now like to turn the call over to John.","John J. Christmann - President and Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Gary. Good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us today. I'm pleased to report that we had a successful first quarter on several fronts. Operationally, we executed a very rapid and efficient downsizing of our drilling program. On a go-forward basis, our reduced program better aligns capital expenditures with cash flow in this depressed oil and gas price environment. Specifically, we decreased our North American rig count by 77%, from 65 rigs on December 31 to 15 rigs by the end of the first quarter. We are highly focused on reducing all elements of our cost structure.","On the capital side, we were fortunate to enter this downturn with minimal long-term rig contracts and very few acreage exploration issues. As a result, we were able to quickly adjust our costs, and now project that total drilling and completion costs will ultimately be down between 20% and 40% in 2015 from the levels we disclosed for our key plays at our North American update in November. And compared to 2014, we are on track to achieve an overall 25% reduction in average drilling and completion costs. As the year progresses, we anticipate capturing potentially more savings.","With regard to G&A, over the past 18 months Apache has divested a substantial number of operated properties and exited several operational areas. Our smaller footprint now requires less overhead and a more prudent approach to spending. Every dollar we save in corporate overhead can be recycled into our asset base to generate a return for our shareholders.","We are structuring Apache's organization, planning functions and operational teams to provide maximum flexibility to respond to commodity price changes and cash flow availability. We have budgeted conservatively at $50 WTI for the year. And while first quarter oil prices came in a little below that level, the second quarter is off to a good start. Should oil prices stabilize at these higher levels and cash flow increase accordingly, we are well-positioned to ramp up the drilling program in an efficient and cost-effective manner.","Despite a significant reduction in drilling and completion activity, we were able to minimize our first quarter production decline in North America from record fourth quarter levels. We also encountered some significant weather challenges in our Permian and Central regions during the quarter. However, North American onshore production still exceeded the high end of our guidance range.","On the international side, Egypt and the North Sea both outperformed our expectations during the quarter, primarily on the strength of successful delineation drilling and better than expected well performance. Australian operations were generally on track in Q1. However, production was adversely impacted by two cyclones that hit late in the quarter.","Turning to our capital spending; during the quarter, capital expenditures before LNG, capitalized interest and Egypt's minority interest was $1.3 billion. This represents approximately 36% of our full-year 2015 capital budget, the midpoint of which has been reduced to $3.65 billion. CapEx was in line with our expectations for the quarter and consistent with our commentary on last quarter's call that we were coming into 2015 hot on activity and capital.","Given the magnitude and success of our first quarter activity and spending ramp down, we remain confident in our 2015 CapEx guidance. Also, despite our significantly lower activity levels for the rest of the year, we remain comfortable with our pro forma North American onshore production guidance of relatively flat compared to 2014.","In summary, it was a very good quarter both domestically and internationally. And I'll provide a little more detail on the regions in a moment. Since the last earnings call, we have made excellent progress on our portfolio repositioning initiatives.","In April, we announced the closing of our Wheatstone and Kitimat LNG assets along with a definitive agreement to sell the remainder of our Australian oil and gas assets. We expect to close the Australian asset sale around mid-year and our updated capital and production guidance provided in this morning's press release takes into account this assumption. In his prepared remarks, Steve Riney will discuss how we plan to utilize the $5.8 billion of proceeds from these transactions.","I'd like to now make some comments about our operating regions and also provide some color on our projected year-end horizontal well backlog.","As I noted earlier, we substantially reduced our drilling and completion activity during the first quarter. In North America, we completed 42% fewer total wells compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. More importantly, we deferred our scheduled horizontal completion count in anticipation of better pressure pumping pricing from our third-party vendors.","For example, we completed only 84 operated horizontal wells in North America during the first quarter compared to 153 operated horizontals during the fourth quarter of 2014. Despite these activity reductions, our first quarter North American production averaged 307,000 BOEs per day and exceeded our guidance range of 300,000 BOEs per day to 305,000 BOEs per day.","In our Permian region, production grew 6% compared to the first quarter of 2014, but decreased by roughly 10,000 BOEs per day or approximately 6% from record levels in the fourth quarter of 2014. The majority of this sequential quarterly decrease of approximately 7,800 BOEs per day is attributable to severe winter weather-related downturn.","In fact, had we not encountered weather-related shut-ins during the quarter, our oil volumes in the Permian would have been roughly flat compared to the fourth quarter. Assuming no change from our currently budget activity levels, we anticipate the Permian oil production will increase gradually for the remainder of the year, while natural gas production should remain relatively flat.","The Permian production increase in 2015 will be driven by the Delaware Basin, where we anticipate generating significant volume growth from 28 wells scheduled for completion in the second and the fourth quarter.","Key Permian Basin well completions during the quarter included two very strong Delaware Basin horizontal wells; the Condor 205H and 206H in our Pecos Bend area and three solid horizontal wells with relatively short laterals at our Powell-Miller area of the Southern Midland Basin. On a lateral adjusted foot basis, all of these wells produced at 30-day average IP rates above the representative tight curves, which were presented at our November update.","In particular, the Condor wells in Delaware Basin, which have been online for just over two months are substantially outperforming expectations. We look forward to drilling more wells in both of these areas during 2015 and reporting results in the coming quarters.","We are making good progress in reducing drilling and completion costs, particularly in the Delaware Basin, where we plan to be the most active this year. The previously mentioned Condor wells were drilled and completed for around $6 million. This represents a 25% reduction from the $8 million well costs we provided in our November update.","On the Central Basin Platform, we completed a large number of very economic vertical wells from our 2014 backlog and completed two exceptional horizontal wells in our North Monahans area that produced a 30-day average IPs in excess of 1,000 BOEs per day.","In April, we completed our highest IP well ever in our Barnhart area, the Scott Sugg West Unit H11U, which is producing more than 1,000 BOEs per day. Also in April, we put on production our first four Midland County wells in the Wildfire area along with our first well in the Azalea area near the Midland-Glasscock County line. Early results from these core Midland County wells look very encouraging, and it's fair to say that this activity has positioned us well for a good start in the second quarter in the Permian.","Turning to the Central region, production was down 2% sequentially from the fourth quarter after adjusting for asset sales. This was expected following our significant reduction in activity. During the first quarter, we completed only 24 gross operated wells compared to 51 gross operated wells during the fourth quarter.","Apache's primary focuses today in the Central region are the Canyon Lime and the Woodford plays. The Canyon Lime is a tremendous source rock with significant oil in place, but due to the recent drop in oil prices, we have slowed our drilling pace and turned our attention to optimizing our approach and reducing costs in the area.","We have made some significant breakthroughs on the cost side in the Canyon Lime. Drilling costs in our two most recent wells came in around $4.25 million. Completion costs on these well should be roughly $2.75 million each, which means that all in, we believe we can develop this play for about $7 million per well excluding facilities costs. This is also almost 20% lower than the $8.5 million well costs that we showed at our November update.","We brought online our 93H pad during the first quarter and the flow back has been somewhat limited as a result of an extended third-party plant outage. Regardless, these wells appear to be tracking in line with their type curve. We have various tests underway in the Canyon Lime that will help optimize the play and prepare for future rig ramp up.","Under the improved cost structure I noted above, our Canyon Lime inventory starts to become economic at around $60 or $65 per barrel, and we believe there is significant opportunity to improve the economics as we advance the play.","That said, the Canyon Lime will still need to compete for capital on an NPV and rate of return basis with our other plays. To-date, we have drilled 14 wells in the lower Canyon Lime, 12 of which are online and producing. As of March 31, we had a backlog of four wells drilled but uncompleted in the play.","In the Anadarko Basin, we are currently acquiring seismic and delineating roughly 50,000 net acres in the Woodford Springer play, also referred to industry as the SCOOP. We're currently drilling a two-well pad in Grady County and are planning to drill and complete a few additional Woodford wells later in the year.","A tremendous amount of science and testing is also underway in our Eagle Ford play. To-date, we have drilled in four primary operating areas; Reveille, Ferguson Crossing, Remington and Brazos Riverside and have materially advanced our understanding of this intricate resource play.","We have now drilled a total of 86 wells in the Eagle Ford, 45 of which are online and producing. Lithology and hydrocarbon phases change fairly significantly in Northern Eagle Ford. We're continuing to test optimal drilling and completion methods, frac designs and well spacing. Each of these inputs can vary materially depending on the hydrocarbon phase window and clay count of the area.","In Area A, which is generally characterized by higher gas\/oil ratios, the drilling is a bit more complex and expensive due to depletion in the chalk above the Eagle Ford. Our current drilling and completion cost target is around $6.5 million, which is down more than 20% from the $8.4 million we cited back in November.","In Area B, which is a bit shallower, we estimate drilling and completion costs will be around $6 million per well, which is down roughly 15% from previous estimates. We have a large backlog of wells to complete in the Eagle Ford, and while we may not get to all of them this year, we can expect this play will contribute to our North American oil growth in 2015 and 2016. Like the Canyon Lime, we anticipate becoming a more active driller in the Eagle Ford when oil price approaches the $65 per barrel level.","In Canada, we had a good quarter. Weather-related downtime was minimal, and production decreased only modestly from the fourth quarter 2014 levels, despite reduced completion activity. During the quarter, we generated positive results in a new lower-cost oil-rich area of the Montney, which we call Ante Creek. We have some running room there; however, more infrastructure will be needed to bring these wells online.","We also successfully tested the very thick lower Montney formation for the first time in our Wapiti area and believe it will have minimal communication with the currently productive horizons in the upper Montney. In the Duvernay, we just completed drilling our first seven-well pad in the Kaybob area and look forward to completing those wells and bringing on some significant volumes during the quarter.","Turning to our international operations; in Australia, our production averaged 59,400 BOEs per day, which was down from the fourth quarter. During the quarter, we had unanticipated production shut-ins for approximately 2,600 BOEs per day due to the impact of two cyclones that hit the region. Otherwise, the ramp up of our Coniston and Van Gogh fields remains on schedule, as does the planned sale of all of our Australian oil and gas assets by mid-year.","In Egypt, the successful delineation of our Ptah and Berenice fields has led to a recent gross production rate of more than 19,600 barrels of oil per day from seven wells. This month, we plan to place one more delineation well online and increase production to approximately 22,000 barrels of oil per day. Several other new field discoveries have been made across multiple concession areas subsequent to quarter-end. As a result, Egypt is tracking very well against our production outlook from February 12.","Apache's production in the North Sea decreased as expected from a record high in the fourth quarter of 2014, but was up 5% relative to the first quarter of 2014. One of the two main electrical transformers failed on our Beryl Alpha platform, resulting in two weeks of unplanned downtime. This translated into a 2,600 BOE per day net production hit for the first quarter. Our North Sea team responded quickly and commendably to this incident and managed to keep our production tracking in line with plan.","Subsequent to quarter-end, we logged significant pay at new wells in both the Beryls and Forties areas, and there's a high degree of confidence in our 2015 North Sea production outlook, after adjusting for the sale of our non-op interest in the Scott and Telford fields. We're excited about our recently processed 700 square mile 3D seismic survey covering the Beryl field complex and adjoining area. This is the first seismic survey conducted over this field since 1997.","From the higher resolution of the extensive data set, a number of interesting features have surfaced in terms of potentially material exploration targets and lower risk in field drilling opportunities. We look forward to testing these later in the year and in 2016.","Since our fourth quarter call back in February, we've received a lot of questions about our inventory work off in 2015 and our projected drilled but uncompleted well inventory going into 2016. Let me quickly provide you a few numbers that may be helpful for modeling purposes.","We entered 2015 with 207 drilled but uncompleted wells at our North American onshore backlog, 80% of which were horizontals. Based on our current plan, we expect to exit 2015 with between 80 and 100 drilled but uncompleted wells, essentially all of which will be horizontals. I would stress that this assumes that we do not add any additional rigs in the second half of the year.","During this period of depressed oil and gas prices, Apache is not standing still. Though, we have reduced our rig count, we continue to move forward on multiple initiatives that will strengthen the company. I believe these initiatives will help transform our operational and financial results and ultimately drive incremental shareholder value.","I mentioned them last quarter and would like to close by reiterating them here again today. We are realigning our North American incentive program to reward continuous improvement and cost discipline. We are developing detailed medium and longer term field development plans and continue to high grade and build our drilling inventory at multiple price scenarios.","We are continuing to invest heavily in seismic acquisition, processing, and other technical services to provide a more thorough understanding of our acreage and optimize our drilling and completion techniques. We are focused on quick payout, high return work over and re-completion projects that protect our North American production base, and we're consolidating and enhancing our portfolio through opportunistic acreage additions, where there is less competition and lower prices.","I have confidence in the positive impact of these initiatives and I'm excited about our people, our acreage, and our strategy. Despite the commodity price challenges the entire industry faces, I believe Apache will finish this year as a much stronger company then when we began it.","I will now turn the call over to our new CFO, Steve Riney, who I am very pleased to have on board. He has only been here a few short months, but has already made a significant impact on our organizational capabilities. Steve?","Stephen J. Riney - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, John, and good afternoon. It's great to be a member of the Apache team. And I have to say, it's everything I hoped it would be and more. In my three months in the role, I have spent most of my time getting to know the business and the people and understanding how we do things. I have been very impressed with our team. They're dedicated to always doing the right thing and to growing value for our shareholders. We also have a terrific set of assets that are more than capable of delivering on that same goal of growing value.","Before I dive into the first quarter performance discussion, I thought I would share some of my emerging views on top priorities with respect to the role of finance at Apache. There are two particular areas where I am focusing my near-term attention: planning and capital allocation. I have a firm belief that finance plays a key role in stewarding the value proposition for our shareholders. We don't do this alone. There are many others who lead very important elements, but finance plays a vital role in bringing a dispassionate view into the planning process and the capital allocation process.","In planning, we're working to pull together a high-quality view of the next five years as well as to develop a dynamic planning process. Planning is where opportunity and expectations become aligned. Shareholders have expectations with respect to operational performance, financial delivery, and growth. So, there is an element of what we must deliver in the planning process. Our portfolio presents our current opportunity set. This is where planning addresses the question of what can we deliver. Getting these two views aligned builds confidence that long-term delivery is on track, and this is what we're trying to accomplish.","We're working the plan with three price scenarios in mind: a low case of flat $50 WTI; a high case of a rise to $80 WTI, and then flat; and a base case of the five-year strip.","Recent oil price volatility reminds us we have little control over the price environment and underscores the importance of being prepared to take any necessary steps to correct our course. We are redesigning the planning process to significantly improve our visibility into the potential impacts of price movements across the portfolio, so we are prepared to rebalance the activity set accordingly.","Of course, price does not move in a vacuum, and we will take into account that costs move in tandem with prices, and may do so in very different ways for the various pieces of our portfolio. In some places, costs can move very quickly with price movements, potentially providing a natural hedge. In other places, the cost reaction could move much slower.","The capital allocation process is how the plan gets implemented. We have a tremendous variety of opportunities in our global portfolio, and we are working to improve our understanding of how the economics of every element of the portfolio work. It can be more complicated than it is sometimes portrayed and an appropriate depth of understanding gives confidence that the best opportunities are getting funded, and they are truly adding value for our shareholders.","We're also working to establish a strong linkage between the investment economics view of the portfolio and the long-term plan view. It is not enough to understand the depth of economic opportunities in the portfolio. We need to understand how that depth changes in different price environments.","And finally, the various price assumptions in the plan and the corresponding cash flow generation will establish the pace at which the portfolio of opportunities can actually be funded. So, we have a lot of important work to do, but we are already on our way and we have a plan for taking this forward.","Now, let me turn to some of the details of our first quarter results. John and Gary reviewed our earnings and key operational drivers for the quarter, so I'll make a few comments about our ceiling-test write down, planned use of proceeds from recent asset sales, and our 2015 capital spending outlook. I'll then finish up with some directional guidance for the year on a few other items.","As noted in this morning's press release, we reported an after-tax ceiling-test write down of $4.7 billion or $12.48 per share for the first quarter of 2015. This is a result of the current commodity price environment. Under full cost accounting, our upstream assets are carried at historical cost. Each quarter, we compare this cost basis to a calculated PV-10 value. To the extent the net book value exceeds the PV-10 valuation, the result is a ceiling-test write down.","The ceiling-test employs a methodology prescribed by the SEC, which uses trailing 12-month average oil and gas prices. The PV-10 calculation assumes these average prices are held flat into perpetuity. The prices for the last two quarters have dramatically reduced our PV-10 calculation. In addition, since today's trailing 12-month prices still reflects several months of higher prices from last year. If prices do not recover materially, you can expect further impairments during the remainder of 2015.","In terms of our planned use of asset divestment proceeds, in April we received $3.7 billion of proceeds from our LNG transaction with Woodside, and approximately $560 million of U.S. income taxes has become payable as a result of repatriating these funds.","Of the remaining $3.1 billion, $2.6 billion were used in April to pay off commercial paper in short-term bank loans, which you will see on the balance sheet at the end of the first quarter. Around mid-year, we anticipate receiving an additional $2.1 billion, subject to customary post-closing adjustments, upon closing the sale of our remaining Australian oil and gas assets. We plan to use these proceeds in combination of further debt reduction and cash retention.","On page three of our earnings supplement, we provide a net debt reconciliation for the first quarter. On that same page, we present a pro forma view of our actual net debt at March 31 to reflect the asset sale proceeds expected in the second quarter. With this pro forma view, you'll see that our net debt is less than $7 billion, which is less than two times our projected 2015 EBITDA, assuming $50 WTI and $53 Brent.","Turning to capital spending; we continue to anticipate North American CapEx, excluding LNG, to be in a range of $2.1 billion to 2.3 billion. We have no current intentions to expand the planned activity set in North America during 2015. However, if rising oil prices and continued capital efficiency result in 2015 cash flow significantly above plan levels, this may change, and as John indicated, we'll be prepared to respond.","Our anticipated spending levels in the North Sea and Egypt remain unchanged. As we noted in this morning's press release, we're reducing our full-year international capital budget by $150 million as a result of the pending sale of our remaining oil and gas assets in Australia.","Accordingly, our revised guidance for international and Gulf of Mexico capital spending is between $1.3 billion and $1.6 billion. On the cost side, both LOE and G&A are experiencing downward pressure in 2015. These operating expenses came in at just under $10 per BOE during the first quarter, which is 5% lower than 2014 actuals.","For G&A, as John indicated, with the reduction in the scale of the portfolio and reduced activities around the globe, overhead costs should be coming down and they are being specifically targeted for reductions. Some of this has already been accomplished, but there is more to do.","Following the closing of our Australian sales, we will prevent present a more in-depth view of our cost-cutting efforts, especially in the area of G&A spend. Interest expense for the year is projected to be around $460 million. Approximately 50% to 60% of this will be capitalized.","On the tax side, we anticipate our effective tax rate on adjusted earnings in 2015 will be between 25% and 30%. Note that this does not include the one-off benefit in deferred taxes for the recently enacted UK tax rate change, which we expect to be a little over $600 million.","Operationally, you'll see on page two of the first quarter earnings supplement, our North America onshore production guidance is unchanged and is expected to be relatively flat compared to 2014. You'll also see in the earnings supplement that we have updated our pro forma production guidance for the Gulf of Mexico and international operations to be slightly up from 2014. Please note this guidance now excludes Australia production volumes entirely.","I'd like to close by echoing what John said in his remarks. Our goal for the remainder of 2015 is to maintain a strong balance sheet, to live within our cash flow, and to prepare the organization for an efficient ramp up in activity, when the cash flows dictate. We will also continue to be opportunistic, but highly disciplined in evaluating new opportunities that may unfold in this challenging price environment. I am very excited to be a part of the Apache team, and I look forward to meeting with many of you down the road.","I will now turn the call over to the operator to begin Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We'll pause for just a moment to compile the Q&A roster. The first question will come from Doug Leggate with Bank of America.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America \u2013 Merrill Lynch","Thank you. Good afternoon, everybody. John, I wonder if I could take the activity step-up question, if I may, and it's not so much about \u2013 you've laid out what oil price, I think, you would start to go back to work, but you still have a fairly intricate portfolio. You've got a lot of opportunities. How would you think about the incremental allocation of capital? For example, you're running more rigs in the Eagle Ford right now, but if you did go back to work, what would be the first call on spending? And I've got a follow-up on the international, please.","John J. Christmann - President and Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Well, Doug, thank you. We have actually worked hard to be in this position to get our activity levels adjusted and obviously address the cost structure. So, it puts us in the position now where we can be opportunistic. Obviously, prices on the strip right are now running ahead of where we planned, so it puts us in a position to make some choices.","The first and easiest thing, obviously, to do would be to put a couple of frack crews in and recomplete some of our drilled but uncompleted wells, but we want to be very prudent, we want to be opportunistic, we're starting to see some acreage things that pop up that might be very additive to long-term shareholder value, so, Doug, we want to be very prudent, because we worked hard to get into this position, and want to kind of monitor that as the second half of the year unfolds.","We're working through a detailed planning process right now, as Steve lined out, with three price scenarios, and one at $50 flat on the low side, the other one at $80 bracketed, and then the strip, and so that will help us give some guidance in terms of those directions.","Clearly, when I look at the portfolio, the Delaware Basin is an area, and the Permian is an area that we can go in quickly with cash flow in terms of additional activity as we plan to run quite a few more rigs there. And then also both the Canyon Lime and the Eagle Ford at higher prices, we'd scale in there. But, we've got lots of opportunity in front of us, and we want to be opportunistic and very careful on where we go forward.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America \u2013 Merrill Lynch","Just to qualify, John, is the backlog concentrated in one particular area? Or is it pretty much spread around?","John J. Christmann - President and Chief Executive Officer","It's spread around. The lion's share that we mentioned, we came into the year with 207, and 80% of it was horizontal. We will work off the vertical backlog, which was predominantly in the Permian, by year-end. And we said, we'd come in \u2013 exit right now, our plan would be to exit the year with between 80 and the 100 uncompleted wells. A big chunk of those will remain in the Permian, and obviously we've got some in the Eagle Ford and then the other areas.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America \u2013 Merrill Lynch","Okay. My follow-up, John, is on the North Sea. Obviously, you had some interruptions this quarter, but in the absence of exploration success, what is the production prognosis for the North Sea? And maybe if you could just frame into that how you see your backlog of opportunities to hold production flat? I'll leave it there. Thank you.","John J. Christmann - President and Chief Executive Officer","Well, we're very excited about what we've been able to accomplish in the North Sea. We're coming off of a Q4 record high for us of over 80,000 BOEs a day. We've got a deep inventory there. As part of our capital reductions, we did scale back in the North Sea as well. We've got over 200 identified prospects and locations. We've got deep inventory. And for the year, Doug, from where we are right now, we would envision it being relatively flat on a go-forward basis.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America \u2013 Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thanks a lot. I'll leave it there, John.","Operator","The next question will come from David Tameron with Wells Fargo.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning, John. I guess afternoon. What's changed as far as the Delaware? Can you just give a little more detail what you're seeing, why you're getting more aggressive there, and why is the remainder of the Permian program going to be focused there?","John J. Christmann - President and Chief Executive Officer","Well, we'll be focused in two areas. Obviously, the Delaware, even if you go back to our November update, we're planning to run four to five rigs there. That's where we were maintained today, and honestly, right now the economics there are just slightly higher. We've also got some testing we're doing there, which we think can be differential.","Right now, we've only brought on two wells this year. We plan to drill another, or actually complete another 28 wells for the rest of the year. So, we're excited about our position there, and we see lots of opportunity. But, we will also be active in the Midland Basin as well as our Central Basin Platform. About half of our Permian rigs will be in the Delaware and the other half are going to be spread out.","But, we're moving into the Midland County, Southern Midland Basin area, our Wildfire area, Powell, Miller. We're excited about those. We'll actually be doing a Spraberry test later this year in the Wildfire area, and we've also been drilling great wells on the Central Basin Platform. So, it's just part of our portfolio, and right now the economics over there are slightly better than they'd be in the other areas. But, we're excited about all the areas.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And just as a follow-up, if I think about the Delaware, it looks like the couple of wells that you highlighted during the quarter in the supplement were in the third Bone spring. Can you give us any color as to where you plan to focus \u2013 those four rigs? Is there any zone in particular standing out? Can give us any color on that?","John J. Christmann - President and Chief Executive Officer","Well, it really depends on the area. If you look at our Pecos Bend area, where the two Condor wells are, we drilled 31 wells to-date. 21 of those have been in the third Bone springs. We've had six in the Wolfcamp and four in the second Bone springs. Right now, we're kind of dialed in on the third Bone springs, and there's a couple landing zones in there. You move into the other areas, and that's the nice thing about the Delaware is you've got multiple targets, anywhere from the Avalon to the first, second, or third Bone springs or down to the Wolfcamp and some other zones. So, the nice thing is it kind of depends on the area you're in, but with where those rigs are focused.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","All right. Thanks.","Operator","The next question will come from Leo Mariani with RBC Capital Markets.","Leo Mariani - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey. You guys came out in your prepared comments and talked about having a position at 50,000 acres, kind of in the Woodford Springer area. I'm just trying to get a sense if this was a legacy position in the portfolio or something that you guys leased recently. And maybe if you can just provide a little bit more color regarding your comments about some leasing opportunities that have been picking up here?","John J. Christmann - President and Chief Executive Officer","Well, I'll start out with the Woodford. It is predominantly legacy acreage. Last year, we did sprinkle in some sections around there. And we have been blocking that up as we have been most of our key core areas. Currently we've got one well, the Ellis 14-4-6 number 1Hs, it's right now on completion. We've got two rigs out there and we're drilling two wells, the Ellis 14 number 2H and the Truman well. So we've got three wells we'll be bringing on in the very near future. We're very excited about the rates. We've got about 200,000 acres there gross and about 50,000 net, and it's a nice little position that can be very material for us.","In general, obviously, we're seeing some opportunities in all of our core areas. And that where we're busy trying to core up acreage, prep things, and be prepared for when we allocate more capital to some of the high-value areas.","Leo Mariani - RBC Capital Markets LLC","All right. And I guess you guys obviously spoke about some really nice cost reductions here that you've seen here recently on your wells. And a lot of that was focused in the Permian with some of the costs coming down. I wanted to get a sense if you guys are also not only seeing cost reductions, but are you seeing improvements in the wells, just better efficiency as you guys tweak frac design, and you're seeing the wells in the Permian get better here of late. Maybe you can speak to that?","John J. Christmann - President and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I mean, the first thing is we did a very detailed dive on the EURs in the plays in November. And since that time, we've brought on some wells, but not many. You look at the Delaware, we brought on two wells. They are outperforming our type curve, so we're doing some things there technically which we think can improve those. But with two wells on, they've only been on 60 days, I'm not in a position right now to be updating type curves. And the same is pretty much true in our other areas.","Our Canyon Lime wells are coming on relative to type curves. In the Eagle Ford, we've got some slightly above, some under. So, we feel really good about those areas. We are seeing cost, we've kind of dialed in 10% to 15% on the last call when we talked about the plan for 2015.","Clearly, we said that they're going to range from 20% to 40% right now. We're seeing on average about 25%. A lot of that's attributable to the service side. But, a lot of it's just more people now focused on ways to drive cost out and doing a better job planning our wells. And clearly, if prices remain where they are, we're going to see costs further align and come down for the rest of 2015.","Leo Mariani - RBC Capital Markets LLC","I guess, previously you folks had spoken in the past, predominantly last year, about separating North American business from the rest of the international properties. I just wanted to see, if there's any kind of status update on that or if you've got kind of a new way of thinking about any type of separation of the business lines.","John J. Christmann - President and Chief Executive Officer","Well, we addressed that on the first quarter call. But the key objectives with us on our international portfolio were two. One, unload our LNG, which we have done, signed, closed. And then we announced the sale of Australia. I think that leaves us with a portfolio now that we plan to stick with, we're excited to have. We're 60% to 70% North America. If you look at our North Sea and our Egypt operations, we've got world-class people there as well as leading positions.","And the nice thing about both the international assets, they complement our North American portfolio, they're Brent pricing. And the other thing is the way the PSCs and the tax regimes work, you've actually got less sensitivity to lower oil prices in terms of after tax cash flow.","So, going forward, we're going to, as we work through our planning process, we're working through North America, we're also working through Egypt and the North Sea, and we will be outlining longer-term plans. But, we're very happy with the portfolio as it stands today.","Leo Mariani - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you very much.","Operator","The next question will come from Bob Brackett with Bernstein Research.","Bob Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Good afternoon. Question on that impairment, the $4.7 billion. Can you give some detail what assets were involved there?","Stephen J. Riney - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, Bob. So, the primary assets that were involved there were the U.S., Canada and the North Sea. There was about a $7.2 billion gross impairment. You'll see in the 10-Q, it'll be released later today, that $5.2 billion of that was in the U.S., $1.4 billion of that was in Canada, and about $600 million of that was in the North Sea. All of that's on a pre-tax basis.","Bob Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. And the U.S. assets how would those split?","Stephen J. Riney - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, we're not providing a breakdown of that into the U.S.","Bob Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. And then a follow-up, on the net proceeds, what's the ultimate use of those net proceeds that you've collected from Australia?","Stephen J. Riney - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So, we collected $3.7 billion pre-tax proceeds. We've got about a $600 million tax liability that will get paid later this year, so the $3.1 billion net, $2.6 billion of that went in the month of April to pay down the debt, the short-term debt that existed on the balance sheet at the end of 1Q. The $2.1 billion that will be coming in sometime right around midyear for the second Australia transaction, that $2.1 billion will be used as a combination of debt pay down and some cash retention. We haven't decided exactly the ratio of that yet, but I would say the majority of that will be going to debt pay down.","Bob Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","The next question will come from Arun Jayaram from Credit Suisse.","Arun Jayaram - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Good afternoon, John and Steve. My first question regards the new planning process that's under way. I think you articulated maybe three different pricing scenarios that you would look at. I was just wondering if you could give us a sense of when this planning process is completed, what will be \u2013 will there be a new set of targets that you'll communicate to the Street, and could this potentially impact your views on 2015 production and capital?","John J. Christmann - President and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, Arun, at this point we're working through that. Obviously, we've got early looks, but we're taking a really deep dive at the portfolio and one of the keys is, it's an iterative process as you have to try to really synchronize cost with price environment for each of those. So, what we're really trying to do is put some sidebars on the world we'll be operating in as we start to take a longer-term view. I don't envision anything impacting 2015 from where we sit today for how we budgeted it. And so, we feel good about where we are, but we'll be working through that, and over the next several months we'll get to where we have an internal view as we start to think about how we react going into 2016.","Arun Jayaram - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Great. Great. Obviously, John, the balance sheet is in a different place, or will be once you complete the transactions. You commented in the press release about potentially being opportunistic yet disciplined. Historically, Apache has been a counter-cyclical investor, so where is your head at in thinking about potential acquisitions, and would you be focused in on your core area, or look for new areas?","John J. Christmann - President and Chief Executive Officer","Well, Arun, where my head is right now is delivering value for the shareholders and trying to maximize that. And I think we have positioned ourselves very nicely. The nice thing is we have high-quality assets and deep inventory, but we also are always opportunistic and always in looking at opportunities, so if there was something that we thought made sense and incrementally might add value, then we might be willing to move forward on it.","But, in general, we're happy with our asset base and we're going to be very selective, but clearly we're in a position where we have a lot of flexibility, and you'd never know what might present itself.","Arun Jayaram - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Just my final question, as you think about capital allocation to the Permian this year, could you give us a sense of what percentage of your CapEx, perhaps ballpark, is going for Midland versus Delaware and how that could shift over time given your comments on the Delaware today?","John J. Christmann - President and Chief Executive Officer","Well, I mean, when we look at where we sit right now, kind of like even like what we lined out in November, about 60% of our CapEx on North America is in the Permian. When you look at what we've done with the price environment, we've slowed down much more so than we had planned in the Eagle Ford and the Canyon Lime, and even Canada. So, for the bulk of the year, the majority of our capital is going to be going into the Permian. I would say that in terms of, if we were to add incrementally, the Southern Midland Basin would be an area we've got the best \u2013 most flexibility and things ready to drill that we could move quicker on.","We had kind of planned even in higher capital and prices to run the number of rigs we're running in the Delaware. So, we like our pace right there given our asset base, so I would say incrementally we'd probably add first in the Delaware or we might choose to accelerate in the Delaware or add in the Midland Basin.","Arun Jayaram - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Thanks a lot, John.","Operator","The next question will come from Charles Meade with Johnson Rice.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Good afternoon, John, and to the rest of your team there. If I could ask a question about those Wildfire wells that you just mentioned in your operations report. Presumably, if you were ready to share already you would have put it in there. But, you did I believe say that the early flow back was very favorable on those four wells, so I wonder if you could perhaps condition us a bit on \u2013 give us a background on, did you batch drill and batch complete those four wells? Did they just come on in the last week or so, and what is it? Is it the total fluid volume that's being moved that has you feeling it's favorable?","John J. Christmann - President and Chief Executive Officer","Well, Charles, what I'll say is, I'll go ahead and give a little bit of color. We've got four, roughly 7,500 foot Wolfcamp B wells that are in what we call the Lynch Unit. All four wells were completed in late March. We've got all of them on in less than three weeks, so we're not ready to talk about 30-day rates, they're going to be second quarter wells. But they've been encouraging.","In general, we've had an average kind of peak IP of around 1,400 BOEs a day, they're 70% to 80% oil. So, we're very excited about them, and we're flowing them back very conservatively. So, we're very, very encouraged.","Additionally, we've got about three wells there, we'll drill in 2015 and delineate and optimize and test our fracs, and then it sets us up for quite a drilling program there going forward when we decided to scale up. We also plan to test a Spraberry shale well there, probably in the third or fourth quarter of this year.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Got it. Got it. That's great additional detail, John. And then, if I could ask another question. This goes back to the drilled uncompleted count that you expect to have at year-end 2015. I think you said it was 80 to 100. Perhaps you could tell me, if I'm thinking about this the right way, but if you're running 15 rigs, and just to make the math easy, let's say, your average drill time or drill and complete time is \u2013 I guess spud to rig release would be the appropriate thing, is 30-days, that would imply kind of a six-month backlog there. And if you cut it in half and say, okay, well our spud to rig release is 15 days, it gets down to about a three-month backlog. So, both of those seem sort of high to me, and it makes me wonder if you plan to continue to work down that backlog as you go into 2016, and could you tell me, is that the right way to look at that?","John J. Christmann - President and Chief Executive Officer","Well, what I'll say is, what it tells you is we're going to carry. We're not just aggressively moving through our backlog. And that's a function of cash flow and being very disciplined. Clearly, we could go complete a lot of wells today, if we wanted to. We're going to take a very measured approach. We're being very careful with how we allocate our capital and how we handle it this year, but it puts us in a position where we will enter 2016 with a lot of flexibility, just like we entered 2015.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Got it. That's what I was after. Thanks a lot, John.","Operator","The next question will come from Paul Sankey with Wolfe Research.","Paul Benedict Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Hi. Good afternoon, everybody. I was just wondering, you've talked about cost improvement and performance improvement. Around these oil prices, with this level of spending, where would you anticipate your volumes to be growing or not growing in 2016? And is there a price of oil that you can share with us, where you feel that if we saw that price, you would start to reaccelerate the activity? Thanks.","John J. Christmann - President and Chief Executive Officer","Well, good questions, Paul. What I'd say is, number one, it's cash flow for us that matters. I don't worry as much about oil price. What I'll say is, we're taking a very hard look right now and going through a very rigorous planning process, which kind of brackets some scenarios. And we're looking at a range, which we would mirror \u2013 kind of mirror the cost structure to those oil prices and look at that. So, as we get further into the year, into the next quarter, and we get closer to 2016 and things crystallize, we'll start to be more candid on where we are for 2016.","Paul Benedict Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Right. So, I was just wondering if we could get a sense, given the way performance is improving, let's say for example, you held your CapEx at these levels, how would you anticipate your performance in volumes to be next year?","John J. Christmann - President and Chief Executive Officer","What I'll say is, clearly, if we're in a low price environment, capital in 2016's going to go further than it went in 2015, because costs are going to be lower, we're seeing efficiencies. Additionally, with the G&A reductions and things we're targeting, we will be able to put more dollars in. So, through the efficiencies and that sort of thing, it's going to take less in 2016 to deliver than we have in 2015, but beyond that, we're working through a rigorous process, we're going to stay committed to bracketing kind of the environment we're in and then communicating that at a later date.","Paul Benedict Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Understood. I can kind of sense that you're in the process, so it's hard to talk about, but I'll just try one more. Could you just put some numbers around the cost savings that you've achieved, and maybe where you think we may be by the end of the year? And I'll leave it there, thanks.","John J. Christmann - President and Chief Executive Officer","Well, we outlined in February a 15% reductions from our November levels on our well-by-well basis. If you look at it today, I've said today we'd be at least 25%. So, the one thing is we came into the 2015 hot. We spent a lot of our capital, so if you look at our go-forward capital for 2015, we're seeing down 25% on average from the levels that we had in November 20.","Paul Benedict Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. And you think there's more to come?","John J. Christmann - President and Chief Executive Officer","Absolutely.","Paul Benedict Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","All right. Thanks.","Operator","The next question will come from Pearce Hammond with Simmons & Co.","Pearce W. Hammond - Simmons & Co. International","Yeah. Good afternoon, John. Thank you for taking my questions. John, just following up on Paul's question there, just to clarify, so if you were to hold CapEx flat in 2016 versus 2015, in North America, do you think you'd be able to grow production?","John J. Christmann - President and Chief Executive Officer","Pearce, we're early. I don't want to give you overall numbers, because we're working through planning. I'm just \u2013 my point was, if I hold CapEx flat, I'm going to get more out of it in 2016 than I got out of it in 2015.","Pearce W. Hammond - Simmons & Co. International","Okay. Great. And then on Egypt, it seems like the political environment has become more stable. You had some \u2013 the permits that you got on the concessions were faster, it looked like, this most recent round. Is the arrow pointed up in Egypt? And if so, could you end up allocating more capital there?","John J. Christmann - President and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I think clearly the investment area there is improving, and if you go back, even though the Arab Spring, we've never skipped a beat. So, it's in general, the investment has always been good for us. We've got a great relationship with the Egyptian government, and we did set record times and bring in Ptah and Berenice on, but we've been that way in the past. So, lot of advantages. It's, clearly the sentiment is turning, and like the rest of our business we're excited about it, and that's one of the options we'll have on the table as we start to think about if we have incremental cash flow, where would we put it.","Operator","The next question will come from James Sullivan with Alembic Global Advisors.","James Sullivan - Alembic Global Advisors LLC","Hey, good afternoon, folks. I just want to go back for a second to the Condor wells in the Delaware. Just want to see \u2013 the 30-day IP you gave of those was not, is not normalized for lateral and the short lateral length, is that right?","John J. Christmann - President and Chief Executive Officer","That is correct.","James Sullivan - Alembic Global Advisors LLC","Okay. Great. So, that's a good number. Just to follow-up on that, your position out in the Delaware seems to consist more of the smaller lease configurations. What is the appetite? You guys have talked about bolt-ons and leasehold. What's your appetite or can you describe the environment for trying to block up your acreage? Obviously, I'm sure there's always appetite to do it, but with firming up in prices are the bid asks just too tough, and would you migrate over the river into Reeves to try to do that, and where you might get a better pricing?","John J. Christmann - President and Chief Executive Officer","Well, I mean, I think we're obviously very high in the Delaware. We've got lots of room to build off of, and we've got inventory for many years on our existing acreage position. It's one of the areas that clearly that if we felt like we could add something at attractive prices that we'd look at.","James Sullivan - Alembic Global Advisors LLC","Okay. Sounds good. Just to go to the international piece. Obviously, since you guys are thinking about the North Sea and Egypt as a retained part of the portfolio, could you just remind me, this is probably something I should know, but could you just tell me what the challenges are associated with the cycling that free cash flow back to the U.S. under kind of a normal retained asset accounting? I know that those should be free cash flowing generally, if you think about a normalized price environment, so the idea that feeding the U.S. will be a positive thing, but just want to see what the tax implications would be of that?","Stephen J. Riney - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, James. We don't see any significant issues with cycling cash back to the U.S. now, especially with eliminating the election to permanently reinvest earnings overseas, and we'll be able to do that with a significant amount of foreign tax credits as well going forward.","Operator","The next question will come from Jeffrey Campbell with Tuohy Brothers Investment Research.","Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Howdy?","John J. Christmann - President and Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Jim.","Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Hi, John, I wanted to ask you first a broad question, and then a specific one. You mentioned a couple of times on the call today that $65 a barrel was an encouraging number, let's say. I'm just wondering, do we mean that you're looking at it as something that you have an ability to hedge at $65, or do you have a certain amount of time you want to see stability around $65 a barrel, before you begin to start pulling levers?","John J. Christmann - President and Chief Executive Officer","What I would say is right now, we're not hedged. Our best hedge is our activity levels, which we are able to mirror. Clearly, we would look at \u2013 hedging is a tool that we could use before we started to make some longer-term commitments in terms of activity levels as we went into these plays. The point is, for the Canyon Lime and the Eagle Ford, when you get into the $60 to $65 range, that's an area where they become very attractive for us to put capital back to work. But as I said in my prepared notes, they'd have to compete with the other opportunity set.","Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Right. And the other question I wanted to ask was about the Eagle Ford itself. I think you gave a little bit more color, or at least maybe I noticed it this time, a little more color and complexity in the play. Now you've got a lot of 3D seismic covers. And I also remember last quarter, you said sometimes it's not such a bad thing to be forced to slow down a little bit. And I'm wondering if the path forward here for a little while is to use this 3D, to try to figure out the better places to not only \u2013 better ways to complete your wells, but maybe even thinking about better places to drill preparatory to the time when you return rigs there?","John J. Christmann - President and Chief Executive Officer","Well, actually, would you look at the Eagle Ford, we're dealing with four phases across our acreage position. We've got black oil, we've got volatile oil, we've got wet gas, and we've got obviously dry gas, which we're not obviously focused on.","As you look across those three areas, you've got 38 wells to complete, Jeff, 17 in Area A, as we lined out back in November and 21 in Area B. We've been focused on our cost side. I think we have made significant progress on the drilling side. So, it's just optimizing completions and working on improving the economics. So, we'll be working on that and providing updates later in the year.","Operator","The final question will come from Michael Rowe with Tudor, Pickering.","Michael J. Rowe - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Thanks for squeezing me in here. I just had one quick question on the Permian. Can you talk a little bit more about the growth in oil volumes for the rest of the year, while gas stays flat? Is that a function of the weather impact reversing itself here, or is it that you're leading on your completion backlog? How should we think about the growth there in oil, with the reduced capital spending?","John J. Christmann - President and Chief Executive Officer","Well, there's two things. Number one, obviously, from where we are first quarter, we did have weather impacts. So, there's a piece of that. The other thing is, though, we only brought on two Delaware Basin wells. So, we've got pretty good inventory ahead of us.","In fact, if you go back to our Q4, we did not bring on a lot. So, we're sitting with some nice things coming on and as you get into the second quarter and into the summer months, we've got some key pads and some things we'll be bringing on which are going to help drive the liquids in the Permian coming forward.","So, we've just got a lot of our stuff in front of us. We've moved into the Southern Midland Basin Wolfcamp, so we've got a lot of exciting things to bring on, even at the reduced activity levels in the Permian.","And then I can't underscore our base decline. We've got 25%, 26% across North America, and a nice thing about us relative to our peers is having a big Central Basin Platform position where our decline rates and the water floods, we've got 45 water floods, we've got seven CO2 floods, having a lot of that low decline base really helps in terms of our volumes out there.","Michael J. Rowe - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","That's helpful. Appreciate the detail there, and then one quick question on the North Sea. Was curious about the 3D seismic survey that you're doing there at the Beryl field, because you're working on some drilling plans. And subject to more capital availability, you would maybe consider drilling some more wells there. Does that savings of $150 million from selling Australia, does that kind of give you the capital availability to potentially put a few more North Sea wells in the 2015 program, or is that more planning for 2016 drilling?","John J. Christmann - President and Chief Executive Officer","I would say we've got a plan right now. We've got brand-new 3D there which we're excited about. The 150 comes out of Australia reductions. So clearly, anything we decide to add anywhere is going to be a function of future generation off our existing base. But, there is opportunity in the North Sea. We've got some exciting things we will be testing later this year and well into 2016 and beyond. So, it gets back to the depth and the opportunity to generate value over the long haul.","The thing I would add about the North Sea that's differential for us is in both of our big complexes, we have made significant investments in our infrastructure that pushes our abandonment timeframe way out into the 2030 range. And we've spent over $1 billion at Forties, which gives us long, long runway there. And the same thing at Beryls, we've spent $300 million there over the last few years, which gives us lots of runway in time, and we're very excited about the opportunity set.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call.

My name is Nicole, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker\u2019s remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","It is now my pleasure to hand the conference over to Mr. Gary Clark. Please go ahead, sir.","Gary Clark","Good morning and thank you for joining us on Apache Corporation\u2019s third quarter financial and operational results conference call. We will begin the call with an overview by CEO and President, John Christmann. Due to a personnel matter, Tim Sullivan is unable to join us today, so Dave Pursell, Executive Vice President of Planning Reserves and Fundamentals will provide additional operational color. Following that Steve Riney, Executive Vice President and CFO will summarize our third quarter financial performance.","Our prepared remarks will be approximately 20 minutes in length, with the remainder of the hour allotted for Q&A. In conjunction with yesterday\u2019s press release, I hope you\u2019ve had the opportunity to review our third quarter financial and operational supplement, which can be found on our Investor Relations website at investor.apachecorp.com.","On today\u2019s conference call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the differences between these non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the supplemental information provided on our website. Consistent with previous reporting practices, adjusted production numbers cited in today\u2019s call are adjusted to exclude non-controlling interest in Egypt and Egypt\u2019s tax barrels.","Finally, I\u2019d like to remind everyone that today\u2019s discussions will contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions based on our current views and reasonable expectations. However, a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from what we discuss today. A full disclaimer is located with the supplemental information on our website.","And with that, I will turn the call over to John.","John Christmann","Good morning and thank you for joining us. On today\u2019s call, I will discuss Apache\u2019s approach to delivering value in the current environment, provide high level direction on our 2020 capital budget, and conclude with some comments on our third quarter performance and fourth quarter outlook. The market has come to view the lower oil and gas price environment that has been in place since 2014, a structural in nature and unlikely to improve for the foreseeable future.","Compounding this, investors are frustrated with excessive capital investment by U.S. producers and pursued the growth which is common with expense of both return on and return of capital. For these and other reasons, the broad energy sector is out of favor and there is very little investor interest in publicly traded E&P companies. In response as an industry, we must generate more free cash flow and return it to investors on a more consistent basis while continuing to operate responsibly and increasing our focus on emissions reduction.","In this regard, Apache\u2019s primary objectives are simple and straight forward, deliver competitive risk adjusted returns with a long-term moderate pace of growth, improve our free cash flow yield to level consistent with mature industrial sectors, and progress our sustainability initiatives. As we have done for the last several years, Apache will budget using a conservative price tag, influx our capital program in response to price volatility.","We have taken a number of steps to adapt to the lower commodity price environment of the last five years. These include streamlining our portfolio, making substantial improvements to our capital allocation process, and significantly reducing our head cost. Apache has historically employed a decentralized region focus approach to operations. In recent years, we have centralized certain key activities and today see an opportunity to capture greater efficiencies by taking further steps in that direction.","To accomplish this, we have initiated a comprehensive redesign of our organizational structure and operations that will position us to be competitive for the long term. This process which began in late summer should be largely completed by the end of the first quarter. We are targeting at least a $150 million of combined annual savings and look forward to updating you on our progress in the future.","As we look ahead to 2020, our capital planning process is underway and we will disclose a final budget with our fourth quarter results in February. Based on current strip prices, we anticipate a 2020 upstream capital budget that would be 10% to 20% below this year\u2019s program of $2.4 billion. This will enable Apache to generate organic free cash flow that covers the dividend and puts us on pace to fund a multiyear debt reduction program while also delivering modest year-over-year oil production growth.","We anticipate directing the vast majority of our Permian Capital in 2020 to more oil weighted projects in the Midland and Delaware Basins. In Egypt, we have taken significant steps to build and enhance our drilling inventory and assessing the potential for increase investment in the future. And in the North Sea, we intend to maintain a consistent level of activity year-over-year.","Turning to Suriname, we have retained the Nobel Sam Croft drill the second and third wells on Block 58 in 2020, with an options still outstanding on a fourth well. We are planning to drill these wells at a 100%, but that might change should we choose the farm down our interest. As we progress through the 2020 planning process, we continue to monitor commodity fundamentals and evaluate multiple capital allocations scenarios under a number of different price tags across our diverse portfolio. We look forward to providing details on our outlook in February.","Next, I will comment briefly on our third quarter performance and fourth quarter outlook before turning it over to Dave for more details. In the Permian Basin, our oil production in the second half of the year has been moderately impacted by some unplanned downtime events and to ways in our completion schedule and well maintenance timing. Consequently, we are now projecting fourth quarter Permian oil volumes of approximately 100,000 barrels per day.","At Alpine High, we have reduced our drilling activity to two rigs and have chosen to defer some fourth quarter completions into 2020. This lower activity set combined with a decrease production outlook on one of our multi-well pads has results in an approximate 5% reduction in our fourth quarter Alpine High guidance. Internationally, third quarter production was in line with guidance and our outlook for the fourth quarter is unchanged.","Egypt continues to deliver excellent well results and a high drilling success rate. In the North Sea, we have a significant exploratory success coming online at store this month and a second well at Garten coming online around year end. The log on the Garten well shows a much larger than expected hydrocarbon column and should generate positive production momentum as we enter 2020.","In Suriname, we spud the market central number one in late September and expect to TD the well in November and a depth of approximately 6,325 meters as measured from the deck of the drillship. The well is designed to test multiple targets and is located roughly seven miles from the Suriname\/Guyana maritime border.","With the recent exercise of our option to drill a second and third well on Block 58, in conjunction, some optional future well commitments, Apache has the ability to retain the entirety of Block 58 with no relinquishment requirements until June of 2026. This provides sufficient time to execute a comprehensive exploratory program over this large block and initiate development activities as warranted.","In closing, we are taking numerous decisive actions to improve our performance and positioning in this difficult macro environment. Apache has several key differentiators that enhanced our investment proposition. Our diversified portfolio affords the flexibility to allocate capital across to all three hydrocarbon streams and among conventional and unconventional assets as warranted by market conditions.","We have a deep and diverse acreage position across the Permian Basin. Our international assets generate strong and stable free cash flow driven by premium pricing for oil, gas and NGLs. The returns generated by these assets are highly competitive within our portfolio and tend to be less sensitive to downside commodity price volatility. And lastly, Apache has excellent organic exploration opportunities in each of its three key regions as well as a potentially transformational position offshore Suriname.","With that, I will turn the call over to Dave Pursell, who will provide some operational details on the quarter.","Dave Pursell","Thanks, John, and good morning. Our strong operational results for the third quarter reflect the benefits of the diversified portfolio. Adjusted production of 391,000 barrels of oil equivalent is nearly flat with the previous quarter, which included approximately 25,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day from assets in the Mid-Continent region that we divested during the second quarter.","We are advancing a number of exploration programs both internationally and in the U.S., and development activities continue at a steady pace and our legacy U.S., North Sea and Egypt regions. During the third quarter, we drilled and completed 64 gross wells, 48 in the US, 14 in Egypt and two in the North Sea. U.S. third quarter production totalled 266,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.","In the Midland Basin, we continue to drill high productivity oil wells. Our third quarter activity included an 11 well, 1.5 mile pad at Azalea located in the Midland County. This pad produces from the Lower Spraberry shale, Wolf Camp A and B and Lower Cline formation. The Lower Cline well tested in new landing zone with favourable results, achieving an average 30 day IP of 1,270 barrels of oil equivalent per day at 72% oil.","Plans are underway to drill future Lower Cline wells to further delineate the Cline potential across our Midland Basin acreage. In Reagan County, we drilled the five well 2 mile pad. In the Hartgrove area, producing from the Wolfcamp B1 and B4 formations, 30-day IP averaged 1,150 barrels of oil equivalent per day with 79% of oil with D&C cost averaging a very efficient $7.2 million per well.","And in the Delaware Basin, we drill five wells with 1 mile laterals at Dixieland at an average cost per well of less than $5.3 million. As we outlined last quarter, we are still feeling the effects of completing timing on our Permian oil production. We are on pace to put all 88 plan Midland in Northern Delaware Basin wells online, but many of them pushed back throughout the year. We have 25 wells schedule with online dates in November or December, which based on their timing, will add only minimum production to the fourth quarter.","At Alpine High, we brought 15 wells online during the quarter. This included several wells from our 14 well Blackfoot Barnett pad in the Northern Flank. We have now drilled four large multi-well pads in this area and this most recent Barnett pad has thus far underperformed relative to the adjacent Mont Blanc, Barnett pad. All 14 Blackfoot wells were completed sequentially before commencing flow back operations.","As a result, the significant volume of frac water was pumped into the small areas of reservoir, which may have impacted well productivity. We took advantage of a shutting period to soak this pad for approximately 60 days. The wells have been return to production at higher rates, additional modelling is underway to better understand the performance of these wells.","Moving to our international regions, adjusted production came in a little higher than projected at 125,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. In Egypt, following up on the discovery announced last quarter in our new East Bahariya area, we have received the development lease and have drilled the second well the Cobra-2, which is producing approximately 3,000 barrels of oil per day. We are currently drilling a third well with plans for a fourth well later this year.","In the Matruh Basin, the Biruni-1X well tested 5,000 barrels of oil per day from the AEB 6 reservoir plus 6 million cubic feet of gas and 228 barrels of condensate per day from the Safa reservoir. We are currently drilling and offsetting the future expansion potential. And in the Shushan Basin, we had a recent exploration success the Anti-1X which tested 47 million cubic feet and 1,700 barrels of condensate per day from the Shifa formation.","Turning to the North Sea, third quarter production was impacted by annual turnaround maintenance from which we expect the significant production rebound in the fourth quarter. We have had extremely successful drilling campaign this year, having drilled 10 producers with no dry-holes.","Our latest North Sea success at the Garten-2, which encountered approximately 1,200 feet of net pay, in the prolific Beryl reservoir across three fall blocks, this compares favourably to the Garten 1, which came online in November 2018 to the 30-day IP of 13,000 barrels of oil and 17 million cubic feet of gas per day from 700 feet of pay.","The Garten-2 is expected to be online around year end. Apache holds the 100% working interest in the Garten complex, which will have several follow on wells. The first well at our store development is scheduled for initial production next month. This is a high rate gas condensate well which we anticipate will initially produce over 30% oil. The well will be tied back to the existing infrastructure that connects to the Beryl alpha platform. We plan to drill second production later next year. More detail drilling pad and well highlights can be seen in our third quarter financial and operational supplement. Thank you.","And with that, I will now turn the call over to Steve.","Steve Riney","Thank you, Dave. On today\u2019s call, I will review third quarter financial results, provide a few updated to our 2019 guidance, and briefly share some thoughts on 2020.","As noted in the press release issued last night under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, Apache reported a third quarter 2019 consolidated net loss of $170 million or $0.45 per diluted common share. These results include a number of items that are outside of core earnings which were typically excluded by the investment community in their published earnings estimates.","The most significant difference was a $53 million valuation allowance for deferred income tax benefits. Excluding this and other smaller items, adjusted earnings for the third quarter were a loss of $108 million or $0.29 per share. Production volumes were strong, but oil and NGL realizations weaken during the quarter. Gas prices increased a bit with some improvement at Waha hub, but generally remain very low.","All major expense items were in line with or below our guidance for the quarter with the exception of DD&A, which rose to $17.30 per BOE. This was primarily due to reduced proved reserves at Alpine High associated with the recent deterioration in the NGL and natural gas prices. Both the GCX gas pipeline and the Shin Oak NGL pipeline were commissioned during the third quarter. With transport capacity on both of these pipelines, Apache now has access to attractive marketing margins over and above the pipeline test.","In terms of full year 2019 guidance, we are increasing our annual DD&A to $15.25 per BOE for the impacts previously described. There are few other smaller changes to full year 2019 guidance, all of which can be found in our financial and operational supplement. As John indicated, we are deep into the planning process for 2020 and beyond.","As in past years, we will take a conservative approach to pricing assumptions. We will plan for free cash flow over and above our normal dividend. At current strip pricing, this would indicate a 10% to 20% reduction in capital from 2019. Through the pricing cycle, we believe this approach can combine an attractive free cash flow yield with a moderate pace of production growth.","For the next few years, most free cash flow will be used to reduce debt. Our debt maturity profile is now in good shape with just under $1 billion of debt maturating in the 2021 to 2023 timeframe. Our plan is to retire all of this debt as it comes due. As a reminder, for reporting purposes, Apache consolidates Altus' long-term debt. This debt non-recourse to Apache and amounted to $235 million at the end of the third quarter.","So as we look forward to 2020, Apache is in a good situation, while the gas and NGL price environment will cause a slow down at Alpine High. We have a well diversified portfolio to allocate capital towards more oil focused opportunities. We will continue to be long-term returns focus with an appropriate balance of free cash flow and moderate growth.","And with that, I will turn the call over to the operator for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Doug Leggate with Bank of America.","Doug Leggate","John, I wonder if I could hit a couple of things first of all, at a high level, I understand you haven\u2019t given guidance for 2020, but will you see modest growth, what is that mean?","John Christmann","We don\u2019t see any modest any this point, Doug. We\u2019re in the middle of the planning process, kind of pace, we\u2019ve been on what is leave at the modest.","Doug Leggate","Okay. I thought that would be quick answer, but so appreciate you\u2019re trying to at least no answering the question. My second one is on Suriname, much and you\u2019re going to get low on this. But I wanted to ask a very specific issue around Suriname, you\u2019ve said for sometime the Apache had a differentiated view of the block. My question is that, you've never released the result of the Popokai well, but a couple of your engineers did talk about the Popokai changed your view all to be thermal maturity of your block. So wonder if I could ask you to characterize, what are the type of targets you\u2019re looking for and address specifically whether you believe this is our predominantly gas prone area that you\u2019re testing? And any color around the spud specific issue would be really appreciated?","John Christmann","Well, the first thing I\u2019ll say Doug is, the team was very impressed with the work that we did from the data that\u2019s out there. So, we thought you do a fantastic job on your report. We said that we have seven different play types on Block 58. The Maka-1 Central well is going to be targeting two of those play types. They\u2019re in the Cretaceous. And I will just suggest that we obviously feel like the, we would be in an oil window or we wouldn't be placing a well there.","Doug Leggate","I appreciate that. Last one very quickly, as I wonder if you could just address the recent management change and followed by price capabilities in Suriname, and I would note that I believe you saying the PSC before Mr. Kim and joined Apache. So if you could just over some clarification that would be great?","John Christmann","Actually, we picked this block up in 2015. Steve had been on board with us, but he was not working the conventional exploration stuff at that time. So, this is something that actually we did on my watch early in 2015, before any other results were down in Guyana or our wells. So, Steve did not have anything to do with us getting into Suriname or taking this block.","Secondly, I want to thanks Steve for his time here. He made great contributions to the organization and is truly a world-class explore. As we disclosed on the call today, I have been thinking about a long-term vision for the Company and working on some significant organizational changes. Steve's remaining tenure was shorter than the time I was planning for. So that require he and I to have a conversation around succession. I propose an appropriate transition in very simply he just elected to resign, but it had nothing to do with Suriname.","Operator","The question is from the line of John Freeman with Raymond James.","John Freeman","Hi, John. The first one on, just sort of the initial commentary that you've provided on 2020, so just, it sounds like from I guess the high level when we think capital allocation, you basically said just assume kind of North Sea would be kind of flat year-over-year. Egypt based on the success you\u2019ve had and I assume additional information you\u2019re giving from the seismic shoot that you should see an increase investment there. And then it just sounded like in terms of kind of Permian\/Alpine High just more of a shifting of capital there some of the more oiler areas at Midland, Delaware. So, when I think about just as overall region, when I think historically all kind of 70:30 kind of U.S. international. Just I guess how much that could kind of change, as it sounds like just really international the only kind of directionally going up?","John Christmann","Yes. I would say, John, first and foremost, we spent more money at Alpine High and that capital is going to come down, so that in itself will change those the parentages of pie. The exploration spend in Suriname could be a little larger as well, so that also would tilt the international. But -- and then, we stated that the Permian capital is going to come down, but in general the oil drillings is going to go up, so...","John Freeman","And then just the follow-up until we\u2019re given any additional information, can we just contain to assume for these additional, these other two Suriname wells around that $60 million to $65 million per well somewhere to the first?","John Christmann","Yes. I mean the spread shouldn\u2019t be changed in much. I mean we\u2019ve got Nobel Sam Croft. Rates were negotiated and there is actually another extension we could take and have just preserved that option for the future. So, it's going be pretty similar. A lot of that will just depend on what we do and how long we\u2019re on the wells and how much testing and all those things will drive that cost.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs.","Brian Singer","I wanted to see, just a follow-up on John\u2019s question there. More a bigger picture, if you could paint a picture of how Suriname success or lack of excess is going to impact your capital allocation strategy? So, in success case, would you finance development fully and entirely via selling down a stake? Would there be openness to outspending cash flow? Would you need to issue equity? Would you think about just reducing activity elsewhere in the portfolio? And in a lack of success case, what would be your interest for need for inorganic portfolio replenishment?","John Christmann","Well, Brian, we feel good about the portfolio with or without Suriname. So I think we got a very diverse portfolio, we\u2019ve got great optionality, we\u2019ve got lots of onshore unconventional inventory that is all weighted as well as some optionality on the rich gas side. We got good inventory both on our international areas and then obviously Suriname offers a new playground for us. So, we feel good about the inventory and feel good about the direction of the Company, I think that\u2019s one thing.","If you look back over the last four years from where we sit today, from where we were, we have a lot of more inventory than we have on all fronts. So, as far as financing or success case at Suriname, we still have a 100% equity in that block, and we made a very clear that our intent would be to likely bring in a partner, and we feel like it that would play a role and how that would be funded. So, I am not in a position to give you a lot more color than that, but I don\u2019t see us having to stop some of the other things that would be doing or significantly stressing our balance sheet. Steve, do you want to add anything.","Steve Riney","No, I think that\u2019s good John.","Brian Singer","And then, the follow-up is with regard to the onshore inventory you mentioned, some improved performance or economics on the Cline. Can you just talk to what you\u2019re seeing in terms of supply cost coming down either by cost reduction or improve performance in the Permian? And then any update on exploratory efforts in the onshore?","John Christmann","At this point, we do not have anything that we prepared to update on the onshore exploratory side. I will say in general, cost are, it's kind of mix bag, some things are coming down and some of the services there has been some slowdowns. Some of it remains tight, so we\u2019re managing that, so it's really a function of the individual services. I think what you\u2019re seeing now is having been in kind of a development mode with those pads. A lot of the synergies and things were drive out or in the cost to really more function just the efficiencies that come with the larger scale, pad development where you have all the infrastructure in place. I\u2019ll put it over to Dave to comment on the Cline.","Dave Pursell","Yes. So, thanks John. The Cline well just a little more color than in the prepared remarks. It's one well that it\u2019s been online for 120 days. We\u2019re happy with its performance. We look at our portfolio when we think we have opportunities under a couple of field at least. And so, you\u2019ll be hearing more about that as we kind of get to the end of 2020.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Bob Brackett with Bernstein Research.","Bob Brackett","Good morning. I\u2019m looking at that TVD of the Market Central at 6,325 meters, that's considerably, say, several thousand feet deeper than Haimara, which is maybe your closest offset well from the industry. Does that suggest you\u2019re trying to tap the top of the Jurassic? Or is that landing somewhere in the Cretaceous?","John Christmann","I would just say at this point that would you know most of our targets, the two plays will be testing here are in the Cretaceous.","Bob Brackett","Bob here, but I appreciate the compliment. A quick question then, what about the Miocene? You didn\u2019t mention that as one of the play types?","John Christmann","At this point where you've gone through a full evaluation of all of the play types, so, Bob that\u2019s where we are I mean this is two in the Cretaceous in a very nice sticks section.","Bob Brackett","Yes, concurred. In terms of the modest oil production growth that you highlighted, should I stay specifically into focus on oil production growth and the gas will be sort flat or down or just gas track with that oil?","John Christmann","We would be emphasizing the modest oil plays.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Charles Meade with Johnson Rice.","Charles Meade","I wanted to understand that there is a lot of focus on this first well, but I wonder if I could get you to talk a little bit more about these next two wells that are going to come after. My guess would be that since you've already got the -- the rig going to drill these back-to-back that you already have those two locations mapped out and that they're going to be independent of your result on this first well. But can you talk about whether that's right? Or how you -- how those next 2 wells are going to go?","John Christmann","Charles, we actually permitted nine different wells. So, there is multiple, multiple target. I\u2019ll just say since it is the first well in this area that we\u2019ll be gathering data and there are some decision through things we\u2019ll do based on the data we collect. So, we\u2019ve got a pretty good idea where we want to go, but information and confirmation is certain things will drive the exact thoughts and process.","Charles Meade","And then if I could go back to the Blackfoot pad in the Alpine High. Dave, I appreciate the comments you made about that in the prepared remarks, but I was curious you mentioned -- I believe, I heard you mentioned that you left the frac water soak on those -- on that pad for, I think, 60 days. Can you talk about -- is that -- has that been a standard procedure at Alpine High? Is that something new or different view you chose to do? Or maybe just -- maybe it was just the timing? Can you talk about whether that's the standard plan whether it's a one-off? And what you're going to learn going forward from this?","Dave Pursell","Yes, Charles, good question. We\u2019ve had some opportunities in the past to soak wells, really do the facility constrain so what we found in some cases and well performance improve of soak. When we frac the 14 well Blackfoot pad remember that was, the wells were all completed sequentially. So, we put a lot of produced water into a relatively compact part of the reservoir. And we thought, well, let's taken the advantage of well commodity prices, initiate a 60-day soak.","Really trying to understand is that relative permeability issue? Or what are the mechanisms for the underperformance? We\u2019ve had the pad back online for about 30 days. The gas rate came back above. The pretty soak rate and it's actually holding in pretty flat, which say or was some impact in the condensate rate came up, higher than the pre-soak rate. So, what we\u2019re doing Charles, we\u2019re evaluating that, we have a team of folks doing some detail work on the Blackfoot and all of the multi-well pads that we've drilled and completed today.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Gail Nicholson with Stephens.","Gail Nicholson","I am looking at Egypt, you guys had a really nice results there this quarter. When you guys look at cash 2020 and CapEx, do you guys have any idea -- an updated idea what maintenance CapEx is Egypt would be to keep adjusted 72,000 flat?","John Christmann","Gail, we\u2019ve got results from the new 3D that we're starting to see from our prospect inventory should improve is what we\u2019re excited about. So, we don\u2019t really look at rig count to keep things flat because we\u2019re just working on what\u2019s project are going to be best in terms of the allocation. But as we\u2019ve said, with the new inventory and the things we\u2019re seeing, I think there is a potential to actually return Egypt on the oil side to grow and so, we\u2019re tired about that.","Gail Nicholson","And then just looking the recent exploration at the [indiscernible] G12 and the [indiscernible] condensate discovery. How does that I guess maybe change future potential gas development in Egypt?","John Christmann","Well, we\u2019ve got a lot of infrastructure from Qasr. And so, there is the nice thing about some things is they can be tied in. Most of our drilling will be focused on oil, but we do have a lot of gas infrastructure and capacity. So, it\u2019s not a big deal, and if we find it and it still very economic for us is as we get about 265 NIM for that.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Mike Scialla with Stifel.","Mike Scialla","Just wanted to see if there anything you could say about what you've seen so far in the Maka Central wells at this point?","John Christmann","I\u2019d say we\u2019re drilling ahead that we are now in the shallower targets. And Mike, the only thing I\u2019ll say at this time point is, is that, we have not seen anything that would be unexpected.","Mike Scialla","And just wanted if you could give any more color on the organizational initiatives that you put in place?","John Christmann","Yes. I think we see an opportunity to reduce kind of take a $150 million out of the system. I think it's going to unable to deliver more proactive planning and improve capital allocation, which is something we strived to continually do. I think it's going to enable us to advance our resource progression from access to exploration to the development and operations is going to allow us to right size both the corporate and regional offices to more efficiently support the new organization. We\u2019re going to minimize duplication, eliminate some redundancies and it also is going to help us really enable the collaboration on the value adding technology adoption.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Neal Dingmann with SunTrust.","Neal Dingmann","John, my question is based on the early strong Lower Cline test that you've seen in that Driver Schrock pad. Do you have plans to increase activity targeting this zone? Or I guess maybe I\u2019ll ask a different way, could you all just maybe discuss your upcoming multi-zone development pad around the Midland Basin?","John Christmann","Yes. I think we\u2019ve got our inventory so lined out, but it doesn\u2019t impact the next couple of pads. But what it does is, we\u2019re constantly dipping down and testing things that we can add in the future. And so, we can\u2019t jump around next pad and move here. I mean we\u2019ve really got this machine lined out and we\u2019re in an execution mode. But we factor that in, we\u2019re testing things that we think and add material inventory and then we will start planning that into our future pads is the way I think about that and is kind of where we approach things.","Neal Dingmann","And then just one follow-up, could you all discuss any upcoming lease requirements that you might have at Alpine High as you slowdown activity in the play?","John Christmann","Yes, I mean that\u2019s one of the big things where you've kind of challenged the team to do that is work through a plan that helped to determine what acreage we want to maintain for optionality purposes. So, that\u2019s the process we\u2019re working through, and we will be very deliberate and work through what it is, we think we have to maintain for optionality in the future.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Leo Mariani with KeyBanc.","Leo Mariani","Just wanted to follow up a little bit there on Alpine High, obviously, you guys are kind of cutting back activity, but still looks like you have a pretty nice growth ramp here into fourth quarter. Just kind of wanted to get a sense with sort of 2 rigs out there in '20, how should we think about Alpine High production? Obviously, you've got significant production there. I mean is that's something that can kind of be maintained kind of at sort of year-end '19 levels? Or would you start to see some declines there with a couple of rigs?","John Christmann","Well, we\u2019ll come back in February with the, when we have better view exactly what the plans is going to look like. But I do know we deferred some completions in early 2020 and we got some docs. So, it\u2019s not going to drop massively, but we\u2019ll come back with the shape for the curve next year that\u2019s comments through with the activity level that we\u2019ll go forward with.","Leo Mariani","And I guess, obviously, there's significant infrastructure there and clearly we'll get, I guess, another gas pipeline and Permian Highway coming sometime in early '21. I mean, I guess, what type of kind of future gas and NGL prices do you guys kind of want to see to where you may harvest kind of more of that resource? Any color on that would be helpful.","John Christmann","Yes. Thank you, just step back late 2018, we went in the more what I called the development stage and as Dave mentioned in prepared remarks we initiated pad drilling on four multi-well pads. Concurrently this spring we had a natural gas and NGL price is really materially lower and that happen as we started to bring on some of the infrastructure. So we\u2019ve got the pads to evaluate and we\u2019ll just come back with that view as well.","Leo Mariani","And I guess, just lastly on Egypt. Certainly, I noticed that your gross liquids volumes primarily on the oil side in the third quarter were kind of down versus 2Q kind of roughly 9% on my math here. Just wanted to get a sense if there was anything anomalous going on in 3Q on the gross oil volumes in Egypt that may have driven that reduction?","Dave Pursell","Yes, this is Dave Pursell, really what drove that were declines in Qasr and Berenice.","Leo Mariani","Okay.","Dave Pursell","Remember those -- just for some color, those fields have been producing for a wild now and it held much better than anticipated. So, we\u2019re expecting declines at some point and we saw here in the third quarter.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Richard Tullis with Capital One Securities.","Richard Tullis","Just a couple of more on the Alpine High, John, could you talk a little bit about reserve write-downs that you took in the quarter related to the lower commodity pricing?","Dave Pursell","Yes. This is Dave Pursell. So, we\u2019ll -- there\u2019ll be more color at the end of the year in the K and there maybe some commentary in the Q, but what you see any price revision was primarily on gas and NGLs in the Permian Basin. There were very modest or performance vision, so the price revision were due to low basin gas and NGL prices and primarily focusing on Permian Basin.","Richard Tullis","And Dave, do you expect any additional year end write-downs in addition to what you referenced in the 3Q?","Dave Pursell","Yes. I think, if you -- yes, it\u2019s a good question. If you look at the trailing four quarter pricing, we\u2019re still benefiting somewhat a high fourth quarter 2018 price. So, as we roll forward and if you look at the future prices for the fourth quarter of 2019, we lose the benefit of the one high quarter that\u2019s in the averaging right now. So, if the forward prices hold we would envision there would be some additional price revision in the fourth quarter. Say again still so hard to quantify those to get the actual in, but that\u2019s kind of where we see it now.","Richard Tullis","That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. And just my last question also related to Alpine High. Do you have any sort of minimum volume commitments with Altus that you have to maintain?","Dave Pursell","No, acreage dedication.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Scott Gruber with Citigroup.","Scott Gruber","So circling back on the CapEx split between U.S. and international, just back of the envelope here, it appears that the 4Q shift will see the U.S. international split move towards 65:35 based upon the updated annual guide for 2019. Is that broadly how we should think about the split in 2020, overall, would yield the modest spending growth abroad, is that how we should think about it?","John Christmann","I mean what I would say, I hate that, you just look at the one quarter, right, because things move around. But I would say in general, our CapEx is going to come down as we set. You\u2019re going to see last rich gas drilling at Alpine High and you\u2019re liable to see pretty flat pace in the North Sea compared to where we are, and we actually have some exploration wells. So that number might come down a little bit. Egypt should be flat to slightly and our oil projects in the U.S. are going to be a little higher as well. So, we\u2019ll give you more color in February when we come out with our final 2020 plans.","Scott Gruber","And then just on the UK given the production momentum heading into next year, what are you guys looking at in terms of production over the full course of 2020? Can you generate some growth from the UK next year?","John Christmann","Once, again, we\u2019ll hold off on the 20s specifics until we come out with the plan, but we\u2019re very excited about the program. They\u2019ve done a tremendous job this year at Garten 2, absolutely exceeded our expectations. We\u2019ve got an entire fault block there that looks just fantastic that we had upside at the Storr well. So, we\u2019ve got some big things coming on and it sets up as Dave said in his prepared remarks, set ups some additional drilling at Garten in the future. So, the shape of the curve going into 2020 is going to have a lot of momentum for the North Sea.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Ryan Todd with Simmons Energy","Ryan Todd","Maybe a follow-up question on Alpine High and Altus in particular, I mean, given the reduction activity at Alpine High, I know you have MVC. But how do you think about the go forward options at Altus longer-term in terms of future capital to spend on the G&P side, potential options to address the value and\/or structure of the entity?","John Christmann","Ryan, I\u2019ll ask you it's not too bigger than inconvenient so just hop on the Altus call this afternoon at 1 o'clock, and we'll let Clay and team there handle all of those questions directly.","Ryan Todd","Maybe one follow-up on Egypt, I mean, you've mentioned the possibility to generate long-term growth as opposed to just holding volumes flat in the region. I mean, what would you need to see the move in that direction? Would you need to see continue the exploration success? Have seen enough already? And is there anything else that would dictate kind of how aggressive you would or could be there?","John Christmann","No, I mean, that's we got very large position, right; and we\u2019ve got a very large base, I think the technology that we\u2019re applying the new acreage we picked up with the new 3D puts us in a position for pretty interesting looking inventory. And I think it's going to be more driven off the inventory and the opportunity set than anything.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Jeanine Wai with Barclays.","Jeanine Wai","Just wanted to follow up on some of the Egypt questions, I make sure I got some of your remarks correct. So, in your prepared you've indicated that you\u2019re building and enhancing drilling inventory there. And so, can you provide us with an update on what the current capital efficiency looks like because that might have changed over the past couple of years as you're spending below maintenance? And then, how productive the first call and incremental capital sounds like, because it seems like there could be some exploration? I know you said there is already some gas facility there, but not sure what\u2019s there on the oil side in order for you to increase production?","John Christmann","Yes, Jeanine, I thank if you look at Egypt, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve been under investing. So, that\u2019s the first thing I\u2019d say, I think we\u2019ve been investing in appropriate pace. We had a very large discovery in Qasr, many, many years ago, which is pretty unique. And so, if you take that out and look at the portfolio, we\u2019ve been on a really good pace.","You look at the Ptah and Berenice discoveries, we had in late 2014 early 2015; things have been going quite strong. So, we\u2019ve got a big footprint. We\u2019ve been there a long time. We spread out over a very, very large area. And my point on the other tie ends is, we just have a lot of capacity there for more gas yields. And so, I think things are going quite well and we do see the potential to improve our productivity with the new inventory.","Jeanine Wai","My second question is on the Alpine High, in terms of giving away some Alpine High CapEx to other early play. At what commodity prices do you think that Alpine High can beat your capital? And I guess what we\u2019re thinking is just that, you\u2019re takeaway contracts specifically for Alpine High for NGLs and crude, those are acreage dedications so you have a ton of flexibility there. The gas takeaway I believe has that MVCs, but I\u2019m pretty sure that you wouldn\u2019t have an issue arbing those out. So, just trying to really figure out kind of what the push and pull is on CapEx allocation to that play?","John Christmann","I mean it's purely going to be forward look at the incremental economics.","Operator","Our final question will come from the line of Michael Hall with Heikkinen Energy Advisors.","Michael Hall","Thanks. A lot of been address, I guess maybe going back to Suriname. Now, you\u2019ve got the Mako Well location out there. Is there any additional color you can provide as to why this was the first of the test of the nine wells you\u2019ve permitted and any additional color on the thought process there?","John Christmann","Well, I mean it\u2019s first of all in the block, right. So -- and it\u2019s a well that we like, some of the prospect there its ability to test two of them and that\u2019s why we chose it.","Michael Hall","And were there any risks in the other wells that you were mitigating with the selection of this well?","John Christmann","With the exploration and your first well in, it\u2019s a process right. So, there is -- since it has the word exploration by, there's always risks that you're assessing and you learn from. And so, but this was the order of the first well we thought we should drill, and from there, we got numerous options to go. So, but there is -- as we said all along, there are seven different play types. There are many, many significant very good looking prospects, so we just had to get started somewhere.","Michael Hall","And then I guess just to come back on the Alpine High economics side of thing, I think in the past you\u2019ve talked about mid-$0.20 or 7 handle on propane as kind of the level to think about where Alpine High will compete for capital. Are those still fair levels to watch?","John Christmann","Michael, we\u2019ll come back on that. I mean once again, we've got four pads that we\u2019re evaluating, and it really is going to boil down to now that we have the infrastructure in place. It's more about the incremental economics relative to our other portfolio opportunities.","Operator","And with no further audio questions, I\u2019ll hand the floor back to John Christmann for closing remarks.","John Christmann","So, thank you. In closing, Apache is taking significant steps to lower our cost structure and to further optimize our capital allocation. Our goal is to improve free cash flow yield inclusive of the dividend, increase returns, and continue our pace of modest oil growth. We have some very attractive exploration opportunities throughout the portfolio that make Apache a differential investment opportunity. Thank you and happy Halloween.","Operator","This does conclude today\u2019s conference call. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your line."],"2155":["Apache Corp.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you.","And I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Gary Clark, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","Gary T. Clark - Apache Corp.","Good morning and thank you for joining us on Apache Corporation's First Quarter 2018 Financial and Operational Results Conference Call. Speakers making prepared remarks on today's call will be Apache's CEO and President, John Christmann; Executive Vice President of Operations Support, Tim Sullivan; and Executive Vice President and CFO, Steve Riney. Also available for the Q&A session are Mark Meyer, Senior Vice President, Energy Technology Strategies; and Dave Pursell, Senior Vice President, Planning and Energy Fundamentals.","Our prepared remarks will be approximately 25 minutes in length with the remainder of the hour allotted for Q&A. In conjunction with yesterday's press release, I hope you have had the opportunity to review our first quarter financial and operational supplement, which can be found on our Investor Relations website at investor.apachecorp.com. Please note the supplement was updated this morning to include information on our Permian Basin oil and gas marketing positions, which can be found on pages 22 and 23.","On today's conference call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the differences between these non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the supplemental information provided on our website. Consistent with previous reporting practices, adjusted production numbers cited in today's call are adjusted to exclude noncontrolling interest in Egypt and Egypt's tax barrels.","Finally, I'd like to remind everyone that today's discussions will contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions based on our current views and reasonable expectations. However, a number of factors could cause the actual results to differ materially from what we discuss today. A full disclaimer is located with the supplemental data on our website.","And with that, I will turn the call over to John.","John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.","Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Before I get to the results, I want to take a moment to recognize a long-time Apache who has recently announced his plans to retire later this year, Kregg Olson, our Executive Vice President of Corporate Reservoir Engineering.","During his 26 years with Apache, Kregg's leadership and expertise have been significant contributors to our long term success. On behalf of all of Apache, I want to thank Kregg for his years of service and wish him well in retirement.","In light of this change, we have announced Dave Pursell, Senior Vice President, Planning and Energy Fundamentals, will lead our Corporate Reservoir Engineering function upon Kregg's retirement. This transition is already underway, and we look forward to introducing you all to Dave in the months ahead.","On today's call, I will review Apache's first quarter progress and provide highlights from some of our key operating areas. Tim Sullivan and Steve Riney will then provide a brief review of our operational and financial performance during the quarter. And before moving to Q&A, I will conclude with our perspective on a few themes we have been hearing recently from the investment community.","Apache is off to a strong start this year. In the U.S., we exceeded our first quarter production guidance through solid operational execution, shorter completion cycle times, improving efficiencies, and continued outperformance from new wells placed online over the last two quarters. The positive impact of these items more than offset volume losses we incurred from unplanned facilities downtime and adverse weather.","As noted in yesterday's press release, we delivered record production in the Permian Basin. And the excellent progress we made during the first quarter has prompted us to raise our U.S. production guidance for both the second quarter and full-year 2018.","Internationally, our leverage to Brent oil pricing contributed to improving margins, higher cash returns, and strong free cash flow. Production was in line with guidance, which remains unchanged for the full year.","Moving now to specific region performance, beginning with the Permian Basin. Our results continue to improve, as we strive for best in class execution, leveraging the best technology advancements and insightful data analytics.","In the Midland Basin, our current drilling program is focused on section and half-section testing and development in the Wolfcamp and Spraberry formations. We are delineating additional landing zones within our core fields and assessing other parts of our acreage, where we are seeing positive early results.","In the Delaware Basin, outside of Alpine High, we are generating solid growth from our Wolfcamp and Bone Spring drilling program. We are drilling multi-well development pads, testing incremental landing zones, and evaluating additional prospect areas.","Our plan is to sustain a three rig drilling program outside of Alpine High in the Delaware Basin. We have made excellent progress reducing well costs, increasing productivity, and driving higher returns in the Midland and Delaware Basins. We are deliberately operating at a measured pace, which is enabling timely integration of key learnings into our capital program.","On many occasions, we have stated that production growth will be the outcome of our disciplined returns focused investment program. We are certainly seeing that in the Midland and Delaware Basins, where daily oil production has increased 37% since the second quarter last year and in the Permian Basin as a whole, where daily oil production has increased 19% over the same time period.","Turning now to Alpine High, where progress toward a value optimized full field development plan is continuing as planned. As I indicated on last quarter's call, you can monitor Alpine High progress on three key fronts, well cost reductions, well productivity, and inventory expansion.","First, we are making substantial improvements on well costs. Our objective is to decrease average well costs by 25% from 2017. During the first quarter alone, we delivered an average 20% reduction. Having already achieved 80% of the target, we have clear visibility into further well cost reductions through the remainder of the year.","Second, we are focused on enhancing well productivity at the section level, which is the true economic unit we are seeking to optimize. We are now gathering data from two important half-section multi-well pad tests, which Tim will provide details on in his remarks.","And third, in terms of drilling inventory, recall that we increased our risked location count to more than 5,000 locations at our October webcast update. At the time, we characterized this as a conservative view based on only six landing zones and relatively wide spacing assumptions. We have now confirmed hydrocarbon production from 11 distinct landing zones. And we are continuing to delineate these and other landing zones across Alpine High. We are also testing tighter well spacing and have seen some encouraging initial results.","While we are not updating our location count today, we are confident that as field delineation and development progresses, the risked location count will increase substantially over the next several years.","Alpine High is also making great progress on lease operating expenses. LOE was approximately $4.50 per BOE in the first quarter, and we are targeting a decrease to less than $3 per BOE by year end. As previously indicated, we are on target to drive LOE per BOE below $2 by the end of 2020.","One of the primary factors behind our low cost structure is that the transgressive source interval in the Woodford, Barnett and Penn [Pennsylvanian] produces very little water, resulting in minimal handling and disposal costs.","On the midstream side, our buildout at Alpine High continues, with additional infrastructure coming online as expected. Our strategic objectives this year include finalizing a JV, or partial monetization of the midstream enterprise, and reaching agreements for future oil, gas, and NGL take away capacity.","Moving on to Egypt, we are continuing with a high destiny seismic acquisition and processing program across our expansive acreage position, which will greatly enhance our subsurface imaging capabilities. We believe this will uncover numerous meaningful opportunities to grow future oil production on both new and legacy acreage.","In the second half of this year, we plan to commence drilling on our new concessions, which comprise 1.6 million acres. We are very excited about these concessions, which are geologically similar to our producing acreage in the Western Desert and are virtually unexplored.","In the North Sea, we recently announced an impactful discovery at Garten in the Beryl area. We believe this discovery will yield a minimum of 10 million barrels of oil with potential to move significantly higher. Apache owns 100% of Garten, which will be a relatively quick and inexpensive tieback to existing facilities. This should have a positive impact on our 2019 and 2020 international production guidance, which we will revisit later in the year.","In summary, we are off to a great start in 2018. Execution is very strong, and we are investing capital efficiently and strengthening Apache's overall capabilities to deliver more sustainable, higher returns over the long term.","Now, I will turn the call over to Tim Sullivan, who will provide some operational details on the quarter.","Timothy J. Sullivan - Apache Corp.","Good morning. My remarks will briefly cover first quarter 2018 production performance and capital efficiency, including drilling highlights and activity in our core regions.","Operationally, we had a very good quarter and saw improvement in many key areas. We achieved first quarter company-wide adjusted production of approximately 367,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, a 6% increase from the same period a year ago and up slightly from the fourth quarter 2017.","The Permian Basin remains the primary driver of our growth, where oil production increased 14% and total production increased 24% from the first quarter a year ago. This reflects the ongoing development of oil production in the Midland and Delaware Basins and the start-up of Alpine High. We averaged 16 rigs and four frac crews in the Permian Basin during the quarter, with seven rigs and one frac crew dedicated to Alpine High.","In the Midland Basin, we have implemented a new completion design with more optimal stage and cluster spacing, which is contributing to improved early time well performance. We are fracture stimulating more lateral feet per day, completing wells faster and more efficiently, and realizing significant cost savings.","For the quarter, we brought online 12 wells in the Wolfcamp formation with an average peak 30-day IP exceeding 1,100 BOE per day, consisting of 75% oil. Notably, we tested our first Wolfcamp C producer, which achieved a very encouraging 30-day IP of nearly 1,150 BOE per day, 70% oil. These positive results could open up hundreds of additional Wolfcamp C locations across our acreage position.","Moving to the Delaware Basin, production at Alpine High averaged 26,300 BOE per day. Of note, we brought online our first multi-well pad in the wet gas window, the four-well Chinook pad, which delivered peak 30-day IPs averaging 5.2 million cubic feet of gas and 170 barrels of oil per day. The Chinook gas has an average BTU content of 1,350 and is currently recovering 50 barrels of NGLs per 1 million cubic feet of gas. This yield is expected to increase to 150 [barrels] with the addition of cryo.","We are pleased with these early results, which will yield attractive economics, as well cost averaged only $6.4 million. A year ago, drilled on a one-off basis, these wells would have cost more than $8 million per well.","We have made significant progress on our cost reduction goal at Alpine High, targeting an average completed well cost of $6.2 million for 2018. As we move to pad operations, we are realizing the benefit of increasing efficiencies and reducing well costs.","On the drilling side, these include the use of less expensive spudder rigs to drill surface and intermediate holes; standardized casing programs, and, in many wells, the elimination of a casing string; and optimized bits and bottom-hole assemblies for specific areas. Completion savings include the ability to pump more frac stages per day, optimize sand loading to pattern size, and the use of recycled and brackish water.","At the end of 2017, we placed on production the Dogwood pad, our first multi-well development pad in Alpine High's dry gas window. This pad has been producing for 119 days with cumulative production of 6.4 BCF. The stabilized production rate from the six-well pad is currently 62 million cubic feet per day, compared to the initial peak 30-day IP of more than 70 million cubic feet per day.","Importantly, we have seen no interference between these wells at 660 [foot] spacing, which is a very encouraging indicator for tighter well spacing during full-field development. Keep in mind that our current 5,000 well location count assumes 925-foot spacing in the dry gas window and 800-foot spacing in the wet gas window. Other downspacing tests are in progress.","Elsewhere in the U.S., production for the Mid-Continent region increased from the preceding quarter as a result of the recent completion of approximately eight net wells over the last two quarters in the SCOOP. These are showing strong performance. And this production uplift will allow us to hold Mid-Continent production flat or grow slightly year over year.","Internationally, Apache remains the largest oil producer and most active driller in Egypt. For the quarter, Egypt adjusted production averaged approximately 80,000 BOE per day, down slightly from the fourth quarter 2017. We drilled and completed 28 operated wells with an 86% success rate. Of particular note, the Apries East-1X, a discovery in the Shushan Basin, found 280 feet of pay in the Shifa formation.","The gas condensate reservoir flow tested 20 million cubic feet of gas per day and 2,400 barrels of condensate. This success sets up several development and follow-on exploration wells in the area.","Our seismic acquisition is ahead of schedule. To date, we have acquired 710,000 acres of a planned 2.6 million acre seismic shoot, spanning four different basins in the Western Desert. Early results indicate the data will deliver a paradigm shift in imaging capability and reservoir characterization.","Moving to the North Sea, production averaged 54,000 BOE per day during the quarter and was impacted by a number of items, including downtime associated with inclement weather, unscheduled maintenance and repair on compressors in the Beryl area, and periodic interruptions on the Forties Pipeline System.","No new wells were placed on production during the quarter, which contributed to a sequential decline from the fourth quarter. As we have stated before, production in the North Sea tends to be lumpy on a quarter-to-quarter basis, but we are seeing some of the above conditions abate thus far in the second quarter.","As John noted, an important highlight for the quarter was our discovery at Garten, which is located only 6 kilometers from the Beryl Alpha facilities. The discovery well encountered more than 700-foot of net pay from multiple zones. Drilling, completion, and tieback costs are estimated at approximately $60 million. And with minimum reserve estimate of 10 million barrels of oil, we expect very low F&D costs.","To sum up, operationally, we are off to a very good start to the year and are focused on building this momentum in the quarters ahead.","I will now turn the call over to Steve.","Stephen J. Riney - Apache Corp.","Thank you, Tim. Let me start with first quarter results. As noted in our press release issued last night, under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, Apache reported first quarter 2018 net income of $145 million, or $0.38 per diluted common share. Adjusted earnings for the quarter were $124 million, or $0.32 per share, the most significant adjustment being a $39 million after-tax unrealized gain on our derivative positions.","As John outlined, our U.S. production exceeded guidance by 4%, while international production was in line with guidance.","Capital investment of approximately $850 million was above guidance, due to accelerated activity in the Permian Basin, primarily driven by more efficient completion times. There was also additional spending on our Garten discovery in the North Sea, due to a higher working interest than previously planned.","Despite inflationary pressures, costs remained under control during the quarter. Nearly all categories of costs ended the quarter consistent with or better than latest guidance.","Two specific areas of costs included accounting impacts for one-off type changes. First, G&A for the quarter includes approximately $10 million of non-cash charges related to a change in retirement policy. Second quarter G&A will include a similar amount of non-cash charges.","Second, gathering, transmission, and processing costs for the quarter, reflect the reclassification of certain charges under the new revenue recognition rules adopted for 2018. This change has no net effect on results. In the past, these costs were netted against revenue. Now, they are recognized as an expense, and thus our reported revenues have increased by the same amount.","Our effective tax rate for the quarter was approximately 47% on a GAAP basis. This is higher than most would expect due to the accounting treatment of U.S. taxes. We operate at a profit in Egypt and the UK and accrue taxes at the average effective tax rates of 45% and 40%, respectively.","In the U.S., we operated at a small loss, which would normally bring the average effective tax rate down. However, uncertainty in realizing these benefits precludes us from recognizing them on an ongoing basis today. The result is that the GAAP effective tax rate is a bit high, but there is no impact on cash flow.","Moving now to guidance. Following strong first quarter results, we are increasing full-year U.S. production guidance to a range of 250,000 to 258,000 BOEs per day, up from 245,000 to 255,000. Most of this increase is attributable to the Permian Basin. Our 2018 international guidance remains unchanged at this time.","On the full year guidance for other items, we are making only one change, increasing cash taxes to a range of $175 million to $225 million. This reflects the anticipated income uplift from improving realizations for North Sea crude oil production.","For the second quarter, we anticipate U.S. production will be approximately 248,000 BOE per day. And adjusted international production is expected to average 135,000 BOEs per day. This would result in 7% quarter-on-quarter U.S. production growth and 4% overall growth worldwide.","We have provided second quarter guidance for a number of other items, but I will not cover those in detail. You can find them in our financial and operational supplement.","Turning now to Alpine High midstream, we are currently operating 121 miles of gathering line, 33 miles of 30-inch trunk line, 34 central tank batteries, and 780 million cubic feet per day of inlet gas processing capacity. An additional 50 million cubic feet per day processing capacity expansion was planned for later this year. We are now looking at options to eliminate this expansion by bringing forward the mid-2019 planned start-up of the first cryo facility.","We are actively working design and procurement for three 200 million cubic feet per day cryo plants. Once fully operational, these facilities will significantly increase our NGL volumes out of Alpine High, boosting overall liquids production from the play. Plans to joint venture or partially monetize the Alpine High midstream are on track and a formal process is underway. That process has drawn a significant amount of interest from a broad range of potential partners. And we are confident we will put some form of venture in place during 2018.","I'd like to close by commenting on the steps we have taken to mitigate the impact of widening Permian Basin differentials. We recognized the potential issue over a year ago and have been proactive in addressing it through various strategies. We have in place a combination of basis hedges, sales contracts, and firm transportation to access other pricing points.","We anticipate a relatively tight market situation will last through much of 2019, and that is the timeframe we have targeted for mitigation efforts. While we have some exposure to both price risk and product flow risk, we are taking actions and looking for opportunities to further mitigate both of these risks.","Now, I'll turn the call back to John for some final remarks before moving to Q&A.","John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.","Thank you, Steve. Before we open the call to Q&A, I would like to comment on a couple of the recurring topics we have heard during recent interactions with shareholders and the broader investment community.","With oil prices well above the baseline for 2018 planning, there is a lot of focus on what industry will be doing with the extra cash flows. For Apache, the answer to that question has to be based on the key elements of our plan for the year. Our 2018 base plan showed an approximate outspend of $700 million at $58 WTI, which was primarily driven by the Alpine High midstream investment program of $500 million.","In conjunction with that plan, we outlined our desire to transact the midstream business in a way that would eliminate our ongoing funding obligation, while still leaving us significantly invested in the future value add from the growth that will come from the upstream. As Steve outlined, we are well into that process. And we are confident that we will execute such a transaction in 2018.","That said, the timing and structure of this event are not finalized, and we will plan and respond accordingly. As such, our first priority for any extra cash flows in 2018 will be to close the cash flow gap with our overall capital program, including Alpine High midstream.","When we have better visibility to full year cash flows and certainty around the midstream outcome, we will then consider other options, including the return of additional capital to shareholders and incremental capital investment.","Another common topic is Permian Basin's supply growth, take away capacity, and the resulting impact on oil and gas basis differentials. Both oil and gas take away capacity is tightening as we move through the year and into late 2019. Basin offtake capacity is the main concern in this situation, and Apache is well protected through a combination of firm sales contracts and firm transportation solutions for the majority of our projected volumes.","A related concern is the widening basis differentials that accompany a constrained market. Here again we have taken proactive steps through basis hedges and firm transportation commitments that will help mitigate the price risk. I won't go into the details here, but we have included a few slides in our first quarter supplement that describe our current Permian marketing position and hedges.","Pipeline offtake constraints and differential widening will be a relatively short lived condition. The industry has been there before in the Permian, and these issues were quickly resolved, as Permian Basin intrastate pipeline capacity is comparatively easy to build.","Over the longer term, the Permian Basin provides a tremendous opportunity for Apache to deliver attractive growth at high rates of return. We have the fourth-largest acreage footprint and plan to commit 70% of our capital to the basin over the next three years.","That said, accelerating industry activity is creating significant competition for oilfield services and nontrivial operational challenges. In this environment, our priority is to protect and grow returns. We are operating at a disciplined pace with the objective to be the returns leader in the Permian with growth as an outcome.","And with that, we are ready to move to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And our first question comes from the line of John Freeman with Raymond James.","John A. Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Thank you. When I'm looking at the impressive cost reductions at Alpine High, you've already achieved kind of 80% of the target that you had, and you're really just starting to get kind of the impacts or the benefits from the pad development. I guess what's kind of been the biggest surprise relative to your initial expectations?","John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.","John, I think it's just a matter of moving into pads, I mean the drilling analytics, and the things we've been able to do. We've originally said we thought we could get down to $4 million to $6 million. So getting to the $6.2 million target this year, we knew we would be able to achieve it. And I think probably just being able to get there as quickly as we have, given the inflation we've had on some of the small services.","So I'm really pleased with where we are. I can tell you we see pacesetters daily coming out of there with all the analytics and technical tools we're applying. And I expect us to continue to drive those costs down. So it's a great story and is going to only get better.","John A. Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Great. And then when I look at Alpine High with basically you all averaging seven rigs and the one frac crew, once all the midstream is taken care of, can you kind of give me an idea kind of how that ratio of rigs to frac crews would you see changing kind of in 2019 and beyond?","John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.","Well, I mean we're at a period right now where you're working both your frac crews and your rig counts, and they will be dynamic. We've actually got two crews in that region, one of them kind of bounces back and forth between there and the Delaware. So it's really not just directly, I would say, one. A lot of that's a function of the pad and the timing and how we're scheduling that.","So over time, we would expect both. We've seen significant efficiencies on the completion side in the Midland. And I think you in general are going to see ratios similar to what we have, but probably in that same line.","John A. Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Great. And just the last one for me, following on the really impressive discovery at Garten, you all said you're going to revisit the international guidance on 2019 and 2020. Just maybe sort of an idea of kind of when you think you'd have enough information to at least preliminarily give some idea on how that changes numbers?","John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.","Garten is a very exciting discovery for us. And it will be material to our North Sea. I mean part of this will hinge on getting the well on and testing it, as well as evaluating how many other wells there might be there. This structure could \u2013 is more subtle and could be significantly bigger than the 10 million barrels that we have disclosed.","So as the year progresses and we get to do more technical work, we'll come back with that sometime later this year. But it's going to have an impact positively in 2019 and 2020.","John A. Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","I appreciate it. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bob Brackett with Bernstein.","Robert Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hi. Thanks for the disclosure on the gas positioning in the Permian. Can you talk \u2013 and you guys have thought about this, clearly, what are tactically some of the things you would do if gas production flow risk emerged?","Stephen J. Riney - Apache Corp.","Yeah, hey, Bob. This is Steve. Well, the thing is we are continuing daily with the contracting strategy for gas out of the Permian Basin and Alpine High. You see in the supplement we have 91% of our gas production planned for 2018. That's either on firm transport or is into gas sales contracts that require taking that gas.","So really only 9% of our production volume that we have planned for this year on the gas side in all of the Permian is at risk to any type of a takeaway capacity constraint. And we work on that daily. We're looking at more firm transport, more opportunity to get product out of Alpine High and get it into other basins.","As you know, there's a lot of activity out there in the market on that. And we're very active in all of those types of conversations. And I would anticipate there will be more activity on that as we go through 2018 and into 2019.","We're also looking at \u2013 we're also \u2013 there are option \u2013 we do have two large pipes going to Mexico that run to the north and to the south of Alpine High. And we are looking at options and possibilities on moving product on those as well.","Robert Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","And I heard your approach that by 2021, this is a \u2013 or 2020, 2021, this is something that the industry typically solves. How are you set up for 2019? Because you are growing gas fairly prolifically through 2019.","Stephen J. Riney - Apache Corp.","Yeah, we're still working on that. We've got the Gulf Coast Express that'll be coming online in the third quarter of 2019. That'll take care of a lot of the growth after that point. And then we're continuing to work the contracting side of this. As long as we have firm contracts to move our product with customers and they have the transport capacity, then our product will move.","Robert Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bob Morris with Citi.","Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thank you and congratulations, John, on some nice well results in the Permian and on the Wolfcamp C discovery.","John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.","Thank you.","Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","You mentioned that \u2013 you're welcome. You mentioned that at Alpine High you've now delineated 11 distinct landing zones. And you've had nice results from the pilots targeting the Woodford and Barnett formations so far. Can you say what other formations you'll be targeting this year with your drilling activity?","John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.","Bob, as we've said, we'll have about half of our program over the next three years will be in, primarily going towards retention, which is going to be predominantly Woodford and some Barnett.","The other portion of that will be \u2013 is discretionary or what we call impact, and we will be testing and drilling some other wells. So you'll see us start to work up the column. You'll see us start to work the Woodford in the shallower areas, the areas where it's going to be more oily and more liquids rich. So we're excited about those. And there's stuff that's ongoing now and will continue.","Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. And then my follow up. Steve, you mentioned pulling forward one of the cryogenic processing plants into this year. And maybe I missed it. But how are you able to do that? And what is the timing? Because obviously that'll have a big impact on the liquids mix once that plant is in place. So if you could just, if you can, give any color on now what the timing of that will be to be in place? And how you were able to pull that forward?","Stephen J. Riney - Apache Corp.","Yeah, sorry, Bob. I may have misled you on that on that comment. To be clear, our original timeline for starting up the first cryo unit was mid-2019. And we're simply looking at an option for bringing that forward in 2019, earlier in 2019. We won't have a cryo unit online before the end of 2018. That's for sure.","Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. So that still has to pull forward. Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeoffrey Lambujon with Tudor Pickering.","Jeoffrey Restituto Lambujon - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Looking at the overall opportunity set in the Midland, Delaware, and Alpine High and just thinking about long term activity levels, what's the right rig count or well count to keep in mind that gets you \u2013 again for the long term balance of optimally developing the resource, managing inventory levels, and also appropriately capitalizing when it comes to the infrastructure?","John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.","Yeah, Jeoff, I mean I think what we've stated is today we like our pace in both places. We've done some strategic tests at the half section level in the Midland Basin. And you're seeing the results of those that we're now integrating into the wells we're drilling now. So it's making a big impact by being able to incorporate the learnings and the data in the work we're doing.","Ultimately it boils down to, how do you develop these sections? And we've got to get the completions fully optimized. You've got to get your patterns right, numbers of wells, and those things.","And so taking the time to do it, taking the time to analyze the data, and then coming back, because you can always drill more wells, but you can't take away any that you drill.","So we like the pace we're on there. I think we're going to be able to accelerate into that as time progresses.","The second thing we're doing is you've seen, by getting out and testing the Wolfcamp C, we're testing other benches. And we're also testing other portions of our acreage that \u2013 when we've given our location counts in the past, we've been very conservative.","We've got a lot of acreage in the southern Midland Basin there that's highly prospective and others would consider core, so some of that's continuing to test those.","So you'll see us continue to ramp that activity over time. We can handle many, many more rigs than we're running there today, but we like the pace.","And similarly at Alpine High. What's unique about it is we've got 6,000 feet of rock over a 70-mile area. And obviously we're doing what we need to do to earn and hold the acreage, as well as build the infrastructure. And a lot of that pace has been driven by the wet gas side early on, because that's what we need the infrastructure for, to process the wet gas. The oil is easier, and it's also in the shallower zones.","So from a pace standpoint, we like where we are. I think when we get something done with the midstream, which we're confident we will do, it's going to give us some more flexibility. So we like the balance we have and what the whole portfolio brings.","Jeoffrey Restituto Lambujon - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Thanks for that. And then my follow-up is just on the completions optimization you mentioned. Is there any additional detail you can give us on the Midland spacing and stage design side? Any comments on that? And if there's anything else to watch for in terms of testing in the near term would be helpful.","John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.","In general, I'd say just keep watching our results. I mean we've done a lot of work with fiber and a lot of technology that is helping us with things we're doing. We're working on the optimization side. A lot of it has to do with the clusters and some things there, so \u2013 and spacing. Not necessarily just more sand. It's just placing it in the right places, doing things to understand our frac geometry and understand the reservoir. And I think once you align those two, you get smarter, and it helps you optimize.","I don't know, Tim, if there's anything you want to add?","Timothy J. Sullivan - Apache Corp.","Yeah, just a little color to add to that. Really it's allowing us to maximize our available pump time. And the cost reduction, we're seeing about a $220,000 cost reduction per mile of lateral length. So it's very significant.","And then of course it reduces the time it takes to get our wells back online. But we've done early results, we've done dip-in fiber, and we've done some modeling work. And we're seeing equivalent or better inflow from these wells.","And another thing that we've done also is we paid very close attention to our pad moves. And we've been able to take 20 hours off our pad moves from rigging down to moving to rigging back up. And with 42 pads a year, that's about two months of frac crew time that we can eliminate.","Jeoffrey Restituto Lambujon - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Great. Appreciate the detail.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Herrlin with Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale.","John P. Herrlin - Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale","Yeah, hi. I have some unrelated ones. With respect to the monetization of the Alpine High midstream, are you still planning to keep a large equity stake, because you had mentioned that I think in the past?","John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.","Yes, John. I mean, clearly, when you look at \u2013 and Steve alluded to it in his comments. I mentioned it. We are deep in a process. It is going very well, and there's a tremendous amount of interest.","I think the thing that we recognize is, is that this asset is unique, because of the column that we have. We've got 6,000 feet of pay. And really the value of this infrastructure is going to grow significantly over the next five, six, seven, eight years.","And so unlike other midstream assets, where you're developing one or two zones, this has a built-in set of wells and capital that's going to drive value.","So we will want to hang onto a large piece of the equity and keep that exposure, because ultimately it's our upstream capital that's going to be driving that.","So we're very encouraged. I think we're going to be able to maintain control. I think we're going to be able to eliminate the future spend. And I think it's something that's going to be value accretive for our shareholders.","John P. Herrlin - Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale","Okay. Great. Next one is on the improvements in the fracking that were mentioned. How much of it was development related, versus how much of it was design related to the well specifically?","John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.","Well, it's \u2013 that question, they go hand in hand. Because your design is impacted by your development. And I think that's the point is, is by getting into the pads with the pattern and the spacing test \u2013 and I'll say it again. We're doing a lot of things with fiber and a lot of high-end things with the micro size and others and the tracers, which is letting us better understand the frac geometries in what you're doing there. And I think those are the keys is understanding the rock, understanding the well spacing, understanding the number of landing zones.","And as we've said, you take the rock. It's not as generic as everybody wants you to believe. You can move over in some areas. Wolfcamp A and B are separate. Some areas are going to communicate. You have to go in and do the work and test the rock and understand it.","And I think once you start to grasp where the geometries are, then you can optimize those. So it really goes hand in hand, and it's why we stress the importance of the section and pad level development and return metrics.","John P. Herrlin - Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale","Great. Last one on Egypt. When do you think you'll have all the seismic done and processed?","John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.","Yeah, it's going to take it \u2013 we're making good progress, but this is going to be ongoing for quite some time. And we've got two brand new concessions. We're highly excited about what it's going to bring on the new acreage, as well as what the new technology brings on our existing acreage.","So you go back and look, Ptah and Berenice were two discoveries we had in late 2014, which really enabled us with the 25, 30 wells to pretty much keep our production flat on the oil side and grow it. So and that's really a strat trap sitting right under our nose out there.","So we're really excited about what the new broadband is going to do. And \u2013 but it's going to be \u2013 it's something we're going to be doing for a while. I mean it's going to go on into 2019, 2020 potentially before we get all of it shot. But we're getting a lot of it back right now. We've high graded the areas. And it's going to have an immediate impact on our drilling programs.","John P. Herrlin - Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale","Great. Thanks, John.","John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Charles Meade with Johnson Rice.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Morning, John, to you and your team there.","John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.","Good morning, Charles.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Yeah, I wanted to ask, to go back to these \u2013 the four-well Chinook pad. And that looks like it was one of the encouraging results out of Alpine High.","And I'm wondering if you can elaborate a bit on if that \u2013 how those well results fit with what you expected going in? And I imagine you guys are still learning new things at Alpine High and will be for a while. And I'm wondering if you could talk about if your results at Chinook changed anything about the way you guys are seeing the resource there?","John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.","Well, the thing I would say about the Chinook pad, number one is, is in industry vernacular, those would be child wells, because we've already had parent wells in the section.","So we're really pleased with it shows you the spacing assumptions. It shows with us getting into the pads. The cost is the big thing. We've always talked about the Woodford, and I think everyone acknowledges it's the best source rock in the world.","And so the key here with us and what's going to differentiate Alpine High is going to be the cost structure. And so I think getting well costs down, starting to be able to put the patterns in place, and then seeing the results. And quite frankly, we still are working through the infrastructure build out and bring up.","So we got a lot of things on last quarter, but we still don't have everything opened up fully. So well results, they look very good. They're very encouraging. I think spacing, we've been conservative. It kind of confirms we've been conservative on our spacing assumptions. And there's just a lot of rock and a lot of landing zones. And we're thrilled with the results, and those are short laterals too. So...","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Got it. That's helpful detail, John. And then secondly, this might be going a little bit further down the line. I appreciate your comments about how you guys are going to look at what you're going to do with the extra cash, if and when it shows up.","But when you get to the point where you're evaluating adding to capital spending or adding to your activity levels, can you \u2013 do you have any thoughts you can share now about where in your portfolio those added dollars and added activity would go?","John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.","Well, I mean clearly it's going to go into returning those dollars to shareholders. And then, two, it's going to go into the discretionary or what we'll call the impact areas. And those are going to be the oilier and more liquids rich portions of Alpine High or into our Midland Basin or Delaware Basin.","So those are the areas. We've got a lot of very encouraging results. And we're going to have a pretty big pick menu to choose from, so very excited.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Thank you, John.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you. Good morning.","John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.","Morning, Brian.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Wanted to ask on the CapEx trajectory for the rest of the year, I think you highlighted that one of the reasons for first quarter CapEx being a little higher was some of the efficiencies that you're seeing. You maintained the full year budget. How do you see the rest of the year playing out? And is there a decision that would need to be made if those efficiencies continue in terms of letting that lead to higher CapEx, versus potentially reducing activity?","John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.","Well, first of all, we did come in a little hot. We ended up keeping 100% of Garten. That was the last well we drilled with the WilPhoenix. And I think we all celebrated when we finally ended that three-year rig contract, so that's going to be very helpful going forward in the North Sea on our CapEx numbers.","But I mean honestly, one of the other factors is, has been the completion time. And as Tim alluded to, we've eliminated a lot of time in terms of between pad moves and things.","And so one of the things is, is you're always seeking to strive that balance, completion crews with rigs and rig count. And efficiencies, they run in \u2013 they don't run in parallel all the time.","And so our completions have taken a step forward. It's enabled us to choose some days off and pull some wells forward. And we will have a decision to make, if on the drilling side the pace doesn't quicken there, which that could happen as well. Then we will have a decision to make on, do we add another rig or two with our frac crews? So it gives you some flexibility. But we've got some time in the schedules right now. And later this year we'll have to make some \u2013 a decision on that.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks. And then my follow up is back to the midstream monetization. Can you talk at all about the type of long term contracts or commitments that you need to make? And the longevity or magnitude of those to be successful with your monetization plans?","John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.","Well, I think first and foremost is, it's a very thoughtful process where there's a lot of due diligence being done on us, and we're doing a lot of due diligence on the potential partners.","So you won't see big volume commitments. You'd see acreage dedication. And quite frankly, you'll see us controlling. So we're open to what the structure looks like. We recognize that the infrastructure investment really should sit in a different structure, where there is a different true cost of capital. We also recognize that we want to maintain as much of that equity as we can, because of the value we're going to create with our capital spend from the upstream side.","So I think very creative in the parties we're talking with and the potential structures vary. So but I'm very encouraged by where we are. We're very deep into the process. There's a tremendous amount of interest. And we're very confident that we will do something very attractive in 2018.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you.","John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Leo Mariani with Nat [National] Alliance.","Leo P. Mariani - National Alliance Securities LLC","Hey, guys. Just wanted to follow quickly on the Garten discovery. You guys talked about having 700 feet of net pay there in multiple reservoirs. Obviously that's a very, very significant number.","Is there any type of ballpark contribution that we should think about here? Can this thing do 10,000 barrels a day of oil as we work our way into 2019? Anything you can sort of say along those lines?","John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.","Leo, it's very material. I mean we have 700 feet of pay. This is in the Beryl sands, which is some of your most prolific sands there. It's got a lot more scope to the structure than something like Callater has. We did not find the water saturations. We kept drilling and quite frankly, we could've kept drilling deeper.","So it's going to be pretty material. And we'll come back with that. We just haven't given any color or any guidance. But you see very high rate wells come on. This will be light oil. And it'll be pretty impactful to our Beryl area. And I think the important thing is we own 100% of it.","Leo P. Mariani - National Alliance Securities LLC","All right. That's helpful. And I guess just (51:15) here. Obviously you guys talked about your methodical plan to really focus a lot on the wet gas in Alpine High in the short term. You got to get those volumes up to get the infrastructure sort of working.","But as you kind of think through the three-year plan, just trying to get a sense of whether or not you start to see more of a shift to oil. Is that more of a 2019 move at Alpine High? Or is it more 2020? What can you sort of say about the way you progress the development in terms of phase?","John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.","Well, I mean I think the important thing is, is we've got a very rigorous plan. And as we've stated, we've kind of put Alpine High in three settings. There's actually a couple more than that, but we put it in the Northern Flank, the Crest, and the Southern Flank.","And two things I'll say. Number one, the Northern Flank, the acreage is more checkerboarded. So we're drilling shorter laterals. And we have more near term lease obligations. And also is where the dry gas window is at the bottom of the Woodford. So you've seen some of our early capital tilted there.","As we move to the Crest and to the Southern Flank, we move up the column. And actually at Alpine High, if you remember, it gets a little cooler in the Southern Flank, which will also yield more liquid and potential for oil.","So I think you're going to see just the Woodford and the Barnett, as time moves on, they're going to get more oily. They're going to get more liquids rich. And they're going to get more rich gas.","Secondly is, as we've stated there is a lot of proven oil; we've shown that. We had five parasequence wells. There will be more. And quite frankly, with our discretionary capital, we will continue to advance those.","And so we've said all along that we plan conservatively with Alpine High. And it will get more oily as time progresses. And you'll see more from us.","Leo P. Mariani - National Alliance Securities LLC","All right. Thanks, guys.","John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Doug Leggate with Bank of America.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. Good morning, John. Morning, everybody.","John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.","Good morning.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","John, I've got one on the Permian and one on Egypt, if I may. So starting with the Permian, the comment you made about Wolfcamp C and expanding the inventory. Obviously you're clearly doing the right thing delineating and securing your acreage in Alpine High.","But at what point would you have greater flexibility? Because obviously, when you started this process, oil wasn't trading where it is with the kind of differentials we're seeing. So I'm just curious how you think about on a sort of one-, two-, three-year view, how your incremental spending will switch between the Midland\/Permian versus the Delaware\/Permian, given the increase, potential increase on location gap?","John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.","Well, there's no doubt over time you will see more from us on the incremental side. It's going to be going in two places. It's going to be going into the oil zones at Alpine High. It'll also be going into the Midland Basin. And part of that, Doug, is making sure we have the infrastructure in place in both places, where we are maximizing the returns. Because in the end, it's the returns that matter more than the top-line oil production.","And so the beautiful thing about Alpine High is, is that we have exposure to dry gas, wet gas, and obviously oil, and a lot of rich gas. And clearly, as we get the infrastructure in place, and we get more of the infrastructure in the Midland Basin in place, then we're going to have the flexibility to toggle and put that in incrementally, where we think it's going to drive the best returns.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I don't want to labor the point, but obviously oil is up a bit. You've been extremely capital disciplined. But it seems you have a lot \u2013 like you did today. It seems you've got a lot more flexibility to pivot to the oil opportunities you have today. So are you sticking with your spending budget? Or were you tempted to pivot a little bit more to oil in the near term?","John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.","Today, what we reiterated is our spending budget. And we came in a little hot, as we said, on the completion side.","And if we were to change that, we would obviously come back and give you some guidance on that. But today, that's what our \u2013 we increased our guidance on our current CapEx budget. It is going to be a little more oily because of the performance that we're seeing. And clearly, we've got things that we can do. So it's a good situation.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I appreciate that. Yeah. So my follow-up, and hopefully I won't take too much time on this. But a few years ago, actually probably it was seven or eight years ago, we published a detailed report on Egypt talking about how you had cracked the code of seismic and the legacy you had there and so on. And my question is really about in this oil price environment, I think most people think of Egypt as a cash cow to feed the onshore U.S.","I'm just curious how you think about Egypt's relative competitiveness as potentially a more meaningful growth area. We don't normally think about conventional location turnout (56:36), at least I don't think U.S. investors do in the way \u2013 the context of the Permian. But what is the opportunity set like? And why wouldn't you accelerate, given the very favorable PSC you have over there? And I'll leave it there. Thanks.","John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.","Well, I mean clearly, Doug, you hit on one of the key points. I mean Egypt is great rock. It's kind of Permian with conventional delivery. And clearly with two discoveries, Ptah and Berenice, we're producing tremendous volumes over a three-year period and still are today, about 30,000 barrels a day.","We think we see Egypt as a place where we can continue to grow the oil volume and grow the cash flow. And so we think it's a place we can have our cake and eat it too. And that's why we are investing in a new state-of-the-art 3D, and I think it will uncover many, many opportunities that we can tie back into infrastructure. So we see Egypt as an area that in the future we can do both, grow and grow the free cash flow.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","John, how quickly do you get your money back in the PSC?","John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.","It depends on the well. Some of those are very, very short.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thank you.","Operator","And our final question comes from the line of Michael Hall with Heikkinen Energy.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Thanks. Good morning. Just a couple quick ones on my end. I guess first on the Wolfcamp C result in the Midland Basin, commentary there of several hundred additional potential locations from that well. I'm just curious, like what other work you've done on your acreage to assess the Wolfcamp C? And what sort of follow-up activity we should expect on that front?","Timothy J. Sullivan - Apache Corp.","Yeah, Michael. First of all, we're very excited about the well. There have not been a lot of Wolfcamp C wells drilled to date. Keep in mind that this is just a mile lateral and had good 30-day IP.","But we've mapped the Wolfcamp C. And we've got tens of thousands of acres underlying it. So we feel very comfortable that we're going to have quite a bit of inventory that will spin off from this. But as I mentioned, it's very early days, and we're still evaluating.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Any plan in the near term to follow up that initial result with additional tests?","Timothy J. Sullivan - Apache Corp.","Yeah, we're going to evaluate this well right now. This is at Azalea. And we've got other areas that we do want to test the Wolfcamp C as well.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Okay. And then another topic I guess, just following up on the infrastructure or the marketing detail you provided. On the gas side I'm just curious, those percentages that you provided, are those on current volumes, planned volumes? Or how should we think about those?","Stephen J. Riney - Apache Corp.","Those are planned annualized volumes for 2018. For the full year.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Okay. And what are the term lengths on the contracts and dedicated sales? Any color you can provide there?","Stephen J. Riney - Apache Corp.","Yeah, they're all over the place. It's a whole portfolio of contracts, because this is the entire Permian Basin.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Sure.","Stephen J. Riney - Apache Corp.","What we provided in this, and just to be really clear, is that any contract that expired or would expire during this year is included in the uncommitted \u2013 that portion of it is included in the uncommitted production wedge.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Okay. Okay. That's helpful. Appreciate it. Thanks, guys.","John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","This does conclude our Q&A portion for today's call. And I would like to turn the call back over to CEO John Christmann for any closing remarks.","John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.","Well, and finally, I'd like to thank you all for joining us today. I want to leave you with three key takeaways.","First, Apache's off to a great start in 2018. We established a new Permian Basin production record, exceeded U.S. production guidance in the first quarter, and raised our outlook for the remainder of the year.","Second, we are realizing greater capital efficiency through cost control and continuous productivity improvement. This is a direct outcome of our methodical approach to delineation and development, our application of technology, and our measured activity pace in the Permian Basin.","And lastly, we are very pleased with our progress toward completion of an Alpine High midstream transaction, which will enable us to return additional capital to shareholders and\/or increase our upstream investment program.","That will include today's call.

My name is Sarah, and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the First Quarter 2012 Earnings Release Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Mr. Cassidy, you may begin your conference.","Patrick Cassidy","Thank you, Sarah. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us for Apache's First Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. This morning, we reported earnings of $778 million or $2 per diluted share. Adjusted earnings, which exclude certain items that impact the comparability of results, totaled $1.2 billion or $3 per diluted share. Cash flow from operations totaled $2.6 billion for the quarter. ","On today's call, we will have 3 speakers making prepared remarks prior to taking questions. First, we will hear from Steve Farris, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; followed by Rod Eichler, President and Chief Operating Officer; and finally, Tom Chambers, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","We prepared our quarterly supplemental data package for your use, which also includes a reconciliation of any non-GAAP numbers that we discuss such as adjusted earnings, cash flow from operations or pretax margins. This data package can be found on our website at www.apachecorp.com\/financialdata.","Today's discussion may contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions, and no assurances can be given that those expectations will be realized. A full disclaimer is located with the supplemental data package on our website. ","With that, I'll turn the call over to Steve.","G. Steven Farris","Thanks, Patrick, and good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. The first quarter of 2012 continued Apache's strong growth in production, earnings and cash flow. Our daily production during the quarter was up 7% from the first quarter last year adjusted for divestitures. And I want to point out that this growth came despite having about over 10,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day off during the quarter due to production disruptions, and Rod Eichler will get into more detail a little later in the presentation. ","Our corporate production growth expectations for the year remains strong between 7% and 13% over 2011 with a capital program that, I might add, that lives within our cash flow. We are continuing to build production momentum, and I'd like to mention just a few of the highlights of the quarter before I turn it over to Rod who'll give you a more detailed operational report.","In the Permian Basin, we entered the quarter with 26 rigs running. We now have 31 rigs running, going to 34. We have had good results in the Wolfcamp horizontal and the lower Cline plays, and we continue to accelerate as we get after a Permian drilling and resource portfolio that is really second to none. ","In the Mid-Continent liquids play, we entered the first quarter with 6 rigs running and currently operate 22. We continue to have attractive and consistent results across a number of liquids plays from the Granite Wash, the Tonkawa, the Cleveland, the Marmaton, Cherokee and the Canyon Wash. Our drilling inventory in the Mid-Continent is very comparable to that in the Permian, and we are more than tripling our activity in order to translate that activity into production and cash flow today. Importantly, we have the asset strength to do this while still living within our cash flow in our Central region.","We intend to unveil our Permian and Mid-Continent resource potential at our June 14 Analyst Day in Houston. ","In Canada, we're quickly transitioning our activity into an oil and liquids play focus. In our drilling during the first quarter, we've concentrated almost entirely on the Viking, the Bluesky, Montney, Glacier, Chinook and Beaverhill Lake plays, which have real running room across 6 million acres in that region. ","While this transformation unfolds, our current production in the region is still 83% gas, and our Canadian gas realizations continue to decline for the quarter, which contributed to a noncash write-down of the carrying value of our proved Canadian properties. And Tom Chambers will discuss this in greater detail in a few moments. ","Oil and liquid plays, we are locking on our Canadian acreage, rival those in the Permian and the Mid-Continent, and the fact that gas prices are low is not unique to Canada. Our longer-term gas solution is exporting to BTUs where they are valued, and that's why we're pursuing the Kitimat LNG project, which continues to progress toward FID. ","One change in our capital plans for the year in Argentina where our technical work has delineated about 650,000 acres in the oil window position in the Vaca Muerta shale. Most of it is either adjacent to or in the vicinity of the recent wells that have generated so much excitement down there, and our first test results have been very encouraging. And we have increased our region's capital program by 20% to accelerate our drilling and recompletion activity in this potentially very large oil resource play.","And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Rod Eichler.","Rodney J. Eichler","Thank you, Steve. We had another solid quarter of growth, and we're really just getting started. ","I'll begin with international as the bulk of our new volumes in the quarter came from the North Sea, where we completed the acquisition of Mobil North Sea Limited's Beryl and other fields at the end of last year. Production is up 67% year-over-year and 41% sequentially with plans in motion for continued growth. ","Apache assumed operatorship on December 31, including taking onboard 184 staff members from the previous organization to bring with them a wealth of experience and ideas for adding value. These fields had largely been in decline due in part to minimal investment from the prior operator who focused primarily on maintenance and compliance. ","As we did at Forties, we expect to reverse the direction of the production curve by acquiring and processing new seismic data, drilling wells and continuing workovers and other value-adding activities. Overall, the general infrastructure and platforms are in good shape, although we're dealing with obsolescence in certain areas, which isn't unusual for mature offshore assets. ","We recently drilled a new well from the Beryl Bravo platform, known as the BBP prospect, that we're currently completing and should have online later this month. Our team in Aberdeen is very excited about this one because we found virgin reservoir pressure in 2 of 3 zones containing more than 300 feet of net true vertical pay. This should be a very robust well and opens up further development opportunities. ","A 1,500 square kilometer 3D seismic survey is scheduled to commence during the third quarter, and we expect this program will significantly supplement the backlog of drillable locations on these newly acquired assets. This will be the first 3D acquired over the Beryl area licenses since 1997, and we are expecting a step change in the ability to image and interpret the very large and geologically complex structures in this area. ","Forties Field was off approximately 6,000 barrels a day during the quarter due to plant turnaround, ESP failures at 2 wells and the fact that no new wells came onstream to offset these disruptions. This is deferred production, and we expect to recover these volumes later this year.","Also during the quarter, we completed our subsea development work at Bacchus. And the first horizontal development well commenced production last week, producing at an initial rate of 6,000 barrels of oil per day. A second well was spud and is drilling ahead for Jurassic objectives in the central and western parts of the Bacchus geologic structure. ","In Egypt, overall, we're producing to plan. Our quarterly gross BOE volumes are up 1% sequentially. But under the terms of our production sharing contracts, as oil prices increased, our net production is reduced as fewer barrels are required for cost recovery. Due to these terms, our net daily production in the first quarter was reduced by approximately 4,000 barrels oil equivalent per day primarily from the 16% increased oil price realizations, averaging nearly $124 per barrel compared with $107 a barrel at the preceding period. ","Operationally, we have more rigs running, 26 currently, than a year ago and more wells planned this year, 280 versus 262. Importantly, we're getting more development leases approved. So we're able to convert exploration success to production at a faster pace than last year. ","And we continue to have good results with drill bit. In our Qarun joint venture, 2 exploration successes at the Heba field commenced production at a combined rate of 1,300 barrels of oil per day. In total, 22 new producers came online during the quarter, contributing 5,600 barrels of oil per day. ","In our Khalda area concession, we made several significant discoveries. The Qasr-1X exploration well in the West Kalbasha Station [ph] tested at the daily rate of 5 billion cubic feet of gas per day and 4,800 barrels of 43-grade API of oil per day. In the Kronos field, the discovery well tested 22 million cubic feet of gas and 700 barrels of condensate per day on a 460-acre structure. At Karman [ph], a test of the lower Sapa yielded 1,100 barrels of oil per day. And in Khalda field, an exploration well proved up stack base in the lower Sapa and A and B sections testing 1,700 barrels of oil per day. ","Lastly, exploration of the lower Baharia and Mirakar-1X [ph] in the AG development lease, which has been acquired from BP, it counted 198 feet of pay. After fracture stimulation, the well produced 28 million cubic feet of gas per day and 600 barrels of condensate per day. ","We continue to progress the development of our assets in Egypt. Despite ongoing struggles in the quest for democracy, our operations have continued uninterrupted and are supported by our government partners, as evidenced by the issuance of new development leases, drilling permits and the ongoing process of the first [indiscernible] in 6 years. We're really optimistic for Apache's future in Egypt. ","Turning to Australia. We commenced 2 new contract sales at our Devil Creek gas plant on January 1. New contracts significantly boosted our average gas price for our region, up 58% from the prior quarter to $4.18 per Mcf. Two cycles resulted in deferred production of 4,000 boe per day during the period, but there was no lasting damage. Van Gogh production averaged 10,800 barrels of oil per day, and we continue to realize good uptime and reservoir performance. ","Pyrenees field average 14,400 barrels of oil per day in the quarter, below plan due to Cyclones Heidi and Iggy. Reindeer averaged 44 million cubic feet of gas per day for the quarter, and we have 2 additional Reindeer gas contracts coming on in 2013. ","One of the highlights from our drilling campaign is the BHP Billiton-operated Tallaganda gas discovery in which Apache has a 25% working interest. This well accounted approximately 160 feet of net pay in the objective Mungaroo sandstones. We are currently evaluating the data and looking with our partners to determine the next steps. ","At the Coniston oil development project, long lead items have been ordered, and subsea packages are being manufactured. Work is on schedule for start-up in the second half of 2013. The [indiscernible] development is also progressing with its first oil anticipated in the front half of 2014. ","Finally, in Argentina, production was up from the prior year's first quarter but down from the preceding quarter due to higher gas reinjection and shale [indiscernible], which is typical during the southern hemisphere summer months of January through March. Our price realizations were up substantially from year ago. Approximately 84 million cubic feet of gas per day of our production was sold under the Gas Plus program at an average price of $4.95 per Mcf during the quarter. ","Overall, our gas realization was up 37% to $2.98 per Mcf from a year ago. Oil realizations were also up, averaging $83 per barrel, a 38% increase. We've had no impact from the recent events involving the Argentine government and YPF. Our team in the country continues to have positive discussions with both federal and provincial authorities to identify and remove constraints toward developing new reserves and production. ","We continue to focus our exploration and development activities in Neuqu\u00e9n Basin where we hold 1.7 million acres in the prospective Vaca Muerta shale per weight, of which 650,000 net acres are in the oil play. On the Huacalera block, we see the well last year as primary objective of the Vaca Muerta shale. The secondary objective is in the [indiscernible] formations. ","We saw significant gas shales in all 3 formations, as well as El Contico [ph]. During the first quarter, we fracture-stimulated the well with testing beginning at the end of March. We will study those wells for the next couple of months to collect more vital data and determine steps for development. On the Quarta Vara block, a well we TD-ed last August to test the Vaca Muerta El Contico [ph] formations was also fracture-stimulated in the first quarter. We will soon place this well in a 90-day flow test before shutting it in to collect pressure data. We plan up to 8 rig completions in the Vaca Muerta formation this year with plans to permit up to 5 new drill locations, both vertical and horizontal, in the oil fairway. We expect to initiate this drilling in the third quarter. ","Now moving on to North America. We continue to ramp up activity in the Permian, where we are the second-largest operator in the basin. First quarter production averaged nearly 99,200 barrels of oil equivalent per day. 70% of the production was liquids, and 82% of that was black oil. This is a 3% increase in per day production from the preceding quarter and includes about 2,800 barrels of oil per day related to prior period adjustments, mostly associated with BP and non-operated true-ups. We averaged 28 operated drill rigs for the period, up 3 from the fourth quarter, drilling 147 vertical wells and 17 horizontals. We currently operate 31 rigs in the region, including 6 horizontals. ","We are running a 14-unit drilling program in the Deadwood area and continue to see positive results. In February, we commenced Phase 1 operations from the Deadwood gas plant, a joint venture with Crosstex Energy, immediately re-commit the facilities in the 90 million cubic feet of gas capacity. Phase 2 is expected come online this quarter and will be fully operational later this year. The plant capacity will be 50 million cubic feet of gas per day. We expect to drill third [ph] wells in Deadwood this year. Exploration drilling in the Cline Wolfcamp play is also underway. It's too soon to talk about results here right now, but we plan to provide more disclosure of our progress next month at our June 14 Investor Day.","I'll move now to our Central region of Oklahoma and Texas Panhandle. We have more than doubled our position in the Anadarko Basin wash play fairway to nearly 550,000 net acres with the completion of the Cordillera acquisition on Monday. With it, we've increased Apache's exposure to the prolific Granite Wash, Tonkawa, Cleveland and Marmaton gas condensate oil plays. We now operate 22 drilling rigs in Anadarko Basin and are contracting for another 2. ","A number of notable horizontal wells were completed during the first quarter. On Apache's legacy acreage, we drilled 3 Cleveland wells and averaged 400 barrels of oil per day and 850 Mcf of gas for the first month. Two Marmaton wells averaged 340 barrels of oil and 7.5 million cubic feet of gas per day and 3 Granite Wash wells, which averaged a daily rate of 475 barrels of oil and 5.6 million cubic feet of gas per day. ","We also continued the successful Cherokee program, drilling and completing 2 wells that produced an average of 250 barrels of oil and 350 Mcf per day for the first month. On the newly acquired properties, 24 wells were drilled and completed during the quarter. Among them were the Cleveland well, which averaged 375 barrels of oil and 400 Mcf per day; 2 Tonkawa wells that averaged 475 barrels of oil and 1.1 million cubic feet of gas per day; and 5 Granite Wash wells that averaged daily rates of 240 barrels of oil and 8 million cubic feet of gas. ","We also had a very impressive Marmaton well coming on with a 30-day rate of 11 million cubic feet of gas per day and 800 barrels of oil per day. Offsets to this well are currently being completed. ","In April, net productions from the Cordillera assets averaged approximately 21,900 barrels of oil equivalent per day, up 22% from January. ","As with the Permian region, we will have more detailed disclosure of our Central region assets and opportunities on June 14. Sequentially, our lower first quarter daily production reflects our low fourth quarter rig count and asset divestments of approximately 40 million cubic feet of gas per day and 200 barrels of oil per day from our former East Texas properties. This will certainly be reversed in the second quarter with the addition of Cordillera and overall accelerated drilling program. ","Turning now to the Gulf of Mexico shelf. We drilled 10 wells during the quarter with a 90% success rate. Our production for the region overall and for oil is ahead of plan of approximately 1,900 barrels of oil equivalent per day and 3,800 barrels of oil, respectively. Like other operators, we are dealing with third-party platform and pipeline issues, which offset higher volumes for property we acquired in 2010. ","New pipelines are being laid in the Ship Shoal, South Marsh Island, Vermillion and Matagorda Island areas, which should help to address past pipelines shut-ins. ","We are seeing some settling down in the regulatory environment. The Bureau of Safety and Economic and -- Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement, or BSEE, is spreading the processing of drilling permits around other district offices, which is helping to alleviate the backlog built up since Macondo. I'm proud to point out that Apache was the first Gulf of Mexico operator to submit and receive Safety and Environmental Management System, or SEMS, audit plan approval. Implementation of that plan officially kicked off on Monday, April 30. ","Notable activity during the quarter included the commissioning of a new platform of Main Pass 308. We drilled 3 wells, which, combined, are producing 900 barrels of oil and 5 million cubic feet of gas per day. A fourth well is drilled, and we're testing -- we're currently testing it, and we're prepared to drill ahead on a fifth. We anticipate drilling 8 wells total and reaching up to 3,200 barrels of oil equivalent per day of production by the end of this year. ","Following a routine inspection, Apache detected corrosion at Grand Island 43 Complex [ph]. Approximately 5,500 barrels of oil per day and 11.5 million cubic feet of gas per day gross will be shut in while we undergo repairs, which are expected to take about 90 days. In the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, we advanced the development on 3 subsea tiebacks, Wide Berth, Mandy and Bushwood. ","Wide Berth came onstream last week, producing at gross daily rates of 35 million cubic feet of gas per day and the 3,200 barrels of condensate per day. We continue to clean up with 4 more [ph] expected in a couple of weeks and 50 million cubic feet of gas per day and 4,000 barrels of condensate per day. Development continues at Lucius with spar and topsides construction in progress, a successful appraisal well of Heidelberg extended the oil accumulation of approximately 1,500 acres. ","A pre-FEED study has been commissioned to determine the development plans. We're currently participating in exploration test at Spartacus in the Lucius, Hadrian play fairway at Walker Ridge, Block 793. We're also waiting on the release of a rig and commence drilling of our Parmer prospect, a subsalt middle Miocene oil prospect that is expected to spud later this quarter. ","In our Gulf Coast Onshore region, we drilled 7 wells during the quarter with a 100% success rate. This includes a horizontal well in Grindes County [ph] where we're testing Woodbine sands, a 16-stage frac simulation job over a 4,100-foot lateral is scheduled to commence this month. We also TD-ed our spar sale prospect at St. Mary Parish. This is a deep lower Miocene exploration test that we're scheduling for completion in the third quarter to coincide with upgrades under way to Atchafalaya Bay infrastructure. ","In Canada, the transition to oil- and liquids-rich drilling is fully under way. Sequentially, quarterly oil production is up 5%, and gas volumes increased 22% -- gas liquid volumes increased 22%. We averaged 7 rigs during the quarter, drilling 58 wells with approximately 60% of these targeting oil reservoirs and 1\/3 targeting rich gas. The remainder were service wells. ","Among the region's highlights were the reactivation of Kaybob, a Duke well which tested 1,800 barrels of oil equivalent per day and is currently producing at 1,200 barrels of liquids per day and 2.6 million cubic feet of gas per day. This is the fifth-highest liquid-producing well in Western Canada and is Apache's highest liquid producer in the region. In our House Mountain focus area, a Beaverhill lake test, came in at 700 barrels per day. We also drilled 10 horizontal wells as part of our House Mountain waterflood project, completing the well's multistage asset fracs. Initial results are encouraging with IPs up to 1,100 barrels per day and 9 day rigs averaging 510 barrels per day during flowback. During the second quarter, the region is focusing on Midale and Brownfield oil drilling programs in Southern Alberta and Saskatchewan. ","In summary, our momentum continues. We had several one-off production disruptions during the quarter, 6,000 barrels per day in the North Sea, 1,500 barrels in Central due to plant turnarounds and 4,000 barrels per day off in Australia due to cyclones. Otherwise, we could have reported more than 780,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. ","Apache has a variety of opportunities across its diverse portfolio. In Onshore U.S. alone, we are ramping up our rig count from 32 in January to 52 today and to 60 by year end. Our accelerated activity will translate into visible future production and ultimately more value for our shareholders. ","We have scheduled a 2012 Analyst Day for June 14 in Houston and plan to highlight our North American resource plays in greater detail. ","That concludes the operational highlights, and I'll now be happy to turn it over to Tom Chambers.","Thomas P. Chambers","Thanks, Rod. Good afternoon, everyone. As you've seen by now, we reported earnings of just under $780 million and $2 per diluted share. These numbers tend to mask our underlying financial performance, which continues to provide a platform for long-term profitable growth across our region. ","I'd like to emphasize what was mentioned previously both by Rod and Steve, in that we continue to grow our business, achieving record levels of production this quarter averaging 769,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day. Coupled with record oil prices, our revenues were the best ever at just under $4.5 billion for the quarter with oil revenues costing $3.5 billion, accounting for 79% of the total. More importantly, these factors resulted in continued strong cash flow with cash from operations before working capital items of $2.6 billion, up 18% from the prior year quarter and in line with last quarter.","Our continued ability to generate significant amounts of cash flow from our asset base has enabled us to fund our robust E&D capital program across the globe. And getting after our capital program is critical in realizing the opportunities we have gained through our recent acquisition activity. We've been able to sustain this cash flow despite increasing pressure on North American gas prices, particularly in Canada. As in past quarters, our balanced portfolio has allowed us to benefit substantially from our oil position and the fact that oil currently sells for about 43x the price of North American natural gas.","In addition, our international gas portfolio has also provided balance, helping to mitigate a 22% decline in North American natural gas prices from the year-ago period. First quarter 2012 international gas realizations were 17% higher than a year ago and 7% higher than the last quarter, driven by our new sales contracts in both Australia and Argentina. ","Our acquisition of Mobil North Sea Limited at the end of last year also bolstered our international gas position by adding 65 million cubic feet a day at prices near $8. Our product mix with oil-related growth has helped preserve our financial strength despite significantly low natural gas prices here in North America.","Natural gas prices are at levels not seen in over a decade and are straining many producers that are highly leveraged to this commodity. Our Canadian region is the most GAAP-leveraged region in our portfolio, and current period earnings reflect this. First quarter earnings were impacted by a $390 million noncash after-tax write-down for our Canadian oil and gas property balance. ","Just to reiterate what most of you are familiar with, full cost accounting requires us to calculate the 10% discounted after-tax value of our proved reserves using period-end comps, a 12-month average for commodity prices in effect at the first day of the month. If the discounted value is less than our net book value in a given country, the excess is written off. Adjusting for this noncash write-off and foreign exchange impacts, earnings were $3 per share, up $0.10 from the prior year period and $0.06 sequentially.","Higher cash margins of $47.94 per barrel of oil equivalent underpinned our healthy earnings and cash flow. Cash margins were up 9% and 6% versus the year-ago period and the sequential quarter. Our consistent focus on margins and cost trends continues to pay off. Total cash cost, excluding taxes other than income, averaged $13.19 of BOE, in line with our $13 to $13.50 target range for the year. ","A detailed calculation of our margins, adjusted earnings and cash from operations can be found in the financial supplement located on the website. ","Turning to the balance sheet. Our ability to consistently generate record cash flows has provided the opportunity for us to meet our planned capital expenditures and continue reaching into the acquisition market. In February of this year, we closed on the 49% share of Burrup Holdings ammonia fertilizer plant for $439 million, which allows us to realize additional price upside on one of our largest Australian gas contracts. And just this week, we closed on the $3.1 billion Cordillera Energy Partners acquisition in the liquids-rich fairway of the Anadarko Basin. ","To fund these transactions and refinance some maturing notes, we successfully issued $3 billion of new debt in early April, 5-, 10- and long 30-year tranches at very attractive rates. Our balance sheet remains strong with almost $3 billion of available liquidity at the end of March and a debt to cap at only 21%.","A key point I need to highlight for the first quarter is our effective tax rate of 49%. Higher than our typical 42% to 44% rate that you've seen. This rate was impacted by the Canadian adjustment mentioned earlier, as well as the higher taxed foreign earnings, contributing more of our overall net income during the quarter. Absent the Canadian adjustment, our effective tax rate would have been a more typical 43%. Similarly, these adjustments impacted our percentage of deferred taxes in the quarter. However, we would expect the deferred rate to move towards the 20% to 25% range for the year. ","To wrap up, despite the lowest North American gas prices in a decade, Apache achieved its highest quarterly revenue ever. Our fundamentals are strong, and we continue to build a great deal of momentum with each passing quarter. With rising production, strong cash flow, a continued focus on delivering strong margin and an inventory of cost mix greater than any time in our history, we are poised to deliver continued growth and value for our shareholders. ","And with that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Patrick.","Patrick Cassidy","We will now open the call to questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Arun Jayaram with Credit Suisse.","Arun Jayaram - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Yes, I wanted to talk firstly, just trying to set the baseline where guidance is set on the production side. I know you had some asset sales late in the year that maybe impacted Q1 in terms of growth. But I just wanted to better understand what the baseline of the 7% to 13% growth is based on.","G. Steven Farris","It's the beginning of the year trend [ph] sale basically. So I think you heard it pretty much throughout the presentation.","Arun Jayaram - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. So we're basically just taking your 2011 growth, backing off the...","G. Steven Farris","About 11,000 barrels of oil, yes.","Arun Jayaram - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, okay. That's fair. And Steve, I just wanted to see if you could talk about your confidence perhaps in the middle part of the range. You are starting off a little bit of a lower starting point. Just give us a sense of your confidence to reach perhaps the middle point of that range.","G. Steven Farris","Well, let me put it this way. I feel very comfortable we're going to be ahead at the low end of that range.","Arun Jayaram - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And what do you think would you have to see to get to that middle part of the range in terms of your overall portfolio?","G. Steven Farris","Well, the results that we're going to have in the second quarter are going to be important, obviously. As you move out, the wells you drill in the first 2 quarters are really what sets the stage for your overall production growth. So I'm hopeful we show some added growth in the second quarter and certainly in the first part of the third quarter. We've got a very active drilling program going on right now, most active we've been in some time in North America.","Arun Jayaram - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Fair enough. One quick question in terms of Egypt. The gas price, I just wanted to get a little bit of color around the decline of the gas prices. I do know next year contractually, the gas price goes down just because of an expiration of a contract. But I just wondered if you can talk about that quarterly swing and the dips in gas prices.","Thomas P. Chambers","This quarter, we had an adjustment in the gas price. There was some gas that was booked at that old gas price that wasn't that. So you saw a reduction in the gas price to make up for that error last quarter. It was a onetime quarter deal.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate with Bank of America.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","If I could try a quick follow-up on the Gulf question. Steve, when you say year-over-year, you've obviously had the Beryl acquisition and the Cordillera acquisition. So is the growth target organic growth target or total growth target?","G. Steven Farris","It's a total growth target.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. I just wanted to clarify that. Getting into the details a little bit, can we talk about the outlook for Australia this year? Because obviously, with Coniston scheduled to come onstream, I guess, in a year or so time, there's still I guess some debate over what you're going to do with the FPSO down there. So could you give us an idea as to what the expected downtime will be.","G. Steven Farris","Yes, Rod?","Rodney J. Eichler","Well, we have a combined Coniston, Ningaloo Vision, which is the name of the FPSO rectification project, which is sort of working both a subsea development in tandem with the repairs and modification. These are making them both. So the -- excuse me, [indiscernible] significant servicing work in early part of 2013. I forget the exact amount of days or weeks that it will be out of service before returning to the field later that year to be able to commence production for the combined Coniston and Van Gogh. I'm sure Patrick can get back with you with that number after the call.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. So the downtime is next year, not 2012?","Rodney J. Eichler","That's correct.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. Second one for me, Steve, again, just I want to get back to you just again. Unfortunately, it still comes up as an issue, an overhang in terms of the uncertainty over there. One issue I wanted to get some clarity on is the risk of devaluation of the Egyptian currency. How does that affect your business? And I'll leave it at that.","G. Steven Farris","Well, Rod might wanted to jump in there too. In terms of -- we get paid in U.S. dollars. In fact, we export the biggest bulk of our crude production, and that's based on dollars. And the gas sales to Egypt you see are based on U.S. dollar equivalent. So we really shouldn't have any impact based on the dollar side other than maybe a little higher op costs just because they're paid in Egyptian pounds. Egyptian workers are paid in Egyptian pounds.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Freeman with Raymond James.","John Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Focusing on sort of the weakness we've seen on NGL pricing, especially sort of in the Mid-Con region. I believe you've got like a pricing contract that's coming up pretty soon that's due on the technical side. Just sort of how you are thinking about it, maybe various options that you're considering to maybe address what's going on in the NGL pricing.","G. Steven Farris","Well, actually, there's an awful lot of work going on in the industry around that in terms of pipelines, and we're not excluded from that concept. And this is a little longer-term view of life. And it's quarter-to-quarter, but a little bit like we're facing in the Permian Basin. With the resource potential both in the Anadarko Basin and the Permian Basin, the easiest thing to pick is infrastructure, frankly. I mean, it's an industry we're facing that in the Permian, and it's -- those things are going to get built. It might be a quarter late, and everybody wants to project in their numbers. And I don't have any specifics associated with it. I'm just talking a little bit like Crosstex and our step there. In all truthfulness, I don't worry about infrastructure if the wells are good enough.","John Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. If I just shift over to the Permian. Of the 31 rigs you got at the moment, you mentioned 6, right now, are focused on horizontal. I'm trying to get a sense of, around the end of the year, what you would envision that split looking like in terms of horizontal versus vertical.","G. Steven Farris","Well, it's an interesting situation in the Permian. Actually, it's unlike what's happening in the Anadarko Basin. We've got 22 rigs running in the Anadarko Basin. 21 of them are horizontal. In the Permian, that's a much lower number than the industry. In 2010, the number of horizontal wells in the Permian Basin was less than 10%. In 2011, it was a little bit more than that, which you're going to see in the Permian Basin. The same thing is happening in the Anadarko Basin, and the majority of them are going to be horizontal as we get into the future. Right now, I think we're projecting something like 700 wells, of which about 100 of them will be horizontal this year. A little over 100 of them will be horizontal.","Rodney J. Eichler","And that number is actually weighted heavily on the Deadwood side because over 300 of those wells that are in Deadwood this year, and those are almost all vertical wells, structural reservoir, targets deeper.","G. Steven Farris","And we've got a couple of Cline horizontal wells in there, and we will drill more of Cline horizontal wells in the future.","John Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And just a final question for me. On New Zealand, I believe the first of the 4 wells that you all had planned there was going to spud during the second quarter. Is that still the case?","G. Steven Farris","Yes, it's either the second quarter or the first part of the third quarter. We just -- Rod and I just reviewed that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Hall with Baird.","Michael A. Hall - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Just curious, as you kind of step back and kind of look at Canada and the opportunity there, kind of in unconventional liquids in particular, I guess how would you characterize that and its lifecycle relative to the U.S. And sorry if I missed it, but did you identify kind of how many, let's say, horizontal unconventional liquids targets you have up there this quarter?","G. Steven Farris","Well, the first question, I will tell you, it's in infancy. What some of the things we're doing on our acreage in the Provost in that area, actually, we've got a huge acreage position there that we're just now beginning to exploit. And that's shallow oil. That's 3,500 to 4,000 feet. And actually, we've had very good success there. Some of the other stuff that you -- the Cadomin and that kind of stuff over to the West, that's a little further along. In fact, what happens in Canada is it's late in coming. I mean, I'll be real honest with you. If you look what happened to gas prices. Everybody was a gas player in Canada until we saw what's happened over the last 18 months on gas prices. So we're not the only ones making that switch.","Michael A. Hall - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Sure. Okay. And then just on, the interruptions that we're seeing during the quarter, if I heard that right, I think about 10,000 barrels a day offline. Did those come fully back on in the second quarter?","G. Steven Farris","Well, the ESP work, part of it will be -- we had the turnaround at -- I think it's Bravo on Forties. The ESPs, we've got a rig that we're going to try to pull out there and do some recompletions and pull those pumps on the ESPs. Those may not all be done this year -- I mean, this quarter. But we also have a couple of other good things happening. That Beryl well that Rod mentioned is maybe the best well drilled in Beryl in the last 20 years. And I'd say that, we haven't gotten the test on it yet. So the best thing about it is we haven't tested it yet. It looks fantastic on the logs. I mean, it's virgin pressure. It could be the best well in the Beryl field in the last 20 years.","Roger B. Plank","This is Roger. Then there was 1,500 barrels a day in the Central region, which from a plant downtime, assuming another plant doesn't go down, that would be back online. And then typically, it isn't cyclone season.","Rodney J. Eichler","We're done with the cyclone season now. We're out of it as of this weekend.","Roger B. Plank","So that's 4,000 barrels a day. So most of it ought to be back online.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Tameron with Wells Fargo.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I have to ask, Egypt, can you just give us an update on anything since your last update as far as progress there and the new government and kind of where we stand on that?","G. Steven Farris","Yes, and then again, Rod probably has some comments, too. I will -- Rod and I were in Egypt about 1.5 months ago. I think what you...","Rodney J. Eichler","Because of the very large concession, because we have a sizable resource. Likewise, the 8 recompletions I referenced and the 5 new drills, those will be focused, for the first time our drilling will be focused in the oil window portion in areas that were very similar and adjacent to like VF and other companies' activities that have had press releases. And we're very encouraged by that outcome. They're on our core concession areas. We had some of our principal productions in the Neuqu\u00e9n Basin, and it's -- we'll have probably more to say about that on our June 14 meeting.","G. Steven Farris","Yes, I think it's safe to say we've gotten some cores. We've done some recompletions down in the oil window, which gives us very good encouragement to drill at least 5 or 6 horizontal wells in the Vaca Muerta shale oil.","Roger B. Plank","That shale is much shallower in those areas compared to the 2 concessions I referenced.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Excellent. Excellent, I appreciate that color, and very quickly on the North Sea, looks like you guys -- the activity's paying off there. How sustainable do you see the rates there for this year that we're seeing out of the North Sea for you?","G. Steven Farris","Well, I think it's early times. I will tell you, the Forties will, we will get that back, and that will be pretty steady. The good thing about the well that we just drilled is we really anticipate having more resource potential there than we thought we did going into it, frankly. I mean, in all honesty, this well found pay but it found much more pay than we thought it would. So it gives us added hope that, that resource potential there is bigger than what we had evaluated.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Pearce Hammond with Simmons & Company.","Pearce W. Hammond - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Your U.S. gas volumes quarter-to-quarter down about 48 million a day. Is that because of the divestitures?","G. Steven Farris","Well, you bet. It was actually the divestitures were a little more than that. So that...","Thomas P. Chambers","50-plus.","G. Steven Farris","I think it was almost 50 million a day. So you're looking at numbers that are comparable to last year.","Pearce W. Hammond - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","And Steve, have you seen your gas volumes start to level off in the U.S. or actually decline? Or are they still growing?","G. Steven Farris","Well, if you look at whether it's us or anybody else, when we talk about all of these liquid-rich plays, the Marmaton well that Rod mentioned is making over 800 barrels of oil a day. It's also making 10.5 million cubic feet of gas per day. And we've got 90% of that well. We've got a -- the Marmaton is going to be a good play. We've got -- it's not nearly as continuous as all those plays, but we've got, we've picked up a very big acreage provision from Cordillera in that play, and that's the second or third well drilled in the Marmaton, only second or third well drilled, so, so far, that's -- but you're going to see a lot of gas besides the liquid side of it.","Roger B. Plank","If I might comment, we've got 60 rigs running in America now, and 58 are targeting liquids-rich and oil. So to the extent -- we're a lot like everybody else, dry gas, we're just not drilling for. The other thing that might have gotten lost in the numbers is our gas production was up 3% sequentially. Well, it's because even though we're down in North America by about 40 million a day with the property sales, we're up 110 million abroad, which is, as Steve pointed out, we've got $4.02 during the quarter. It rose $0.27 from the prior quarter. Internationally, it's the first quarter where we're seeing our international prices higher than our North American prices. So our revenues are climbing internationally on the gas side.","Pearce W. Hammond - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Great point. Great point. And then just one follow-up. If you could provide an update on Kenya.","G. Steven Farris","Kenya should spud in the latter part of July. We've secured a rig. In fact, Rod and I reviewed that a couple of days ago. We should spud that well in the latter part of July.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Portillo with Tudor, Pickering, Holt.","Matthew Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Just 2 quick follow-up questions for me. Along the same vein on the U.S. gas production, could you provide any additional color on potentially how that could trend over the year if you're expecting kind of a steady increase or at some point, we'll see that leveling out? And then within Canada, as there has been historically a little bit more gas-focused, should we be thinking about those volumes declining and any potential risk on shut-ins?","G. Steven Farris","We just quickly looked at our outlook. I would suspect if our outlook is correct, our gas from the U.S. is pretty well flat, maybe a little up. In terms of -- what was -- the other one was about Canada? Yes, shutting in production is if it covers operating costs, there's no economic reality to it. And I don't anticipate us in any of our gas deals to get to the point where we shut in gas because the operating costs are higher than the price we're receiving.","Matthew Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Just to follow-up on that, I guess within Canada, and this might be an unfair assumption, but I'm assuming there's a little bit less liquids-rich drilling activity at the moment from you guys. Should we think directionally your Canadian volumes should start to decline at some point this year on the gas side?","Rodney J. Eichler","Well, you'd presume that, that would be the case with virtually no wells targeting dry gas up there. I wanted to clarify one thing on Steve's point. When he said flat, he's really, I think, thinking from this day forward with Cordillera built in because we're, of course, picking up quite a bit of gas there. So we ought to be able to have U.S. volumes flat to rising somewhat through the balance of the year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","On the LNG side, we've seen a number of LNG contracts signed for U.S. LNG here year-to-date. Can you give us an update on how you see the strength of the market, particularly the Asian market? And then given your advantageous geographic position at Kitimat to serve the Asian market, can you refresh us on what the key constraints are to an announcement on Kitimat? Is it the FID that gives you confidence in the greenfield costs or some other reason?","G. Steven Farris","Well, we -- and Rod again could do this a lot more in detail. But we are pretty much done with the FEED. I mean, I can't tell you enough that the real bottom line for Kitimat or any of these projects, what's happening in the U.S. is an anomaly. It's not a greenfield development. So what you're looking at, whether it's us or Shell, I read this morning that Imperial's thinking about getting in the business, all of those contracts are going to have to be oil-based contracts. And we truthfully are in the throes of negotiations for a very, very -- a tenant that could underpin that development. But we're not there until we're there. So we're continuing to negotiate. We're also continuing to declare right-of-way for the pipeline, and we're working towards the construction of the LNG facility. It's not a cost, as much as it is -- of course, they're, like anything, cost and price, are synonymous. I mean, it's -- but we haven't seen great increases on the cost side as we move through FEED.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And my follow-up is, can you just refresh us post-Cordillera acquisition, what we should expect to see your corporate CapEx run rate to be as we go through the rest of the year?","G. Steven Farris","Yes, we're going to stay within our cash flow. I don't know where our capital budget was for this first -- I mean, I know, but round numbers...","Thomas P. Chambers","9.5 is what we said.","Rodney J. Eichler","Yes, and it's 9.5 to 10, honestly. We're going to have cash flow, usable cash or spendable cash around $10 billion for the year. And that's -- whatever we have is going to go on the ground.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. But no other changes beyond, I think, a slight point you made on Argentina?","G. Steven Farris","No, no, I mean, we're going -- we increased it $50 million to drill those Vaca Muerta shale wells. So it's not a huge bump.","Rodney J. Eichler","The way we look at that, you heard about the increases in the rig count in the Mid-Continent or Central region, Anadarko Basin, also in the Permian. And if cash flow holds up, then we'll just keep that many rigs or more running. And if cash -- if prices come down, then we might cut that back later. So that's kind of how we jigger it to live within cash flow.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Leon (sic) [Leo] Mariani with RBC.","Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Just looking for a little bit more clarity there on Kitimat. Do you guys still think you'll make a decision to potentially build over the project by the middle of the year?","G. Steven Farris","I can't -- I don't think I can be more -- we're going to make a decision when we have all of the Is dotted and Ts crossed, and the most important I dotted and the T crossed is to have an MOU that is good enough in order to -- on the sales side, in order to take this project forward in an economic basis. And if that comes in the middle of the year, it will be middle of the year. If it comes in the third quarter, it will be in the third quarter.","Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","All right. Can you guys comment on the big onetime D&A expense this quarter?","Thomas P. Chambers","Again, Leo?","Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","You had a big onetime D&A expense this quarter like $520 million. Can you...","Thomas P. Chambers","Yes, that was the Canadian write-off.","Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Got you...","Thomas P. Chambers","That was total in cash.","Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Got you. And can we get some more color on the discovery you made in Australia you talked about earlier?","Rodney J. Eichler","Well, Tallaganda is a project that's about 100 kilometers southwest of our DeSoto discovery from 2011. As I indicated in my remarks, it covers about 190, 160 feet per day [ph]. But the well is operated by BHP. We really have to defer our comments to the operator. Right now, we're evaluating the results of the well to see the forward path on future development. But we have to follow BHP's lead.","Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Got you. And do you think that's oil or gas?","Rodney J. Eichler","Well, I think I'd defer to the operator. I hope based on whatever press releases they've had out there, which is I don't think they've had much the way it's...","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Malone with Global Hunter Securities.","John Malone - Global Hunter Securities, LLC, Research Division","On Australia, it looks like CapEx was down a bit quarter-on-quarter. Is that just the general lumpiness of projects? [indiscernible] a trend there? And also on that, when do you start to see LNG spending really start to kick in?","G. Steven Farris","Well, yes, quarter-on-quarter, they may be just a little bit behind, but I fully expect them to achieve their targeted CapEx amount for the year. We've reviewed this on a monthly basis on our call just 2 days ago. As far as the LNG, we have some of the initial LNG-related. Some expenses are beginning late last year and throughout 2012. But the really big spike in those expenses will come in late 2013 and 2014 when the subsea is opened. It gets in place in fabrication and the central processing plant form and the gas plant begin in earnest.","John Malone - Global Hunter Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then just going over to Egypt for a second, I think you mentioned it before, but what was the gross production would have been without the PSE effects?","G. Steven Farris","Growth production was up 1% on a BOE basis, and our gas, oil prices were up 16%, which is basically on a PSE basis, we get less product in order to get the same cash back. So our oil was down about 4,500 barrels a day on a net basis. But it's -- on an overall gross uptick basis, it was up. So you'll see that turn around again next quarter.","Thomas P. Chambers","My simple way of describing that is if you got $100 of costs to recover and oil is selling at $100, then you've got 1 barrel. And if you have $50 oil, then you get 2 barrels. So when prices go up, it works the opposite of that.","John Malone - Global Hunter Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then just on Egypt, you were talking about the politics, just I know you can't extrapolate, as to what you think Egyptian politics are going to do, but how do you think it affects your gas prices if subsidies were eliminated or curtailed?","G. Steven Farris","Well, they've been talking about curtailing subsidies for at least a decade. I guess the good news in that is they actually made it a very transparent part of their budget about 7 or 8 years ago that we actually see the big elephant that is in the room. The subsidies or energy budget gas and oil refined products is probably going to run 115 billion Egyptian pounds in the coming budget year from what I read, which is significantly a lot lower than it was a few years ago, which is about 70 something-billion pounds, about $10 billion. I don't think that the subsidy issue is going to be resolved anytime soon. I mean, we may see some effects on the refined products like gasoline. But to give you an idea of just how extreme that subsidy is, 92 octane gasoline, I just read this morning, the subsidy sells at the equivalent price of $1.09 U.S. per gallon. The people who burn 92 octane are people with nice cars, not poor people or farmers with tractors and use lower octane fuels. So that's a pretty healthy subsidy for people who could afford to pay a regular price. I think the near term, what we're going to be faced with, at least for the next 5 years, I would expect to see the same contractual gas price on our gas sales agreements, which is tied $2.65 per million BTU. Unfortunately, we have very rich gas that we get more than that, $3 to $4 per Mcf basis, and oil price, of course we receive the world price based on our export volumes on the Brent market.","Operator","At this time, there are no further questions. Presenters, do you have any closing remarks?","Patrick Cassidy","Yes, Sarah, I do. Thank you for participating in our first quarter earnings call.

So we will extend this call past 2 o'clock in order to accommodate 30 minutes of Q&A.","And I will now turn the call over to John.","John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.","Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. On today's call, I will begin by discussing Apache's approach to the current environment. Then I will highlight our 2017 accomplishments and provide an overview of the fourth quarter before turning it over to Tim and Steve for more details. And finally, I will close with commentary on our 2018 to 2020 outlook.","Early in 2015, we focused Apache on a path that creates real value for our shareholders over the long term and through the commodity cycles. The foundation was underpinned by cost and capital discipline. And we linked our compensation plans accordingly. This approach has driven our actions through a very challenging period. Specifically, we have streamlined our portfolio, reduced capital investment, increased capital productivity and efficiency, and reset the corporate and operating cost structure.","By choice, we allowed production to decline rather than chase growth in an environment that was mostly value destructive. This disciplined approach enabled us to cost effectively lease and quietly discover a world-class unconventional resource of scale and to direct our limited additional investments to improving long-term returns. We were also able to maintain our dividend, while many in the industry were reduced or eliminated.","Moreover, we strengthened our balance sheet by reducing debt and avoided diluting our shareholders' long-term value by electing not to issue equity to pursue expensive acreage acquisitions or to fund an outsized capital program.","We have been clear in our belief that an E&P company, over the long term and through the commodity cycles, must be able to do the three things that leading companies in mature industries do, live within cash flows, grow the enterprise through prudent investment, and return capital to shareholders through a competitive dividend and\/or share repurchases. This is the path that Apache is on now. And we have assembled the team and the portfolio to do so for decades to come.","Our current investment programs are directed at building the optionality over the next few years to maximize the value of that portfolio. Specifically, at Alpine High we are building out a world class resource play that will change the course of Apache.","The expanse of the opportunity in terms of acreage and hydrocarbon column will drive capital investment and very soon, free cash flow for decades to come. The capital program in short order will bring forth the capacity to deliver oil, gas, and NGLs at scale to the rapidly growing market on the U.S. Gulf Coast.","The midstream infrastructure capital program at Alpine High is a critical piece to the story for the near term. We must strategically control the build-out of the infrastructure to meet the needs of the upstream. We do not need to own 100% of these assets for the long term though. And we are studying strategic alternatives that will ensure we capture the value we are creating and will free up cash flow by eliminating future capital.","In the Permian Basin, outside of Alpine High, we have proven the quality of our inventory and are now well-positioned to profitably grow oil volumes for many years to come.","Internationally, the North Sea and Egypt are very well-positioned to serve their primary strategic purpose, provide free cash flows back to the corporation for many years to come. And we still have a tremendous amount of running room.","In Egypt, we've increased our acreage footprint by 40% with two new concessions and are conducting a large scale broadband 3D seismic survey that will set up growth opportunities for the future. In the North Sea, we have a sizable inventory of development locations and exploration prospects around our existing infrastructure. And in Suriname, we have two highly prospective blocks that are on trend with recent discoveries in an emerging world class oil basin.","In the relatively near future, we will have significant optionality across the portfolio, especially in the Permian Basin, to direct investment across an extensive highly economic portfolio to produce oil, gas, or NGLs.","At that time, the Permian Basin will be generating substantial free cash flow, which will bring another dimension of optionality. Those cash flows could be directed to any of the following, further accelerate the pace of Permian development, fund growth opportunities outside of the Permian, which may have been deferred due to Alpine High funding requirements, and return of capital to our shareholders.","The future allocation and prioritization of how those cash flows will be utilized will be determined by what we deem to be in the best long-term interest of our shareholders. This is the strategic direction of Apache today.","2018 promises to be a very interesting year. Our industry is at a critical inflection point following three years of depressed commodity prices and disappointing returns in terms of both return on and return of capital.","Today, we are in a more constructive oil price environment. And the market is watching carefully to determine whether E&P companies will maintain discipline and focus on long-term returns or revert to the historical norm of a singular focus on top line growth. For the industry to adopt a more rational approach to balancing optimal risk adjusted returns and growth, management incentives must be appropriately aligned.","Consistent with that, investors are now seeking key changes to executive incentive compensation programs. Shareholders are advocating for the inclusion of absolute return metrics and programs historically more heavily weighted toward relative returns performance. They are also insisting that growth related metrics be calculated on a debt adjusted per-share basis.","As I indicated, Apache restructured its compensation philosophy three years ago that clearly linked our long-term compensation as closely as possible with long-term shareholder value. It was also the best way to align our entire organization with our strategic direction.","Specifically, our long-term incentive program has taken a balanced approach, with 50% based on relative TSR and the other 50% based on two metrics, which are highly correlated with absolute returns. The targets for these latter metrics are agreed with the board on an annual basis and reflect corporate objectives that are consistent with the economic environment at the time and the context of the long-term strategy of the company. We align those metrics every year. And therefore, they have no inherent bias for subjective growth targets.","Turning now to our 2017 highlights. It was a great year of progress for Apache, marked by several important advancements that position us for strong performance in the years ahead.","Following two years of curtailed capital investment, our Permian Basin production volumes entered 2017 in decline. Notwithstanding this slowdown, we have made and continue to make significant progress on many fronts, consolidating our land position; investing in science, data collection, and strategic testing; improving our drilling and completion capabilities; confirming additional landing zones; conducting important pattern and spacing tests at the section or half-section level; and testing shallow zones at Alpine High and other unconventional oil opportunities in the U.S.","In 2017, we returned the Permian Basin to a growth trajectory, exclusive of Alpine High, with a relatively limited capital program. And clearly demonstrated that Apache possesses high-quality acreage and can deliver leading well results.","Notably, our total Permian Basin production reached a record high in the fourth quarter, exceeding the previous high set two years ago in the fourth quarter of 2015. This achievement occurred just two quarters after Permian production reached a four-year low in mid-2017.","As a result of the operational progress we made and the now proven quality of our inventory, we anticipate sustained, high return growth from the Permian for many years to come.","In the Midland Basin, we have both a technology and execution success story. We are applying state-of-the-art capabilities to reduce drilling and completion time, locate wells more effectively within landing zones, and more efficiently stimulate the productive interval.","In the second half of 2017, we began to significantly increase our average lateral length, which will continue into 2018, as 85% of our wells are planned for 1.5-to-2-mile laterals. We are very excited about our recent Midland Basin results and will continue to advance and leverage these key learnings for the future.","At Alpine High, we initiated first production ahead of schedule in May and ramped production volumes steadily through the year, as we commissioned infrastructure and connected wells. We increased our inventory of risk locations to more than 5,000 and initiated our first true multi-well pads and pattern tests, which will drive increasing capital efficiencies into the 2018 program and beyond.","We are pleased with these results and have begun to climb the learning curve with our development program, which will deliver well cost and productivity improvements in the future.","Internationally, as I mentioned earlier, we added significant new acreage in Egypt. And we are moving forward with our exploration program in Suriname. Both of these areas bring significant future prospectivity to Apache.","In 2017, we implemented a number of cutting edge technology initiatives across our operational footprint. The continued evolution and application of technology is vital to our industry. It will drive efficiency gains, inventory expansion, higher returns, and performance differentiation among E&P companies.","Apache has long been a leader in technological innovation. And the recent addition of Mark Meyer as Senior Vice President of Energy Technology Strategies underscores the strategic importance of these initiatives.","Lastly, I note the excellent progress we made in the ongoing reshaping of our portfolio. We took advantage of the active market for leasehold in the Permian by divesting some non-core acreage packages at very attractive prices. We also completed our strategic exit from Canada.","These actions, combined with the ongoing investment at Alpine High, represent a large scale, multiyear portfolio rotation that will be extremely accretive to capital efficiency, recycle ratios, and most importantly, long-term returns.","Moving now to fourth quarter results, Apache finished the year on a positive note with its second consecutive quarter of profitability. In the fourth quarter, we delivered strong adjusted EBITDA and cash flow, demonstrating our leverage to improving oil prices. Operating and G&A costs decreased from the third quarter on a unit basis. Capital spending was on plan. And U.S. production was at the high end of our guidance range.","Internationally, we had some mixed results. Both Egypt and the North Sea benefited from improved Brent pricing and delivered combined cash flow from operations of nearly $0.5 billion and significant free cash flow. In Egypt, we continued to deliver excellent drilling results and achieved more than a 90% success rate during the quarter on 25 new wells.","In the North Sea, following a long run of success, we encountered a few challenges. An unscheduled shutdown of the Forties Pipeline System, an unexpectedly tight producing formation in our CB1 Callater offset well, and an exploration dry hole on a long standing obligation well combined for a disappointing quarter. The result was lower production volumes in the quarter and a lower trajectory going into 2018.","Despite these setbacks, the North Sea remains a vital, high return business for Apache. We have two existing discoveries in development planning and a deep inventory of attractive tie-back prospects.","In the U.S., we had a very strong quarter. All of our growth came from the Permian Basin, where production increased 10% over the third quarter. At Alpine High, we commissioned our fifth central processing facility at the Hidalgo site and achieved our year-end production target of 25,000 BOEs per day.","This flow rate was temporary, as we subsequently shut-in some production for a scheduled expansion at the Dakota central processing facilities.","For the quarter, production averaged 20,000 BOEs per day. Midland and Delaware Basin oil production exceeded the high end of the guidance range we established a year ago. This was driven by a combination of strong well performance, a significant number of new wells placed online in the Delaware Basin, and timing of some high impact, half-section spacing tests in the Midland Basin.","With that summary of our fourth quarter results, I will now turn the call over to Tim, who will discuss operational details of the fourth quarter and our 2018 activity plans.","Timothy J. Sullivan - Apache Corp.","Thank you, John. My remarks today will include operational activity in key wells in our U.S. and international regions, planned activity levels by play for 2018, and I'll conclude with commentary about the use of new technology throughout the organization.","Operationally, we had a good year and continue to improve in key areas. Our fourth quarter production results continue the growth trajectory established in the third quarter.","In the U.S., fourth quarter production averaged 222,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, up 7% from the third quarter. U.S. oil production increased to 98,000 barrels of oil per day, an 8% increase from the preceding period. Much of this growth was driven by continued success in the Midland Basin.","At the Powell field in Upton County, we brought online 20 wells from three pads with an average 30-day peak IP of nearly 1,400 BOE per day. These wells were drilled to the Wolfcamp B formation and are comprised of 1.5- and 2-mile laterals, producing in excess of 75% oil. These are half-section spacing and pattern tests, designed to methodically and scientifically determine the optimal development plan for the area.","We continued to make good progress on drilling, completion, and cost optimization, as we use capital more efficiently with larger well pads and longer laterals.","In the Midland Basin, we have reduced drilling and completion costs 20% over the last 12 months on a treated lateral foot basis, while production volumes improved 17%. These results give us confidence that we can continue to improve here and elsewhere in the Permian Basin.","As John mentioned, we are moving to more pad operations at Alpine High. The Dogwood State pad is a six-well spacing test located in the northern flank and was selected due to retention requirements. These are dry gas wells on 660-foot spacing drilled in the Barnett and the Woodford formations to a total vertical depth below 13,000 feet. This pad has produced more than 2 Bcf in just 49 days and is currently producing approximately 75 million cubic feet per day.","In the Central Crest, the two-well Elbert State pad drilled the Woodford formation at a TVD of approximately 9,800 feet, nearly 4,000 feet shallower than the Dogwood [State] pad. As projected from our thermal maturity model, these wells produce wet gas and oil and averaged a 30-day peak IP of 1,175 BOE per day with an oil-gas ratio greater than 60 barrels per million cubic feet. Drill, complete, and equip costs for this two-well pad averaged $6.2 million per well.","As we move to pad operations at Alpine High, we are realizing the benefit of reducing cost and increasing efficiencies. On the drilling side, these include using less expensive spudder rigs to drill the surface and intermediate hole; batch drilling operations with walking rigs; casing design optimization with standardized production casing, and in some areas, the elimination of an intermediate casing string; substituting oil-based muds with less expensive brine drilling systems; customized bit and bottom hole assemblies; and the use of rotary steerable equipment to increase penetration rates in the lateral section. These efforts have reduced spud-to-TD times in some cases to under 15 days.","On the completion side, pad operations have also led to the following cost and performance benefits, pumping more frac stages per day, optimized sand loading to pattern size, recycled and brackish water use, higher pump rates allowing for gel elimination requiring lower horsepower, and pads also allow us to verify confined stimulation intervals with tracers and micro-seismic.","Through these efforts, we have brought down our costs considerably, and we expect costs to continue to decrease from an average of $8 million last year, where we were heavily invested in science and data collection, to $6 million this year. Ultimately, we anticipate well costs will be closer to the lower end of the $4 million to $6 million range we provided in 2016.","Elsewhere in the Delaware Basin, we brought online seven wells in our Dixieland field in Reeves County and five wells in Eddy County. These wells have targeted four separate landing zones in the Bone Springs and Wolfcamp formations with impressive peak 30-day IPs ranging from 1,100 to nearly 2,200 BOE per day.","And in the Anadarko Basin, we completed the Scott 33, a five-well pad in the Woodford SCOOP play. These mile laterals are producing in excess of 1,700 BOE per day with an oil-gas ratio in excess of 50 barrels per million cubic feet. Drill, complete, and equip costs for this pad averaged approximately $8 million per well.","Internationally, our Egypt and North Sea regions continued to generate excellent free cash flow, benefiting from the recent price increase for Brent Index crude oil. In Egypt, highlights for the quarter include the Ptah 18, a development well in the Faghur Basin with a 30-day IP in excess of 3,400 BOE per day, all oil. Also, two exploration tests in the Matruh Basin, the Herunefer West-4X and the Chelsea-1X, were both discoveries in the upper Safa formation with a combined test rate in excess of 14,000 BOE per day, producing 58% oil. Both wells set up additional development and step-out exploration opportunities.","For the full year, Egypt delivered a success rate greater than 80%, completing 88 net wells, of which 40 had test rates greater than 1,000 BOE per day with 87% oil. These are low-cost vertical completions and generate very attractive returns.","In the North Sea, fourth quarter production averaged 58,000 BOE per day, as volumes from the Forties field were impacted by the unscheduled shutdown at the third-party operated Forties Pipeline System.","The Callater field, a subsea tieback to the Beryl facilities, came online in mid-2017, and with the addition of the recently drilled CB1 well is currently producing on a gross basis 17,000 BOE per day, 43% oil. Please refer to our financial and operational supplement for more details on the fourth quarter.","Now I will move to our 2018 capital program, beginning with the U.S. The Permian Basin remains the focus of our activity in the year ahead, with approximately $1.6 billion being directed to this region, or roughly two-thirds of our annual upstream budget. We plan to operate 13 to 15 rigs during the year, with six to seven at Alpine High, three elsewhere in the Delaware Basin, and four to five in the Midland Basin. We also expect to run four to six frac crews during the year, split primarily between Alpine High and in the Midland Basin.","At Alpine High, we plan to drill 85 to 95 wells during 2018. And this will comprise approximately 50% development retention wells and 50% delineation wells. For perspective, to date we have drilled a total of 118 wells at Alpine High, of which 48 were online and producing at year end. Our retention program is crucial, as competitor activity around us has increased significantly, with more than 170 wells drilled or permitted by other operators since we announced Alpine High in September 2016.","Importantly, drilling to the deeper Woodford formation allows Apache to retain drilling rights for all zones above it. Additionally, the wells drilled to the deeper source rock provide data needed to optimize the build-out of our infrastructure and shape the full field development plan at Alpine High.","In the Permian Basin outside of Alpine High, we are planning a balanced drilling program of approximately 55 to 60 wells in the Midland Basin and 45 to 50 wells in the Delaware Basin. While we plan to drill a similar number of wells as last year, our average laterals will be increasing. And we expect to drill 15% more total lateral footage. These plays are predominantly oil.","Our capital program for the international regions reflect their role in our portfolio as free cash flow generators to fund reinvestment in the Permian Basin. Our 2018 planned capital investment here is approximately $690 million. This will provide for continued cash flow generation from Egypt and the North Sea regions, though we expect some natural field decline at this investment level.","Our 2018 capital program anticipates a moderate level of service cost inflation, approximately 10%, and we are managing this carefully. We have already contracted most of our rigs, pumping services, and sand required to execute the plan in the year ahead, avoiding the premium being paid currently with ramped up activity for many services. Higher costs are more likely to be seen in ancillary services in the Midland and Delaware Basins and will be more difficult to offset because of industry-wide activity levels.","In spite of the inflationary trends, we are well-positioned at Alpine High for a step-change reduction in our cost profile as we scale up our business. Throughout our organization, we are applying new technologies and creating new tools that are improving how we work. These apply to subsurface, drilling and completions, production, and supply logistics groups.","We are increasingly applying big data analytics across the company. We continue to lead the way in the development and application of simultaneous seismic sources, both onshore and offshore, the result of which has allowed us to save millions of dollars in exploration costs, greatly reduce the time to collect, process, interpret data, and realize large improvements in data quality.","We have developed a drilling intelligence guide app that gathers high-frequency data from sensors on the rig for use in prediction and avoidance of downhole issues. We have also developed workflows and developed technologies that allow us to rapidly characterize thousands of feet of core and quickly get this information into the hands of the project geologists and reservoir engineers for rapid characterization of our shale plays and landing zones.","Along with our ongoing efforts on oil fingerprinting, we are building a far more robust understanding of our shale plays and their performance. We're using multiple sources, such as fiber optics, micro-seismic, and 4D seismic, all of which are providing unprecedented insight into our formation stimulations, leading to optimized reservoir development.","We've built new state-of-the-art water treatment facilities, including highly engineered water storage pits, both in the Midland Basin and Alpine High areas, that directly add value to our projects by reducing water costs and in increasing both reliability and flexibility in our operations.","We're using remote operating centers that utilize real-time data to optimize well performance, allowing immediate reactions to changing circumstances. These data-driven decisions help deliver operational improvements and increase efficiency.","The combination of data analytics technologies and advanced machine learning inform and validate our decision-making processes and operational strategies. As John mentioned, we expect technology will play an increasingly vital role in our future exploration and development progress.","In conclusion, 2017 was a very good year. We achieved 124% production replacement rate from E&D adds net of engineering revisions. We returned to growth in the Permian Basin, advanced Alpine High, and generated robust free cash flow from our international regions. 2018 will be an extension of these efforts, as we continue our operating and capital cost discipline and our commitment to returns-focused growth.","I will now turn the call over to Steve.","Stephen J. Riney - Apache Corp.","Thank you, Tim. Today I will highlight Apache's fourth quarter and full year 2017 financial results, discuss our 2018 outlook, comment on cash returns and return on capital employed, update our Alpine High midstream progress, and briefly review our hedge positions.","Before I get to these details, let me first review a few of the company's key financial achievements in 2017. Apache returned to profitability in 2017, both on a GAAP reported basis and on an adjusted earnings basis. We reduced our absolute level of debt and our net debt, ending the year with more cash on hand than we began with. We retained our investment-grade credit rating.","We returned nearly $400 million of capital to shareholders through the dividend. And asset sales generated $1.4 billion of proceeds and eliminated approximately $800 million of future asset retirement obligations.","In 2018, we will continue to maintain a strong balance sheet, direct our capital investments for value and long-term returns, and take important next steps to progress Alpine High into full operational mode, so we can return to living within cash flows as we prefer.","Through all of this, we will also continue to return capital to our shareholders, which is an underappreciated aspect of Apache. Over the last three years, we've returned over $1.1 billion to shareholders through the dividend. For the next three years, we plan to return at least this amount, and possibly more, through the dividend or through share buybacks.","Turning to our fourth quarter and full-year results, as noted in our press release this morning, under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, Apache reported fourth quarter 2017 net income of $456 million or $1.19 per diluted common share.","Results for the quarter include a number of items that are outside of core earnings and are typically excluded by the investment community in published earnings estimates. The most significant of these is a $306 million deferred income tax benefit from U.S. tax reform. Excluding this and other less material items, our adjusted earnings for the quarter were $126 million or $0.33 per share.","For the full year 2017, Apache reported GAAP net income of $1.3 billion or $3.41 per share. And adjusted earnings of $92 million or $0.24 per share.","With respect to U.S. tax reform, the $306 million tax benefit recorded in the fourth quarter reflects the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in 2017. This represents the combined impact from the deemed repatriation provision and the reduction in the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%.","This is a provisional assessment of the U.S. tax reform. And we continue to assess its full impact. Importantly, as we have indicated in the past, Apache is not currently a cash taxpayer in the U.S. And given the carryforward of certain tax attributes, we do not anticipate this changing in the foreseeable future.","In terms of operational and financial results, key items such as North American and international production volumes, capital expenditures, LOE, DD&A, and G&A were consistent with or better than our latest guidance. Capital spending was $862 million for the fourth quarter and $3.1 billion for the full year. Throughout 2017, we further strengthened our balance sheet and liquidity position, ending the year with net debt of $6.8 billion and cash on hand of $1.7 billion.","Let me turn now briefly to 2018. We have provided more detailed guidance for the year in today's fourth quarter financial and operational supplement. I won't go through each component, but would like to highlight a few key items.","Our capital budget for 2018 is $3 billion, which is down slightly from 2017. We plan to invest $2.5 billion in the upstream and $500 million in Alpine High midstream. At current pricing, the upstream will be approximately cash flow neutral, inclusive of the current company dividend of $380 million. The midstream will operate at a cash flow deficit of approximately $500 million. This deficit could be significantly reduced or even completely eliminated in the event of a funding transaction involving the Alpine High midstream assets. It is anticipated that any cash flow deficit for 2018 will be funded through cash on hand.","For the year, Apache's adjusted production is expected to increase by 7% to 13%, consisting of 19% to 24% growth in the U.S. and a 3% to 10% decline internationally. Oil production in the Permian Basin is projected to grow by approximately 9%.","For the first quarter of 2018, U.S. production is expected to be around 223,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Adjusted international production is expected to average 135,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.","So the first quarter will be flat to slightly down from the fourth quarter, before we return to a growth profile that will deliver the 7% to 13% increase for the full year that I just mentioned. This is the result of several factors, including timing of pad completions in the Midland Basin, as we placed three pads into production during the fourth quarter of 2017, but we only have one pad planned for the first quarter of 2018; mechanical compression issues on one of our Beryl facilities and further temporary outages at the Forties Pipeline System in the North Sea; production curtailment in the Permian Basin due to weather impacts and a temporary shutdown to rebuild a tank battery in the Midland Basin; and Brent crude pricing impacts on our Egypt volumes as a result of our production sharing contracts.","From a capital and expense perspective, first quarter should generally run at a quarterly pace of around 25% of the full year dollar guidance ranges. Exceptions to this would be capital expenditures will be around $800 million, cash exploration costs will be around $50 million, G&A expense will be around $120 million, and financing costs will be around $105 million.","Let me turn now to a discussion of returns, which as you know, is integral to how we manage our business. For three years now, we have been consistent in our approach to capital allocations. We fund opportunities that we believe will maximize long-term value and optimize long-term returns.","To reinforce this, we added a cash return on invested capital metric to our annual incentive compensation plan. We outline the specifics of how we intend to calculate this metric in our financial and operational supplement.","For 2018, we have established a cash return on invested capital target of 18%. Our performance against this target accounts for 20% of the entire company's annual incentive compensation. This measure of returns should improve by about 2% per year for the next few years.","Another important measure of returns we watch closely is return on capital employed. Just like the cash return on invested capital goal, we have added a strategic goal related to ROCE on our 2018 incentive compensation plan. That goal is to implement a long-term plan that returns the company to sustainable double digit ROCE.","Everybody has a preferred methodology for calculating ROCE with the most significant differences arising from the use of pre- versus post-tax income in the numerator and gross versus net debt in the denominator. Our preferred method is a numerator using adjusted earnings before interest and taxes and a denominator using average debt plus average shareholder equity.","Using this methodology, at flat pricing from today, our 2020 ROCE is projected to be around 10%. And this will continue to improve for the next several years after 2020. With the required start-up investment at Alpine High, improving ROCE will take some time.","Embedded in our forecasted ROCE is the assumption we continue to own, operate, and fund 100% of the Alpine High midstream infrastructure.","Although strategically critical and valuable, these investments tend to hold back returns as measured by accounting metrics. A transaction involving these assets could materially improve these ROCE estimates.","The upstream investment in due course will become the long-term engine for dramatically improving ROCE. While Alpine High may take a bit of time to attain critical mass, with its extremely low entry cost and attractive recycle ratios, it will drive significantly improved ROCE for Apache Corporation for many years to come.","Next I would like to provide some color on our Alpine High midstream operations, where we continue to make steady progress on multiple fronts.","Construction on these facilities began in November 2016. And the progress we have made in a little over a year is remarkable. Currently, we are operating 110 miles of gathering line, 45 miles of 30-inch trunk line, 21 central tank batteries, and 5 central processing facilities with inlet capacity of 330 million cubic feet per day. By the end of 2018, we anticipate reaching 830 million cubic feet per day of inlet processing capacity.","During the year, we plan to commence installation of centralized cryogenic processing facilities, which will add another 600 million cubic feet per day of capacity in 2019.","We have also begun implementing a takeaway strategy with the signing of an agreement with Kinder Morgan to access capacity on their Gulf Coast Express long-haul gas project from the Waha Hub to Agua Dulce near the Texas Gulf Coast. This agreement includes an option to participate in the project on an equity basis, which we believe will prove valuable to the midstream enterprise for the long term.","You can anticipate similar arrangements on the NGL and oil sides in the future. We recognize there is a wide variety of long-term strategic options for the Alpine High midstream assets, and we are giving these careful consideration. The inherent value of these assets comes from the massive long-term flow of hydrocarbons from Alpine High and the optionality that will create along the value chain.","Numerous parties have approached us with some very interesting ideas of how they might join us in the build-out of the midstream business. While it is likely these assets will end up in an enterprise separate from Apache, for both funding and for value optimization reasons, we currently anticipate owning a significant share of this enterprise for the long term.","Before turning the call back to John, I'll comment briefly on our hedging program. As a reminder, we do not engage in hedging to speculate on price. The purpose of our hedging program is to protect cash flows to fund the capital program at Alpine High.","For 2018, an average of 85,500 barrels of oil production per day currently have some form of hedging protection. 47% is in the form of puts, 37% is in collars, some with upside call options, and 16% is in the form of swaps. All of these hedge positions give the desired downside protection, and nearly 70% retain some form of upside potential, which we generally prefer.","While our cash flow sensitivity to natural gas price movements is considerably less than for oil, we did recognize risks associated with certain types of gas exposure. As such, we entered into both NYMEX gas price swaps and Waha basis swaps to eliminate some of the uncertainty.","To date, we have swapped an average of 237 million BTUs per day of NYMEX gas price exposure for 2018 at a weighted average price of $3.07. With respect to Waha basis, for all of 2018 and the first half of 2019, we have entered into swaps for an average of 156 million BTUs per day at an average basis differential of $0.51. We have also entered into a small number of Waha basis swaps for the second half of 2019. The details on all of our hedge positions can be seen in our financial and operational supplement.","This time of year, we also typically provide updated guidance on our cash flow sensitivity to changes in commodity prices. For 2018, we estimate that a $5 change in oil price impacts cash flow by approximately $350 million. A $0.30 change in gas price impacts cash flow by approximately $65 million. Both of these estimates exclude the effect of our hedge positions.","I would like to conclude by noting Apache's continued financial strength and flexibility. We entered 2018 with $1.7 billion of cash, $150 million of which we used to fund debt maturities earlier this month. We have an additional $400 million of debt maturing in September, which we will also retire using cash on hand.","We will continue to balance the great confidence we have in our current investment programs with our overarching desire to live within cash flows. We have purposefully created the liquidity to fund the near-term outspend because it will maximize long-term value for our shareholders. While this will be a small and short-lived outspend, we are exploring all options for minimizing or eliminating it entirely.","We will also continue to take advantage of the flexibility our portfolio provides on the capital program outside of Alpine High. We will maintain the planning and operational flexibility to manage these programs as market conditions dictate.","I'll now turn the call back over to John for a discussion of our three-year outlook.","John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.","Thank you, Steve.","Before we move on to Q&A, I'd like to comment on the 2018 to 2020 outlook we provided in this morning's press release. Over the next three years, we plan to invest a total of approximately $7.5 billion in the upstream, with just under $2.5 billion budgeted for 2018 and increasing slightly through to 2020. Additionally, we expect to invest $1 billion in the midstream build-out at Alpine High over the next three years. This will include around $500 million in 2018 and another $500 million split evenly between 2019 and 2020.","As we have made clear, we are exploring funding alternatives for our midstream assets and are working to eliminate some or all of this capital from our three-year plan. I cannot overstate the strategic importance of the midstream solution at Alpine High. The optimal outcome requires a deliberate and thoughtful approach, highly integrated with the upstream development plan, and we are investing the necessary time and resources to get it right.","The outcome of this capital program is a projected compound annual growth rate of 11% to 13% for Apache as a whole and 19% to 22% in the U.S. over the next three years, which will be accompanied by very solid returns. This growth will be driven almost entirely by the Permian, which we project to grow at a compound rate of 26% to 28%.","Our international operations in Egypt and the North Sea will continue to be free cash contributors. For the last two years, we have been investing below our $700 million to $900 million maintenance capital rate. As a result, we have seen international production volumes decline. And for now, we anticipate they will continue on a shallow decline rate, given our planned investment levels. In the North Sea, however, we do anticipate improving capital efficiency, as our high day rate contract on the Ocean Patriot semi-submersible rolls down to a significantly lower rate in mid-2018. We feel good about the long-term strategic direction of Egypt and the North Sea, and industry activity is picking up in both regions.","I'd like to take a few minutes now and focus specifically on our three-year Permian Basin investment plan. As you know, Apache has one of the largest acreage footprints in the Permian, and it is our largest-producing region. From 2018 to 2020, we plan to invest approximately two-thirds of our upstream capital in the Permian, consisting of $2.5 billion in Alpine High and $2.5 billion in the Midland Basin, other Delaware Basin, and Central Basin Platform combined. Outside of Alpine High, we will focus our capital program on horizontal oil drilling in the Midland and Delaware Basins and on moderating our Central Basin Platform decline rate through water flood and EOR projects.","With the advancements made over the last three years that Tim discussed, the capital program in these areas is becoming both more efficient and more productive. We have the inventory to significantly increase this investment level, especially in the Midland Basin, if our objective was to simply maximize short-term oil growth. However, a deeper understanding of multi-zone reservoir dynamics on a section level will lead to much more economic full development decisions for the long term. This section-level approach requires the collection and analysis of massive amounts of data to fully understand the complex, inter-well, inter-zone physics.","Our current rig and completion pace allow sufficient time to collect and analyze this data and design and implement optimal spacing and pattern configurations across our acreage position. After we complete this important work, then we will look to accelerate our Permian development pace in the context of available cash flow.","With nearly all of our key Midland Basin acreage held by production, we have the luxury of utilizing time and technology to ensure long-term value maximization of our Permian acreage. The industry is just beginning to understand the dynamics of downspacing, inter-well and cross-landing zone communications, and long-term reservoir performance of multi-well pads. Apache's goal is to stay at the forefront of that understanding.","Turning to Alpine High, Apache has the unique opportunity to advance a low-cost greenfield play of enormous scale. We are confident it will become a long-term, high -return, free cash flow generating asset for decades to come. In the context of today's commodity price, we acknowledge that funding a wet gas play is a bit contrarian, but it is justified by the long-term scale and return potential, even at lower gas prices.","With 340,000 contiguous net acres, up to 6,000 feet of hydrocarbon columns spanning the full range from dry gas to oil, relatively high permeability, low clay content, and generally over-pressured true organic shale formations, the potential of the play is very compelling.","Our investment plan for Alpine High upstream over the next three years assumes an average of 6.5 rigs in 2018, increasing to 10 rigs in 2020. During 2018, approximately 50% of the drilling program will focus on wrapping up the primary phase of delineation and testing. The rest of the three-year drilling program can be roughly split 50:50 between retention drilling and impact development drilling.","The key to success for Alpine High will be its cost structure, both on a capital and operational basis. We have already made great progress on drilling costs. But over time, well design optimization, pad drilling, and pattern development are expected to drive Alpine High's average completed well cost down into the $4 million to $6 million range, resulting in very attractive F&D costs.","The Woodford, Barnett, and Pennsylvanian source rock are also true shales, which means they contain little to no in situ formation water. With minimal water handling costs, Alpine High will have extremely low operating costs.","We are projecting a steady decrease in lease operating expenses over the next three years to less than $2 per BOE by the end of 2020, excluding gathering, processing, and transport fees. This is a major difference between Alpine High and other sweet spot Delaware Basin plays that we believe is vastly underappreciated.","In addition to low costs, revenue uplift from oil and liquids in the wet gas portion of the play will contribute to strong cash margins. Together with the low F&D costs, this will drive very competitive recycle ratios compared to those generated by other Permian Basin operations.","2018 will be another key step in the transition of Alpine High from delineation and testing to full development mode. The build-out of the infrastructure backbone will continue through 2018 and into 2019. There will be times when we need to shut in production to commission new facilities, to upgrade or expand existing facilities, or to reroute product flows. The infrastructure build-out also comes with inherently unpredictable timing risks associated with weather, surface use agreements, and third-party engineering, procurement, and construction vendor delays.","Drilling at Alpine High will progress at a steady and increasingly efficient pace as we transition to more pad development, while the turn-in line schedule for larger pads will periodically drive significant waves of new production capacity.","Midstream installation and commissioning, in parallel with the drilling program migrating to more multi-well pads, will create significant lumpiness to the near-term production profile. As I mentioned earlier, Alpine High production in the fourth quarter of 2017 was 20,000 BOEs a day net to Apache. By 2020, average daily production is expected to be between 160,000 and 180,000 BOEs a day, which represents a compound annual growth rate in excess of 150%.","Our forecast has certain embedded assumptions for improved capital efficiency and productivity that are common with new resource plays. We believe these assumptions are conservative relative to improvements the industry has seen in other unconventional plays such as the SCOOP\/STACK, Utica, and Marcellus, so there is meaningful upside from this forecast. We are still very early in the unfolding of Alpine High, and there is much learning still to occur.","In terms of production mix, fourth quarter 2017 volumes at Alpine High were comprised of 83% gas, 10% NGLs, and 7% oil. In our three-year outlook, we are conservatively forecasting the oil percentage to remain relatively flat, as our drilling program will be weighted toward deeper drilling for retention purposes. However, there are many avenues by which the oil mix should increase. And I anticipate we will see many updated views on the oil mix in the future.","In terms of the NGL mix, our first cryogenic processing facility will be commissioned in 2019. At that point the percentage of NGLs in the production stream will begin to ramp up. And in 2020 should be around 30% of total Alpine High volumes on a BOE basis.","Going forward, there are three primary program milestones to monitor. The first is well cost reductions in the development program. As we transition more of the drilling program to pads and patterns, completed well costs should improve over time and eventually land in our $4 million to $6 million target range.","Second is improving well productivity in the development program. As we drill and complete more wells, you should see the learning curve benefit of more productive wells over time.","And the third is expansion of the drilling inventory through the delineation and testing program. As we further test the Crest, Southern Flank, and the shallower zones of the play, we anticipate increasing the number of wet gas and oil locations significantly.","Alpine High has all the makings of a great resource play. And Apache is fortunate to have such a commanding acreage position. Investing in Alpine High is arguably a gas and NGL proposition for the near-term investment horizon. We realize we are often held to the comparative conventional wisdom of Permian Basin, especially Delaware oil plays. But we believe that a hydrocarbon agnostic evaluation of this play is the right approach.","Full cycle returns will be determined not only by top line revenue, but importantly, by cost structure as well. With respect to the former, we believe the macro environment is setting up very nicely for gas and NGL producers, as the important drivers like the Gulf Coast pet-chem build-out, LNG exports, and Mexican demand accelerate as we enter the next decade.","In terms of costs, we are confident the geological attributes, such as continuous and contiguous transgressive sequence, high organic content, over-pressured geologic settings, and the operating simplicity that comes from low water cuts will result in Alpine High being highly competitive with, if not ultimately superior to, other leading Permian Basin plays from a full cycle return standpoint. And ultimately, that is what Apache is about, generating and sustaining leading full cycle returns.","It will take time to bring clarity to the full potential of Alpine High in terms of resource and production profile. And this clarity will only come through investment. We are confident though that it will be a game changer for Apache and provide a powerful complement to the rest of our portfolio.","I will now turn the call over to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We'll pause for just a moment. The first question will come from John Herrlin with Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale.","John P. Herrlin - Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale","Yes. Thanks. Regarding your Midland well pads, John, how many wells per pad? And is the 1.5 to 2-mile length ideal? Is that your optimal horizontal length for those wells?","John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.","Yeah, John. Thank you. First off, we brought on three half-section pads. And a lot of those were 8 and 10 wells, so we're testing multiple zones and the patterns there, and it's really important. I mean we'll be watching those wells now over time. We've got a couple of other \u2013 we've got a pad coming on in the first quarter, as we said, of 2018. And some others planned in 2018, which will help us with that.","Right now, 1.5-to-2-mile is probably optimal. And a lot of that hinges on your land position. So we've had to do some work to kind of be able to block up some trades, to be able to drill those longer laterals.","But I do think that the 1.5-to-2-mile laterals are going to be optimal for now. And obviously we're watching the spacing. I think that's one of the big keys is getting this spacing right. As you know, you can't take back wells you drill. And we've seen some instances where others have plowed ahead and are over-drilling. And now you're seeing a lot of interference.","And so I think it's important to take the time, effort, collect the data, and do the science to make sure you get those patterns and spacing tests right to maximize the long-term returns.","John P. Herrlin - Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale","With respect to the data gathering and all that, how much incrementally or how much has that been for the well costs or the pad development costs, the technology that you're focused on?","John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.","Well, we had a pad where we ran fiber on all the wells. We ended up spending a couple million dollars there ultimately, because of how we collected it. We also had seismic crews out there. And we actually collected true seismic data in between each stage.","So we've done a lot of things, John, where we've invested that money. But when you look at the grand scheme of things, that relative to just one well that you over-drill is money well spent. So I mean it's worth taking the time and making sure we do this right.","John P. Herrlin - Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale","Great. That's really it for me. Thanks.","John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","The next question will come from Bob Brackett with Bernstein.","Robert Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hi, guys. Question on the U.S. non-Permian, non-Alpine High. If I kind of take your guidance and back out what it implies for U.S. non-Permian, it's kind of under-investment, like a decline. If I look at the Permian outside of Alpine High, it looks like you guys basically keep it flat through 2020. Is that about right?","John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.","When you look at the capital program with where we are today, Bob, yes. We are spending very little outside the non-Permian capital. I think you're actually going to see though, that it's \u2013 with the investment that's come off of the last three years, it's not going to decline a whole lot. In fact, our Mid-Continent stuff will actually grow with just the five wells we brought on in the SCOOP this year. So we're in a pretty good spot there. But, yes, very little capital there for 2018.","Now as we get out past a couple of years and we start generating a lot of free cash flow from Alpine High, we see that changing quickly. And so we like having the optionality there in those assets.","And right now in the other Permian, it's close, a little more than maintenance. But it's really more designed at going at the right pace there. As I mentioned too in the Midland Basin, I mean we've shown \u2013 if you look at the results, the back half of 2017, as I mentioned in the script, we peaked in the fourth quarter of 2015. And then we really shut the programs down, reset the cost structure. Bottomed second quarter of last year. And then quickly in a matter of two quarters made a new production high.","So really it's an off\/on switch. It takes a couple of quarters. But it shows you the quality and the progress that we've made in terms of being able to apply that capital to the other Permian assets.","Robert Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","And if you have those assets that other people would voraciously drill, at what point do you say that those belong in somebody else's hands? Or to your point, do you keep them for future optionality?","John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.","Well, we just have to weigh the value of that. I mean we look at the portfolio. We work the portfolio very hard. Last year we made a strategic decision to exit Canada, which we're very glad we did. I think one of the things that gets lost in there is that we eliminated $800 million of ARO, but that was a big strategic decision for us.","We also unloaded some acreage that we felt like we got some very \u2013 prices for. And is exactly that. Something that somebody placed a high enough premium on that we felt like it would be better in their hands. So you're always looking at those things and weighing those things. And we continue to do that in the future.","Robert Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay, thanks.","John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.","Thank you.","[Technical Difficulty] (59:22 \u2013 59:31)","Operator","Jeffrey, your line is open.","Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Thanks. On the multi-year plan, you mentioned the 10% service cost inflation. Can you talk through some of the other assumptions, specifically what commodity prices you're underwriting? And if you're including any expected efficiencies or productivity improvements?","John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.","On the service side, yes. As Tim said, we have most of our big ticket items \u2013 rigs, frac crews, sand \u2013 under contract and tied up for the foreseeable future. So we feel good about the main services.","But we are seeing the smaller things that drive the day to day, trucking, simple as the backhoes, pads. Everybody is wanting to raise costs everywhere. So we did bake in, in general, a 10% rise. Now when you look at some efficiencies at \u2013 and then we kind of took each play, play by play. As Tim told you, in 2017 we were able to reduce our Midland Basin well cost by 20% on a treated lateral foot basis and increase productivity by 17%.","So we've taken those kind of play by play into account. The greatest efficiencies we'll see at Alpine High is we're early in that play and really starting to move into pads. And then less in the more mature plays, where we've drilled more wells.","And so we've got a pretty conservative forecast on the capital side going into this year. And what I don't want to be is in a couple quarters, having to raise my capital, because I assumed that we could keep things down when the reality is there's a lot of pressure out there on a lot of different fronts.","Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","I appreciate that detail. And then I guess on the commodity price assumptions through the three-year timeframe. Just trying to get a good sense of what's under-written, when Steve talked about cash flow neutrality and the upstream piece this year, for example, and just how that might evolve over time.","Stephen J. Riney - Apache Corp.","Yeah, Jeff. So obviously, there's lots of conversation out there today about cash flow neutrality and pricing assumptions and what pricing assumptions people ought to use. And obviously I think that the last few years have demonstrated how important we believe cash flow neutrality is. And we've said that many, many times that we ought to be able to live within our means.","I think it's important that we actually acknowledge there are lots of different definitions out there about cash flow neutrality. There are lots of different methods that people use to talk about that. Some include dividends, some don't include dividends. Some actually go so far as to include asset sales. And some have some capital structure changes, all contributing to cash flow neutrality.","Just to be clear, we take a very, maybe extremely pure approach, because we believe cash flow neutrality means that with no asset sales and with no changes to debt or equity, that you should end the year with the same amount of cash on hand that you began the year with. And that's a very pure definition. I'm not sure there's a more accurate definition of cash flow neutrality. If there is, I'd like to know what that is.","So with that said, our plan for 2018 and beyond, what we talked about today around \u2013 or I talked about around 2018, is so the midstream is obviously operating at an out-spend, about a $500 million deficit. That doesn't \u2013 that's regardless of what price assumption that you might use. And there's obviously \u2013 there's some reasons that some of that might go away.","And what I talked about is that the upstream, which is everything else in Apache, including dividends, that that would be cash flow neutral at current pricing is what I said, which is about $60. $60 $61, WTI's current pricing I believe, unless something's happened on the call.","So we would be cash flow neutral at around that type of price assumption. We believe we could also be cash flow neutral down into the upper $50s. We're working on a number of things that could help us do that.","In terms of pricing in our plan, we've actually run numerous price scenarios, all of them lower than $60. We've reviewed many of these with the board. And just a couple weeks ago, we actually agreed our plan for this year with the board, and that was at a price of $58 WTI. Obviously at that price there would be a small cash flow deficit in the upstream to go with the midstream deficit.","And I think that \u2013 I think with the information that we've now provided around the plan and with the supplement around price sensitivity, around the hedge positions, we've given you lots of details. You understand cash flow sensitivity relative to movements in oil price or gas price. You see the details on our hedge positions, which obviously affect cash flow sensitivity as cash flow \u2013 as price moves down.","And I think \u2013 so I think most of the data there, to meet any modeling requirements that you might have, to understand how cash flow changes as commodity prices move up or move down.","The only word of warning that I would give you on that is that if you start moving too far off of this, our plan at $58 or current pricing at around $60, you start moving too far off of that either to the upside or the downside, then the current plan, all of the other elements of the plan actually begin losing relevance. Number one, we have our hedges in place, so you've got that.","Number two, I think the simple math on cash flows due to price isn't really adequate. Because when you start moving well below that $58 or $60 current pricing or well above it, then all of the other assumptions inherent in the plan begin to change. All of the things around cost inflation assumptions that we've made, the actual activity set that we would engage in, the actual capital allocations that we would make, all of those change as you move far off of that plan.","So we set ours at \u2013 we set the plan with the board at $58. And we think that's actually somewhat irrelevant. The current pricing, $60 to $61, we would be cash flow neutral in that upstream or everything outside of the Midland \u2013 or the midstream, which is about a $500 million deficit.","Unknown Speaker","Thank you.","Stephen J. Riney - Apache Corp.","Yeah, all of that, just to be clear, again, that all includes the dividend.","Unknown Speaker","Understood. Appreciate all the color there as well. Thanks.","Operator","The next question is from Charles Meade with Johnson Rice.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Good afternoon, John, to you and your whole team there.","John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.","Good afternoon, Charles.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Thank you, John. I want to go back to something that you spent some time on in your prepared comments. And I'm hoping you can perhaps add a little bit more. And that's the discussion around the \u2013 said maybe the balance of returns between your Alpine High and say your Midland asset. And it sounded like you were saying in the short term, perhaps a better return is available in the Midland Basin. But if you widen the perspective a bit and look at the longer term trajectory in Alpine High, that actually that's going to deliver better returns to Apache shareholders.","I wonder is that the right way to interpret your comments? And if so what is the timeframe where maybe there's a breakover that Alpine...","John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.","Well, first thing is the returns in both programs are excellent, so it's really not a return difference thing, Charles. The point was we could increase short-term oil by going much quicker in the Midland Basin today or some of the other Delaware Basin stuff today.","The point was in the Midland and the Delaware, we're gathering a bunch of data by moving to the pads and the pattern spacing tests. And that's really, really important data that we're collecting right now.","And quite frankly, you want to \u2013 the market has gotten conditioned to thinking that early performance in IPs is a direct correlation to EURs, which is just not the case. You have to look at how these wells perform and how these pads perform over a longer time, and especially as you start to look at the inside wells and so forth.","So in our Midland program, we've actually brought on three brand new half-section pads late last year, which we're going to critically watch. And they're a little different configurations and we collected a lot of data. So there are two elements there. What my point was is we could accelerate the short-term oil over the longer-term investment at Alpine High.","At Alpine High, you have a totally different animal, though. You have 6,000 feet of hydrocarbon column. We've got a 70-mile fairway, 340,000 acres that we control, multiple zones. We've now proven over 11 different landing zones across just the vertical column, and there's many, many more as we work through that. So it takes time. We're moving the infrastructure forward. And most of that's geared to the wet gas infrastructure that we have to have to process that and get put in place.","And so when we look at advancing that over time and then you just look at the velocity at which we'll be able to reinvest that capital because of the F&D and because of the turnover and the returns, from a longer-term perspective, what's in our best interest now is advancing the Alpine High at this pace and the Midland Basin at the pace we're at.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Okay, got it. I think that makes sense, John. And then this is more just a rifle shot question. The Dogwood and Elbert State pads, your Alpine High pads that you gave us some results on, I believe you gave us the oil cut. But what was the \u2013 if you could, give us an idea of the NGL yield on those.","John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.","No, the Dogwood pad we said is in the dry gas. I think the thing that's very exciting about that is that's a six-well pad that's on 660-foot spacing. And quite frankly, that's a heck of a lot tighter than what our location counts would be today. So the performance there is very encouraging. And it could lead to an increase in numbers of well counts, because it's performing very, very nicely.","But the Dogwood is in the dry gas. And as we mentioned, we've got six wells on. They're 660-foot spacing, and they're currently making over 75 million [cubic feet] a day, and have already made 2 Bcf in a very short term while they were cleaning up. So it's really the first true pad and pattern. And it's validating the organics. This is a true shale. And so you're seeing great response from the first pad.","The Elberts are shallower. And there you see the liquid yield goes up. Those are still cleaning up as well. It's a two-well pad. I think the key there was we got the cost down. And what you're seeing there is the liquid yield. And that will be wet gas too as it moves up. So I don't know, Tim, do you have the NGL yield on the Elberts?","Timothy J. Sullivan - Apache Corp.","This is high BTU gas. And under the cryo, it's going to be in the 140 barrel per million range of a typical wet gas well.","John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.","And it's about 60 barrels a million right now of oil too, correct?","Timothy J. Sullivan - Apache Corp.","Correct.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Great, that's what I was looking for. Thanks, Tim, and thanks, John.","John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.","Thank you, Charles.","Operator","The next question will come from Michael Hall with Heikkinen Energy.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Thanks. I guess first on the trajectory of Alpine High in the three-year outlook, I'm just curious. Should we think about that as basically filling up infrastructure as you go, or do you have remaining infrastructure capacity to continue growth beyond that timeframe?","John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.","No, Michael, it's a pretty conservative plan. It's really based on retention, half the capital going to retention. We will be ahead of that. I said we would end the year at about 830 million a day of inlet processing capacity at the end of this year. And the volumes we have on that outlook don't fill that up. So we've got a lot of capacity there. And quite frankly, I think there's room for the picture to improve greatly as time marches on this year, both in terms of the volumes as well as the liquid content and the oil content as we test more of the zones and go forward there.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","And in what timeframe does the Alpine High project as a whole go from being in an investment phase where there's an outspend, including the midstream, to \u2013 let's just set aside monetization, but to a free cash flow phase where you're actually harvesting the cash flows from the program?","John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.","We look at it \u2013 probably the best way to put this to you is on a rig line basis. A single rig line is going to turn cash flow positive in less than two years. And so if we hold the rig lines constant, you'll see it turn pretty quickly. So that's how we think about it.","We laid out the capital on the midstream was (1:14:04) $500 million last year. We said $500 million this year and then $250 million, $250 million. So it starts scaling down. So then it really comes down to the pace on those rig lines.","But you're going to see this thing start throwing off a tremendous amount of cash in less than a two-year window per rig line.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Okay. And then last on my end is just around the cost structure. I was just looking year on year at the LOE cost guide. It's up despite adding a pretty large wedge of what I would think is pretty low-cost gas. What's going on there that's not driving a reduction in LOE per unit? And should we anticipate a reduction over the longer timeframe within the three-year outlook?","John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.","There's no doubt that, as we mentioned in there, the per-barrel numbers are going to come down on Alpine High. Some of that's with starting to put various things in the LOE lines that hadn't been there prior. Some of it is when we pored our plan, our guys have taken a pretty conservative approach for what LOE looks like right now just because of the pressure we're getting for everywhere to raise the small things.","So I think there's room, as we have historically done, to work on those numbers and beat those numbers. But it's probably just a little bit with this price environment changing so dynamically, that and the timing of some pads and some things coming on that is driving that. But there's no doubt over time the LOE per BOE for the Permian is going to come down significantly as Alpine High ramps up.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","And at the corporate level, should we see that by 2019 you think, or more time?","Stephen J. Riney - Apache Corp.","Yes, this is Steve. So I think that a lot of that will depend on what happens with the midstream at Alpine High. Because John made reference to what we believe the LOE per BOE at Alpine High will be in his prepared remarks. That was excluding the midstream costs.","And today, all of the midstream costs show up, or the operating costs for that show up as LOE. And obviously, as you're building that out, you're building out capacity and starting it up and operating it below its actual true capacity, in some cases and for some periods of time well below its true capacity. You're going to have a pretty high cost per BOE going through that.","Two things will change that, number one, just ramping it up to a larger scale and really getting it ramped up to efficient activity. But also eventually what's going to happen, or at least I would anticipate will happen, is that the midstream assets become part of a midstream enterprise separate from Apache. And depending on the accounting treatment of that, the structure of it and control and ownership, you could see all those costs move over to gathering and transportation, which will be more of a typical third-party type of transport and processing fee as opposed to LOE. But that's going to have a meaningful impact, especially on 2018, the startup and operations of that midstream enterprise.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","All right. Look forward to seeing how it all progresses. Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Good afternoon.","John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.","Hey, Brian.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","With the three-year outlook on Alpine High to get to 160,000 to 180,000 BOE a day, fully recognizing that production mix is different from value, can you just give us the update on your expectations for the oil versus NGLs versus gas split in 2020?","And then on the gas piece, what are your expectations for how much will go beyond the local market in 2020? I think you referenced the Gulf Coast Express Pipeline as one option, but maybe you could quantify that a little bit more.","John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.","in the prepared remarks, we said fourth quarter, you were 83% gas, 10% NGLs, and 7% oil. And we said in my prepared remarks by 2020 that the oil, we assume the oil will remain about constant. And the NGL volume's going to grow to about 30%.","So you're going to be more like 63% gas, that's probably then going to be two-thirds to \u2013 or more wet gas to dry gas with a heavy 30% NGL. And then we've assumed a 7% oil mix. But I believe that's pretty conservative. And that's \u2013 as I mention right now, our plan is geared more towards retention and what we see without the ability to be able to drill more at the other locations. So that's how that'll transition. And...","Stephen J. Riney - Apache Corp.","And on the marketing side, we've got a lot of activities actually underway here, a lot of parts that we're working on. We're continuing to contract gas at or around Waha or near our assets. We're continuing to work on contracting gas down on the Gulf Coast, where we now have the capacity to transport 500 million a day starting in 2019. So we're working on marketing contracts at the Gulf Coast from that point forward.","And then we're continuing to look at more gas opportunities as well as \u2013 for the longer term, as well as oil and NGLs. And so I think there's still a lot of work to do on the marketing side, both physically moving product and also selling that product or downstream products from those products.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you. And then shifting to the other side of the world, there was some news earlier this week of some contracts signed to move natural gas into Egypt in a couple years out, at a price ostensibly greater than what Apache receives for its gas. I realize that Apache's price is probably a blend of a number of contracts and concessions. But how prominent are the opportunities to grow gas production on your concessions? And how interested would you be in investing or monetizing that in some other way?","John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.","I mean there are definitely opportunities to move that forward. I mean I think we just added 40% to our acreage footprint. Most of our revenue comes from the oil side, quite frankly. And the way a lot of our concessions are structured and so forth, some of those prices are set.","The Egyptian government has been very flexible and willing to step in and structure things that would encourage some development of some different types of things. So I think you'll see us continue to do that. And if it makes economic sense in relation to the oil that we're developing over there, we will do that.","In general, we applaud the contracts to bring the gas in. I think it's a good thing for Egypt and the country and actually, it's very beneficial to us. So we're happy to see what's happening, both in the deepwater with the gas developments there as well as bringing in the gas that was recently announced.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great, thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Leo Mariano with MetAlliance (1:21:37).","Unknown Speaker","Yes, hey guys. Just in terms of the Alpine High midstream monetization, recognize that it sounds like you guys are still contemplating various avenues here. But just try and think of it from a high level perspective. Is this likely to be an event you think that's going to come later in 2018, or more of a 2019 event?","John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.","It could come any time in 2018 I would guess. I'll be honest with you. We made a lot of progress. We've had some inbound proposals that are fairly attractive. There's a tremendous amount of interest. And quite frankly, I think there's a lot of folks out there that realize this is going to be one of the most critical pieces of infrastructure in the Delaware Basin. And so I'm very optimistic that we'll be able to get something done and something that'll be very, very strategic for Apache.","Unknown Speaker","All right, that's very helpful. And then just looking at kind of the Alpine High project and thinking about some of the splits that you threw out there in terms of hydrocarbon mix. You certainly talked about strong rates of return for your shareholders here.","Just wanted to kind of think about some sensitivities there. Have you guys looked at kind of some of the downside cases, where if say you're getting $2 for the gas over the next three years and $20 for the NGLs, does the project still have kind of the right hurdle rates for Apache?","John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.","It \u2013 the beauty of it is, is with the wet gas, you don't need the gas. Now you got a scenario where you have really low NGL prices and really \u2013 I mean obviously, as under a scenario where all commodity prices go way down, then it's a different story.","But this thing's going to really hum below $2 on the gas side. And I think with what's going on on the Gulf Coast, with the expansion that's taken place in the petrochemical end, we look out to 2019, 2020, 2021, and we see a pretty robust NGL market, as well as the ability to get the gas to the Gulf Coast.","So it's what sets this play apart is the cost structure. And ultimately, it's the cost to drill the wells that's going to be superior and the deliverability. And it's that combination with the liquid yields and the oil production is what makes it unique. And quite frankly that's what we know makes it differential.","And the other factor is you're not going to have to move a lot of water in the lower zones. And that's another very differentiating fact.","But, yes, we've run many cases on the downside. We would not be making this type of investment on the midstream or the upstream side if we thought there was a sensitivity that was close to anything that would come into making it not work under very, very low gas and NGL and oil prices.","Unknown Speaker","Thanks, guys.","Operator","The final question is from Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Oh, hi. Good afternoon, everybody. Thanks for squeezing me in. John, you've given a fairly robust defense of the Alpine High in terms of the returns, the cost structure, and so on. And certainly, the production growth looks pretty impressive.","Can you give us an idea of what you anticipate the cash flow growth to look like under your planning assumptions matching that? Because obviously it's going to be a function of basis differential and the prevailing gas price at that time. So what are your planning assumptions as you see going through 2020 in terms of cash flow growth?","John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.","I think as you get out longer term and you see the expansion in the infrastructure that we see as being built and will be built, we don't see Waha continuing to trade at a big discount on down the road, because that will be solved. Part of it starts with the Kinder [Morgan] Gulf Coast Express Pipeline in 2019 and so forth.","So I mean historically, Waha has traded at a, call it, $0.10 to $0.20 discount. Over the long haul, you're probably going to be in a $0.35 to $0.50 transportation cost differential at worst. You could \u2013 some scenarios actually see Waha become a premium, depending on what happens ultimately with Mexico and so forth and the West Coast.","So we think, try to think, longer term with a project like this. We realize it's a little disruptive. If you look at last year when we were putting in a lot of our hedges, we were a lot of the market at Waha. And a lot of the reason why that differential is where it is today. We recognize that.","So any time you bring on a world class play that's going to be a little bit disruptive, you've got to go through that time period till you can see through it. But I think as we get out to the timing, when we start to see the cash flows really ramp up here, the beauty of it is we will be solving some of the short-term obstacles that would stand in its way initially.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I appreciate the answer. My follow-up, I'm afraid, is a midstream question also. Because obviously this is a fairly pivotal event if you are able to get something done this year. Your CapEx guide assumes $500 million for midstream. And forgive me if I'm wrong. I think you had indicated you might see the same spend next year also. Are you pretty much done after that in terms of midstream build-out? And if you did manage to find a structure for the midstream, would that capital move off your balance sheet onto another entity, let's say?","John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.","Yeah. Well, first of all, next year's spend, we didn't guide to $500 million. We said it would be $500 million this year and $500 million in 2019 and 2020, split evenly amongst those two years. So you're really $500 million, $250 million, $250 million is terms of how we see it.","But absolutely, Doug. We envision moving the future CapEx spend into the entity, where it will be able to do its own thing. So that would be the plan. And we're very confident we're going to be able to do something. I mean it...","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Really helpful. Thanks a lot, John. Thanks, guys.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time.

The supplement also includes information on our capital expenditures for the quarter, as well as a chart that illustrates cash sources and uses and reconciles Apache's change in net debt during 2014.","Our earnings release, the accompanying financial tables and non-GAAP reconciliations and our quarterly earnings supplement can all be found on our website at www.apachecorp.com. I'd like to remind everybody that today's discussion will contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions based on our current views and most reasonable expectations. However, a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from what we discussed today. A full disclaimer is located with the supplemental data on our website.","This morning we reported a fourth quarter 2014 loss of $4.8 billion or $12.78 per diluted share. These results contain several non-cash charges primarily related to the impact of declining oil and gas prices, acreage impairments, the announced disposition of our LNG assets and changes in foreign tax estimates and assumptions.","Adjusted earnings, which excludes certain items that impact the comparability of results totaled $404 million or $1.07 per diluted share. Cash flow from operations before changes in working capital totaled $2.1 billion during the quarter.","Worldwide reported net production averaged 673,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, with liquids production constituting 62% of that total. On a pro forma basis, which excludes assets that have been divested, non-controlling interests, and tax barrels in Egypt, our fourth quarter worldwide production was 609,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. This represents an 8% increase from the third quarter and a 12% increase from the same period a year ago.","I would now like to turn the call over to John Christmann.","John J. Christmann","Thank you, Gary. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. I would like to start by saying a few words about our long-time Chairman, CEO and President, Steve Farris. Steve announced last month that he would be retiring from Apache following more than two decades of leadership. During his tenure he helped grow the Company to one of the largest and most successful independents in the world. I would like to personally thank Steve for his service and am honored to be his successor as the new CEO and President of Apache.","In 2010, Steve initiated a strategic repositioning to bring Apache's primary focus back to North America. As we showed you at our November North American update, 2014 was a milestone year for this transformation. We streamlined and enhanced our North American portfolio and we added significant new unconventional capabilities. We now have a deeper and more predictable inventory of economic locations in North America than at any time in Apache's history.","Our drilling production and inventory is oil prone and located in areas with multiple stack pay horizons, which we believe creates a significant long-term competitive advantage. We have the right teams, processes, and science in place to efficiently develop our existing Resource and to build future opportunities. In response to the rapid drop in oil price, we have purposely taken quick and decisive action to reduce our drilling activity, well costs, G&A and lease operating expenses.","This will position us more favorably and make us a more efficient Operator in the future. A top strategic priority for Apache during 2014 was to sell our Wheatstone and Kitimat LNG assets. I am pleased to note that the sale of these assets, which we announced in December is on track to close by the end of the first quarter. Including capital cost reimbursement, estimated proceeds from this transaction will be approximately $3.7 billion, which we will use initially to pay down debt.","Our operations in Egypt and the North Sea provide a very nice complement to our North American production and cash flow. Cash flow from Egypt and the North Sea has less than 50% of the downside sensitivity to oil prices as our North American operations. Importantly, both regions are still expected to generate free cash flow in 2015 at current strip pricing.","Apache\u2019s Egypt and North Sea operations offer steady, high rate of return projects, and the portfolio diversification benefits of these regions becomes evident during oil price downturns like the one we are currently experiencing. While we always leave open the option to adjust any part of our portfolio in response to changing conditions, we are not currently proceeding with a sale or spinoff of Egypt or the North Sea.","With regard to Australia, we are taking a close look at the potential monetization of our remaining non-LNG assets. The value of these assets is generally underpinned by long-term fixed price natural gas contracts, which we believe increases the universe of buyers and the potential valuation, even in this depressed oil price environment.","In summary, our portfolio is well positioned to weather the low oil price storm and I'm excited to have the opportunity set that lies before us today. Before we go to the fourth quarter results and outlook for 2015, I'll make a few comments about oil prices and the actions we have taken thus far in this fast moving price environment.","We cannot predict nor control the length or depth of this oil price correction, or the timing and extent of the rebound. We have therefore acted quickly and decisively regarding the things we can control. Our activity levels and cost structure.","During the third quarter of 2014, we operated 91 rigs onshore in North America. By the end of this month, we will have reduced our rig count to 27. On the pressure pumping side our frac crews are down more than 50% over the same time frame. In some instances we are choosing to lay down rigs that were under longer-term contract at day rates reflective of $100 oil price environment. As a result, we expect to pay some modest early termination penalties totaling approximately $50 million.","We are also delaying the completion of some wells in backlog until pressure pumping costs reset to levels that better reflect the current commodity price environment. Corporate cash flow is the main constraint on our 2015 drilling plans. We would consider using our balance sheet only to capitalize on lower acreage costs and other potential opportunities that may occur, rather than to drill wells and chase production in a depressed and volatile oil price environment.","Importantly, once we achieve the full benefit of lower well costs, our returns will be competitive at $50 per barrel of oil to those represented in our November North American update at $80 per barrel. The key difference is that we will simply have less cash flow to work with and will accordingly drill fewer wells. Additionally, we are diligently working through a dynamic scenario planning process that will allow us to quickly adapt our business and activity levels under a variety of potential commodity price case scenarios.","During the robust and relatively stable oil price environment over the last four years Apache was one of the most active drillers in North America. We grew our Permian Basin production by more total barrels at a faster rate than any of our peers. I\u2019m highly confident that when oil prices begin to recover and stabilize at higher levels we will efficiently ramp up our drilling programs in the Permian, Eagle Ford and Canyon Lime to deliver top-tier production and cash flow growth.","The recent oil price decline has been dramatic and almost unprecedented, but we believe that it will create a once in a decade opportunity for those of us that have moved aggressively. For Apache the oil price drop and subsequent industry slowdown has several positive aspects that we believe enhanced our ability to generate strong long-term shareholder returns.","The slowdown provides an opportunity for us to be come a more efficient company through focused initiatives such as realigning our North American incentive program to reward continuous improvement and cost discipline, creating medium and longer term field development plans and high grading and improving our drilling inventory, rationalizing and consolidating our acreage position, leveraging our surface operations infrastructure and scale, adding key acreage while there is less competition and at lower prices, and reducing our North American base production decline.","Regardless of how long oil prices remain depressed we plan to emerge in this downturn as a top-tier resource company in terms of drilling inventory, operational efficiency, cost structure and balance sheet strength.","Now let's talk about Apache\u2019s full-year 2014 results. Worldwide production on a pro forma basis grew 6.5% in 2014 which was right in the middle of our 5% to 8% guidance range. Absent some timing delays on the startup of our two large offshore Australian oil projects worldwide production would have been at the high end of our guidance range for 2014.","Onshore North American liquids production grew 18.6%which exceeded the high end of our 15% to 18% guidance range provided back in February of 2014. This strong performance was possible, because our high quality extensive drilling inventory in the Permian region enabled us to accelerate activity levels and production while at the same time we were seeing slower than expected growth and were recalibrating our capital program in the central region.","As a result North American liquids growth was driven by the Permian where production increased 25% from the prior year or approximately double the midpoint of the guidance we provided back in February. In the central region growth was essentially flat for the year, but despite a difficult first half played by weather and operational problems we were able to reduce our drilling programs significantly in the second half of the year while maintaining steady to slightly increasing production.","The North Sea and Egypt were ahead of plan, while Australia was a little behind plan due to timing delays Balnaves and Coniston oil projects. It was a good year for us internationally and we generated very strong free cash flow ex LNG spending.","Turning to our 2015 capital budget and production outlook, based on the midpoint of our capital guidance range we anticipate spending a total of $3.8 billion in 2015, which excludes potential lease hold purchases or acquisitions. Compared to 2014, this represents a 60% decrease in our capital spending.","We expect our pro forma onshore North American production to be roughly flat and our pro forma international and offshore production to be slightly up in 2015. Our Companywide 2015 pro forma production should be relatively unchanged from 2014. We believe this is a pretty good outcome given the extent we are reducing the capital program.","Turning to the fourth quarter regional review and our planned activity levels for 2015. I was very pleased our drilling results across the entire company. We had success in every region during the fourth quarter. Onshore North America delivered liquids production growth of 5% sequentially and 20% year-over-year when adjusted for asset divestitures. The Permian was once again our biggest growth driver and we exited the year with record production. We ran 42 rigs during the fourth quarter and we expect to have this down approximately 15 by the end of the month.","In 2015, we plan to average 10 to 12 rigs in the Permian approximately five of which will be in the Midland Basin, four in the Delaware Basin, and two rigs will be drilling high rate of return vertical and horizontal wells on the Central Basin platform in Northwest Shelf.","In the Central Region net production grew 3% sequentially during the quarter as we completed 72 gross wells in various legacy Anadarko Basin formations. You can see the results from some of these wells in our quarterly supplement where we highlight a few key contributors from the Granite Wash, Cottage Grove and Cleveland and Lower Marmaton.","As a result of taking a more measured approach in these legacy plays, we are seeing better-than-average well performance, better returns, and much better capital efficiency. During most of 2015, we plan to keep one rig running in the Anadarko Basin. In the Canyon Lime, no new wells were brought online during the fourth quarter; however we just started to flow back our first four well pad in the Canyon Lime and will have some flow rates to report there in the near future.","In the Eagle Ford, our rig count peaked at 12 in December and by end of this month will be down to four. By mid-year we plan to have one to two rigs working in the Eagle Ford and are prepared to ramp back up quickly if oil prices allow. The Eagle Ford is an excellent example of our cost initiatives driving positive returns in this depressed price environment.","Our initial wells in Area B of the play were running in excess of $8 million. If you'll recall back in our November North American update, we projected 2015 well costs would average around $7 million. With lower service costs and further design improvements, we think we'll have these wells down closer to $6 million within a few months, which depending on their oil cut, they can deliver solid economics and strip prices. In Area A, where we should generally have better economics, we have a backlog of 20 or so wells that we will be bringing on over the course of the year.","Apache is progressing its understanding of the Eagle Ford petroleum system and will update you later this year as we gather more data. We plan to continue consolidating acreage around our core position.","To sum it up, we're drilling better wells at lower cost and continue to expand our understanding of this compelling play. In Canada, we are finishing up a three-rig drilling program in the Duverney and Montney plays this spring and will release the rigs for the remainder of the year. We plan to complete a seven-well pad in the Duverney in the third quarter and in the Montney we continue to develop a long term solution to process future Montney gas production.","We are making progress reducing drilling and completion costs in Canada. Canadian production averaged 72,300 BOEs a day during the fourth quarter, which is a decrease of 1% sequentially from the third quarter. Given minimal planned activity during 2015, we anticipate that production will decline from fourth quarter levels.","Turning to our international operations, all three of our regions, the North Sea, Egypt and Australia, delivered profitable production growth and remain on track to generate significant free cash flow for the year. In Egypt, we made two oil discoveries during the quarter. While additional appraisal work is under way, the Ptah and Berenice field discoveries appear to be two of Apache's largest oil field discoveries in Egypt over the last 15 years.","On a gross basis we expect Egypt will decline modestly in 2015, but our cost recovery mechanism there will result in a fairly significant increase in our net barrels. In the North Sea we delivered the strongest production numbers in the history of the region with a great rebound from the third quarter turnaround season. Coming off this high watermark and given the significant reduction in capital investments, we are starting to see natural declines kick in.","With the program we have planned we do expect North see will decline slightly in 2015 beginning in the first quarter. Lastly in Australia, we continue to make progress towards first oil at Coniston, which is expected to be online mid year.","I would now like to turn the call over to our interim CFO, Anthony Lannie, who will discuss in further detail our fourth-quarter non-cash earnings charges and provide guidance around first quarter 2015 North American production and CapEx.","P. Anthony Lannie","Thank you, John, and good afternoon. I would like to begin by providing some detail around our fourth quarter non-cash charges. As noted in this morning's press release, we reported an after-tax loss of $4.8 billion or $12.78 per share for the fourth quarter of 2014 as a result of several key non-recurring items. We incurred $2 billion in after-tax non- cash property write-downs related to full-cost ceiling impairments in the U.S. and North Sea.","Under full-cost accounting we are required to use trailing 12 month oil prices to calculate the PV-10 value of our reserves each quarter. Approximately half of the charges associated with the Company's full-cost ceiling test were driven by an impairment of acreage that we do not intend to drill. We recorded a $1.3 billion impairment of goodwill in the fourth quarter related to our U.S., North Sea and Canada reporting units. This is a function of prior-year acquisition values being valued under today's lower commodity price deck.","If oil prices do not recover materially from the current futures market price indication, the Company expects further impairments of the carrying value of its oil and gas properties throughout the remainder of 2015. The Company does not, however anticipate significant additional acreage or goodwill impairments in 2015.","In December 2014, we announced the sale of Apache's interest in the Kitimat and Wheatstone LNG projects along with associated upstream oil and gas assets, to Woodside Petroleum for $2.75 billion plus recovery of Apache's net expenditures made between June 30, 2014 and closing. Assets associated with the sale of our LNG facilities are classified as held-for-sale on the balance sheet.","Accounting rules require us to evaluate assets held-for-sale for impairment. Accordingly an impairment analysis was performed on these assets and an after-tax loss of $753 million was recognized in earnings. The full-cost upstream assets associated with this sale are excluded from held-for-sale accounting and no impairment was recorded, however. We do expect a non-cash charge upon closing of the sale.","Lastly, we incurred approximately $1 billion in non-cash deferred tax adjustments for the fourth quarter, primarily related to the U.S. GAAP rules pertaining to the measurement of income taxes on undistributed earnings in our international regions that we no longer consider to be permanently reinvested. The announced sale of our interest in the Kitimat and Wheatstone LNG projects and associated upstream assets was a key step in refocusing our portfolio and giving us more flexibility with capital allocation.","Additionally, during 2014 we completed the sale of our Argentina region, our deepwater Gulf of Mexico interest and several non-core assets across North America. In total for the year, we completed or announced sales of approximately $7 billion of assets worldwide, we intend to use the proceeds of the remaining sales to pay down debt and strengthen our balance sheet in this low price environment.","I would like to leave you with some guidance for our North American onshore operations in the 2015 first quarter. We currently project that quarter one North America onshore production will average between 300,000 and 305,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day which is down slightly from our record fourth quarter 2014 levels when adjusted for asset sales.","This slight decrease is attributable to the plan deferral of completions which John spoke about earlier couple with the impact of severe weather conditions during January. In the Permian region alone we experienced abnormal weather related down time of approximately 14-days in the first half of January. The estimated impact of this down time when spread across the quarter is roughly 3700 barrels of oil per day.","From a CapEx standpoint, we anticipate spending roughly $800 million in onshore North America during the first quarter which represent approximately 36% of our full year onshore North America budget. I should also note that our first quarter and full-year 2015 capital budget excludes approximately $300 million of estimated spending for LNG which we anticipate being reimbursed upon closing of the LNG sales this quarter. Our financial strategy for 2015 is to maintain a strong balance sheet and live within our cash flow in order to take advantage of opportunities quickly and efficiently once prices begin to recover.","I will now turn the call back over to the operator for question-and-answers.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of David R. Tameron of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","David R. Tameron","Hi, good morning. John, can you talk about \u2013 when we start thinking about the rig efficiency, obviously I know you\u2019re going to say everything you drill is good but some has got to be better than the others. So when I start thinking about productivity per rig and those type of metrics, what type of up lift do you think you'll see on the scale back?","John J. Christmann","Well I mean it\u2019s hard to put the percentage as an actual percentage, but clearly about slowing down on high grading, we will focus on our best wells, additionally we're going to be drilling wells, only wells that we really need to drill right now and the nice thing is a lot of our acreage is held, we don\u2019t have lease obligations we're worried about. So it\u2019s all about reducing the cost structure and improving the economics before we really speed up, but there is going to be efficiencies dialed in, I think that kind of goes into what the capital reduction that we've shown and where we are given guidance on the production levels.","David R. Tameron","Okay, one more for me and I'll let somebody else jump on. When I start thinking about the toggle and what you guys are looking for mid year, obviously you want service cost reductions. And you mentioned this, you alluded to this that your 2015 is more captive, your capital program is more constrained by your cash flow. What should we look for? What metrics should we be looking for on our end to try to guess when and if you decide to ramp?","John J. Christmann","Well, I mean the easy thing is we'll signal because we'll pick up rigs when we start to ramp, so but I mean there\u2019s two things. There\u2019s two parts that equation, one is a commodity price, but the bigger deal right now is cost structure and we made the decision to consciously and aggressively drop rigs, because the cost structure needs to come down for this price environment and we can always ramp back up, I mean you look at our depth of our portfolio in the Permian we showed we delivered 25% year-over-year growth, we got very, very deep high graded inventory. So it\u2019s going to easy to scale up, but the big deal as we've got to drive the cost structure down to reflect this current price environment.","David R. Tameron","Okay, thank you. I'll let somebody else jump on. I appreciate it.","John J. Christmann","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Pearce Hammond of Simmons & Company. Your line is open.","Pearce W. Hammond","Good afternoon, guys.","John J. Christmann","Hello.","Pearce W. Hammond","Hey, John, I was curious how you can reduce your North American rig count so sharply, yet keep production flat. Touching on the earlier question, is this due to greater efficiencies or well productivity? Or is it a backlog of drilled but not completed wells that you can work through this year? And then, if you stayed at an average of 17 rigs into 2016, do you think you'd keep production flat there? Or would it start to decline?","John J. Christmann","Well, I mean clearly we are able to drop quickly because we did not have a lot of committed contract or required location we had to drill. So we are able to scale back very quickly. We will come into 15 with a pretty deep backlog of wells and we have pushed a lot of those completions back, because quite honestly, we've got to get the completion cost to come in line as well.","So we are going to very methodically push those back. If I can defer those, see the benefits of lower completion costs and then bring those back on and potential higher price environment and later there is a big win there. As for what 16 looks like a lot of that\u2019s going to depend on where we are mid-year and what the program does. So we\u2019ve got the benefit this year of having a backlog of completions and we can spread those out and it's kind of how we planned it.","Pearce W. Hammond","And then, John, I know this question I'm about to ask is tied into what the cost structure is, but at what oil price would you be willing to accelerate the drill bit again?","John J. Christmann","Right now, the wells we're drilling are economic because we've been aggressively attacking the cost structure. As I mentioned in the script, our limitation is cash flow and we're wanting to put it, our cash flow to work in the best places, we don't feel right now that tapping the balance sheet to drill wells that we don't have to drill in this price environment or cost structure makes sense, so I think we've got a deep inventory and when the economics and more cash becomes available we will ramp back up.","Pearce W. Hammond","Great, and one last quick one for me. What level of service cost concessions are you currently experiencing? And how much do you think you can capture this year on a percentage basis?","John J. Christmann","I mean I'd say in general, if you look at our Eagle Ford and I alluded to that in the script, we showed cost in our November update of around $7 million, we're early last year we were North of eight, I can tell you we\u2019ve already reflective of old service costs, we just TD'd a well in the 6.5 range. We feel like we can get those well under six so we're already down 10% to 15%. We got now some things dialing in that's going to help our numbers go further, so with the drop in oil price being where it is I know a lot of our competitors are talking about just seeing 10% well cost reductions that's going to have to be more than that. We're seeing more than that.","Pearce W. Hammond","Thank you, very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Arun Jayaram of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Arun Jayaram","Good afternoon, John. I first wanted to ask you a little bit about the shape of the production profile in 2015. I guess you guided to 300,000 to 305,000 BOE. That suggests you'll stay relatively flat all year. Is that how we should think about it? Because what we don't know is how you plan to time the completions throughout the year?","John J. Christmann","Yes, Arun, with where Anthony alluded to first quarter being and where we\u2019re going to exit where we average it's pretty good assumption on how we are got it dialed in right now. Obviously first quarter is being impacted by the significant down time we've had already. First two weeks of January were very rough in the Permian and central so that's part of why you see more of a flat look because we've had a lot of down time early but we do have a lot of completions that we'll be able to bring on and obviously drilling better wells with the rigs we\u2019re going to be running too so I think that's probably a pretty reasonable view of how we\u2019d look at right now.","Arun Jayaram","Okay, the only thing that wasn't quite intuitive, you guys talked about spending $800 million in Q1 which is about 36% of your budget yet you're deferring completions, could you just maybe reconcile that a little bit, the timing of the spend?","P. Anthony Lannie","Sure. It's just simply we're coming in hot, plus we've got the LNG spend too that when that closes so you've got a combination, but you don't go from running 90 rigs to down to levels we're going to be and not have a hot spend early.","Arun Jayaram","Makes sense. Just a couple other quick ones. John, you alluded to $800 million of acreage acquisition costs in Q4. Can you give us some details on where you added the acreage?","John J. Christmann","We touched on that in November. I mean it was predominantly in our key areas. A lot of that was Eagle Ford and Canyon Lime and Permian and really within our core areas.","Arun Jayaram","Okay, and then my final one is on the international. In the slides, when you do the pro forma adjustment, you talk about the Australia asset sales and North Sea. I believe Australia's Balnaves. Can you give us some numbers around the magnitude of the sales at Balnaves and in the North Sea?","John J. Christmann","Well, I let Gary answer that one, Arun.","Gary T. Clark","Arun, we can say that the Scott, Telford and the Balnaves you are going to be in the 10,000 sort of type barrel range.","Arun Jayaram","Okay, thanks a lot Gary.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bob Brackett of Bernstein. Your line is open.","Bob Brackett","Hey, question on the status of the split of the international assets. Is that on ice in a low-price environment? Is that still something that's a strategic priority?","John J. Christmann","Right now in this price environment a lot changes a $100 price environment to $50, so right now as I stated in the prepared comments, we are not proceeding with anything on the spinoff of Egypt or North Sea. We are looking at possibly still monetizing or the non-LNG assets of Australia, but at this point in this price environment I think you're seeing strength of our international assets complement our North American portfolio.","Bob Brackett","And can you talk about where your hedges stand for 2015 now, and what your hedging strategy this year and next might be?","John J. Christmann","Right now, we\u2019ve got very little hedges 415 and that is one of the things we're going to be looking at is was what type we've gone through a major transformation as we started thinking about 15 the world changed and that's something we'll be looking at early part of this year is what type of hedging strategy we would use in the future.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Rowe from TPH. Your line is open.","Michael J. Rowe","Hi, good afternoon. I was wondering if you could maybe provide a little bit of context around your backlog at the end of the year, of your $2.2 billion mid-point budget for North America onshore. How much of that is actually just blowing through and completing drilled but uncompleted wells versus actually going and drilling new wells to add to the production base?","John J. Christmann","Well I\u2019ll say we haven\u2019t provided a lot of color there, we are coming into the year with a couple of harder wells, so it is a portion of that budget, but we are going spread it out over the year.","Michael J. Rowe","Okay, that's fine. And then, switching to one specific region, the Eagle Ford, that has a pretty sharp rig count drop down to about one maybe two rigs in 2015. You mentioned getting the cost structure down to $6 million per well, so what exactly needs to happen to get there to make that asset more competitive? And if we see a rebound in crude oil prices, do you expect that cost structure to come back up? How should we think about that specific asset and the drilling economics there?","John J. Christmann","Well the answer there is when you look at our cash flow, still the lion share of our capital is going to go into our bread and butter Permian which has been driving our performance. So we're going to be down to one rig - one to two rigs in Eagle Ford, one to two rigs in the Canyon Lime, those are both areas where we are advancing deep inventory of economic wells, but in terms of how they stack out right now, the Delaware Basin and so our step in the Permian is going to little bit slightly higher, but I do not see some of the efficiencies we are driving into those well costs, a lot of those are utilizing 3D avoiding drilling hazards or efficiency, there is more to this than just service cost.","So I don\u2019t envision any of those coming back in even if prices rebound. So that\u2019s the nice thing about slowing down is this is going to really give us a chance to when we speed back up to do it a lot more efficiently in a lot better later, because a lot of the changes are not just come out of service side, they are out of our end and designs and other efficiencies.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Leo Mariani of RBC. Your line is open.","Leo Mariani","Hey guys, I was hoping you could speak a little bit about the improvement you saw in results in the Central Basin, particularly some of these Lower Marmaton wells looked really massive. Could you speak a little about to some of the well costs you're seeing in Central? I know it's a bit different by some of these formations and where you're going to be targeting most of the capital in 2015 there?","John J. Christmann","Well we are really going to have one rig around it, so what we\u2019ve shown though is by taking a very measured and disciplined approach which we made a lot of operational changes you know management changes last summer in Tulsa, and you're seeing fruit of that really start to come through. It's more conventional reservoirs. We've got to do more homework up front. It shows the depth and quality of the acreage up there but really when you look at this year it will be a very small program just based on the commodity mix and so forth.","Leo Mariani","Okay, so is there any particular zone that you guys focus on? Or is it still multiple horizons in terms of how you tackle this?","John J. Christmann","It will high graded list of all wells there, so we do have a couple hundred acres in the Woodford that will be active there, about 50,000 net in the ops report, there will be lower Marmaton and then we got some nice Cottage Grove and Cleveland and big kind of small assortment of all the best projects we have from all those formations.","Leo Mariani","Okay, that's helpful. And in terms of your guidance here for the first quarter in North America, your 300,000 to 305,000 BOE, does that exclude production that you're selling as part of the LNG divestiture? Some of the Kitimat properties? Or is that included in those numbers? And are those going to be discontinued or how does that work?","John J. Christmann","There is actually with what\u2019s being sold with Kitimat there's not any production would be dialed into those numbers. So that is an adjusted number that you would expect to see from us post sales.","Operator","Your next question come from the line of Harry Mateer of Barclays. Your line is open.","Harry Mateer","Hi, good afternoon. The first question, so you've mentioned that you plan to initially use asset sale proceeds to pay down debt. First, can you just tell us how much CP and\/or credit facility borrowings you had at the end of the year? And then can you talk about how you plan to pay down the debt? Are you considering more liability management actions like you did in late 2013 to take out long term debt? Or are you just looking to take down short-term borrowings?","John J. Christmann","I'll have Anthony answer that question.","P. Anthony Lannie","Just short-term borrowing, but we had $11.2 billion of debt at the end of the year with $800,000 million of cash on the balance sheet for net debt position of 10.4. We\u2019ve increased our CP line of credit and $3 billion to $5 billion in December. So we have about almost $4 billion of available credit line.","Harry Mateer","Okay, and then second, can you just update us on your balance sheet and credit rating priorities in general? So any sense for what credit ratings you're trying to target for Apache, given the current commodity price environment and your view that you're no longer looking to spin Egypt or North Sea? And are there any targeted leverage metrics we can be thinking about or what is the right debt balance for the company?","P. Anthony Lannie","We are still working with the credit rating agencies on what our credit rating will be but we intend to pay down debt and have a very strong balance sheet.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Freeman of Raymond James. Your line is open.","John A. Freeman","Afternoon. I was looking at the rig count kind of break down if I wrote it down correctly, John, when you were going over the rigs in the Permian. And it looks like the Delaware Basin is about the only place in your whole portfolio where the rig count's not really changing from the November update.","And obviously it makes sense, given at that time you all said that was the highest net present value per well. I'm just trying to get a sense of how you all think about the capital allocation, the Permian where trying to balance the fact the Delaware Basin is your highest NPV, but you're still running rigs in some of these other areas of the Permian.","John J. Christmann","The issue there is you correctly picked up that rig count did not change and our governors in the Delaware right now are more driven by infrastructure, take away capacity in those things. So you are exactly right. That is not a piece, it is at the top of the food chain. And it didn\u2019t change. The others had to compete with the Permian and that's why when you look at we\u2019ve got the lion share of our capital there, so Permian still will be getting 60% of our total North American capital and which is about in line with what we showed at the November update.","John A. Freeman","Okay and then last one for me, just thinking about these delayed completions, can you give just kind of a rough number on where your backlog of uncompleted wells stands in the Permian?","John J. Christmann","We\u2019re kind of couple hundred total. Where the rig count's been, a lion's share of those would be in the Permian.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of James Sullivan of Alembic Global Advisors. Your line is open.","James Sullivan","Hey good afternoon, guys. I wonder if you could just - we've been dancing around this a little bit - but just give us a Q4 fully-adjusted volume number. You guys gave the full-year number which is helpful for both international and North America. But just net of the LNG upstream, net of the North American packages, net of Australia and net of North Sea, that whole thing.","Gary T. Clark","Yes, hey. This is Gary. We are looking at about 319,000 a day as your pro forma Q4 number in North America. And about 225 international and offshore.","James Sullivan","Perfect, thank you very much for that. The other thing I had was, you guys gave some color which was a little bit distinct in your release, about completion costs. And it sounds like - you're the only guys that I've really heard saying that you're thinking about delaying completions, not just overall activity, into the second half of the year.","With the thought, perhaps, that you'd capture a little bit more savings on the completion side, maybe. Could you speak to what you've seen in the market in terms of differential deflation rates on the drilling side, say the rig side and drilling versus fracking and completing the wells and whether that's driving your thinking? Or am I reading too much into your comments there?","John J. Christmann","Well, I mean I think the simple answer is we need to get the costs down in line with the oil price environment and when you look at 60% to 65% of your total well cost is in the completions, a lot of folks were assuming you'd just move through the backlog and keep completing the wells, but I mean that's some of the best things we can do right now to push those back because up front, significant savings there lets us drill other wells, so we're seeing substantial numbers on both the rig rates and then with what we've done basically by setting down most of the rigs, we're able to come in now and contract what prices should be in a $50 price environment and the same thing applies on the frac crews.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Herrlin of Societe Generale. Your line is open.","John P. Herrlin","Yes, thank you. John, since you've taken the helm, have you had any other leadership team changes other than the addition of Mr. Riney?","John J. Christmann","At this point given where we are John, we are taking a hard look at everything. I\u2019ve taken a pretty measured approach of stepping in and had a lot of things to get knocked out off in early. I really want to think about what we have North America look like. I've got Tom in place on the international side and I'm going to take a very measured approach and think through what this thing ought to look like for the long-term and come out with something at a later day.","John P. Herrlin","Okay, thanks. On a pro forma basis for the U.S., what's your average decline rate now?","John J. Christmann","Right now if you look at our just in the U.S. our PDP decline is across all products. Oil is about 26%, our total streams around 24% in North America and that's just on a PDP basis.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joe Allman from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Joseph D. Allman","Thank you, operator. Hi, everybody. So just to recount in North America, what's that rig count in the fourth quarter of 2015? And then, I know you answered this a little bit earlier, but if it's as low as I think it is, I would assume that going into 2016 it's going to be hard to keep production flat. And do you exhaust the wells waiting on completion? Do you exhaust those by the end of 2015?","John J. Christmann","All right. What I would say about that Joe is it will just depend on where we are and where prices are. I mean clearly if we are under $50 it will be lower than the average for the year considerably come in hot, but we are going to kind of let things dictate what we say going into the third and fourth quarter kind of based on where the market conditions are and also where the cost structure is. I mean that\u2019s the other piece, we get cost down we would be able to pick up too so.","Joseph D. Allman","Okay, so second question, again, following up from the first. Do you exhaust the inventory of wells waiting on completion by year-end? And separate question, the $2 billion ceiling test write-down that you described, North Sea. You described US. You talked about some acreage that you're not going to drill. Could you give us more details on that please?","John J. Christmann","Well in terms of completion backlog we\u2019ve got \u2013 that\u2019s kind of at our disposal as to when we would complete those wells and obviously if we're an under 50 and prices have come on down and we will probably get some of those on and may choose to wait and see an increase in price when we go ahead and complete some of those wells. For the write down of the charges, I\u2019m going to let Anthony handle that question.","P. Anthony Lannie","Yes, we haven\u2019t provided any details in terms of split out between North America and North Sea at this point, but the total is $2 billion for the ceiling test and another $1.3 for the balance, for the impairment.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Doug Leggate","Thanks, good afternoon, John, and congratulations on your appointment. John, I wonder if I could ask you about the organizational capability from going from 80-plus rigs to 17 rigs. What does that do to you? If you were to look into being able to ramp that up again in the event of an oil price recovery, do you intend on keeping the organization static? Will you see some headcount reduction and cost reduction at the corporate level? Can you walk us through how you think about that and how patient you're prepared to be until the oil price recovers if you choose to do nothing?","John J. Christmann","Well Doug we have been looking at G&A, looking at it pretty hard in terms of ways to reduce it, we did announce we had some reductions in January about 5% worldwide when you look at the numbers, clearly we had an organization in place its capable of running 90 plus rigs in North America which at this point its less than that.","So we will continue to look at things, one thing we are doing is we're taking some of our young engineers and we are putting them in the field which is allowing us to replace some contract folks so we\u2019re being pretty smart about how to leverage folks, get some good experience and also puts us in a better position, in fact I have got a lot of good reports on the savings and some of the benefits that we\u2019re having about putting those guys out in the field.","So we are going be pretty prudent, in terms of what we do we will continue to look at what is the best organization for North America in terms of where things are going and do not worry about being over ramp up, I mean its easy to ramp up after you\u2019ve been there before, I mean we\u2019ve got great capabilities in the Permian and our other regions and it will not be hard to ramp up.","And in fact I\u2019ve got a lot of ways thankful because its gives us a chance to really look at our processes, our efficiencies, our inventory and really spend some time, high grading that and I will promise you will do it when we ramp up differently then would have been do it right now.","Doug Leggate","I know it's not an easy question to answer, so I appreciate the answer. I wonder if for my follow-up if I can go back to Bob's question earlier about the international strategy. I really just want to get clarification on this because for the past year, I guess there's been an expectation that the international business would be spun off completely. Is this a temporary situation? Is it now strategic?","Can you help us understand what has flipped the Board's view on this? Because clearly it's a massive turnaround to decide to keep it. And will it compete for capital? I'm just trying to understand is this now \u2013 does the new Apache this time include Egypt and North Sea as go-forward assets? Or is this a stay of execution? I'll leave it there.","John J. Christmann","There\u2019s a couple things. One of our key strategic objectives was to sell the LNG and that will close in the end of the first quarter. Secondly, we are looking at our conventional business in Australia, Egypt in the North Sea are different businesses then what we are doing in North America, but the thing you are going to look as generate free cash flow they always have had higher rate of return projects which complement our portfolio and clearly in this price environment it would not make sense to monetize them and they complete things very nicely. So at this point, there is no plans to sell or spin and they fit nicely with the portfolio when we ramp back up we will grow North America at faster rate.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Singer from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Brian Singer","Thank you, good afternoon. Apache has a number of different opportunities within North America onshore to ramp up investment when the time is right. Based on what you're seeing now, what is the best way to do that? Do you see concentrating more in specific areas among the Delaware Basin versus Midland Basin versus East Texas, Eagle Ford to gain greater scale when you do want to ramp up and efficiencies? Or should we expect a gradual ramp up everywhere when the time is right?","John J. Christmann","A lot of that's going to depend on a lot of the strategic testing and the things we're doing in these plays right now. We're learning things each day. We've got the rig we're running in the Eagle Ford will be telling us very critical things as well as the Canyon Lime as well as the Permian so the good news is we've got a deep inventory and I'm confident we're going to have plenty of economic projects. We've got more right now than cash flow to spend at these levels so a lot of that Brian will just depend on how we see each of those plays at that time.","One place is one of the questions earlier we have not slowed down in the Delaware and we will continue to try to expand that and then I think we're going to be in a position to we've gone from 12 rigs down to, we will be at four and down to one to two in the Eagle Ford. We can ramp that back up very quickly. The Canyon Lime we can put up at five or six in there and the neat thing is we're high grading a lot of prospects and a lot of acreage and we'll have a lot of choices to choose from.","Brian Singer","Thanks, and as my follow-up, and it actually follows up on a couple of questions earlier, and as well as your response here just now. You say you want your costs to come down, you want prices to go up. Your returns are strong from the portfolio today. But is what you're saying that every well that the 64 rigs you have dropped, or are planning to drop, achieve attractive returns at today's oil prices. But simply you've dropped them to stay within cash flow? Or are there areas where you need costs to come down to meet your return threshold? And if so, can you provide specifics?","John J. Christmann","It's a combination. There are a lot of those projects on the lower end that need prices down to where we want to drill them right now. But I can tell you where we made the cut based on our current cash flow I have more capabilities right now of economic projects we were electing to defer because we don't have to drill them. I mean the point is why drill them in this price environment when things are going to improve? So it's a combination.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Richard Tullis from Capital One Securities. Your line is open.","Richard Tullis","Thanks, good afternoon, everyone. John, following with the rate of return line there, so we saw the rates of return associated with your portfolio at the November meeting based on $80 oil, $4 gas. What do you think the impact is on the portfolio in general, using current commodities and the reductions you've seen in well costs to date?","John J. Christmann","Well there's no doubt that they drop. You go from 80 and 4 and you go to 50, and call it 50 and 290, apples-to-apples they have dropped. Now we are working on the cost side and we still have very attractive returns in the place where we are active, so but there's no doubt right now, the returns are costs haven't come down to put the returns in line with what we showed you and $80 a barrel in November.","Richard Tullis","Okay. And looking at the Eagle Ford A area, back in November it looked like you were going to be quite active there in 2015, running as many as 10 rigs with a fairly high rate of return. Why the significant change down to one rig now? And I'm not sure if that's going to be in the A or the B area? Has your thinking on that play changed any? Or is it more just a rate of return thing right now?","John J. Christmann","It\u2019s neither its cash flow in the portfolio of what the dollar amount is so it's simply cash flow. We got more - there is lot\u2019s of wells we could drill in the Eagle Ford right now, but it\u2019s purely just a function of we aren't going to tap our balance sheet to develop production.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Campbell from Tuohy Brothers Investment Research. Your line is open.","Jeffrey L. Campbell","Hi, John. I'd like to second the congratulations on your new CEO role. First, I want to ask about Canada. I noticed you're going to stop drilling in March 2015. I just wondering will the completions be delayed there as you were talking about doing elsewhere? Because in November you made it clear this is an emergent play, so was just wondering if maybe the desire to see results would be a part of the calculus.","John J. Christmann","Well, Jeff, thank you. Two things. Number one, we do have excellent results and high hopes for Canada, and but there's two things. Montney wells we are going to be completing. There are little more dashing than the Duverney, and the Duverney wells have great economics, we will be completing the - we got a seven well pad there it\u2019s testing two different spacings. We will be completing those in the third quarter of this year.","It\u2019s simply a function of cash flow in Canada is limiting how much we're spending in Canada so that's why and obviously with the winter drilling season we've come in very hot in Canada and actually Canada is going to be a slight out spend versus cash flow. So it\u2019s purely same answer again. It\u2019s cash flow driven is what's causing us to do that and the good news is after these two wells we had to hold acreage in the Montney we don't have any acreage problems in Canada this fall. And obviously if prices change going in third or fourth quarter you could see us decide to step back up. But we will right now, the plan would be not to do anything.","Jeffrey L. Campbell","Okay thanks and to ask a little bit different question. In Egypt we're reading a lot about the government trying to procure pipeline nat gas Israel as well as floating LNG. Is there any financial incentive to try to increase the natural gas production into the Egyptian market, because I notice your highlight wells are very high oil cuts.","John J. Christmann","Yes, I\u2019m going to have Tom handle this one.","Thomas E. Voytovich","The answer is that the Egyption government has kept the gas price artificially low for 12 to 13 years now, 14 years and there is no indication that they have the willingness or desire to increase the domestic production gas price and as such, we continue to focus on oil and drill sufficient gas wells to keep our infrastructure full primarily by focusing on higher condensate yield reservoirs so that we could also increase liquids productions at the same time.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Hall from Heikkinen Energy Advisors. Your line is open.","Michael A. Hall","Thanks, appreciate the questions. I guess you provided the rig counts going forward for 2015. Maybe circling around this weighted uncompletion question in a little different way. How many wells do you anticipate to put on production regionally in 2015? And then how much of the, you said 200 or so in backlog, so I'm just trying to think through the organic program underlying that is...","John J. Christmann","Yes I would \u2013 we have not disclosed the well counts in terms of lay that much detail out in terms of the plan. We kind of hit on rigs and we have a couple hundred wells in addition to those and I mean, if we want to get back with them later Gary or something on details.","Gary T. Clark","Yes Michael, we can follow-up with you there, but we really haven\u2019t kind of put anything out there on the specific well counts you know I just...","Michael A. Hall","Okay, but if -- relative to the Analyst Day in November, you cut the rigs probably 50% or more, or not quite. But is it fair to say then you're only taking the well count down by a quarter or so or is that simple math?","John J. Christmann","You can do it, you can probably do the math on the rigs, but the other factor is there costs are coming down, so it\u2019s not straight linear math.","Michael A. Hall","Fair enough. And then you provided the PDP declines, that's helpful. How did that vary regionally?","John J. Christmann","That\u2019s another things, I don\u2019t have that detail for you. I\u2019m just giving you a general on North America.","Michael A. Hall","That's fair and that's helpful. And then final one of mine, just housekeeping, on the budget for 2015, does that include capitalized interest? And if not, roughly do you all know what that might look like?","John J. Christmann","It does.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Wolff from Jefferies. Your line is open.","Jonathan D. Wolff","Afternoon, guys. I'm just looking at the numbers and intuitively spending about 36% of your budget in the first quarter and looking for exit rate that's similar. It just feels like there's a contemplated CapEx increase in here in the second half of the year, based on being able to achieve that type of momentum with the base decline rates that you've laid out. I'm just trying to get to the math. Is there a contemplated CapEx increase coming in May-June timeframe?","John J. Christmann","Not in this budget at all.","Jonathan D. Wolff","Can you give a little intuition on how you only have two-thirds of the budget left to spend in the last three quarters? It should be down dramatically in terms of the spending versus 2014. Is it a assumption that oil service costs are down 20%, 25%? Is it the expectation that oil prices are up $10? We're just having a hard time getting anywhere near the math on the domestic production.","John J. Christmann","Well it works fine on our end. I mean basically it's a function of how we spread the completions out. We've come in hot. We've got with Canada having completed it, you're not going to be completing those Duvernay wells until the third quarter. The math works. It's just a function of we pushed a lot of completions back and we'll bring them on at the appropriate time. But there's nothing baked in beyond, there's no capital increase. There's no oil price increase, you know we wouldn't be very smart to do that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Leo Mariani from RBC. Your line is open.","Leo Mariani","Hey guys, I just wanted to ask you a little about the M&A landscape. It sounds like in your prepared comments you spoke about rather buying acreage and maybe securing more assets as opposed to drilling. Can you talk about what you see out there that might be available? And what type of size of purchases are we talking about?","John J. Christmann","I mean I think the point is we would be opportunistic. I mean we see a potentially if things stay where they are there's a lot of folks that are significantly out spending. There is a lot of clocks on acreage. We're seeing things pop-up right now and for drilling a well we can earn pretty big acreage blocks. I think there's just a lot of opportunity that could surface and we would expect to surface.","Leo Mariani","All right. And moving over to your international guidance for 2015, you guys talked about 207,000 barrels a day, which I guess is after subtracting out final tax, working interest barrels and some tax barrels. Do you guys have that guidance numbers kind of prior to those subtractions? Because I know you guys reported that way in your financial just to keep it apples-to-apples for the financials?","John J. Christmann","I\u2019ll let Gary.","Gary T. Clark","I\u2019ll tell you what. Why don't we do this and follow-up because we've gone over the top of the hour. Why don\u2019t we follow-up with offline on those, on that reconciliation.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Herrlin from Societe Generale. Your line is open.","John P. Herrlin","Yes, hi, just one quick follow-up. Obviously there's been a lot of questions regarding oil field services costs, completion costs, et cetera. On a going-forward basis, do you think the services providers will be more willing to index so you avoid kind of this boom-bust type pricing? Or will it just be business as always?","John J. Christmann","John I mean that\u2019s one of the things we\u2019ve looked very heavily at and we think it makes a lot of sands and quite frankly we should have done it a while back. So we would like to think that you can do that.","John P. Herrlin","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","And your last question comes from the line of James Sullivan from Alembic Global Advisors. Your line is open.","James Sullivan","Hey guys, thanks for running this call real quick, do a little follow-up. Can you guys talk a little bit about what you're doing in Central Oklahoma? You guys did put the Woodford wells up on the ops report, but are you guys targeting some of the multi-lateral areas there with the Springer and the Merrimac and other stuff? Just get a little detail on that.","John J. Christmann","Yes, I mean as I mentioned we are going to have one rig pretty much dedicated. We will be drilling some Woodford wells. We've got about 200,000 acres gross 50,000 net so we will be active there with that and we\u2019ve also got some really look in economic prospects in some of our other plays. So its juts simply budgeting our capital there, but you will see some more Woodford wells from us.","James Sullivan","Great, and just a quick follow-up to that. Is that one of the areas you guys talked in the leasehold work you've been doing. I think East Eagle Ford probably got some of that money and some of the other areas, but are you working there as well with the leasehold?","John J. Christmann","We have been working to fill in and bolter on our position, but that\u2019s relevant for all of our key areas where we would be active drilling.","End of Q&A","Operator","This concludes today's Q&A session.

However, a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from what we discuss today. A full disclaimer is located with the supplemental data on our website. Also, please note that Apache's third quarter 10-Q will be filed at the close of business today.","I would now like to turn the call over to John.","John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.","Good afternoon and thank you for joining us.","Apache continues to make great progress on the goals we set at the beginning of the year, and our recent announcements and third quarter results underscore this positive performance. On today's call, I will discuss four primary topics. First, I will review the strategy we laid out at the beginning of 2015 to guide Apache through the downturn. I will outline how the execution of that strategy has positioned Apache for success in 2017 and beyond. Then, I will discuss our capital spending priorities as we look ahead to 2017. Following that, I will review our Permian, Egypt, and North Sea regions, and then conclude with a discussion of the Alpine High.","At the start of the downturn, we established some guiding principles that have brought us to where we are today. These were: dramatically reduce development spending until price and costs come into better equilibrium; establish a strong financial position and protect it by living within cash flow; and prepare the portfolio for long-term returns, growth, and shareholder value.","At the start of 2016, we put forth a very conservative capital budget of $1.6 billion. This spend level was based on a plan to live within cash flow at $35 per barrel of oil. Our capital allocation process reflected the decision to constrain capital investment in North American onshore development activities. Despite this, our North American onshore production has performed well in 2016, which is a testament to Apache's greatly improved capital efficiency and the relatively low decline rate of our Permian-anchored production base.","At the beginning of 2016, our planned capital allocation for the Alpine High play was less than $100 million. As the year progressed and cash flow came in above budgeted levels, we elected to invest incremental cash flow in Alpine High rather than chase near-term production growth elsewhere. As a result, we now expect to spend approximately $500 million in Alpine High this year, which effectively accounts for the incremental cash flow above our original budget. Our financial and operational discipline has served us well. We plan to end the year with relatively unchanged net debt, and we brought forth a transformational discovery at Alpine High that will drive incremental growth and returns for years to come.","With regard to next year's outlook, in February on our fourth quarter conference call, we will provide a detailed view of our 2017 capital budget and other guidance items. In the meantime, I thought it would be helpful to provide the following high-level summary of our 2017 investment priorities.","Our top priority next year is funding the Alpine High. The budget will likely consist of a four- to six-rig program and a first wave of midstream build-out. The near-term pace of spending on Alpine High will be governed by the timing of infrastructure availability, as well as a prudent appraisal and delineation program. Our goal in 2017 is to ensure that investment levels do not outpace our comprehensive understanding of the opportunity or our capacity to get product to market.","Our next priority is to increase development activity in our other Permian Basin focus areas. Specifically, we will add three rigs in the Midland Basin before year-end 2016, bringing our total rig count to five. This additional activity, coupled with first gas production from Alpine High, will return the Permian Basin to a strong growth trajectory in the second half of 2017. We will also continue to invest in Egypt and the North Sea at levels designed to sustain production and generate significant free cash flow. And, lastly, our other exploration projects and North American development opportunities will compete for the remaining available capital.","Now turning to the third quarter. As noted in this morning's press release, Apache's adjusted production in the third quarter, which excludes tax barrels and our non-controlling interest in Egypt, was approximately 438,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. This is comprised of 270,000 BOEs per day in North America onshore and 168,000 BOEs per day from the international and offshore. Production in North America onshore continues to perform well despite minimal development capital. For the full-year 2016, we expect North American onshore production will be in the upper half of our most recent guidance range of 268,000 to 278,000 BOEs per day.","In the Permian, while we are clearly excited about our Alpine High acreage, we are also positioned for very attractive growth and returns elsewhere in the basin. Our focus on strategic testing during the downturn has yielded excellent results in our core Midland and Delaware Basin acreage, where we have expanded and prioritized our inventory of high-return projects. Improved landing zone targeting and new completion designs are delivering strong well performance in both areas. With these improvements and the significant progress we have made on costs, we are confident in bringing growth-oriented capital investment back to the Permian Basin. As such, we have initiated a more aggressive development drilling program the Midland Basin, and will look to expand our rig count further in 2017 if warranted by commodity prices and available cash flow.","Turning briefly to our international and offshore regions, production for the quarter excluding tax barrels and our non-controlling interest in Egypt, was 168,000 BOEs per day, comprising 98,000 BOEs per day from Egypt, 62,000 BOEs from the North Sea, and 8,000 BOEs from the Gulf of Mexico. During the quarter, our North Sea operations were impacted by planned and unplanned maintenance downtime, as well as third-party facilities downtime. Thus far, we have seen volumes in the fourth quarter rebound to more normalized levels. For the full-year 2016, international and offshore production is on track for the midpoint of our 170,000 to 180,000 BOE per day guidance for the year.","I am very pleased with the drilling results in our international operations this year. Our exploration and development drilling success rate in Egypt and the North Sea year to date is approximately 90%. Apache made another key discovery in the North Sea this quarter in our Storr prospect. We highlighted this prospect in our North Sea investor webcast late last year, and it marks our third consecutive exploration success since acquiring 3-D seismic data in the Beryl area. This validates the quality of our 3-D seismic data and geologic modeling and gives us higher confidence in the dozens of future exploration prospects we have identified to date.","Now I would like to spend a few minutes discussing our Alpine High play. The Alpine High is an immense resource and a transformational discovery for Apache. We have invested a significant amount of human and financial capital through two years of extensive geologic and geophysical work and reservoir and fluid analysis. This was accompanied by concept testing an initial round of verification wells, the results of which we disclosed in early September.","We are now engaged in a methodical appraisal and delineation program to confirm the geographic and stratigraphic extent of the play and to formulate our long-term infrastructure plan. This work will continue for the next several quarters before transitioning to an active development program once gas processing and transportation infrastructure is in place.","The Alpine High can be broadly characterized as five distinct target formations, all of which we believe will be highly economic. This includes the Bone Springs and Wolfcamp, which are prevalent and productive throughout the Delaware Basin. These hybrid unconventional plays are the current focus of the industry to the north and east of the Alpine High. Two early tests have demonstrated that these formations are oil productive and offer significant potential at Alpine High. More appraisal drilling in these zones is necessary before we will provide prospective location counts and resource-in-place estimates.","Underlying the Bone Springs and Wolfcamp and unique to the Alpine High is a true resource play in the Pennsylvanian [Penn], Barnett, and Woodford formations. This is a world-class source rock sequence, up to 1,500 feet thick across our acreage position. Based on our appraisal program to date, we anticipate this will become a very large resource play with attractive rates of return and breakeven economics. Together, the Penn-Barnett-Woodford source rock in the two hybrid unconventional zones in the Bone Springs and the Wolfcamp are up to 5,000 feet thick across Apache's Alpine High acreage position. Given this extensive vertical column, we anticipate drilling multiple landing zones in each of these formations and ultimately defining several pipe wells and associated location counts.","As a reminder, in previous disclosure, we assigned only one landing zone to each of the Barnett and the Woodford formations on only a portion of our acreage to arrive at our current 2,000 to 3,000-plus location count.","When we announced Alpine High in September, we provided production results from eight horizontal wells, six in the Woodford and one each in the Barnett and Bone Springs. The objective of this initial group of wells was only to test the boundaries of specific geologic settings and evaluate certain potential hazards. We made no effort to optimize completions, well orientation, or landing zone placement. Despite this, the test wells have continued to perform very well.","Since Barclays, we have flow-tested two additional wells. The Black Hawk 1H, a normally pressured Woodford well, flowed at a peak 24-hour IP rate of 5.3 million cubic feet of gas, 224 barrels of oil, and 245 barrels of NGLs. The Redwood 1H, an over-pressured Woodford well, flowed at a peak 24-hour IP rate of 18 million cubic feet of gas. This well was drilled to a vertical depth of nearly 14,000 feet, further confirming our thermal maturity model of the play and the depth limit of the wet gas window. Tim Sullivan will provide more details on our Alpine High wells in his remarks.","Finally, we have closed several additional acreage transactions over the past two months, and our Alpine High position now comprises 320,000 net contiguous acres. Apache identified and captured this position for an average price of $1,300 per acre over a period of approximately two years. This very low entry cost gives us an advantage that we believe will translate into very attractive returns on capital employed compared to the alternative of acquiring prospective Delaware acreage at current transaction prices.","To summarize, our near-term drilling objectives at Alpine High include: geographic testing to define geologic settings across our acreage position; stratigraphic testing to collect data from all five formations; defining the number of landing zones and the optimal well placement and orientation within each formation; and enhancing completions and testing longer laterals and well spacing to optimize full field development.","At this point, we can say with confidence that the Alpine High contains thousands of predictable high-return horizontal drilling locations that will drive returns and production growth for many years to come. Importantly, Apache controls the vast majority of the play, and we have the ability to establish the pace and scope of development. Our ultimate goal is to optimize value of this extensive resource base for the maximum long-term benefit of our shareholders as well as other stakeholders.","I would now like to turn the call over to Tim Sullivan and Steve Riney, who will discuss the company's drilling results, financial performance, and midstream plans before coming back for some final remarks ahead of the Q&A session.","Timothy J. Sullivan - Apache Corp.","Thank you, John, and good afternoon. My remarks today will be focused on providing more detail around results from our core areas, highlights from specific wells, and near-term development plans.","Our Permian region produced 159,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the third quarter, or nearly 60% of Apache's total North American onshore production. Production in the Permian Basin decreased by roughly 6,200 BOE per day from the second quarter, as their declines were buffered primarily by 13 well tie-ins and our Northwest Shelf Yeso play.","In our new Delaware Basin discovery, the Alpine High, we're showing results from 10 wells, comprising eight Woodford, one Barnett, and one Third Bone Springs wells.","On page 15 of the operations supplement, we have updated our production curves from the wells we showed at Barclays and have included the two most recent wells. As you can see, our Alpine High wells compare favorably with the P-50 type curves for the Marcellus, Utica, and SCOOP resource plays, with half the wells producing at or above the P-50 type curves.","Keep in mind, the Alpine High wells are short laterals and have not been normalized for lateral length. Also, the completions and landing zones have not been optimized. These initial wells were drilled as appraisal wells and test-of-concept and were oftentimes drilled near hazards so that we can better understand the boundaries of the play. Given this, we are excited about the early time performance. We are shutting wells in as we complete testing and we'll collect pressure buildup data. These wells will be brought back online when we begin selling gas in 2017.","The two new Alpine High wells John previously mentioned are both producing from the Woodford formation. The Black Hawk State 1H, which was drilled in a normally pressured setting, has the highest oil cut in the Woodford among the wells we have drilled to date. The Redwood 1H is the deepest well we have drilled and is our highest gas producer. We have also updated production from the Bone Springs producer Mont Blanc 2H, which can be seen on page 17 of the operations supplement. The well, which was a non-optimized completion with a short lateral, has a cumulative production of greater than 40,000 barrels of oil equivalent over 100 days and is currently producing 220 barrels of oil and 580 MCF per day with a stable GOR. Also, you can see that the water production has decreased to approximately 275 barrels per day.","The wells drilled to date have confirmed the unprecedented picture of the vertical dimensions of the play of the Bone Springs to the Woodford across our acreage position, with the hydrocarbon column ranging from oil to wet gas to dry gas confirming our geologic model. We have seen a range of initial oil cuts in the Woodford from zero to 20%. The shallower Barnett well has an oil cut of 21%. These yields are in line with our thermal maturity model and can be correlated to depth.","The gas is extremely rich, with an average BTU of approximately 1,300. This should provide for an average NGL yield in excess of 100 barrels per million cubic feet of natural gas when permanent facilities are in place. As expected in a resource play, Alpine High is becoming more predictable. Every well we've drilled has confirmed our model.","In the Pecos Bend area in the Delaware Basin, we placed seven gross operated wells on production, all of which targeted the Third Bone Springs formation. We continue to see excellent production performance across this play. Our Blue Jay Unit 103H well continues its strong performance. Using 3-D seismic, we targeted a highly fractured area. The well has produced 427,000 barrels of oil equivalent in just under seven months, achieving an average rate of roughly 2,260 barrels of oil equivalent per day. This well is currently producing approximately 1,500 barrels of oil equivalent per day, of which 60% is oil.","In a less fractured area of the play, we are also able to drill economic wells by utilizing pad drilling operations. On our Falcon State lease, a 6-well pad came online in mid-September, with an average 30-day rate of 625 barrels of oil equivalent per day. This pad also demonstrated our best-in-class operational efficiencies in this basin, with an average total well cost of $3.5 million per well.","In the Midland Basin, Central Basin Platform, and Northwest Shelf, we placed a combined 16 gross operated wells on production in the quarter. We ran two rigs in the third quarter, primarily in the Midland Basin, and intend to ramp up to five rigs by the end of the year. Activity is focused on stratigraphic landing zone targeting and development pad drilling in the Wolfcamp and Spraberry shale formations and our Wildfire, Azalea, and Powell focus areas. We also expect to bring 20 horizontal wells online over the next two quarters across these three areas.","As we stated on our last quarter call, in the third quarter we brought online the CC 4144 East 2HM, producing from the Wolfcamp B formation at Powell. This well continues to show strong performance and has produced 136,000 barrels of oil equivalent in the first 90 days online, at an average of more than 1,500 barrels of oil equivalent per day. This well along with our Connell 38B 2HM and 38C 2HM wells were drilled with our improved targeting and completion design, which we highlighted last quarter. Please refer to page 18 in our operations supplement for a production update of our Midland Basin focus area.","Subsequent to quarter end, we brought online the Lynch A 6HM, a Wolfcamp B producer in our Wildfire area in Midland County. This 8,500-foot lateral was completed with 146 frac stages at approximately 60-foot frac spacing, pumping 1,700 pounds per foot of sand. The well is still cleaning up and has not reached peak production but is flowing at a rate of 1,120 barrels of oil and 1.1 million cubic feet of gas per day. In addition to this well, we will be testing one Middle Spraberry and three Lower Spraberry wells in our Wildfire focus area later this month.","Much of our previous strategic testing in the Wolfcamp and Spraberry involved completions and landing zone optimization. The improvements we are making, as demonstrated by these wells, will significantly enhance our Midland Basin program going forward.","In the Northwest Shelf, we placed nine horizontal Yeso wells in production during the quarter and continue to generate very good production rates and economics from this play. The 30-day rate for these nine wells averaged almost 450 barrels of oil equivalent per day. With our best-in-class drilling and completion cost for these wells, we averaged less than $2.5 million per well. This program generates extremely favorable economics on a fully burdened basin. In addition to the nine horizontal Yeso wells, we also placed four vertical Yeso wells on production during the quarter.","Outside of the Permian, Apache had no active drilling rigs operating in North America during the quarter. We did, however, test seven operated wells, all in Canada, in our Annie Creek, Montney, and Wapiti Montney focus areas. Most notably is our 9-of-23 well, completed in the Lower Montney in our Wapiti area. This well tested at an impressive initial rate of 10.6 million cubic feet of gas per day and approximately 2,000 barrels of condensate per day, with a total estimated completed well cost of $6.2 million. We are making great progress in North America, even at our low level of reinvestment. We remain focused on returns and are positioning the Permian Basin for a growth trajectory in the second half of 2017.","Moving to international and offshore operations, in Egypt, gross production of 350,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day was up slightly compared to the second quarter. On a net basis, adjusted volumes declined sequentially by 3,000 BOE per day, primarily due to the impact of improving Brent oil prices on cost recovery mechanisms and our production sharing contracts. We continue to benefit from a robust, optimized drilling program, drilling 45 producers and only five dry holes, achieving a 90% success rate through the first three quarters of 2016.","Apache placed nine wells on production in Egypt during the third quarter. Most notably is the Ptah #12, producing from the Shiffah formation, with a current peak oil production of over 2,800 barrels of oil per day. Since field discovery in November 2014, the Ptah and Berenice fields have produced a combined 17 million barrels of oil equivalent from only 14 wells and are still producing at a rate of more than 38,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Well costs for this play averaged only $3.2 million per well.","In the North Sea, third quarter production decreased approximately 8,300 BOE per day due to downtime resulting from planned maintenance turnarounds and third-party operated facility restrictions that impacted production. This was associated with seasonal turnarounds that occur in this region during the late summer. This deferred some 3Q production into the current period, so we expect 4Q volumes to bounce back to levels we've seen in the first half the year.","As John mentioned, we also made a nice discovery at our Storr prospect in the Beryl area, which encountered hydrocarbons in two separate fault blocks. The results were in line with pre-drill estimates, and we expect to test more fault blocks at Storr in the future. Apache has a 55% working interest, with Shell holding the remaining 45%.","In late October, we commenced drilling our next Beryl area prospect, Kinord, which we expect to reach TD by year-end. Please refer to our November 2015 North Sea investor update for more details on Storr, Kinord, and other opportunities in the Beryl area. I would note a new high-rate development well at the Beryl field, the Nevis North NNA, which came online mid-September. The 30-day average rate for this well was 20 million cubic feet of natural gas equivalent per day.","At our Aviat project in the Forties field, we have now completed and tied in the first well. As you may recall, Aviat enables a switch from diesel to natural gas as our primary source of power for the Forties field. This is an environmentally friendly project that will extend the economic life of Forties due to lower operating costs and reduce certain safety and reliability risk associated with bunkering diesel to our platforms. We estimate our annual diesel savings due to this project at $15 million per year. Importantly, using natural gas to fuel the Forties field should enable us to maintain higher and more stable water injection rates, which should in turn result in higher sustained hydrocarbon production from the field.","In Suriname, we completed our 3-D seismic shoot on Block 58 in September, and we will have preliminary processing results by year-end and a fully processed data set in the third quarter of 2017. On the adjacent Block 53, we will commence drilling operations on a commitment well in the first quarter of next year, the Kolibri #1. While this is an attractive and sizable exploration prospect, very few wells have been drilled to this depth offshore Suriname, and as such, carries a significant amount of risk. The dry hole cost to Apache for this well is estimated at less than $40 million.","To sum up international and offshore, while activity was limited, we had very good exploration and development results in both Egypt and the North Sea during the third quarter. We're excited about the future exploration potential in our international and offshore portfolio and look forward to providing more details in the future. I would now like to turn the call over to Steve.","Stephen J. Riney - Apache Corp.","Thank you, Tim, and good afternoon, everyone. On today's call, I will discuss the following. First, I will review our financial results for the third quarter and provide updated 2016 guidance on selected items. Next, I will provide a few details on our near-term Alpine High infrastructure development activities, which have the primary purpose of achieving first gas sales around mid-2017. Then I will conclude by outlining the framework that we intend to follow as we put together our 2017 capital budget.","Before I dive into our (28:44), I want to remind everyone that all of our numbers I will review on today's call are now reported under the Successful Efforts accounting method. For those who would like to compare these results to those under the Full Cost accounting method we used in the past, please reference the 10-Q that will be filed later today.","As noted in our press release, Apache reported a loss of $607 million or $1.60 per common share. Our results for the quarter include a number of items outside of our core earnings that are typically excluded by the investment community in published earnings estimates. This includes a $355 million impairment of certain proved properties in Canada as a result of downward reserve revisions related to well performance and lower expected net gas realizations.","In addition, with the reduction of the UK petroleum revenue tax, or PRT, to 0% in September, we recognized a charge of $481 million to eliminate the PRT benefit associated with certain future abandonment costs. Despite the apparent negative impacts of the change, in the long term the reduction in the PRT tax rate will improve our North Sea returns. When excluding these and other smaller items, our adjusted loss for the quarter was $12 million or $0.03 per share.","In the third quarter, Apache generated $651 million in cash flow from operations. We operated near cash flow neutrality after paying dividends and after increasing capital expenditures in the Alpine High and in our core Midland Basin. As a result, we ended the quarter with $1.2 billion of cash.","Our 2016 CapEx guidance, which we updated in early September, remains unchanged at $2 billion. And we still intend to end the year with unchanged or lower net debt. A combination of asset disposal proceeds and a significant U.S. tax refund, both anticipated in the fourth quarter, should enable us to achieve our targeted cash balance of $1.5 billion at year end.","Turning to costs, lease operating costs in the third quarter were $7.94 per barrel of oil equivalent, approximately 10% lower than the same period last year. As previously guided, LOE per barrel of oil equivalent increased from the second quarter due to higher seasonal maintenance activity and increased workover expenses. While we expect LOE per BOE to trend a little higher in the fourth quarter, we are again revising our full-year 2016 guidance down to less than $8 per barrel of oil equivalent. This just reinforces the tremendous progress we have made on costs this year.","On the G&A side, our gross overhead spend, which we've defined on previous calls, continues to track toward the lower end of our 2016 guidance of $650 million to $700 million. As such, you can now expect our 2016 gross overhead spend to be about $650 million.","Lastly, exploration expense in the third quarter was $161 million. $114 million of this was attributable to unproved leasehold impairments in Canada, the Eagle Ford, and the Canyon Lime. Last quarter we guided to $250 million to $300 million of exploration expense for the full year. With the incremental impairment from the third quarter, we now expect full-year 2016 exploration expense in the range of $350 million to $400 million.","I would now like to provide a few details on our Alpine High infrastructure development plans. There's currently very limited infrastructure in the immediate vicinity of our acreage. During the course of delineation drilling, Apache has installed skid-mounted refrigeration units to process gas and recover natural gas liquids. NGL recovery volumes are currently constrained by the capability of these temporary units. We have also installed separation facilities to recover oil. Both the oil and the NGLs are being trucked to local sales points. These temporary arrangements will over time be replaced by more permanent solutions. The initial objective of our infrastructure investment is to establish permanent gas processing capacity and transportation of residue gas to market sales points. First gas sales are expected in the middle of 2017.","Field processing of the gas stream will be accomplished using refrigeration units at key locations across the acreage. These units are modular and can be expanded commensurate with increasing production. This will help optimize the pace of capital deployment and maximize efficiency.","A high priority during the initial phases of field development is to ensure that production is not limited by processing or transportation capacity. The gas takeaway infrastructure will include 60 miles of 30-inch diameter trunk line that will traverse our entire Alpine High acreage position. Major third-party transport lines are currently situated or are under construction in locations approximately 10 miles to the north and south of the Apache leasehold.","The Waha hub is located less than 50 miles to the east of Apache's acreage and provides access to most major U.S. markets. Apache is currently evaluating numerous options to utilize these points of access to both U.S. and Mexico gas market opportunities. We will install the trunk line across the Alpine High and establish most market connections through 2017 and 2018.","As indicated previously, NGLs are currently being transported by truck to local sales points. As production volumes increase, NGLs will eventually exceed trucking capacity and will require pipeline transport. Apache is evaluating options for the type of gas processing and the means of access to major NGL markets. There will be additional disclosure regarding these plans in the future.","Apache's Alpine High infrastructure strategy will address both the near-term requirement for market access during the appraisal and delineation phase as well as the long-term requirements for optimizing value through the transition to full field development. As the ultimate production potential of the Alpine High is better understood, the long-term infrastructure requirements will be formulated accordingly. As with all capital decisions at Apache, infrastructure investment and full field development decisions at Alpine High will be made with full-cycle, fully burdened long-term returns as a key priority.","To reiterate some of John's early comments, as we think about our 2017 capital allocation process, we will do so based on a continuation of our core principles. We will focus on living within our means, maintaining our strong financial position, and investing to improve long-term returns. We will provide the details of our 2017 capital plan and guidance in February. However, I would like to share three of the key themes in this year's planning process.","First, the Alpine High and the rest of the Permian Basin will be high priorities for our capital program. We fully expect to return the Permian Basin to a strong growth trajectory in the second half of 2017. We are pleased with the improvements we made during the downturn across our portfolio, and we are now prepared to execute on our robust growth plan.","Second, we will continue to fund our Egypt and North Sea assets to sustain production and free cash flow. Our returns in these regions are highly competitive, and the free cash flow is critical for funding growth opportunities without resorting to dilutive equity raises.","Finally, we are fortunate to have many quality assets that will compete for capital funding throughout the portfolio. In some situations, when funding availability is scarce, we have the luxury of deferring investments without significantly impacting underlying values.","With that, I will turn the call back over to John.","John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.","Thank you, Steve. Before taking questions, I wanted to make a few closing comments.","Apache used the industry downturn to drive substantial change and improvement. We drastically reduced our cost structure, implemented a rigorous and integrated capital allocation and planning process, upgraded and expanded our drilling inventory, improved our capital efficiency, and positioned ourselves extremely well for the future.","We invested a high percentage of our precious capital in strategic testing and captured the Alpine High play. This significant new discovery reflects not only the company's strategic focus on organic growth, but also highlights the strong technical capabilities that were necessary to discover and secure it.","In 2017, we will continue to manage oil and gas price volatility by setting a reasonable expected price band and gearing our capital spending, return targets, and capital structure to the lower end of that band. Should realized prices come in higher, we will maintain the operational and financial flexibility and optionality to respond accordingly, as we have done in 2016.","Our overall strategic approach will remain unchanged. Apache will live within its means, maintain its strong financial position, continue to build and develop our high-quality drilling inventory, and invest our capital with a primary focus on improving long-term returns and creating shareholder value.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to the operator to begin the Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question is from the line of Ed Westlake with Credit Suisse.","Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Congratulations again on Alpine High. Just on the gas line first, I mean a 30-inch line. Maybe give us some idea of how much capacity that would have because obviously that's probably going to be the governor on the size of the play in the beginning.","John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.","Ed, at this point I don't want to talk about capacity. I think a 30-inch line will tell you that it will move a tremendous amount of gas.","Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","That's what I thought.","John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.","So I just want to leave it at that, because obviously with compression and so forth, you can do a lot there. But we're not in the position to talk about scale. That's just the main trunk line through the field and in terms of what we have to run from north to south.","Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. And then slide 17 caused some debate today. Bone Spring well, obviously great initial rate, and then a decline down to 220 barrels a day. Maybe talk a little bit about the proppant loading, the landings and optimization, because in delineation you're not doing a lot of that. So maybe talk about the hopes you have to improve that performance over time. Obviously this is a short lateral as well.","John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.","I think the first thing is, and Tim Sullivan did a good job in the script of walking through this. What we've got is a hydrocarbon system that has 5,000 feet of stack pay. And so what the purpose of that well really to do was, was to prove that we have oil production at a depth of around 9,000 feet, which confirms our geologic model and our thermal maturity model. So quite frankly, we're very pleased with that well. It's a very short lateral. It's a small frac. It was more designed to test the geologic model and the maturity model. And quite frankly, what's impressive about it is the GOR has been stable and is relatively flat, and you've seen the water lines come down. So we're quite pleased with it.","As we've said all along, we have not tried to drill big press release wells that are going to blow everybody away with their production rates. This was a well that was designed to confirm we have oil production. We have a very rich column all the way from 9,000 feet down to 14,000 feet, which the Redwood confirmed when we move from oil down to wet gas down to dry gas. And the beauty of it is, unlike other plays where you have a 200-foot zone that you're trying to track aerially across windows, we've got such a thick column here and we have the maturity all the way up the column. So all we have to do is move our pole and we will have more oil and so forth.","So as we get into further test points and start to delineate and start to drill some other wells, we'll bring on some other things. But the important point here is it validates there is oil production at 9,100 feet and 43 gravity API, and I think it's something we're very excited about.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good afternoon. John, I was wondering if you could maybe just compare and maybe contrast the opportunity set for oil in the Woodford and Barnett. I think you talked about in the prepared remarks thinking about maybe a 20% oil cut in the Barnett, zero to 20% in the Woodford. And then maybe also talk about how things could play out for the Bone Spring and Wolfcamp.","John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.","Arun, as I just mentioned, we've got a model that is confirmed and has been validated. And really, the oil cut is going to be a function of thermal maturity and the depth of burial. And so as you move up, the only Barnett well we've drilled has a 20% cut. Below that, in the deeper Woodford wells we've drilled, we've anywhere from zero up to 21%.","So the point in this whole thing is that we've got multiple zones across a window, a hydrocarbon system that we know has hydrocarbons ranging from oil from 9,000 feet and probably shallower \u2013 I mean, we've got some other indications it could go shallower \u2013 down to 14,000 feet. So those cuts are going to be a function of which rock we place in those depths. And quite frankly, the transgressive sequence from the Woodford up through the Penn, it really doesn't matter what age it was laid down. It's more a function of where it is in the maturity model. And so as we move up, we will see higher oil cuts, and we're confident in that. And we've got wells that we're drilling that we'll be bringing forth in the future that will design those. You can look at the oil cut in the Mont Blanc 2H, and it's very good at 9,100 feet.","So I've tried to articulate what you've got is a hydrocarbon system, okay, which is unique because we've got five stack pays, different types of rocks. And as you move up, the cuts are all going to be a function of depth and temperature. And that's the good thing about it is everything's been validated and we can predict it, and everything's coming in at or better than our model would suggest.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","That's helpful. And just switching gears a little bit, Steve, I was wondering if you could just comment. In Egypt, they did free float their currency, and there has been a pretty significant devaluation versus the dollar. Can you talk about the impact to Apache in terms of the devaluation?","Stephen J. Riney - Apache Corp.","Yeah, so the direct financial impact is pretty minimal, actually, Arun. By contract, all of our revenues come in U.S. dollars, both on the gas and on the oil side. Oil, we actually export, sell in the open market, and get U.S. dollars into U.S. bank accounts.","On the cost side, we do have some costs that are based in Egyptian pounds, which means that we're a net Egyptian pound buyer. On a quarterly basis, we buy about $100 million worth of Egyptian pounds. And we buy them obviously at a rate at which we would consume them. So the logical conclusion would be that the devaluation would benefit us on the cost side. But actually, we would anticipate that inflation would mostly offset that over time.","And then, just as a general rule, on a day-to-day basis, we generally hold a pretty minimal amount of Egyptian pounds at any one point in time. And just as an example, at September 30 we had a little over $50,000 worth of Egyptian pounds on hand. So the actual exposure to the Egyptian pound in a direct financial basis is pretty minimal. Of course, the more macro issue is that Egypt is going through a very difficult time. They're doing all of the right things, but it's going to be very difficult, and it's going to be tough on the economy, and we obviously keep a very close eye on that.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. Good afternoon. I wanted to follow up on a couple of the earlier questions. First with regards to the midstream and Alpine High, if you can't give us the specifics on the capacity on the gas front that you're trying to expand to at least initially, can you just talk to the CapEx strategy and what we should expect that midstream spending to look like for at least the shorter term, kind of next year, year and a half type piece?","John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.","Brian, when we come out in February with our year-end call and give a look on 2017, we'll give some specific color. Obviously, this year, we've ramped up to $500 million in the Alpine High play, and we said 40% of that would be towards the midstream. I'll say directionally, you'll probably see numbers go up next year in Alpine, but I'm not in a position to give you a whole lot more color than that. I mean, the good news is we can fund it, and we're on a pace to bring on really this first big phase that will carry us through what ultimately would be a bigger build-out in subsequent years. So it'll be done incrementally and in a way that we can handle it.","Stephen J. Riney - Apache Corp.","Yeah, I would also say \u2013 so let's start with the 30-inch trunk line. That is a trunk line through the field, but we have three directions in which we can connect to markets. And eventually I would hope and assume that we would be connected in all three directions, and therefore the trunk line can flow in different directions. And obviously therefore, it's not \u2013 the amount of gas that the field can produce is not limited by a unilateral flow of gas through the trunk line. It can flow in different directions. And then there will be a third connection most likely to the east from the middle of the field over to Waha. So the capacity of the field to produce and transport gas out is not actually limited by one-direction flow of a 30-inch line with compression.","I think you could probably get a pretty good estimate of what the capital costs are going to be over the next few years. We're going to put in all the pipes and the connects over the next two years, 2017-2018. We're actually going to begin construction on the trunk line before the end of this year. So we'll have trunk line connections, hopefully north-south into Waha, and an NGL line, most likely into the Waha direction as well, by the end of 2018. And I think industry estimates probably work to figure out the cost of that. A 60-mile trunk line less than 10 miles to the north and south, and then just less than 50 miles over to Waha.","On the processing side, we're going to be \u2013 you can put in refrigeration units in the 50 million to 100 million cubic feet per day increments. That works economically. And for both processing and compression, an industry cost estimate of somewhere in the $0.40 to $0.60 per cubic feet per day in terms of capital spending is probably a reasonable estimate.","So whatever you're assuming in terms of our development profile and production profile, you can pretty much match a field processing and compression profile with that and get a decent estimate of the capital spending. We do anticipate that we will put in processing and compression capacity in advance of us needing it, so we won't be takeaway constrained \u2013 processing or takeaway constrained. We'll be well deliverability constrained.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great, thank you. And the follow-up is I had a couple small questions on the international front. One, in your prepared comments, you referenced I think a reserve reservoir performance issue in Canada. I just wondered if there's a little bit more color there. And then on the back of Arun's question on Egypt devaluation, do you have confidence that for domestic consumers of oil and gas that the prices will be \u2013 the currency devaluation will be passed along?","John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.","A couple things, Brian. I didn't see anything on a reserve impact in Canada. I'm looking at Steve...","Stephen J. Riney - Apache Corp.","It was the impairment.","John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.","It was the impairment.","Stephen J. Riney - Apache Corp.","So we had an impairment in Canada, and it was due to reserves related to both well performance but also to net-back realizations and the impact on PUDs that were booked at that point in time. So we took a reserve write-down in Canada, and the $355 million pre-tax impairment was related to the reserves.","John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.","In regards to Egypt, Brian, having just gotten back from there the week before last, and my third trip over there, I've actually seen President Al-Sisi twice this year. I've got to give them a lot of credit. They're on the right path. They're doing the right things. They're in the process of securing a loan from the IMF. This is all part of a process to go through and start to take some of the subsidies out and do the things to put the country onto the right track. So I actually feel very good about where things are. Our relationship is good. I think they understand how important Apache is. So we feel very good about that aspect of it. They've just got to go through a reset. And the good news is they're taking this head on and they're working on doing that. So we feel good about our overall situation though.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of John Herrlin with Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale.","John P. Herrlin - Societe Generale","Close enough, guys. Anyway, you're not willing to quite say what you think everything can do with the Alpine High when it's installed and you don't want to front 2017 expenditures. But looking out and saying longer term, what do you think a normalized volume growth model would be for Apache once you're further along versus an also fiscally conservative approach where you're not diluting people, where you're living within your means?","John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.","Obviously, John, you can look at the math, and things change significantly for us starting in the back half of 2017. What I'll say is when we look at the volumes coming out of Alpine High, we're not talking hundreds of millions of cubic feet of gas a day, you're probably talking billions a day with a lot of oil and liquids associated with it. So our profiles are going to change dramatically. I think when we come out in 2017, we'll talk a little bit about 2017, and most of that is going to occur in the back half of 2017. So we'll start to give some color, but it's going to be a different profile then we've probably had in our history.","John P. Herrlin - Societe Generale","Okay, that's fair. Regarding the Midland, a lot of companies now are going out 10,000 feet and beyond. Is that something in your wheelhouse too that you're considering doing?","John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.","Yes. The big controlling factor there, obviously, is the land ownership. We showed a well in the ops report today that's about 8,500 feet. So clearly where we have the land to do that, your limitation isn't the rock in terms of how far you can drill. So we'll be drilling as long laterals as we can and optimizing those on pads.","Timothy J. Sullivan - Apache Corp.","Brian, one comment I might make as well on that is we spent a good portion \u2013 or a good amount of work this year on blocking up our acreage at three of our fields at Powell, Wildfire, and Azalea. And as a result, we feel like about 2\/3 of our locations now will be extended laterals between the mile and a half to two mile.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Bob Brackett with Bernstein Research.","Bob Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","I had a question on \u2013 I hear you saying that you want to live within cash flow to grow this program. Would you consider asset sales as another source of funds to maybe accelerate this program, and are there parts of the portfolio that would be ripe for that?","John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.","Bob, the thing I would say is the good news is our pace for the development of Alpine is going to be governed at the start based on the build-out of the infrastructure and just the amount of time it takes to collect the data and do this properly in a way that's going to maximize the NPV and the returns. So it's not a matter of needing more capital to try to accelerate Alpine, the Alpine High play. It's going to get its capital at that pace. And then amazingly, it becomes cash flow positive pretty fast and self-funding.","I think the bigger question will be as we look at the portfolio, Steve mentioned in his comments, we've got a lot of things we can defer as we have really the last two years. As we shut down, we're doing strategic testing and stuff. Most of our acreage is HBP. We've got a lot of really other attractive plays, and a lot of that will depend on what capital budget we want to run and what price deck we're comfortable spending at in terms of how we feather those in and that sort of thing. If there clearly are things at higher prices that we don't envision ourselves getting to, then obviously we would be looking at some of those options over the next couple years. So those are all things that would be on the table.","Bob Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thanks, and a quick follow-up. Can you talk about the process by which you got board sanction for this big 30-inch pipe big infrastructure investment? Did you present them with a 20-year project asset level, and what was that process like?","John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.","What I would say is they had the scope and scale of the Alpine High. We're in a process where they have seen numbers going into 2017 and have sanctioned those. And the cost of this for what we've got identified looks fantastic, but it is a board-level approval and has been approved by our Board of Directors under our normal course of business.","Operator","And our last question is from the line of David Tameron with Wells Fargo.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks for squeezing me in. John, if I think about \u2013 I know you said you won't comment on 2017, but I'm going to try to ask anyway. If I just think about your regional CapEx mix that was in your slide deck this morning on page 26, you have 50% \u2013 Permian and Alpine High get 50%, and then 50% other are outside of U.S. onshore. Is that the right way to think about it as far as a 2017 number, just based on obviously whatever the cash flow and prices end up being? But is that the right allocation?","John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.","What I would say is Alpine is going to get its capital. We're going to invest to sustain North Sea and Egypt. Permian is going to get a big chunk of its capital. And then how that pie changes is going to be a function of what price deck we're comfortable running with and how much capital we pour. So we've seen a lot of volatility. We've gone from the low $50s to the mid-$40s. And so obviously every $5 of oil price and the movement of gas price means a lot to us in terms of that. So as we start out 2017, a lot of that's just going to hinge on what price we've got we feel comfortable using.","The good news is we made a lot of progress over the last 18 months, not just on our Alpine and just on our Permian. We've got a lot of really strong projects that are very competitive. We've got a nice SCOOP position in the Woodford with 52,000 net and 200,000 gross acres out there, a nice little position in the STACK. You've seen some of the results from some of the Montney and the Duvernay today. So we've got a lot of other quality projects that we're fortunate that we can defer a few of those.","But it's all going to hinge on ultimately where we shake down on the capital plan going into 2017 is going to be where will we'll start. And of course, the main thing is we're going to maintain the flexibility like we did this year by budgeting a little bit conservatively to then react and ramp up because we've got a lot of optionality and a lot of opportunity in our portfolio both within the Permian and the other parts of the portfolio.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay, let me jump real quick to Suriname. Can you just give me your latest and greatest thoughts as far as \u2013 I know Hess made some noise about Liza a few weeks back. But can you just give me some color around that?","John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.","What I'll say is, number one, we completed our 3D shoot on Block 58, so we'll be looking at that. We'll get that seismic in full evaluation sometime next year. So we're excited about Block 58. It's right in the kitchen. We own it 100%. Block 53 we're partners in. we've got 45% of that. We have a commitment well that we're going to spud first quarter, the Kolibri #1. We're very excited about it. It's a very, very strong prospect. There are some follow-on prospects. And quite frankly, it's an exploration well, but it needs to be drilled, and we're very excited about it. But it's exploration, and it will be first quarter of 2017.","Operator","That's all the time for questions we have for today. I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Clark for any closing remarks.","Gary T. Clark - Apache Corp.","Thank you all for joining us today. There were a number of you left in the queue, so if we didn't get to your question, please feel free to reach out to the IR team as always. Thanks.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect."]}}
