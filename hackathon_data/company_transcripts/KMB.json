[Operator Instructions] at the completion of today\u2019s presentation we will open the floor for questions. At that time instructions will be given as to the procedure to follow if you would like to ask a question.","I would now like to turn today\u2019s conference over to Mr. Paul Alexander. Sir, you may begin.","Paul Alexander","Thank you and good morning everyone. Welcome to Kimberly-Clark\u2019s Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Here with me today in Dallas are Tom Falk, Chairman and CEO; Maria Henry, CFO; and Mike Azbell, Vice President and Controller.","Here is the agenda for our call. Maria will begin with a review of our second quarter results, after that Tom will provide his perspectives on our results and the outlook for the full year. We\u2019ll finish with Q&A. As usual we have a presentation of today\u2019s materials in the Investors section of our website. Now as a reminder we will be making forward-looking statements today. Please see the Risk Factors section of our latest annual report on Form 10-K for further discussion of forward-looking statements.","We\u2019ll also be referring to adjusted results and outlook. Both exclude certain items described in this morning\u2019s news release. The news release has further information on these adjustments and reconciliations to comparable GAAP financial measures.","And now I\u2019ll turn it over to Maria.","Maria Henry","Thanks, Paul. Good morning everyone. I am happy to be in my first earnings call as part of the Kimberly-Clark team. I had the opportunity to meet some of you and I am looking forward to meeting many more of you as I begin travelling to meet with investors [indiscernible]. Let me go ahead and turn to our results for the second quarter, starting with some headlines.","First, we achieved organic sales growth of 4%, in line with our full year target of 3% to 5%. Second, we delivered excellent cost savings and margin improvement and solid growth in adjusted earnings per share. And third we continue to improve our capital efficiency and return cash to shareholders.","Now let\u2019s cover the details of our results, second quarter sales were $4.6 billion, that\u2019s down 6% driven by a 10 point drag from currency rates. Organic sales rose 4% highlighted by a 10% increase in our developing and emerging markets. On profitability adjusted gross margin was 35.8% in the second quarter up 140 basis points year-over-year. Adjusted operating margin was 17%, that\u2019s up 130 basis points. Operating margins were up in each major geographic regions North America, developed markets and developing and emerging markets.","Our teams continue to deliver significant cost savings in order to improve profitability and fund the investments that we\u2019re making behind our brands. Second quarter FORCE savings were $105 million equaling our previous all-time high. For the full year we now expect that FORCE savings will be at least $350 million that\u2019s up from our previous expectations of at least $300 million.","In addition our organizational restructuring is on track and generated $20 million of savings in the quarter. Commodities were a $40 million benefit in the quarter mostly from oil based materials. We now expect that deflation for the full year will be between $100 million and $200 million. On the other hand we continue to experience significant currency headwinds the total earnings drag from currency was approximately $0.30 per share in the second quarter.","For the full year, we expect that currency will negatively impact earnings by more than 20%. On the bottom-line, second quarter adjusted earnings per share were $1.41 that\u2019s up 6% year-on-year and includes an approximate 3 point benefit from a lower share account.","Now turning to cash flow and capital efficiency. Cash provided by operations in the second quarter was healthy as $772 million, compared to the year ago quarter that was down $70 million driven by the spin-off of the healthcare business.","Our second quarter working capital cash conversion cycle improved seven days compared to the 2014 full year average. We now expect our full year improvement to be six to seven days and that\u2019s ahead of our original three to four day improvement targets. This is mostly driven by additional progress on payables.","In terms of adjusted return on investment capital halfway through the year we are up 220 basis points including benefits from the spin-offs. We expect full year improvement on ROIC to be at least 250 basis points. On capital allocation, second quarter dividend payments and share repurchases totaled more than $400 million the full year total should be at least $2 billion or about 5% of our current market capitalization.","Now let\u2019s take a look at the segments. In Personal Care, organic sales rose 5%, performance was led by developing in emerging markets where organic sales were up 13%. Overall Personal Care operating margins were 20.5%. The 190 basis point improvement year-on-year was enabled by three things, organic sales growth, cost savings and lower input cost.","Moving on to consumer tissue, organic sales were up 1%, including volume growth of 5% in North America. Consumer tissue operating margins of 17.3% were up 260 basis points. Result from this segment benefited from strong cost savings and lower between the line spending.","In our third segment K-C Professional delivered organic sales growth of 5%. Within that organic sales were up 8% in developing and emerging markets and up 2% in North America. The segment top-line also benefited from sales of nonwovens to Halyard Health in conjunction with a limited term supply agreement. Overall K-C Professional margins were 17.6%, up 20 basis points year-over-year. I am encouraged that K-C Professionals margins remained healthy and above the corporate average.","To summarize, we had a good quarter as we achieved mid-single-digit growth in organic sales and adjusted earnings per share, we delivered strong cost savings and margin improvements and we continue to improve our balance sheet efficiency and allocate capital in shareholder friendly ways.","With that, I\u2019ll now turn it over to Tom.","Thomas Falk","Thanks, Maria and good morning, everyone. I\u2019ll share my perspective on our second quarter results and then I\u2019ll address our full year outlook. So, overall we delivered another quarter of good financial results and we are executing our global business plan strategies very well. As Maria just mentioned our business in developing and emerging markets had another strong quarter and that was led by our Personal Care business.","Organic sales in diapers rose low teens in these markets and we continue to benefit from innovation from expansion of diaper pants from the category development in many areas and from higher net selling prices in some places. And in terms of our key growth markets, organic sales in diapers increased 30% in China where we continue to drive strong growth even though competitive activity has picked up somewhat recently.","Huggies diapers are now sold in about 110 cities in China and that\u2019s up from 105 cities at the end of last year. Our organic sales in diapers also rose by 30% in Eastern Europe the growth this quarter was driven by price increases to offset some of the currency declines that have happened in that market.","In Brazil, our team continues to execute well in a challenging economic environment. Total Personal Care organic sales were up about 10% in Brazil and that included 5% growth in diapers. We\u2019re also doing well in our other Personal Care businesses in developing and emerging markets organic sales in fem care were up double-digits in the second quarter and that included excellent performance in Latin America led by Brazil.","Organic sales also increases strong double-digits in baby wipes and in adult care. And our K-C Professional business had high single-digit organic sales growth in developing and emerging markets in the quarter. So overall we delivered excellent results again in the developing and emerging markets and we expect our momentum to continue there going forward.","Turning to our developed market business outside North America organic sales in the quarter were down slightly. We had solid growth in South Korea, but market conditions were relatively soft in Western and Central Europe. Nonetheless I am encouraged that operating margins were up year-on-year in the developed market overall.","Moving to our North American consumer business, sales volumes were up nicely on a number of brands that included Huggies baby wipes, Goodnites Youth Underpants, Cottonelle bathroom tissue, Viva paper towels. On Huggies diapers while still early day the second quarter relaunched of mainline Huggies Snug N\u2019 Dry diapers is off to a pretty good start.","In terms of upcoming innovations in North America, we have product upgrades coming on both Huggies premium diaper and Pull-Ups training pants and in adult care we\u2019re launching Poise Impressa, which is a unique innovation that helps prevent Light Bladder Leakage. And in K-C Professional North America volumes increased mid-single-digits in our higher margin faster growing wiper and safety products businesses.","In washroom products volumes were up low-single-digits as market conditions continue to improve modestly. Since Maria has already discussed our profitability balance sheet and capital allocation I will just add that I am pleased towards our performance in all of these areas. So all-in-all I am encouraged by our results in the second quarter and in the first half of the year.","Now let\u2019s move on to the outlook for the full year. Our teams continue to focus on delivering their plans for the year and investing further as appropriate for future growth. On the top-line we continue to target organic sales growth of 3% to 5%. With organic sales up 4% halfway through the year we\u2019re in good shape relative to this target.","On the bottom-line we've raised the low end of our previous guidance by $0.05 a share. Our new guidance range for adjusted earnings per share is $5.65 to $5.80 a share. This change reflects our strong performance in the first half of the year and our progress on FORCE costs savings that Maria highlighted.","We\u2019ve also stepped up investments in our brands and our targeted growth initiatives from what we originally planned. As we continue to be optimistic about the growth opportunities that we have in front of us. In terms of external factors our current expectation is that the net impact of changes in currencies, commodities and selling prices probably similar to our original plan that we communicated to you in January. The commodity outlook has improved somewhat, but we expect that price realization will be a little less positive than what we expected earlier in the year. And as we said in April we expect more currency headwinds than we had in our regional plan for the year.","We continue to focus on delivering on our annual commitments that said as you look at the back half of the year I\u2019ll point out that last year\u2019s earnings profile was unusually skew to the third quarter. Third quarter last year had more than normal amount of other income, had a strong quarter in Venezuela and had lower than expected G&A spending.","So in summary we delivered very good results in the first half of the year, we continue to focus on the fundamentals that drive long-term performance and we remain optimistic about our prospects to generate attractive shareholder return.","So that wraps up our prepared remarks and now we\u2019ll begin to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen at this time we\u2019ll open the floor for questions. [Operator Instructions]. The first question will come from Wendy Nicholson with Citi Research. Please go ahead.","Windy Nicholson","Hi, I have two sort of buckets of questions if that\u2019s okay? The first one just on a diaper numbers that you break out, okay so the 5% in Brazil can you clarify how much of that is a slow down just in the macro just in the macro is a slowdown in the consumer off-take, is it inventory destocking and is that number sort of in your mind in terms of what\u2019s going to process over the next couple of quarters? And then totally separately, Maria sort of as you come into the company fresh perspective, new look I mean the FORCE savings that Kimberly has been generating are just phenomenal, and I guess as you look at the cost structure sort of with a fresh set of eyes is this rate of cost cutting sort of something that you think is sustainable for the next few years or are we coming sort of to the end of that part of the story? Thank you.","Thomas Falk","Okay, sure. I\u2019ll take the first one and I\u2019ll let Maria answer the second question. So in terms of Brazil, I mean overall we\u2019re pretty happy with our performance in that market on the consumer side. We didn\u2019t talk much about our KCP business. But on the B2B side that economy has slowed down. There is no question about it and we are seeing that in our KCP sales in the industrial side customers and at this point we\u2019d say that the category is a little slower on the other hand we had a great quarter in fem care. So we\u2019ve been able to bring innovation, we\u2019ve seen that continue to drive the business. And so we\u2019re going to continue to invest in innovation and diapers and we think we can do a little better than we did this quarter overall. But it\u2019s a more challenging market from an economic perspective that\u2019s for sure. Maybe I\u2019ll turn it over to Maria and she can comment on cost saves and her perspective on that.","Maria Henry","Hi Wendy, thanks for the question. On the FORCE savings, first let me say I\u2019m really proud of the Kimberly-Clark organization on a global basis for delivering just an outstanding quarter in FORCE savings of over $100 million in the second quarter. If you look at the rates for the - of at least $350 million. That\u2019s a really strong savings rate and I believe that we can continue to do this. If I think about the percentage of annual savings that we\u2019re able to deliver off of our cost of goods sold base we are in a good place in terms of what we are delivering and with the addition of Sandra MacQuillan to our team, who is our new Head of Global Supply Chain. I think Sandra will be able to work with the teams around the globe to unlock some additional savings as we go. So I feel really good about the rate of savings that we are delivering and I\u2019m very confident that we\u2019ll able to continue to deliver strong productivity in our supply chain area.","Operator","Thank you for your question. The next question will come from Bill Schmidt with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Russell William Schmidt","Hi guys, good morning.","Thomas Falk","Hey, Bill.","Russell William Schmidt","Hey, a couple of questions. Can we just like draw a little bit deeper in the emerging markets starting with Brazil. I think if you look at some of the shared data of Hyper Mark [ph] out which is value brand is gaining share do you think that\u2019s a change in sort of consumer preference or is it macro, is it permanent? And then I think SA [ph] also exited the market. So is that an opportunity and then in China can you just talk about I think you said 110 cities now. What\u2019s the sort of end state opportunity is like how many cities aren\u2019t you in and then what channels and price tiers maybe? And then lastly on Russia I just wanted to check on the health of the distributors and how they are getting [indiscernible] product in and if there is I think you can just sort of help them out given the macro? And then I have a follow up if I can.","Thomas Falk","Okay sure. If I remember all those also Brazil I\u2019d say EPRA markets is up a little bit and that business is for sale, as you probably know I think there is some stuff that they are doing a kind of push those sales in the short-term. I wouldn\u2019t say we\u2019ve seen a lot of trading down in this market and spend the consumer shock hasn\u2019t been as big as you\u2019ve seen in other economies over time and so you are seeing a huge trade down at this point and we\u2019re still driving premiumization across our line up in Brazil and you saw that in the fem care numbers as we launch better performing products that consumers want to trade up on that front. So again I\u2019d say the news of FCA leaving in some consolidation there I mean there are probably more competitors in Brazil today than your normal market at this stage. And so it\u2019s not unusual to see a little bit of consolidation happening and typically that\u2019s good for the big global players.","In China we are at 110 and I\u2019d say it\u2019s truly every city you add is a little smaller than the last, on the other hand these cities still have like a million people and so they are pretty good sized and there still quite a bit of opportunity. I would say at least 200 cities in terms of channels. We are actually really developing e-commerce quite well and we\u2019re also spending a lot of time on the premium baby stores and those are both rapidly growing channels. Today probably a third of our diapers sales in China are done through e-commerce and the baby stores are a real super-premium channel where all the high end products are typically sold and you don\u2019t see much in the value segment in that space.","I don\u2019t expect we\u2019re going to go deep into the low tiers in China, we\u2019ve got quite a bit of growth ahead of us in the mid to premium tiers and expect us to stay in that space. And on Russia, I was in Russia earlier this year actually I met with one of our KCP distributors and at that point they seem to be managing through the prices pretty well probably we\u2019re little more optimistic than even I was going in terms how things were going to play out. I think the oil prices has stayed down little longer is probably going to put a little bit more pressure on that economy. So it\u2019s something that we\u2019re continuing to watch, we do manufacture now in Russia so that does help us a bit in some of our cost base in local currency and doesn\u2019t require us to import as much, but that\u2019s a challenging market for sure and we\u2019ll keep an eye on that going forward.","Russell William Schmidt","Great, thanks. And if I just ask one follow-up on fem care in North America, I mean the category itself is pretty soft I think the shares are little soft as well is any of that due to your now having like a focus competitor in Edge well and obviously they have some pretty ambitious growth targets. So are you seeing a lot more aggressive competitive activity from them?","Thomas Falk","I would say there was a little bit more competitive noise in fem care in the last quarter that accounts for some of the share decline, we\u2019re also looking to see are we executing as well as we could and we have enough news and innovation in commercial activity, but I would say that was a soft spot for us in the consumer business in the second quarter.","Operator","Thank you for your question. Our next question will come from Ali Dibadj with Sanford. Please go ahead.","Ali Dibadj","Hey, how are you? So, couple of questions. One is I want to dig into Personal Care just a little bit more in terms of where your growth is coming from clearly it\u2019s the emerging and developing world. That growth rate again continues to slow, it\u2019s still good that continues to slow. So trying to get a sense of where you think that kind of growth rate gets to on a steady state, you say the momentum is continuing, but is that momentum is slowing momentum, so that\u2019s one part of the Personal Care of business. And then the other part I want to get a little bit more into the details of the Snug and Dry re-launch in the U.S. so it still looks like the North America business for you on Personal Care isn\u2019t really showing great results from the Snug and Dry launch is it just too early because on the other hand in the Nielsen data it looks like you might be seeing some improvement, so want to really understand what we should expect from Snug and Dry in particular and how you think that may change your Personal Care results in the U.S. going forward? So those two pieces first please.","Thomas Falk","Okay. So Personal Care growth rate, I mean we\u2019ve said high single low double-digit growth in developing and emerging markets for us going forward and Personal Care is going to be the centerpiece of that and while there is some little bit of growth slowdown in some places there is also new markets that we\u2019re continuing to open up like Nigeria and Kenya and places like that where there is pretty high birth rate.","So we do feel like there is a pretty long way to go to continue to penetrate these categories and GDP per capita is still improving even though the overall economic growth rate is slowing in some of these markets. And so consumers have more purchasing power in their pocket to buy our products going forward. And so we also see categories like Adult Care, baby wipes that are still very under penetrated as we bring those into those markets there is a big opportunity to build those out overtime. And so we\u2019ve got some GDP per capita levers to drive that we\u2019ve got some new category expansion to drive as well as some still some remaining geographic expansion to drive it and those factors I think will provide a lot of growth for us for future.","On the Snug and Dry re-launch I mean if you look at kind of the spread I think if you look at the Nielsen data and probably say we were up a percent in the quarter that\u2019s probably pretty consistent as we would look at our consumption or our shelf off take would be pretty similar to that as we look at it across the parts of the category that aren\u2019t covered by Nielsen and our sales were down about a percent, our share was up about half a point sequentially. And so the difference between our sales and the retail consumption is probably inventory change in channels which obviously going to be sustained.","So we\u2019d say we\u2019re broadly on track with our expectation on that re-launch and pretty good execution across retail consumers like the product the early reads and all the social media activity is very high four and five star ratings. And so that\u2019s kind of what we\u2019re looking for and expect to continue to drive that in the back half, we\u2019ve also got some news coming on the super-premium end of our Huggies line up, which will help that, we haven\u2019t seen much canalization on little bit of share growth that we\u2019ve had which is great. So, so far I think the team we would say we\u2019re pretty much on track.","Ali Dibadj","Okay. And then follow-up just on a former response in terms of Personal Care in the emerging market, I mean I guess just to be very specific, do you expect the growth rate to continue to slow given kind of large numbers et cetera as it has done. So maybe answer that and I\u2019ll come back with another one.","Thomas Falk","I mean I think it was what 11 in the first quarter and 10 this quarter. So I would say that\u2019s a modest slow down. But I would expect we\u2019re going to be in that high single-digit, low double-digit range for a while I mean they vary a little bit depending on the quarter and what\u2019s going on.","Ali Dibadj","Okay, cool thank you. So my last one is just around the CapEx uptick that we saw in a part has been see it. But can you give us a sense of where that's from what we should expect going forward?","Thomas Falk","Yeah we\u2019ll probably move to Maria you can add some color on this, but we\u2019re probably a little ahead of our typical run rate it seems to be more backend loaded. But I think we\u2019re still expecting to be in the range, but Maria I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve got any other color you want to add to that?","Maria Henry","Yeah, I think that's right. I would expect given where we are and the projects that we have on top for the second half that we will come out at the high end of our CapEx range for the year.","Thomas Falk","More of it's outside the U.S. than inside, as you would expect.","Operator","Thank you for your question. The next question will come from Gail Glazerman with UBS.","Gail Glazerman","Hi, good morning.","Thomas Falk","Hey, Gail.","Gail Glazerman","Can you talk a little bit detail about what\u2019s going on in the U.S. bath tissue market. You guys obviously had great volume probably due to promote. How do you see the overall spend in the promo activity there?","Thomas Falk","Yes, probably competitive activity has probably picked up just a little bit. We are continuing to do well with Cottonelle and have seen that take off another selling quarter behind Cottonelle Scott Tissue is also continuing to do well in the market. So probably maybe the competitive frequency has picked up just a bit and you are seeing that a little bit in the pricing number. Some of our price numbers as well affected some of the promotional timing. And so I wouldn't necessarily say that the uptick this quarter was fully reflective about what's happened in the market. Some of it had more to do with timing of promotions than the overall market activity.","Gail Glazerman","Okay and depends from of course the birth rate is starting to pick up and I was just wondering if you could just talk about are you starting just kind of see them, what are you thinking as you look out over the next year or two?","Thomas Falk","Yeah, we\u2019ve seen that as well and so it\u2019s small positive upward momentum, which as we\u2019ve been talking about for a while. The things that have been more predictive of that our male unemployment, household formation and consumer confidence and we\u2019re seeing slow steady progress in those in the U.S. economy and that's just driving the birth rate up a bit which is good.","Gail Glazerman","Alright. And in terms of your deflation outlook for the year, can you just talk a little bit about where you expect to see the incremental deflation over the second half, I mean what is the little bit better than what you might have expected three months ago?","Thomas Falk","Yeah, pretty much all of our deflation is oil related material. So if you look at pulp and secondary fiber those are pretty close to our original estimates for the year. So we\u2019re not seeing those move around much, I mean eucalyptus is a little stronger, [indiscernible] is a little weaker and so the net-net it's about where we thought it was going to be. And so it's more polymer super absorbent, things like adhesives, packaging materials anything that's made out of a petroleum molecule. Obviously with oil being a little lower than... for a little longer than maybe we thought in our original guidance more that\u2019s kind of flowing through in our lower material cost than we would have expected at the beginning of the year. Most of that lines up in Personal Care from a segment stand point. So consumer tissue and KCP don't get too much of that.","Operator","Thank you for your question. [Operator Instructions] The next question will come from Nick Moody [ph] with RBC. Please go ahead.","Unidentified Analyst","Yeah, thanks for the question. Just two real quick one for me. Tom, maybe if you could just remind us on how you are thinking about acquisitions in terms of criteria and if you were to do an acquisition it's just really kind of building scale in existing categories or would you look at kind of wide space? And then the second question is on e-commerce it\u2019s obviously becoming a very important trend for some of your categories so just wanted to get an update on that side of the business? Thanks.","Thomas Falk","Absolutely yeah the M&A we have not been big acquires and so where we have done things has been more tuck-in and I think we\u2019ve got so many great organic growth opportunities in our businesses around the world that we really want to make sure we're fully funding those and that we're resourcing those in the right way and that's I think the most valuable form of growth for our shareholders and we want to make sure we\u2019re pursuing that. And so there may be tuck-ins and individual markets that we've considered from time to time, but we want to make sure we deliver on our organic growth framework.","On the e-com front, we basically we want to make sure that our products are available wherever mom wants to shop. And so if she is shopping at a nearby traditional retail outlet that's great we want to make sure we\u2019re there with the right offer and the right product form. If she wants to shop online absolutely we want to make sure she can find Huggies and are lineup is easy to navigate and we will make it easier to find what she needs there.","And so we try to make sure that we\u2019re building capability around the world where e-commerce is developing in where mom wants to shop. So that we have the skill sets to make sure that our products is represented in a digital space at the same level of professionalism that is represented in a physical store. And so that\u2019s something that we\u2019ve learned we\u2019re probably in the front foot on that in China. We\u2019re probably little late to the game in the U.S. but we\u2019re catching up quick. And that we\u2019re kind of monitoring and investing ahead of the curve and individual markets around the world where we see e-commerce starts to play out.","Unidentified Analyst","Great. And Tom is there any way you can give us just rough how big the current e-commerce business is and how fast it\u2019s growing just so have a sense of reference?","Thomas Falk","Yeah, I mean the statistics are probably difficult because if you sell to an offline retailer who has an online presence it's hard to tell exactly what flow through each part of their business, but it varies quite a bit by markets on the U.S. it\u2019s probably less than 5% of our sales, in China and our diaper business is probably a third of our sales. In Korea from a category standpoint in the diaper space it's approaching 60% of the category. And so overall it's probably still in the 5% or less of our sales just because some of our categories like tissue and KCP are not as well developed from an e-com standpoint yet.","Unidentified Analyst","Excellent, thank you so much. Thanks.","Thomas Falk","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question will come from the Caroline Levy with CLSA. Please go ahead.","Caroline Levy","Good morning. Thank you very much.","Thomas Falk","Good morning, Caroline.","Caroline Levy","I just wanted to ask a couple of things on the U.S. the adult diaper business and the fem care business. Can you talk about the competitive environment and what the outlook is for innovation there and is P&G growing the adult category or are you seeing some share loss there?","Thomas Falk","Yeah. I think in adult care Procter re-launched last year with their always discrete product and category growth rates did pick up. We lost a little less than our fair share of market share. Probably done a little bit better on the Depend side, they picked up a little bit more share on with always discrete against Poise, but private label and SCA kind of brand loss probably disproportionately more share than we did. If you look at the second quarter both Depend and Poise our share was up about a point sequentially but we were still down year-over-year from where the launch had occurred. It\u2019s quite a bit of innovation happening we\u2019ve launched quite a bit of new products over the last year or so and with more coming under both Depend and Poise. The most recent launch news is a totally new product called Poise Impressa which we had in test market in Kansas City and this is a product that actually helps prevent bladder leakage. And so it\u2019s a new space and we're going to be investing behind that in the later part of the year.","On fem care again we talked about that a little bit earlier probably a little bit more competitive promotion activity in the quarter I think we are down about a point year-on-year and pretty flat sequentially on share, but some of it is the categories more competitors some of it we\u2019re going to make sure we're doing all the right things to execute in that space. So we\u2019re making sure we got the right offer in the right messaging to drive that category.","Caroline Levy","Thanks. And then just a follow-up on China, can you help us scale how important that business is to you because it\u2019s been growing so fast for so long it wasn\u2019t necessarily disproportionately large within the whole business Brazil was generally your biggest market can you help us just understand the key drivers of EM?","Thomas Falk","Brazil still the biggest at about $1 billon and China is gaining fast. So it\u2019s what Paul probably 3% of sales something like that.","Paul Alexander","Yeah. China was 3% in the full year of last year and it\u2019s going to be a bigger percentage this year.","Caroline Levy","Thanks so much.","Thomas Falk","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you for your question. [Operator Instructions] The next question will come from Christ Ferrara with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Christopher Ferrara","Hey, good morning guys.","Thomas Falk","Good morning Chris.","Christopher Ferrara","Good morning. Wanted to dig a little bit more into I guess the specifics around U.S. volume, so it sounds like you guys in the press release you called out volume being down slightly in adult child and diapers and I guess specifically diapers the gap there with Nielsen is really wide right, so Nielsen showing something like mid-single-digits volume increases during those months then you have Unilever this morning talking destalking in the U.S. so I am wondering can you reconcile that a little bit I know it\u2019s Nielsen, but the volume piece specifically I guess?","Thomas Falk"," Yeah I mean as we would look at the - Ali asked this question a little bit earlier, as we would look at the U.S. diaper category in the quarter we\u2019d say looking at everything that we can see and from a consumption standpoint shelf off take was probably plus 1 and our volume was minus 1 on diaper. And so there is a little bit of inventory change some of it also has to do with that we shift some of the promotional activity in March for some of the snug and dry re-launch that that would up selling through in the second quarter. And so I would say we\u2019re about on track with our expectations from that standpoint. And our stuff typically is pretty high queue, pretty high velocity. So there is usually not very large inventory swings. So we wouldn\u2019t typically see a big destocking effect.","Christopher Ferrara"," Okay, great. And then can we talk about the incremental brand, I mean I guess that\u2019s above and beyond what you\u2019d expected I think you sort of framed it around continued optimism around growth opportunity. So I guess can you talk about how much of that incremental brand investment you expect to be in the form of pricing right, which kind of came up a little over this quarter versus advertising behind initiatives?","Thomas Falk","Yeah. I think the way I would think about it is yeah we\u2019re little bit ahead of our plan so far this year and we want to make sure we deliver the plan, but we also if we have the opportunity to invest more in innovation or in some of our key markets where we\u2019ve got good growth opportunities in a strategic way we\u2019re going to look for opportunities to do that in the back half and maybe more than we have in past years, which is a great opportunity for our teams to be whether they\u2019re thinking about where do I cut programming to make the year we\u2019re looking at and we fully funded here the things that we can do to increase our investment.","So, where we\u2019ve had good innovation, where we\u2019ve god market momentum those would be the kind of places that we\u2019d been asking those questions it would be much more strategic front, but I\u2019d say advertising as part of it, digital coupon I guess another part some of that stuff might wind up as a reduction of sales if it\u2019s a digital coupon, but it\u2019s going to be more strategic rather than any kind of price cutting.","Christopher Ferrara","And just to be clear you guys have considered this more offensive than defensive relative to competition?","Thomas Falk","Yeah. I think in general yeah, you want to make sure if you have competitive threats in markets though that you are fully defending. So we\u2019ve mentioned that the China diaper - with the right offer and [indiscernible]. So I think there is an element where you plan to offence and you also want to make sure you\u2019re fully competitive.","Christopher Ferrara","Got it. Thanks a lot.","Thomas Falk","Thanks Chris.","Operator","Thank you for your question. The next question will come from Olivia Tong with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Thomas Falk","Good morning Olivia.","Olivia Tong","Good morning. How are you?","Thomas Falk","Pretty good.","Olivia Tong","Good. So first question, just want to dig a little bit deeper into the earnings outlook because you raise your expectations on commodities enforced by let\u2019s call about $100 million cumulatively. And clearly that\u2019s slightly offset by the slight uptick in currency pressure, but it doesn\u2019t seem to be flowing fully through to your earnings outlook. So is it a function some of the incremental brand investment that you just refer to? So or is it another thing so maybe can you talk through some of the puts and takes that offset some of the positives on the expense line to start?","Thomas Falk","Yeah, that\u2019s the right way to think about it. We took the guidance up, the bottom end of the range up a nickel and that's part of it. We had better - a little bit better commodities we expected a little bit worst currency than we expected and then we took FORCE cost savings are tracking ahead of plan and we\u2019re investing some of that strategically in key markets and products in the back half of the year. So you get the right elements and the mix of that is what translates into the guidance.","Olivia Tong","Got it thank you. And then just two follow-up questions, first on North American diapers, is Huggies spending right now fully rolled out and as you think about sort of rebuilding share at the low end how concern are you about the competitive environment at the entry level price points given where commodities are right now? And how do you think about the price volume mix? How do you think that looks going forward? And then just overall on the promotional environment which you referenced a couple of times already, but how is the competitive environment looking right now overall? I mean we talked a little bit about North American consumer tissue, but just to reassume your thoughts on the overall basis as well? Thanks so much.","Thomas Falk","Sure. Yeah on diapers I mean, I think the near-term commodity weakness isn't resulting in any significant price movement and if you kind of look at over the last couple of years we\u2019ve had pretty good amount of commodity increases, but there was no price recovery for us. So if you looked at the net-net of it we are still even though the deflation we\u2019re going to have this year is less than the inflation we had last year that we didn't get any pricing for. So I would say in the range that we are in I don't think it's going to move price significantly. I also think the consumer is in the stronger position than they were a year ago. And so we want to make sure that we get the right offer and that we get a very good performing product at a competitive price in the market place, which is sort of in the heritage of Huggies for many years and we\u2019re really making sure we stay true to that.","In terms of the competitive environment, if you look all over the world there is plenty of people that get up every morning wanting to take your business. And so we look at the Japanese competitors, [indiscernible] are quite aggressive local Chinese competitors like [indiscernible] are aggressive, we got local competitors in Latin America with CMPC and then SCA is popping up in lots of places. So and obviously P&G is a formidable global competitor as well. So we know we've got to be moving pretty fast every day to bring right innovation to execute well in the market to continue to deliver on our business plans and our teams are up for that challenge.","Olivia Tong","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you for the question. [Operator Instructions] The next question will come from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Lauren Lieberman","Thanks, good morning.","Thomas Falk","Familiar with Barclays it\u2019s great.","Lauren Lieberman","Actually this is Lieberman regardless. Can you talk a little bit again sorry to beat a dead horse, but just on fem care at least in the Nielsen data, it looks like private label has actually been gaining some ground. So when you are talking about kind of making sure you have the right offerings and revisiting market again and so is it primarily what you are seeing day to day as well the private label is the really the one kind of making some inroads?","Thomas Falk","Finally the shares are up a little bit I'm just kind of looking at the share data. But it's.... I don't know if you get it Paul.","Paul Alexander"," About a point.","Thomas Falk","About a point. But I would say it's been more the competitive price points from some of those smaller players in the market that has been making some noise, as we\u2019ve last year consolidated our everything under the U by Kotex name and that execution went pretty well. But we still think with that we can do even better in terms of how we merchandise that in store and make sure we\u2019ve got the right product and right offer. Our super-premium our U by Kotex line was a little slower growth this quarter and so that's one that we are really focusing on and make sure we got the right innovation messaging there. And so again some of it\u2019s the category and some of it is we probably say we can do better on the innovation and execution front.","Lauren Lieberman","Okay. And as you are thinking about the reinvestment dollars the back half of the year and even further beyond, how much of that mix is skewing online social et cetera? Particularly I think about things like where to reach people entering the fen care category, what you'll be doing with Impressa going forward and what\u2019s your kind of learning trajectory on how to do online best?","Thomas Falk","That's a great question, and that\u2019s something that we\u2019re spending a lot of time on and so we\u2019ve got lots of digital marketing work going on all over the world and are trying to make sure we\u2019re investing in that capability in each individual market and then where we find something that work to share best practices at a faster pace. And so I think that\u2019s something that every CPG out there is doing. And particularly in the target market of fem care for late teen girls I mean they are very connected in their social experience and we want to make sure that we\u2019re relevant there.","So for example in China with our re-launch of our Kotex brand there it\u2019s been nearly 100% digital marketing really almost no network TV in that space just because of the importance of that channel that consumer. And so we\u2019ve had some real successes and we\u2019ve also learn some things along the way of what not to do and but we\u2019ve got a lot of good work going on in that space.","Lauren Lieberman","When did Kotex re-launch in China?","Thomas Falk","We launch that it was like early last year or late \u201813?","Paul Alexander","Yes.","Thomas Falk","Late \u201813 I think was the first shipment that really kind of sort hit strides in \u201814.","Lauren Lieberman","Okay. And then in - fem care in Brazil couple of times today, so was there also a re-launch for Kotex in Brazil?","Thomas Falk","Yeah. Our brand there is Intimus like Kotex which is a brand that we acquired, but we\u2019re upgrading that with some of the global innovation that we\u2019ve done in other markets along the lines of the U by Kotex things that we\u2019ve done in the U.S. and seeing a very good response when we picked up brand leadership in Brazil in fem care for the first time in the long time and have good momentum going in that market.","Lauren Lieberman","Okay, great. Last details is it branding on end product in terms of you by Kotex carry over in the U.S. or is it just sort of the product itself?","Thomas Falk","It\u2019s more of the product itself and it\u2019s actually it\u2019s more of a global innovation a lot of the stuff that U.S. guys are launching that was invented in Korea or China or elsewhere and so that global team is probably doing the best job of any that we have of driving an idea consistently around the world. Five years ago probably would have been our most disapproved product form everywhere and today we\u2019re all on went roughly the same product chasse we\u2019re trying to take that learning and do it other areas so some of the things we\u2019re doing on diaper pants and baby wipes are tapping into that where our local teams still have local optimization, but we\u2019re able to drive a more consistent message around the world.","Lauren Lieberman","Okay. So, thanks so much.","Thomas Falk","Thanks, Lauren.","Operator","Thank you for your questions. [Operator Instructions]","Paul Alexander","Alright. Since we have no more questions on the line we thank you for your interest today and we\u2019ll close with the comment from Tom.","Thomas Falk","Once again a good quarter of top and bottom line results and good execution by the team and we really appreciate your interest and support in Kimberly-Clark.

Welcome to our first quarter earnings conference call. Here with me today in Dallas are Tom Falk, Chairman and CEO; Mark Buthman, Senior VP and CFO; and Mike Azbell, Vice President and Controller.","Here is the agenda for our call. After an opening comment from Tom, Mark will begin with the review of first quarter results. He will also provide an update on the strategic changes we are making in Europe. Tom will then provide his perspectives on our results and the outlook for the full year, and we will finish with Q&A. We have a presentation of today\u2019s materials in the Investors section of our website, which is kimberly-clark.com.","We will be making forward-looking statements today. Please see the Risk Factors section of our latest Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of forward-looking statements. We will also be referring to adjusted results and outlook. Both exclude certain items described in this morning\u2019s news release. The release has further information on these adjustments and reconciliations to comparable GAAP financial measures.","Now, I will turn it over to Tom.","","Tom Falk","Well, good morning everyone. I just thought it would be appropriate for me to start this morning by commenting that we are well aware that the eyes of the nation are on the events that are unfolding this morning in Boston, and I just like to start by offering our condolences regarding the tragic event that happened earlier this week in Boston, and please know that the thoughts and prayers of everyone at Kimberly-Clark as well as those of the entire nation are with the families of the victims of this terrible event.","I\u2019d also like to let you know that we are sitting down here in Dallas, Texas very close to the small town of West Texas, and so we would like to also extend our deepest sympathies to our neighbors to the south as they deal with the aftermath of the explosion of the fertilizer plant that happened at that small community this week. So, it\u2019s truly been a difficult week for Americans in various places across the country. So, I just thought we should start with that and remind everyone what\u2019s really important going on around us today, but with that, I will turn it over to Mark Buthman.","","Mark Buthman","Okay, thanks Tom. Good morning everyone. Let me start with the headlines. First, we achieved organic sales growth of 3% that included increases of 6% in our North American consumer tissue business and 5% in K-C International. Second, we delivered adjusted earnings per share of $1.48, that\u2019s an all-time record and up 19% year-on-year boosted by strong cost savings. And third, we continue to allocate capital in shareholder friendly ways through dividends and share repurchases.","Now, let\u2019s cover the details of the quarter. First quarter sales were $5.3 billion, up 1% versus last year. Underlying organic sales rose 3% versus a tough comparison of 6% growth a year ago. The results this quarter were driven by increased volumes of 2%, higher net selling prices of 1%. Unfavorable currency rates and lost sales in conjunction with our restructuring activities each reduced sales by 1 point. First quarter adjusted gross margin was 34.6%. It\u2019s up 140 basis points from last year. The increase was driven by organic sales growth and $85 million of FORCE cost savings partially offset by $35 million of input cost inflation. We are off to a great start with our FORCE program this year relative to our full year target of $250 million to $300 million. Our teams are pushing hard to free up funds to reinvest to field our business and to drive additional bottom line growth.","Moving down to P&L between the line spending increased 10 basis points as a percent of sales and that was driven by small increases in G&A. Strategic marketing spending was down slightly, mostly due to the timing of innovation launches, which relative to last year are going to be more towards the latter part of the year. Other income and expense benefited from a gain in the sale of some non-core assets.","Adjusted operating profit rose 16% with an operating margin of 16%, that\u2019s up 200 basis points compared to prior year. Really encouraged by our margin performance to start the year as both our growth and operating margins were highest we have achieved in 3.5 years. The first quarter adjusted effective tax rate was 30.8% now that\u2019s up from last year but its in-line with our full year targeted at 30% to 32%. Equity income was up 36% in the quarter as K-C Mexico had a great start to the year. So putting it all together, first quarter adjusted earnings per share rose 19% to a $1.48 as well above of what we expected three months ago and plus continued momentum in KC International, strong cost savings and above plant volume growth in our North American consumer tissue business. Now turning to cash flow, cash provided by operations in the first quarter $607 million that\u2019s up 4% year-on-year. The improvement was driven by earnings growth, a smaller increase in working capital relative to last year now is partially offset by higher cash debt payments.","We continue to allocate capital and shareholder from ways with the first quarter dividend payments in share repurchases totally nearly $800 million. In February we announced our 41st consecutive annual increase in the dividend, the 9.5% increase should help maintain our position as a top-tier dividend payer. In addition we repurchased $0.5 billion of KMB stock in the quarter. We continue to expect full year repurchases to be between 1 billion and 1.2 billion. Now I\u2019m going to highlight a few areas from our segment results for the quarter. We first look here organic sales growth is 4% with volume growth of 3% and net selling prices up 1 point. Compared to a tough comparison of the year, our toughest comparison for the year KC International had another good quarter with organic sales up 7%. We continue to make excellent progress with targeted growth initiatives in KCI. This momentum helped offset volume declines in Venezuela and in Australia where heavy diaper promotions last year affected the comparison. Tom will talk more about KCI in minute. Also in Personal Care organic sales were flat in North America and up double digits in Europe.","First quarter Personal Care operating margins of 18.4% rose a 150 basis points. Improvement was driven by organic sales growth, cost savings and higher production volumes personally offset by increased by between the lines investment, cost inflation and unfavorable currency effects.","Moving to consumer tissue, organic sales were up 5%, a volume growth of 4% and slightly higher selling prices. The volume increase was highlighted by double digit growth in North America for high margin Cottonelle bath tissue and KLEENEX, Facial Tissue both brands improved market shares in the quarter. In addition, Cottonelle benefited from increased promotions support in a strong cold flu season help boast KLEENEX volumes. Consumer tissue operating margins rose 200 basis points in the quarter. Margins benefited from organic sales growth, cost savings and lower between the lines spending partially offset by cost inflation.","Turning to KC Professional, organic sales were even with last year has improved pricing in (inaudible) set by slightly lower volumes. Despite a relatively flat top-line our KCP team continues to drive our profitability by delivering cost savings and improving mix. First quarter operating margins of 18% were up 230 basis points year-on-year. Lastly healthcare organic sales were down 1% driven by lower surgical and infection prevention volumes which were impacted by a slowdown in surgical procedures in the U.S. in the first quarter. Operating margins were down 200 basis in the fourth quarter, overall healthcare results were behind plan but our team is focused on improving performance throughout the balance of the year. Before I turn it over to Tom let me update you on a strategic changes we\u2019re making in Europe. Overall we\u2019re moving quickly to implement the changes. We\u2019re on track with our operating plan for the year.","We have stopped selling Huggies diapers in 13 countries so far. We expect to exit the remaining five markets in this second quarter so the impact on our top-line will build over the remaining part of the year. Our diaper facility in the UK will start production mid-March and our Spanish facility is likely to close in May. We have also reached agreements to sell our polish consumer tissue business and that transaction is expected to close on the third quarter. Given our progress so far we have narrowed our estimate for cumulative charges by raising the low end of the range by $50 million, we continue to expect the cash cost will be 50% to 60% of the total charges for the restructuring program. Now regarding the brands we\u2019re retaining in Europe it's solid performance in the first quarter and as bath tissue volumes improved and our market share rose into the high 30s, in Personal Care, Huggies baby wipes volumes grew at a double-digit rate. So, we got more work ahead of us in the next two quarters will be important as we shed additional sales in overhead cost, but I am confident that our European team has focused and now execute the plan very well. So, that wraps up my comments.","To recap, we generated solid organic sales growth. We delivered strong margins, an all-time record adjusted earnings per share, and we continue to allocate capital in shareholder friendly ways. Now, I will turn it over to Tom.","","Tom Falk","Thanks Mark, and since Mark has reviewed the quarter in detail, I will just add that our overall results were excellent. So, we are only one quarter into the year and we have got more work to do, but I am pleased with our solid organic sales growth, our strong margin improvement, record earnings per share, and our capital allocation, which was very shareholder friendly.","So, I want to focus my comments this morning on our consumer businesses in North America and K-C International, and then I will talk about our full year outlook. So, let me start with North American consumer. The two primary objectives for this business this year are to improve our brand positions and to increase our operating profit, and we are off to a very good start in both areas. In terms of market positions, we improved or maintained market share in 7 of the 8 consumer categories that we track. And that included solid gains in Kleenex facial tissue, Pull-Ups training pants, Huggies baby wipes, U by Kotex feminine care products and our Poise and Depend brands. As Huggies diapers were shared through down about 1 point versus the last year quarter, we are currently launching our best ever snug and dry diaper and an improved slip on diaper.","So, regarding the bottom line, our North American consumer business had a very good quarter with excellent FORCE savings, improved manufacturing costs, and volume growth in our high margin brands, including Poise, Depend, and Pull-Ups. Now, that\u2019s particularly true in consumer tissue, where volumes for our Kleenex and our Cottonelle brands were very strong as Mark mentioned. Although that level of volume growth would be tough to repeat, we are encouraged by our momentum that we are optimistic about our second quarter innovation that we have got coming on both of those brands. So, I am pleased with our overall performance in our North American consumer business.","Now, let\u2019s shift to K-C International. Our first quarter organic sales growth was more than 5% and that\u2019s consistent with our first quarter plan for the year. KCI faced it\u2019s most difficult comparison of the year in the first quarter with 13% organic sales growth in the base period last year, and we continued to expect that KCI will deliver high single-digit organic sales growth for the full year. Working together with our global brand teams, KCI is making further progress with these growth initiatives. In diapers, we continued to innovate across our portfolio and we have expanded diaper pants in the more parts of the world, but that strategy continues to deliver strong results in key markets.","In China, where Mark and I were just visiting recently, our diaper volumes increased 50% and they have benefited from innovation, market share gains, and category growth. Huggies are now available in 85 cities in China, and that\u2019s up from about 80 cities at the end of last year. In Russia, our diaper volumes increased by about 10% in the quarter. As in Brazil, diaper volumes were up by about 5% and were affected as expected by selling price increases that we recently implemented because of the weaker real. The increased pricing and improved product mix brought total organic sales growth in Brazil for diapers to be about 15%. And in all three of these markets, we have premium diaper innovation launching in the second quarter. We also have new manufacturing facilities starting up in China and Brazil to support our growth plans. And other businesses within K-C International are feminine care organic sales were up high single-digits and we continue to rollout premium executions that are very similar to the U by Kotex launch in North America.","And finally, in adult care and baby wipes both of these businesses delivered double-digit organic sales growth in the quarter building on our momentum that we achieved last year. And just like we have got in North America, we are building the adult care category in K-C International with our Poise and Depend brands. And in baby wipes, we have good momentum in South Korea and Latin America, and we will be expanding capacities to support our growth plans. So, overall, we remain very excited about our prospects to drive strong top and bottom line growth in K-C International.","Now, let me turn to the outlook. In terms of our 2013 earnings guidance, we are now targeting adjusted earnings per share in a range of $5.60 to $5.75, raising about $0.10 higher than our previous outlook and reflects our strong first quarter performance and our plans to continue to reinvest back in the business for our long term success. We expect to make additional progress on targeted growth initiatives with a particular focus on KC International and we have a lot of innovation coming in the balance of the year and we will support that innovation and these growth initiatives with higher levels of strategic marketing. We also got a number of new assets starting that will support our growth plans later this year. The same time we will continue to focus on generating cost savings to make sure we can fund our investments and improve our profitability. So far input cost and currency rates are tracking in the range of our previous assumptions. We\u2019re optimistic about our opportunities and we believe that our prospect to drive profitable growth have never been better.","So to summarize we\u2019re off to an excellent start in 2013. We\u2019re pleased with our progress but we\u2019re reaching for more and we remain convinced that our global business plan will continue to deliver value for our shareholders. So that wraps up our prepared remarks and now we will begin to take your questions.","","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","(Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from (inaudible).","","Unidentified Analyst","Wanted to ask I noticed you had a pretty accelerated pace of buyback in the first quarter I mean more than half of what you plan to do for the year and I was just wondering with the strong results why you might not top that up a little bit given that you have already done so much.","","Tom Falk","Our plan heading into the year just like we did last year was to be a little bit front end loaded on share repurchases given the cost of commercial paper. We\u2019re still holding course, we had a billion to billion two in our outlook for the year, we still think that\u2019s a good plan. So if it plays out if we have more cash flow obviously that\u2019s one of the options we have got to deploy it.","","Unidentified Analyst","Got you and the second question I had was and I might be missing a little something here but on K-C International I never said in tissue I know that\u2019s not the bigger focus, it's obviously personal care and you mentioned that the volumes grew 4% and of course you\u2019re coming off a strong 12% gain a year ago. What should we see that sort of normalize that in personal care in the emerging K-C International markets, I mean it's 4% kind of the number we should go with as we look ahead or I think based on Tom\u2019s comments should we look for something maybe a little bigger than that going forward.","","Tom Falk","I think in K-C International the volumes were pretty flat on consumer tissue. We did take up some price and mix on that front and that\u2019s done well, I think the volumes were down a percent. So again we\u2019re not adding a kind of additional capacity there and are focusing on driving mix in revenue realization and getting our margins up and you saw some of that improvement in the quarter.","","Unidentified Analyst","I was really talking more about personal care.","","Tom Falk","On the personal care front, I would say the toughest comp in the first quarter and so we would expect to see what the innovation picking up in the last three quarters of the year we will see a little bit better growth from personal care going forward.","","Mark Buthman","Yes if you look at relative to our 3% to 5% top-line Chip obviously personal care in KCI is going to be higher as part of a mix.","","Operator","Our next question comes from Gail Glazerman with UBS.","","Gail Glazerman - UBS","I just wondered if you could talk a little bit more about exactly what surprised you in the first quarter and I guess just trying to reconcile that with the guidance sort of the rest of the year. Last call you talked about actually expecting the second half to be improved relative to first and it doesn\u2019t feel like that\u2019s consistent with the current guidance and I know you were just talking about the innovation type one (ph) and that will flow through the next few quarters, so can you give a little bit of color there?","","Tom Falk","Yes that\u2019s a fair push so that\u2019s a two things one is consumer tissue in North America was really way ahead of expectations and so Cottonelle volumes were up double digits, KLEENEX facial tissue was up double digits and on the facial tissue front that\u2019s probably more of a strong cold and flu season phenomenon and the Cottonelle front one of our primary branded competitors that\u2019s not a public company has had some product supply problems and they sensed I know that\u2019s what their customers have indicated they were going to have trouble supplying, and that certainly helped our business, and it showed up and they would share a loss and our volume gain in the first quarter. So, we ran everything full and try to take advantage of as much of those business opportunities as we could. So, that certainly helps us. We assume they will work their way out of that problem later in the year, and so that\u2019s where we don\u2019t expect that level of volume growth in Cottonelle to continue at that kind of a rate. So, that was one thing.","And then I think the other thing that was a big positive for us was cost savings, so we had a very strong start to the year on FORCE. Now, you could say gosh, you are over $80 million in FORCE in the third quarter and fourth quarter of last year. So, why were you surprised, but it was a stronger start to the year than we had probably forecasted. That should bode well for our results in the balance of the year.","","Gail Glazerman - UBS","Okay. And just looking at the European restructuring a little bit, you commented that you aren\u2019t selling Huggies in, I guess, 13 countries and moving out of the remainder, but I presume you are still selling diapers as with the comments about I think 14% private label growth. And I am just wondering when would you expect to see that trail off?","","Tom Falk","We will honor all of the private label contract commitments we have with our customers in Europe. And so we signed those contracts, they had a certain data which they would renew and we will fulfill the terms of the contract. We will also \u2013 we are going to sell diapers in Italy as we noted in the restructuring, and there may be some other private label contracts that will retain post the shutdown of some of the facilities in the UK and Spain. So, I think the good news on the European front is that our other personal care categories in consumer tissue we saw a good growth in the retained portfolio, and we are investing in those and things like Andrex Washlets in the UK. Our Pull-Ups business had a nice improvement in Europe. Our baby wipes business is growing like crazy. And so the strategy that we have had of focusing more on those growth opportunities in that market very early days that we are encouraged by the first quarter performance.","","Gail Glazerman - UBS","Okay thanks very much.","","Tom Falk","Thanks Gail.","","Operator","Our next question comes from Wendy Nicholson with Citi Research.","","Tom Falk","Good morning Wendy.","","Wendy Nicholson - Citi Research","Hi, good morning. My first question is on China specifically, I know you said that you have gone into, I think five new cities, but can you comment on the competitive environment in China and how your strategy is unfolding in terms of going down market a little bit in pricing? And then second question and I really apologize if I missed it, but did you give us guidance for the year like volumes, price mix, sales growth, if that\u2019s in the press release I didn\u2019t see it?","","Tom Falk","Okay. Then on the first question on China, Mark and I were just in China and so we did the grand opening of our new mill in Nanchang and got to meet with the China team again, and they are doing pretty well. And so our strategy in Huggies of going to the mid-tier has gone well, and so we are not going all the way down to the lowest tiers in China, where we are staying in the mid to premium tiers. And in fact they are just launching a new Huggies platinum, which is a super-premium tier on top of our existing premium tier. So, we will have three product offerings in China in the very near future, which we will think will appeal to the moms in China, they want the very best product for their babies.","I would say the competition from Unicharm is probably the toughest and to a lesser extent Kao, P&G the factor in every segment over there, but we would probably see the toughest competition from Unicharm and Kao at this point in time. But it\u2019s an exciting market and the team is very energized by success and they are reaching for more. On the guidance front, our primary assumptions didn\u2019t change from our full year estimates that we gave you earlier. So, in organic volume for the year, we are looking at overall 3% to 5% organic sales growth, 2% to 3% volume, 1% to 2% pricing mix, currency is going to be about a point drag for the year, and then we will have a couple of points of restructuring drag for the year. And so, that hasn\u2019t changed since January which is why we didn\u2019t say anything about it in the release.","","Wendy Nicholson - Citi Research","So, the $0.10 lift to the estimates is maybe a little bit from K-C Mexico, it\u2019s a little bit on the margin side, but it sounds like most of your assumptions are kind of the same as they were?","","Tom Falk","Well, probably we are a little bit ahead in consumer tissue in the beginning of the year. Cost savings are tracked a little ahead, and obviously, Mexico is part of it, but we would expect that Mexico will have a good year just based on where the peso was trading but we planned together.","","Operator","Our next question comes from Ali Dibadj with Sanford Bernstein.","","Ali Dibadj - Sanford Bernstein","I wanted a little bit deeper in terms of the kind of dichotomy between all other segments in consumer tissue because without the consumer tissue success I think top-line at least would have been somewhat of disappointing top line results for most folks. So I\u2019m kind of understanding consumer tissue I think you have explained us through flu and Cottonelle in particularly. What was the little bit more disappointing I guess on the other end of things, whether it be personal care or in particular KCP or healthcare.","","Tom Falk","Still with healthcare we were surprised and a little disappointed. In fact we started out the year with healthcare was a little bit of a flu pandemic scare and sold a bunch of a face mask in January so we started out pretty strong but then actually you have seen this from some of the healthcare companies that have reported surgical admissions are done about 4% in the first quarter and nobody can figure out why and so everybody has got a hypothesis as to what\u2019s going on but we haven't got a good read on that and so I would say as the quarter played out just the underlying category volumes in healthcare we\u2019re little disappointing and in K-C Professional our washroom business in North America, we saw a kind of low single digit top-line which would be as expected but the safety business was off, part of that was we decided to shut some business in that segment which we knew about but I would also say that it's maybe reflective of kind of a weaker manufacturers environment than maybe we would have hoped going into the year and that\u2019s probably is tracking somewhat with what you\u2019re hearing in markets around the world. KCI obviously we\u2019re looking at that as a global deal and so yeah we were slower in Europe than we thought we were going to be we were a little slower and other parts of the emerging markets that we thought we were going to be in. So the B2B business were generally a little slower on the top-line than we would have thought in the plan.","","Paul Alexander","I would just add that overall personal care was right on track with our plan that obviously was a segment that had really strong results last year during the quarter so you probably want to take a look at the comparisons before you take that into account as it reflect on what personal care did this quarter.","","Ali Dibadj - Sanford Bernstein","You think about the margin story here still in the quarter net-net top-line I think was roughly (inaudible) but the margin is really the big surprise and can you talk a little bit more in detail about disaggregating that? So how much of it was volume leverage? How of it was non-leveraged cost cutting within, I think it includes volume leverage in FORCE and how much of it was price realization or something that I\u2019m missing?","","Tom Falk","We don\u2019t include volume levers in FORCE, since FORCE is about 85 million and so FORCE net that against the input cost increase was certainly a big driver of that. Better volume was just all by itself was about 30 million and if you look at the change in unabsorbed fixed cost which we track that was another 15 million. So you could look at it and say cost savings is about half of our gross margin improvement and volume including down-time related volume effects was about the other half of it.","","Ali Dibadj - Sanford Bernstein","And certainly if you\u2019re sustainable it sounds like that the way you\u2019re talking through it.","","Tom Falk","On the fixed cost absorption front, we took most of our downtime in late 2011 and early 2012 to get inventories in line so the comps will be much easier on that front in the first half of this year so that will start abate a bit in the second half of the year but again we would expect with some of the innovation that we have coming that we will have decent volume growth in the last nine months.","","Ali Dibadj - Sanford Bernstein","Okay my last quick question is on KCI because it's a (inaudible) business and growing so. It's certainly looks like it slowed a bit, you can discuss comps et cetera but one thing that I want to get your perspective is this continued seemingly difficulty of taking pricing in KCI personal care and that might be a competitive issue, that maybe a mix issue but try to understand that outside of Latin America pricing in that category, KCI-PC.","","Tom Falk","We typically take a lot of price where you got cost issues or currency swings and so if you look at the markets where you had this quarter really the two big markets Brazil and Argentina, where there has been the most currency movement as where we got the most price. In the balance of KCI, you look at like China, for example, there hasn\u2019t been a lot of currency movement, there hasn\u2019t been a lot of commodity cost get really in the Personal Care space. And so we are really focused on driving innovation, driving mix, and so launching a Tier 6 diaper in China is going to do more for us from a margin and putting revenue in the category standpoint than trying to drive a list price change.","","Ali Dibadj - Sanford Bernstein","Okay, thanks a lot.","","Tom Falk","Thanks Ali.","","Operator","Our next question comes from Linda Bolton Weiser with B. Riley & Company.","","Tom Falk","Good morning Linda.","","Linda Bolton Weiser - B. Riley & Company","Hi, just maybe you could give a little more information just to help me understand, because in terms of your organic sales growth, I assume you are still kind of thinking 3% to 5% for the year the previous guidance, and it was at the low end in this first quarter, but you have more innovation coming later, but you have some stuff that kind of helped it like the flu season, but I don\u2019t see the comparisons actually getting that much easier. You were pretty strong for all the quarters of last year, just the third quarter was up 3%, but the other quarters were up 4%, 5%, 6%, so how do we have confidence really that you can do little better than 3% later or is this going to be 3% for the year or can you give a little more color on the comparisons issues?","","Mark Buthman","Yeah, I think that\u2019s fair. We said our organic target for the year is 3% to 5%. We said organic volume is 2% to 3% and price mix is 1% to 2%, and so we kind of came in at the low end of that in the first quarter. But we really got most of our heavy up innovation coming in the last nine months of the year and we are pretty bullish on what we are going to be doing there. And so I think to move from the bottom end of the range to the top end of the range on organic volume is very doable. And so I think where the plan is unfolding about is we thought it would and we look for that to deliver the things we would worry about a little bit as the continued weakness in healthcare surgeries if that will be a drag, and we would like to see a little bit of an economic improvement benefit KCP, but on the consumer front, we feel pretty good about what we have got common in KCI and in North America.","","Linda Bolton Weiser - B. Riley & Company","Okay. And then can you just give an update, because it\u2019s been a while since the feminine care, the new brand U was launched and can you give us an update on like how that\u2019s doing like what market share it has achieved maybe in the different categories of pads and tampons and all that? And then secondly, can you give an update on the slip-on diaper, because you said there will be an innovation coming on that? Is that an innovation because you need to improve it, because it wasn\u2019t working or is that just an innovation to just drive it further in terms of market share gains?","","Tom Falk","Yes, sure. You would like those as we have made steady share progress in the U.S., I think it\u2019s up to a little over seven shareholder category now, and our total Kotex share is trending around 18, which is up several points from when we started that the U launch. And so we have little bit of softness on volume on our Kotex natural balance in the first quarter and made up for that with continued growth of U by Kotex and have more innovation coming on that brand as the year progresses. And what was your second question, Linda?","","Linda Bolton Weiser - B. Riley & Company","Just an update on slip-on?","","Tom Falk","Slip-on diapers is just continuing to work on improving the product. And so I would say as you know we normally do, we can consistently launch renovation improvements to our diaper and pant lines around the world. And so it\u2019s a nice improvement to the slip-on diaper one. Again, it\u2019s one that we would like that to be to pick up a little bit from a share standpoint, it\u2019s a big idea around the world, and so it will be a good improvement for mom.","","Linda Bolton Weiser - B. Riley & Company","Okay. And just one last thing on, you said you are going to sell a business in the third quarter of the Polish tissue business, I think like does your guidance for the year include a potential gain on sale that might be included in your earnings then or will that be\u2026","","Tom Falk","Yes, there was a gain and nearly that\u2019s not what I will go through the restructuring line, and no, there won\u2019t be any \u2013 there is nothing related to that that would be in our guidance.","","Linda Bolton Weiser - B. Riley & Company","Okay. And then the restructuring cost savings in the quarter are you including that in FORCE savings or is that separate, and I am projecting restructuring savings of $40 million for the year, is that about right?","","Tom Falk","Well, in the first quarter, we had about $5 million related to the tissue restructuring that was not included in FORCE. So, that would have brought the total into $90 million including that and coming in the full year.","","Mark Buthman","Linda the $40 million would be right between 2013 and 2014 that would get to our full year $100 million run-rate at the end of 2014 for 2013 it will only be about $15 million.","","Operator","Our next question comes from Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank.","","Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank","Do you think this is the peak less margin quarter for the year? I just kind of looking at the year-over-year comparison.","","Tom Falk","I hope not, we feel pretty good about the momentum and lot of things working well. You would say on the gross margin front we should see a little bit of increased cost inflation, although in the first quarter we had 35 million which is not too far off, our annualized rate of the guidance so we set a 150 to 250. So I think we will see how that plays out but we\u2019re encouraged by our progress. As we have launched more innovation, we\u2019re aiming forth to be margin accretive so that should give us a little bit of upward bump on gross margin as well. So we\u2019re focused on building that overtime Bill and we hope the first quarter was a good step in that direction.","","Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank","Okay and then are you tempted to change you\u2019re sort of growth algorithm, maybe not in the sales line but it seems like the business mix has shifted so much and a lot of low end margin stuff is out in the business. So shouldn\u2019t it be kind of a catch up period in terms of eBay growth which maybe kind of gets you a lift sort of mid-single digit operating profit growth target that you have in the long term.","","Tom Falk","I think the other thing we\u2019re looking for is particularly with the strong start this year where can we accelerate investments that will benefit our future growth and are we making sure we\u2019re investing in the brands at the right level to fully take advantage of the innovation opportunity that we have. So we\u2019re strategic partnering in the first quarter was a little bit lower growth rate than past quarter\u2019s but we think for the full year we\u2019re still going to be increasing that and that will be another that we will look for investment.","","Mark Buthman","I would say Bill over the long term 6% to 9% bottom-line, we like to hit that consistently and it's going to require gross margin important, continued investment in the business to do that and so that is consistently hitting our algorithm is really our goal.","","Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank","And just the private label the big private label boast in Europe is there a change in strategy there? So are you guys going to sort of open yourself to all those private label contracts in some of the smaller markets?","","Tom Falk","I think that was kind of a tactical move a couple of years ago, they are still up existing capacity and as we have excited facilities I think that will be a smaller player in the private label market in Europe overall.","","Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank","It was a big move right? I mean I think you said organic sales grew up 14% and first in Europe is that just going to get rid of some of the old diaper stuff as you hold the factories down.","","Tom Falk","These were contracts that we entered into last year. So (inaudible) moves like that in the last couple of quarters of 2012 and it's really just contracts that we picked up last year that were roughly a yearlong that will roll off in the second and third quarter.","","Mark Buthman","And remember Bill Baby Wipes volumes were also up-strong double digits also and we\u2019re keeping that business.","","Operator","Our next question comes from Jason Gere with RBC Capital Markets.","","Jason Gere - RBC Capital Markets","Two questions one I was wanting if on U.S. both questions are on the U.S. and if you could talk about the retail environment, the course of this quarter we heard comments in some of your big retailers out there about some pressure that we\u2019re seeing, so I guess one I was wanting if you could just talk about the competitive landscape what you\u2019re seeing out there, I know in the food side it looks a little more promotional. So just wondering what you might be seeing up there on the HPC side personal care and tissue and then I have a follow-up question. I will ask afterwards.","","Tom Falk","It's a tough quarter and retail generally, just when you look at some of the comps but I would also say that our categories in consumables they have generally done much better than food in some of the other categories we\u2019re are more of an essential product line and we\u2019re also encouraged to see consumers are still responsive to innovation, so when we look at how our new (inaudible) products, these products are performing in the market some of the Baby Wipes products are there in the market. These are our premium priced line extensions and they are doing pretty well from a category standpoint. We saw consumer is still willing to pay for a better product.","Jason Gere - RBC Capital Markets","Okay, that makes sense. And then I guess the more specific question is on just U.S. diaper, and help me with math right now, I guess U.S. diapers of about 15% of your total sales? Is that right?","","Tom Falk","Globally for U.S. diapers?","","Jason Gere - RBC Capital Markets","So, U.S. diapers are at 15% of your total company sales after all the adjustments?","","Tom Falk","Yeah, I mean, we would normally don\u2019t get into that level of detail, but if you can look at our market shares in the mid 30s, I think you could get a pretty good approximation.","","Jason Gere - RBC Capital Markets","So, I guess, what I am trying to figure out is that, can you talk about where the category trends are now, because I know last year, they were still down I think at these mid single-digit and its birth rates are starting to stabilize. There should be like a nice swing I guess to your organic sales calculation, so if you go from negative 6, maybe over the next two years, 2%, there is like about 800 basis point kind of swing I guess on the organic sales calculation, you multiply that by 15%, that\u2019s over 100 basis points of organic sales. So, I guess, can you just talk me through where we are right now, what are you seeing out there, and you expect over the next maybe two years that you actually see that migration from significantly negative category trends to modestly positive. Can you just kind of walk me through some math here?","","Tom Falk","Yeah, sure. If you look at the diaper category last year, it was probably down a couple of points and our expectation for this year that will be down about a point. And the training pant category last year was down more than that, and that was more of the three years of low birth rates piling up in the category as kids tend to be start Pull-Ups training around age 3, and so training pants is down mid single-digits last year. And it\u2019s encouraging to see our training pant business is modestly positive, and that\u2019s probably because there is some penetration opportunity still in that category, and we have driven things like GoodNites and Little Swimmers, which we count in that metric. And those were doing better than the overall training pant category would have performed. So, I would say, you are probably a little high in your estimate of diapers as a percent of sales and you are probably a little more negative in terms of where the comp was last year and where it\u2019s going. So, I wouldn\u2019t expect you are going to see as much top line lift. And at this point, we would say the birth rate seems to have bottomed out. We hope that it will turn slightly positive later this year, but it will be \u2013 the category will still be down a point for the year and hopefully will see a flatter category in 2014.","","Alice Longley - Buckingham Research","Okay, thanks for the reconciliation. Thanks guys.","","Tom Falk","Yeah.","","Operator","Our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.","","Tom Falk","Hello Lauren.","","Lauren Lieberman - Barclays","Hi, thanks. Good morning.","","Tom Falk","Good morning.","","Lauren Lieberman - Barclays","Just another consumer tissue margin, because this was I think just north of 15%, the best it had been since 2004 and knowing that there was the benefit little bit of help from flu season this quarter, just want to get some perspective on whether you think 15ish percent obviously has been give and take quarter-to-quarter is sustainable and whether using consumer tissue margins could be higher than mid-teens over time?","","Tom Falk","Well, you may have recalled that we were when tissue margins were down in the high single-digits that we weren\u2019t pretty \u2013 we weren\u2019t happy with that and we were aiming to get back to the mid-teens. And so now that we are back at the mid-teens, you can imagine that we are not totally happy with that, and we wanted to go higher still, and so it\u2019s been a good focus on mix and revenue generation and driving premium utilization and launching innovation. And so as you look around the company thinks like, we will have a lot of flushable moist wipe launches this year in North America and all over the world and we are starting to look at other things that we can do with our great tissue brands that bring more margin and revenue into the category. And so that\u2019s I think just starting to take hold and so we do have more opportunity to drive margin north in the future and rest assured the team is not stopping at 15%.","","Lauren Lieberman - Barclays","Let me just on the topic of innovation then with the flushable wipes example, that\u2019s maybe not a terribly nice question, but sometimes ideas you guys have had that strike you as big ideas haven\u2019t been quite as successful as hoped, whether it\u2019s the hand towel or past efforts at flushable wipes like that, what if anything is different now, is it just keep trying until the consumer catches up?","","Tom Falk","Well, I think we are better marketers than we probably were. We tried it in the past. We are listening better to the consumer. We got, as you see, some of the flushable moist execution there, actually this category has been growing. It's just finally get on the radar screen and we\u2019re getting it in more market. So we have had terrific launch in the UK for example behind android\u2019s watch list. And we will take some of that learning and take that into other markets and so I think it. There is a consumer need there and we got better and better product executions and we\u2019re talking consumer about it in ways that are memorable and starting to drive some new habits.","","Mark Buthman","I think it's fair to say it's takes longer but one of our learning is when you\u2019re trying to change habits it just takes longer versus the product you\u2019re improving, the consumer uses every day so that\u2019s probably fair.","","Lauren Lieberman - Barclays","Okay and then just final question on this your outlook in general for pricing in tissue in North America much has been talked about some of the private label capacity and improving quality and so on and so forth and it certainly sounds like this quarter was a large and not publically traded having some challenges you were bit protected for now but is your outlook at pricing in this tissue category pricing not mix with the same price can remain as positive and stronger as it has been.","","Tom Falk","I would say generally tissue pricing broadly followed big moves in pulp pricing. So our outlook for pulp is pretty stable. We\u2019re talking about up 20 bucks a ton or something like that for the year and I think given that you\u2019re unlikely to see big swings in tissue pricing. That doesn\u2019t mean that it won't be promotional activity at the edges but if we do a great job of driving innovation we should be hopefully let promotional which winds up with more revenue at the end of the day.","","Lauren Lieberman - Barclays","And just one house keeping question, you mentioned that if there was any gain on the Polish sales wouldn\u2019t it be part of your numbers but in the release this quarter you mentioned the worse gains on asset on the numbers but so I don\u2019t wants the difference or was it just\u2026","","Tom Falk","We sold some real estate in North America that we didn\u2019t need and so that goes into other income and expense. So if it wasn\u2019t related to any of the restructuring activities.","","Lauren Lieberman - Barclays","And that\u2019s the difference because it was related to restructuring it would have been excluded.","","Tom Falk","Yes. So if we took a facility that we took a write-off on and has a gain we don\u2019t take the write-off and as excluded item and then take the gains through operations. We play straight down the middle.","","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Ferrara with Bank of America.","","Chris Ferrara - Bank of America ","It was kind of striking when you were talking about in diapers in China that I guess you called that Uni-Charm and Kao is the biggest competitors in not so much profit and for probably the largest share play in the market. Just wondering why that is.","","Tom Falk","We look at the best performing product in the market and test against that product to make sure we can make competitive claims and so Uni-Charm and Kao both make some terrific products particularly in the diaper pants area where we\u2019re growing in many of those markets and they have the strongest product offer that we\u2019re aiming at and so we test against those and it also make terrific diapers that we have tested again. So Procter is in that for a while and Uni-Charm and Kao are aggressively trying to grow those parts of the business. So we feel like we\u2019re in the share battle with them as much as anybody.","","Chris Ferrara - Bank of America ","And I guess on another note, in Europe I hear you\u2019re on the 13 countries exited, can you give an update on sort of the cadence of cost coming out so I know you\u2019re saying for the full year, the cost is going to come as fast as the sales have but was that the case for Q1 as well like was there a net profitability impact of the European piece this quarter?","","Tom Falk","Europe had a very solid start for the quarter, so overall their profit was up versus prior year and tracking with the plan even a little bit ahead of their plan and second and third quarter is going to be the key turning point for the cost, the back office cost in particular and the team in Europe is monitoring execution of that plan very carefully and I\u2019m confident they are going to deliver on their goals for the year.","","Operator","Our next question comes from Alice Longley with Buckingham Research.","","Alice Longley - Buckingham Research ","My question is about the hikes in your commodity cost, they were up 35 million in the first quarter which seems pretty low versus your annual guidance. Why are you lowering your guidance for the year for commodity cost hikes?","","Tom Falk","But I don\u2019t think we are we said $150 million to $250 million is what we think we are going to see in inflation and then we have $35 million in the first quarter. So, if you annualize that, we would be bumping up against the low end of the range. And in the first quarter, I think it was about $15 million was pulp, about $10 million was polymer, about $10 million was distribution cost. And so I would say those are the probably pulp for the full year we expect will be two-thirds of the inflation with the balance being, the other big chunk being distribution and that\u2019s both diesel rate as well as carrier rate increases, including some in Latin America, where there has been some big carrier rate increases in Latin America.","","Alice Longley - Buckingham Research","Okay. But maybe the bottom end of your range, we should \u2013 it\u2019s more likely than the top end, right?","","Tom Falk","But it\u2019s certainly with the commodity pullback that\u2019s happened in the last week or so, that wasn\u2019t probably fully reflected in our guidance. You can see in the assumptions we are assuming oil is going to be in the $90 to $100 a barrel range, and natural gas, we are assuming $4 to $4.50, and that\u2019s pretty much tracking oil probably the one that\u2019s maybe you got a little bit more upside than what we shared with you. Pulp, we still think if you look at Northern softwood, 8.90 to 9 ton, price range is about right. Secondary fiber we are assuming is around $2.60, $2.65, and there maybe a little bit of upside on that, but we will see how the year plays out.","","Mark Buthman","Yeah, I think the cost analysis is especially with oil, I mean, it\u2019s on the bottom of the CNBC News screen every day, and it\u2019s just \u2013 it\u2019s too easy we have learned to focus on current day pricing. And I think our range of $150 million to $250 million for the year is still a good call and gives us some flexibility in the guidance, if oil or natural gas or fiber run up on us in the whole year.","","Tom Falk","And currency rates are also obviously a key factor here a lot of times, they move in opposite direction with input costs.","","Alice Longley - Buckingham Research","Okay. And the follow-up to this is you never really give us the base off of which we can run these commodity cost increases, let\u2019s say, your commodity costs were up $150 million through the year. Is that an increase below, let\u2019s say, 3% organic sales growth we might get 3% to 4%, what was kind of an increase is the $150 million year-over-year?","","Tom Falk","It would be low single-digits.","","Alice Longley - Buckingham Research","So, you are getting leverage from that from cost going up less than organic sales growth, correct?","","Tom Falk","Yes, yes.","","Alice Longley - Buckingham Research","So, the $150 million would be up like 1%, 2% year-over-year?","","Tom Falk","Yeah, I mean its low single-digit spend, Alice.","","Alice Longley - Buckingham Research","Yeah, excellent. Thank you.","","Tom Falk","Thank you.","","Operator","Our next question comes from Javier Escalante with Consumer Edge Research.","","Tom Falk","Hello Javier.","","Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research","Good morning to everyone. How are you? Question for you, I have two questions, but I would like to just start both in KCI, so I would like to start with China, so you moved 50% right, and certainly I don\u2019t think that the market is growing 50%. So, if you can give us the sense of, if you kind of split China basically in Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities, where you were up to last year and then the new cities that you have three cities, which you are penetrating right now. If you can let us know your best guess what is the market growth in Tier 1, Tier 2 cities versus Tier 3 cities? And also what is the market structure, what is your market share in Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities versus your market share in the new cities that you are competing, entering, and also if you can tell us Unicharm and Procter & Gamble diapers share as well divided between Tier 1 and Tier 2 versus the rest which is your rollout as you started last year? That will be my first question.","","Tom Falk","Javier, I think you might have dialed the wrong number, you might be thinking I am Nielsen or something, but I am probably not going to give you that level of detail. I guess, I will say this is that in the large cities and we almost look at a share on a customer by customer basis. So, in the large cities, in the modern trade customers, we would have much stronger share than we would on a national basis. So, it\u2019s not uncommon to have shares for us north of 20% in the large modern trade and even though our national share in China is probably half of that. And so as you go into new cities, obviously, your share is a lot smaller you are trying to build it with some of the new customers as you go into those markets, and then in we are also doing quite well in e-commerce in China, which is a growing channel, which isn\u2019t very accurately measured. And so it\u2019s s a very dynamic complex market. I also tell you quite honestly in many cases because the Nielsen coverage is still a little spotty but anybody that is quoting you at market shares in China is probably pulling your leg. So Procter is still the share leader, Uni-Charm is probably got a share that\u2019s higher than ours overall but we will be competitive in the Tier 1 cities with both of those companies kind of buying for share leadership certainly in our segments in the super premium segment. We would be the share leader; in the mid-tier you typical would see P&G and Uni-Charm with a little stronger shares than we have because we\u2019re the new comer to that segment.","But good news is the category overall we think is growing at least mid-single digits maybe high single digits and so it's still a pretty existing diaper market for us.","","Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research","But the mid-single digits if you grew volumes at 50s somebody must have been losing share. So if you can help us understand who is losing share because growing at 15 the market is growing only mid-single digits somebody must be losing share. Do you have any idea what player is sharing for you?","","Tom Falk","I would say probably if you look at the Nielsen data I have seen is probably been P&G and Haugen have been the biggest share of losers. On the other hand you could still lose share and grow volume just give the overall growth of the market.","","Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research","But you said you lose mid-single digits and grew 50s so that\u2019s why was seeing the share losses and the other question that I have is that you mentioned China growing at 50, Russia growing at 10 and the slowdown was in Brazil to 5 but it's still very strong growth in this big market so which markets went negative. Could it be related on to what extent this is related to a Kimberly specific issue or is broader market issue that will be the case if one of the negative markets I think you flag it was Venezuela? So if you can explain which markets were negative and whether this is a Kimberly specific issue and that will be very helpful. Thank you.","","Tom Falk","The two big negative markets, one is Australia and had more to do with the timing of promotions. So we had more promotional shipments in first quarter \u201912 than typical that\u2019s a big holiday period in Australia, so usually those promotions take place late in the year for whatever reason they happened in the first quarter of \u201912 they also have happened in the fourth quarter \u201912. So we\u2019re a little late in Australia and that was probably the biggest comp change and then Venezuela was a little weak in Latin America overall just related probably more to our ability to get foreign exchange to pay for important product or as you know we\u2019re disciplined in terms of how we manage that part of the world and so those are the two biggest volume drags in KCI and I guess you could say at least Australia was probably K-C specific and that it was more on timing of promotional shipments in Venezuela. I don\u2019t know who you want to give credit to that one for so.","","Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research","But in terms of Venezuela how weak is weak? You talked because last quarter because you mentioned that their volumes were down 30% could it be that kind of magnitude in Venezuela for you?","","Tom Falk","It wasn\u2019t that, because of the size of the Australia business was in KCI that probably had a much bigger impact on the overall comps than anything else.","","Operator","Our next question comes from Jason English with Goldman Sachs.","","Jason English - Goldman Sachs","First to follow-up to Lawrence\u2019s question, the post tissue exit, how large was that gain this quarter?","","Tom Falk","It wasn\u2019t a gain basically we took\u2026","","Jason English - Goldman Sachs","I was referring to the non-core asset sale in the quarter.","","Mark Buthman","Non-core asset sale it was the majority income which on adjusted basis was 24 million so it's the majority of that.","","Tom Falk","I guess the other point there Jason is that that was in our plan for the year.","","Jason English - Goldman Sachs","One more follow-up, back to KCI in Brazil. There has been some chatter out of the market of the government trying to tamper the inflation rate by partnering with your retailers giving them some tax relief in exchange for some price cuts. Have you seen or heard about this, if so what\u2019s the status or any intentional implications for you.","","Tom Falk","That has not had a big impact on us at this point and I think most of those initiatives have been focused more on food, inflation and less on our categories up to this point.","","Operator","Our next question comes from (inaudible).","","Unidentified Analyst","I just have one question; you were talking about new assets, starting up in the second quarter and maybe for the rest of the year. What kind of assets are they and what\u2019s the cost of starting them up and when are they fully operational?","","Tom Falk","We will be adding as I mentioned Mark and I are dedicated a new diaper plan in China so that\u2019s under startup, we will be adding some Baby Wipes capacity in a couple of markets around the world so that will be co-format that\u2019s the converting assets will be starting up. We\u2019re adding some adult care capacity in different markets around the world and so none of them will have the startup impacts like a new tissue a plant would have and all of the startup cost were baked into our plan for the year but it will a bit of an impact as the year progresses.","","Operator","Our next question comes from Caroline Levy with CLSA.","","Caroline Levy \u2013 CLSA","Just a little more specific you\u2019re in 85 cities already in China. Do you think you\u2019re going to be raising your goal because it looks like you\u2019re moving pretty quickly there and the second part of the China question is how quickly would you get a margin benefit from manufacturing the line of share of your product locally versus importing?","","Tom Falk","Certainly adding capacity in China will give us a margin boast, we have already got a couple of diaper lines running in China at our existing facility in Nanjing and we manufacture quite a bit of feminine care products in China and we enjoy the margin benefits from that and so by adding the diaper capacity we will give us a boast probably starting later this year and certainly in 2014 once we get past the startup and in terms of raising our goal. Our China team is certainly aggressive and as developing such growth plans they were very enthusiastic when Mark and I were with them earlier this year and our job is to make sure that we can make all their dreams come true. So, we think that will be a good thing for Kimberly Clarke long term.","","Caroline Levy \u2013 CLSA","And just in terms of the consumer in China since you just got back any sense of a major shift one way or the other or I mean obviously your business has been growing that there is a lot of concern about the consumer there.","","Tom Falk","You still think good GDP per capita growth even though the overall GDP growth rate has slowed a bit and Chinese moms are moms anywhere else, they want the very best product for their babies. They talk a lot about the little emperors in China where parents really sacrifice a lot to provide the very best for their children and that has impacted us a bit. I mean those children are their future and they\u2019re going to invest in them to make sure that they can be as well-educated and as healthy and as strong as they can possibly be and that\u2019s certainly is a trend that abating at all in China.","","Caroline Levy \u2013 CLSA","And then if you can talk company overall, your price mix outlook because you had pretty strong price mix growth in the first quarter of last year, that\u2019s more modest this year. Is that what we saw in the first quarter kind of what you would expect for the balance of the year for price mix?","","Tom Falk","We set our goals is 1 to 2, we were one in the quarter. We should get a little bit of additional mix as the innovation rolls out but we got relatively benign cost inflation and currency rate swings in the plan and so those are usually bigger drivers of the price line. If you saw big spike in commodities or a big swing in currency raised in an individual market you would see more pricing offsets there.","","Caroline Levy \u2013 CLSA","Right and if you could just talk a little bit about Mexico because you have great growth in your equity income line and was it volume driven? Was it, whatever you can share about that market?","","Tom Falk","We had a solid quarter and really every component of the equity income line this quarter had a very solid results. So we don\u2019t talk them about often but our business in India had a nice profit improvement, our business in Saudi Arabia had a nice profit improvement as well and so those are in that line but they are obviously much smaller than the K-C Mexico numbers and Mexico had a good executions, decent top-line and great cost savings and that translated into a nice improvement and as talking to Pablo Gonzalez earlier in the week and they are pretty bullish on their outlook. In fact I think their call has gone going as we speak, so Pablo is probably out talking to his shareholder group about the good news the K-C Mexico.","","Caroline Levy \u2013 CLSA","Final question just on the U.S. environment again sort of a similar question about the consumer because there is a lot fear that private label or lower price brands are kind of set a stay in the new reality even if the economy gets better. Do you have any thoughts of that?","","Tom Falk","Well it's interesting we track private label shares as you would expect and then basically in every single category that we track this quarter shares were down versus the prior quarter is slightly down and in many of them were down versus the year ago quarter and so I would say the ones that\u2019s up year-over-year is dry bath tissue and so that\u2019s probably the one that you have seen the most competitive pressure, we talked a little bit about that I think our non-public competitors that had some supply problems in the first quarter created a little bit of a window for some private label improvement as well but overall we\u2019re not seeing anything at least in the recent quarter that would indicate that the consumers are feeling more squeezed and bound shifting into private label.","","Operator","Our next question comes from Leigh Ferst with Wellington Shields.","","Leigh Ferst - Wellington Shields","I was wondering if you can tell us some more about the surgical numbers that were down 4% in the quarter. How are they trending towards the end of last year and also is there any remarkable difference between elective and non-elective?","","Tom Falk","Well it's one that you saw a debt in the third and fourth quarter of last year and I would tell you we don\u2019t have the data yet to be able to tell you and I think that\u2019s going to be elective right? Because if you need surgery you\u2019re probably not able to post-pone it as much as you would think but. I think everyone is trying to unpack this data and get a better look at and when we look at our surgical supplies business and in the fourth quarter we\u2019re down a percent it was flattish in the third quarter. We\u2019re also existing some lower margin (inaudible) business which affected those numbers a little bit but we would expected a little bit better underlying environment for surgeries in the first quarter than we saw and we\u2019re still trying to figure it out along with a lot of other companies I would guess.","","Leigh Ferst - Wellington Shields","And did you say you\u2019re expecting U.S. birth rate to be down this year?","","Tom Falk","Well they have been down every year for the last three years and we\u2019re expecting birth rate to flatten out this year.","","Mark Buthman","Category it will be down.","","Tom Falk","Category will be down for some because the babies that weren\u2019t born last year won't be wearing diapers this year.","","Leigh Ferst - Wellington Shields","Okay so flat is what you\u2019re forecasting recently so that\u2019s no change. Thank you.","","Operator","Our next question comes from (inaudible).","","Unidentified Analyst","First question is I noticed the minority interest is creeping up over at about 80 million a year and yet it looks like your dividend to them are only like a third of that or fourth of that, is that correct or how does that generally work for you?","","Tom Falk","I don\u2019t know I have to think about that one Chip and get back to you. I mean the minority interest is it includes some other stuff related to our one of our finance industries that\u2019s probably part of what\u2019s going and that we have got this off shore financing thing that\u2019s on the balance sheet, that\u2019s probably doing more to drive that somewhat unrelated to the dividend flow beyond that I would tell you there is other big minority interests in Korea and that business continues to do very well and also continues to pay out the dividend.","","Unidentified Analyst","And then second question on that financing I noticed there is a note 395 million I think that actually winds up next year and the question is, is that note which is in sort of the long term assets. Is that offset by in your debt section somewhere or is it sort of hanging there in other words. If you\u2019re trying to compete your net debt should we include that note in your cash because you have an offsetting liability on the debt side.","","Tom Falk","Yes there is an offset.","","Unidentified Analyst","And then last question it looked like to us that the corporate expense when you look at just in the pure sense was a little elevated versus a year ago. We get 62 million I think and should we expect that to be higher than it was a year ago or was the first quarter just an anomaly?","","Tom Falk","Chip that would include some higher incentive compensation expenses which are related to our increased outlook for the year. So for the full year we probably be up year-over-year in that line but I wouldn\u2019t assume that the first quarter would be a normal run rate.","","Unidentified Analyst","Lastly Mark you mentioned the gain on the real estate that caused the other income line to be normalized to 24 million, what should we expect that on a normal basis to be. I always thought it was always more or less the small like 10 million expense, is that fair or should it be zero or what would you got us do?","","Mark Buthman","It's normally, it's very slight positive or very slight negative.","","Tom Falk","Plus or minus 10 million and every once in a while you have something like we had this quarter where it's a little lumpier.","","Operator","Our next question comes from Linda Bolton Weiser with B Riley & Company.","","Linda Bolton Weiser - B Riley & Company","I think in the past where we had the bird flu outbreak you actually saw the safe mask lift, are you seeing any of that yet due to what\u2019s going in China or not?","","Tom Falk","Not yet and the another thing we have tried to be better at managing pandemics because what has happened to us in the past is that everybody orders everything and panics and they needed 10 cases they order a 100 cases and then if we ship it to them then they want to ship it all back to us two months later. So we actually have, once we have evidence of there is a \u2013 the demand serves like that coming we go into instant allocation mode and limit the ability of them to buy outsize amounts and so we\u2019re trying to do a better job of managing that for everybody, supply chain in these kinds of situations but we haven't seen much happen yet at this point.","","Operator","At this time we have no other questioners in the queue.","","Paul Alexander","All right. Thank you David, we will wrap up with a closing comment from Tom.","","Tom Falk","Once again we\u2019re off to a good start at Kimberly Clark and we appreciate your support and once again our thoughts and prayers go out to the folks in Boston that are affected by the events that have unfolded this week.

Alexander","Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Kimberly-Clark's First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Here with me today in Dallas are Tom Falk, Chairman and CEO; Mark Buthman, Senior VP and CFO; and Mike Azbell, Vice President and Controller.","Here's the agenda for our call: Mark will begin with a review of our first quarter results; Tom will then provide his perspectives on our results and our full year outlook; and we'll finish as usual with Q&A. As usual, we have a presentation of today's materials in the Investors section of our website.","Now before we begin, let me remind you we'll be making forward-looking statements today. There can be no assurance that future events will occur as anticipated or that our results will be as estimated. Please see the Risk Factors section of our latest annual report on Form 10-K for a further discussion of forward-looking statements.","I'd also like to point out that we will be referring to adjusted results and outlook, both of which exclude certain items described in this morning's news release. For further information on these adjustments and reconciliations to comparable financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP, please see today's news release.","And now, I'll turn it over to Mark.","Mark A. Buthman","Thanks, Paul, and good morning. Let's start with the headlines: first, we delivered organic sales growth of 6%. It was highlighted by 13% growth in K-C International; second, we generated strong improvements in both our adjusted gross and operating margins, as well as double-digit growth in adjusted earnings per share; and third, we reinvested significantly behind our brands, with higher levels of strategic marketing and R&D investment. ","Now let's cover the details of the quarter. Overall, sales increased 4% to $5.2 billion. Organic sales rose 6%, driven by higher net selling prices of 3%, increased sales volumes of 2% and favorable mix of 1%. On the other hand, lost sales in connection with our pulp and tissue restructuring, as well as changes in foreign currency rates, each reduced sales by 1%. ","Moving down to P&L. Adjusted gross margin was 33.2%.  That's up 250 basis points year-on-year. The improvement was driven by organic sales growth and $60 million of FORCE cost savings. On an adjusted basis, first quarter operating profit rose 12%, with an operating margin of 14%.  That's up 90 basis points compared to the prior year. Between-the-line spending increased versus last year, including a $45 million step-up in strategic marketing to support our product innovations and targeted growth initiatives. Additionally, administrative and research spending increased as we continue to build capabilities to support future growth.","First quarter adjusted earnings per share were $1.24 as compared to $1.09 last year. The improvement came despite lower net income from equity companies. And in terms of the tax rate, our adjusted effective rate for the quarter was 29.3%.  That was similar to the year-ago quarter. We continue to expect our full year rate to be in the range of 30% to 32%.","Cash provided by operations in the first quarter was solid at $585 million.  That's up nicely from $250 million in the prior year. The increase was driven by lower pension contributions and higher cash earnings.","So our balance sheet and cash generation remain strong, and we continue to allocate our capital in shareholder-friendly ways. In February, we announced our 40th consecutive annual increase in the dividend. The 6% increase should help us maintain our top-tier dividend payout ratio in the CPG space. ","In addition, during the first quarter, we repurchased 6.3 million shares of KMB stock at a cost of $460 million. We continue to expect full year share repurchases of $900 million to $1.1 billion.  Altogether, full year share repurchases plus dividend payments should total at least $2 billion returned to shareholders for the second consecutive year.","Now I'll highlight a few areas from our segment results for the quarter. In Personal Care, organic sales rose 9%, with volumes up 6% and net selling prices advancing 3%. Volume performance benefited from strong growth in K-C International, including double-digit growth in each of our major regions. In addition, our European business delivered broad-based growth in the quarter. The increase in net selling prices was driven by K-C International, as well as our Infant Care and Baby Wipes businesses in North America. I'm encouraged by the price realization in our North American Diaper business, which as you know, is a key focus for us this year.","First quarter Personal Care operating margins of 16.9% were 90 basis points below the prior year. Nonetheless, our margins did improve 150 basis points sequentially compared to the fourth quarter of 2011. This bodes well for our expectation that full year 2012 Personal Care margins will be similar to the 2011 full year average.","Turning to Consumer Tissue. Organic sales were up more than 2%, net selling prices rose 4% and product mix was favorable by 1 point, while organic volumes fell about 2%. Price realization was excellent in both North America and across K-C International. Consumer Tissue operating margins rose 410 basis points versus last year. And I was really pleased to see that our global tissue teams continue to capture the benefits from our strategies to improve revenue realization and drive cost savings.","Moving to K-C Professional & Other. Organic sales were up about 5%. The increase was driven by improved volumes of 3%, higher net selling prices of 2% and slightly favorable mix. Volumes were up high-single digits in K-C International, while North American and European volumes were up low-single digits. Operating margins of 15.7% were up 220 basis points versus last year.  That was driven by benefits from sales growth and cost savings.","And lastly, our Health Care organic sales were up 4%, driven by volume growth. Medical supply volumes rose mid-single digits, led by growth in exam gloves and surgical products. In addition, medical device volumes advanced low-single digits, with solid growth in our airway management business. Operating margins of 13.1% were in line with last year. ","So that wraps up my comments. To recap, we achieved solid organic sales growth that was led by K-C International. We delivered improved margins and earnings per share, and we're reinvesting in the business to support our growth strategies.","Now I'll turn it over to Tom.","Thomas J. Falk","Thanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. I'll share my perspectives on our first quarter, and I'll focus in on K-C International and then I'll briefly recap our outlook for the year. ","So let's start with the first quarter. Our results were very good. We're off to somewhat of a better start to the year than we planned 3 months ago, and that's mostly due to better top line growth in K-C International. ","Mark's already reviewed the key financials for the quarter. So let me just add that I'm encouraged by our top line growth, by our gross margin improvement and by the investments we were able to make behind our brands. And then finally, we had a terrific bottom line performance. So we got more work to do and the comparisons will get tougher as the year progresses, but I'm very optimistic about the state of our business coming out of the first quarter.","Since K-C International is a key part of our overall growth strategy, I thought it'd be helpful on this call to share some of the details about the actions that we're taking and the results that we're delivering in this business. So first quarter organic sales growth in K-C International was 13%. And that was highlighted by an 18% organic growth in Personal Care. Now some of you may know, this business is now larger than our Personal Care business in North America. So we got scale and we got terrific growth prospects in this business. ","We continue to deliver strong results in our key geographic priorities. In China, for example, organic sales grew more than 45% in the first quarter. And Huggies diapers have now expanded into nearly 80 cities, and we're in the process of launching a new diaper-pant in this market.","In Russia, our organic Personal Care sales are up about 25%, and that included benefits from the Huggies diaper upgrade we began supporting in the first quarter. ","In Latin America, our organic sales increased by nearly 25%, and that included 20% growth in Brazil where we're launching Intimates Explosion, which is a premium feminine care line extension that's very similar to the U by Kotex launch that we've had going in the U.S. ","From a product standpoint, we continue to drive strong growth in our biggest Personal Care businesses in K-C International. In fact, in the first quarter, organic sales were up 20% at infant care and more than 10% in feminine care. ","But I think it's also important to note that we're making good progress with some of our smaller investment businesses in K-C International. For example, we had organic sales in adult care, grew 25% in the quarter. And baby wipes were up about 20% in the quarter. In the past, these 2 businesses were largely North American. And now, we're starting to make them truly global, and we're leveraging our strong brands, the favorable demographic trends and the investments that we've made behind these areas over time.","If you look elsewhere in KCI, we saw good growth in our K-C Professional business in the emerging markets. In first quarter, organic sales for KCP increased 10% within KCI, and that included 20% growth in Latin America. And so we expect KCP's momentum in emerging markets to continue as we make strategic investments where you see industrialization and economic development occur.","And lastly, our Consumer Tissue business in K-C International continues to drive revenue realization, improved mix and cost savings. Our teams delivered a solid step-up in margins in the first quarter, and that further built on the progress that they made in 2011.","So that's just a little bit of a deep dive into our K-C International business. Overall, our strategies are working, our categories are healthy and we continue to be very optimistic about our prospects for this business. ","Now before turning to the outlook, let me just touch briefly on our market positions in the U.S. While the U.S. market is very competitive, we're in solid shape, overall, from a share standpoint. Our market shares are up or even with the year-ago period in 5 of our 8 consumer categories. And that's true in 7 of 8 if you look at it sequentially compared to last quarter. So our businesses in the U.S. remain fundamentally strong, and we've got more innovation coming to further improve the health of our brands.","So now let's look -- move to the outlook. Regarding the global economy, our views are similar to or perhaps slightly better than what we talked to you about in January. We continue to expect that conditions will remain healthy in emerging markets overall, and we're not seeing any slowdown in our categories at this point. ","In Venezuela, where we had a solid first quarter, results are likely to soften a little bit going forward, given the price controls that recently have gone into effect. In the U.S., the economic environment seems to be improving rather modestly. As a result, we aren't planning for a big pickup in market demand in the near term, and we expect the baby and child care categories to remain soft.","And finally, in Europe, we expect the marketplace to remain challenging, although through the first quarter, our European team is off to a solid start on executing its 2012 plan.","So in this environment, we'll continue to pursue our targeted growth initiatives. We'll leverage our strong brands and we'll continue to bring innovation to the marketplace. In K-C International, we'll continue to expand diaper-pants, premium fem care and adult care offerings into more markets. In North America, we have several launches currently underway or that will happen in the near term, and that includes our Super Premium Depend Briefs, the latest fashion execution on Huggies diapers, new U by Kotex products, some health care pain management offerings and several new K-C Professional innovations.","To support our brands and growth initiatives, we'll continue to increase strategic marketing and research and development spending at a faster rate than sales will grow this year.","Now we mentioned in this morning's news release, we reconfirmed our key planning assumptions from January. In terms of cost inflation, our total expectation for the year is unchanged. Although most oil-based costs are tracking a little higher than we expected, that will be likely offset by somewhat more favorable pulp costs. Nonetheless, most commodity costs are expected to rise sequentially from first quarter levels, so we'll continue to focus on cost savings and revenue realization strategies. In short, we're executing the plan we laid out 3 months ago. And we're continuing to target full year adjusted earnings in the range of $5 to $5.15 per share. ","So to summarize, our first quarter performance was encouraging. We're well-positioned to deliver on our full year 2012 plan, and we remain convinced that our Global Business Plan will continue to drive improved shareholder value. ","So that wraps up our prepared remarks, and now we'll be happy to begin to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ali Dibadj with Sanford Bernstein.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","A few questions. It was actually helpful that you spent some time on the KCI business, and then particularly in Personal Care, wanted to get a sense from you guys of how much of the growth is distribution growth or driven by distributive gain versus sort of same-store sales. Because that will tell us a little bit about the sustainability of that growth rate. And I guess a subpart of that question is just around the margin impact of that growth in the emerging markets. I know it used to be that your margins there were pretty darn close to the developed world, so love to get a sense of that as well, please.","Thomas J. Falk","Yes, good questions. I'd say -- we would say we took share in most of the emerging markets at the kind of growth levels that we saw. In a market like Latin America, for example, where we're up 25% in Personal Care, I mean, we've gotten most of the distribution in place that we need there. So there's some places in Brazil that we're expanding. In the Northeast, that's sort of new territory for us. But other than that, we're pretty fully penetrated. Russia, we've got great distribution in and around the Moscow region, but we're expanding more to the East and into the balance of the country. But we also would say we had some share gains behind innovation there. China was the one that was -- is a big number. And I think we went from, I think, 72 cities at the end of last year to 80 cities now. So part of it is distribution-related. But we also have moved into Tier 3. So we're expanding our offering, and we're just in the process of launching diaper-pants. So there's probably a little bit of pipeline fill there. So yes, some share growth, but a lot of innovation and some distribution expansion. And it's tough to break those down, but I'd say, probably in China in particular, was more -- we were expanding into new categories and new markets, and Latin America was probably more of share growth.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","So just -- before I get to the follow-up on the margins part. So if you were to say kind of the Personal Care business, 19%, I think, is the organic growth number, you think 2\/3 same-store sales-ish, 1\/3 distribution gain, is that a fair gut check?","Thomas J. Falk","I'd be guessing. I would say it doesn't sound wildly out of bounds, but we don't have good data to really track it at that level of detail.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. Okay, and then I had a second part of that question...","Thomas J. Falk","Yes, on the margin front, we saw some good margin improvement from KCP as well. So we saw double-digit profit growth in many of these markets as well. So good cost savings performance, good price realization, probably nearly half of the price realization in dollar terms from a total corporate standpoint was in K-C International. So yes, no, they're off to a good start this year on top line and bottom line.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. Switching gears a little bit to free cash flow. And I've asked this question before, but I just want to continue to get comfortable, maybe I'm just too old fashioned about this stuff, but your free cash flow is again less than the dividend and stock repurchase or basically the payment to shareholders. I'm just trying to get a sense of how I can feel comfortable with that, especially when you're not getting -- we're not being hit as much by restructuring charges turning to cash. So how should we feel about that?","Thomas J. Falk","Okay. I'll let Mark talk to that one.","Mark A. Buthman","Ali, we look at it on an annual basis. So our cash flow isn't going to be consistent. It'll -- our operating cash flow will grow over the year. We knew we were going to come out of the gate strong with share repurchases. We were out of the market in the fourth quarter, so we wanted to start strong. We've got about half of the low end of our share repurchases in the bank already in the first quarter. Built a little bit of debt, but that'll come down as the year progresses. For the full year, I think you'll see probably $3 billion of operating cash flow, with about 1\/3 going to capital spending, 1\/3 going to dividends and 1\/3 going to share repurchases. So for the full year, we're not looking to increase significantly our debt. To back up strategically over the last 10 years, I think in '07 and then last year, we made a choice to increase our debt. But other than that, we're funding share repurchases. And our goal is to fund them out of available operating cash flow.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. And then just my last question, if you would, is around the increased marketing spend, $45 million this quarter, for example. Can you give us a sense of how you prioritize that? So I guess what I'm getting at is, how much of that is spent in the emerging markets to grow the brand, to grow education, et cetera, versus new innovations in the U.S. versus competing in Western Europe? Because it looked like it was somewhat competitive. How do you break that up? I know you mentioned your innovation and other projects, but how do you prioritize that spend?","Thomas J. Falk","Yes, each of our teams around the world, we really own the P&Ls on a geographic basis. So they'd put together a plan. They'd work with our global brand teams to make sure that we're resourcing the plan in the right way, and that we're looking at the relative ROI in each of these markets and the opportunity there. We have a series of global planning sessions where we work through and say, \"Yes, this one makes sense, this one, you need to go do a little bit more work\" and rinse through that as just part of our ongoing business planning process. And so, as you can imagine, it's a mixture of some center view of the market and some local view of the opportunity. And those usually come together in a business plan that then we go execute.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","So no, so I understand the process, but when you roll it all up, obviously, you kind of look through and say, \"Are we tackling the right stuff?\" So again, how much of that can you tell?  Or do you not maybe do this in the end, these emerging markets versus developed world versus defending those kind of buckets?","Thomas J. Falk","Yes, we do, do it at that level, but there isn't a big calculator at corporate that's got that level of scientific view. So you look at China and say the opportunity is huge. And so the question is, how can we go even faster? Then you know that -- you don't look at a 1-year payback and compare that around the world. It's what's your relative competitive position, what's the strength of your innovation, what's it going to take to communicate that message to the consumer. And you look at those opportunities and decide which of the opportunity set that you have balances against your strategy and attack those.","Operator","Our next question comes from Alice Longley with Buckingham Research.","Alice  Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Can you comment on why you're holding to your guidance and what kind of deceleration your guidance assumes in the second quarter as opposed to the second half. But I mean, you beat so much, and I know that the gross margin, you've already said the gross margin will be up less in the second half than the first. But I think you indicated that the first quarter was an upside surprise to you, too. So why hold to this guidance?","Thomas J. Falk","Yes, I think -- we're 3 months into the year. So it's relatively early in the plan. There's still lots of things to worry about and lots of competitive activity happening in the marketplace. If you look at the earnings beat, $0.03 of it was really related to a little lower effective rate. That was in our guidance for the full year. It's just that the individual settlement happened in the first quarter. So if you looked at it from that standpoint, on a normalized tax rate, we're not that far ahead of what we said. And so I still think it's the right level of guidance. If we're sitting here 3 months from now and things -- the momentum continues, we'll take another look at that and give you an update at that point.","Alice  Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","You just cited -- or said that there was a lot of competitive activity out there. Could you tell us which category and which region you think competition will be heating up?","Thomas J. Falk","Yes. Well, sure, I mean, in fem care, P&G has got a major relaunch coming in the U.S. In diapers, they've got a relaunch coming midyear, and they've got a big Olympic program in the third quarter. They're going to drive that globally. So yes, there's plenty of stuff to react to, and we are off to a good start. We're encouraged by that. We're certainly going to keep -- I mean, my goal, Alice, is to deliver terrific results and not necessarily be the most accurate forecaster that you've ever had.","Alice  Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Okay. And then my last question is, to circle back to the emerging regions, what percentage of your revenues in emerging regions comes from baby care, roughly?","Thomas J. Falk","Paul, have you got the split of that?","Paul J. Alexander","Yes, we don't break out precisely, but if you added up infant care and child care, it would be at least half.","Operator","Our next question comes from Caroline Levy with the CLSA.","Caroline S. Levy - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Incredible acceleration in growth, fourth to the first quarter. I'm just sort of looking at my notes from K-C International, and the fourth quarter was only up 7. And so again, just trying to get behind what Alice was getting at, do you think this was an anomaly, this kind of 19% growth in those markets? And then also just to understand, because I think Europe was very, very soft in the fourth quarter, so can you tell us what programs are working to turn that around? And I think price was down 5% in Europe, but your volume growth of 11 more than offset that. So just helping us understand if any of this is one-off and why it wouldn't be sustainable.","Thomas J. Falk","Yes, sure. No, I think the first quarter is probably a little easier comp for us. So we're -- the growth rate looked a little bit better from that standpoint. But we had a little lighter first quarter last year. So that's probably part of it. I'd say in emerging markets, the momentum has been pretty good. And so we're seeing that continue and even accelerate a bit. We've got more investment behind it, more innovation happening in the first quarter than we had in the fourth quarter. And we'd expect that pace to continue as the year rolls out. It's also encouraging to see some of our investment businesses like adult care and baby wipes that really have been predominantly North American businesses. We're investing in those. We're putting the right resources behind them. And we're seeing those really start to take off in emerging markets. And I think we're still very early days on that front. And in Europe, what we're seeing right now is it's a very competitive market and Tesco's had some challenges in their home market in the U.K. They're wanting to promote and drive foot traffic heavily. That's part of what helped our business in the diaper side, in particular, in the first quarter. Tissue is a little soft in Europe. And as we were trying to take a little bit of price increase and the category wasn't moving. So we lost a little bit of momentum on Andrex in the first quarter but are looking to get that back. Southern Europe, particularly Italy, you've got retailers advertising private label pricing right now and really talking about the economic crisis and how consumers have to be cautious. So there's a lot more promotion spending in the marketplace. And that's showing up in some of the negative price. And we're getting some positive volume lift from that, which is good. But it comes at a cost.","Caroline S. Levy - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Right. And you mentioned your non-branded business in Europe. Do you supply some of that private label?","Thomas J. Falk","We have some. A small amount of our sales -- less than 10% of our sales in Europe is private label. And we picked up a couple of additional contracts, and you saw that in some of the volume numbers in the quarter. But not a big factor in our overall effort at this stage.","Caroline S. Levy - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","So the bigger question for me, just taking a longer-term view, is the birthrate declines in U.S. and Europe. And is there any chance that you see that the volume actually picks up in these markets without the birthrate recovering?","Thomas J. Falk","I think that if the birthrate doesn't recover, I think that'll be tough because consumers are pretty much using 5 diapers a day. And if they don't have babies being born, that's going to fall off. I think as we look at the U.S. birthrate, at least, and look at some of the underlying causals being employment rate, household formation, you're even seeing it in some of the housing data that's starting to emerge, there are some reasons to believe that the birthrate will turn from being slightly negative to slightly positive later this year. The category in the U.S. will still be down a couple of percent just because of the fact that over the last several years, the birthrate's been down. And so as those children are still in diapers this year, we won't have the benefit of their participation in the category. But we would think, going forward, the birthrate starts to turn neutral or slightly positive. Again, the big growth story is going to be K-C International, where the category penetration is quite low and there's a big opportunity there as the category builds out.","Caroline S. Levy - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Absolutely. Just a last question, in the U.S., did you gain share then in all of your major categories this quarter?","Thomas J. Falk","We were up in 5 out of 8 -- up or flat in 5 out of 8 year-over-year. And if you look sequentially, we were up or flat in 7 out of 8. And so in diapers in particular, we were relatively flat sequentially and year-over-year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bill Schmitz with the Deutsche Bank.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So the first question is, who thought it was a good idea to name a fem care product Explosion?","Thomas J. Falk","Bill, they don't let accountants like me name anything. We have a whole army of marketing people that do a fantastic job of that. And I'm sure in Portuguese, it's a fantastic expression that consumers love.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. Was there any help from the leap year this year in the quarter?","Thomas J. Falk","No, not that I know of. Somebody pointed that out to me, and I said, \"Oh, yes, it was leap year this year.\" I don't know. We probably had an extra shipping day somewhere, but I don't think that was a big enough factor to drive anything significant.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, great. And then just a last one, on the Personal Care business, is there any way to sort of disaggregate the margin softness between just a mix shift both between emerging markets and U.S. markets, and the slowdown in training pants and then just commodity inflation? So is there just like a rough metric to kind of see what's driving that margin contraction?","Thomas J. Falk","Yes, although you look at it sequentially, and the margin was up nicely. And so a good chunk of the sequential improvement was price realization, particularly in North America. And a good chunk of the commodity cost, the oil-based inflation, did hit Personal Care, a good -- a fair amount of that in emerging markets. So they were able to get price to offset some of that so...","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. So I mean it's not -- it doesn't sound like it's that material, the geographic mix shift and then the training pants mix shift?","Thomas J. Falk","No, I would say there was very modest, if any, impact from a geographic mix shift.","Mark A. Buthman","Yes, commodities was the big factor.","Thomas J. Falk","Yes. Commodities and price realization were the big factors.","Paul J. Alexander","Yes. In fact, though, our margins in K-C International were up significantly year-over-year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bill (sic) [Gail] Glazerman with UBS.","Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Sticking on International for a second, it looked like K-C International tissue volumes, even excluding restructuring, were pretty weak. Is there anything one-off there? Is there something that we should be like looking at or thinking about?","Thomas J. Falk","Yes, what you saw there was positive price, really positive mix and negative volume. And part of that is how we count unit volume. So as we de-sheet and put shelfs, is one way we get price. We show that as positive price and negative volume. And so we've been driving that business to drive mix shift and sell more premium products and move from one-ply commodity to two-ply premium around the world. And you really saw that come through with the numbers. So it really sort of belies the progress we're making in terms of consumer share by those statistics. But we've been doing it that way from a -- consistently. And so we just try to be transparent on what's actually happening.","Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay, great. And kind of sticking on demand and volumes, you mentioned in the release seeing some improvement in your washroom business in North America. Can you give a little bit more color? And was that trend consistent through the quarter, getting stronger or weaker as you exited the quarter?","Thomas J. Falk","Yes, I mean, I think KCP usually starts out a little slow just because some distributors will take a little bit more inventory before the end of the year just so they've got -- to tide them over. And so -- but I'd say things have been picking up throughout the quarter. And we had some distributors in recently and they were pretty bullish on their outlook this year in the U.S. market. So they were talking about high single-digit, low double-digit growth, pretty broad geographic distribution in the U.S. You're starting to see it in office buildings and lodging, and some of the occupancy rates are ticking up a bit. I'd say manufacturing is an area that's been a little slow that's starting to pick up as you're seeing more employment there, but still some room to go there. And we've had some innovation that we're out talking about as well. So part of it has been positive as we're out talking about a healthy workplace and with some new dispenser programs and things like that in that market. So we're feeling pretty good about KCP.","Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then just a couple of quick questions on inflation. Can you give a sense of what you're looking at for natural gas? I guess it was $3.00 to $3.50 last quarter, and I'm assuming that's changed.","Thomas J. Falk","Yes, I mean, our outlook for it is in the, what, $2.00 and change -- $2.25. And we're partly hedged. As you know, we were probably 60% hedged last quarter. And we've got hedges in place on a rolling basis for the next several quarters. So we don't get the full benefit of that. But for every full dollar per MMBTU that gas changes, it's about $16 million in operating profit in North America, and -- just from a rule of thumb standpoint.","Mark A. Buthman","Before any impact from hedging.","Thomas J. Falk","Right, before hedging. Just on a raw number.","Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And I guess your real inflation was coming from kind of other raw materials. Can you talk about kind of -- I know you said you expect inflation to be up sequentially, but just what that trend was. Is that just recognizing increases through the quarter and things have stabilized? Or are you still seeing inputs within that category still rising?","Thomas J. Falk","Yes, I mean, most of the ROI [ph] stuff is polymer. And you're seeing it in some of the shortages of things that are popping up. You saw it in the gasoline market in the first quarter, and it's just been real volatile. And I think if you look at a lot of the resin pricing that we buy, that's probably been the biggest single driver and expect that to tick up a bit in the second quarter. Pulp is expected to move up. We've seen a couple of moves already. That'll probably be the biggest dollar impact on some of the sequential changes. And there's a question, will -- there's some expected pulp capacity in Brazil that's supposed to start up later this year. Whether or not that happens is still, I think, weighing on the market.","Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. But pulp, I mean, we're starting to see Asia kind of roll off right now. There's certainly a lot of the capacity coming on over a 6-month period starting later this year. Reports indicate that discounts are up. I mean, your forecast continues to be even, though it's down significantly, above where we are year to date. I mean, is there really anything you're seeing in terms of securing supply that...","Thomas J. Falk","Well, we saw -- we've seen eucalyptus price went up, I think it was $70 a ton in the market last month, and they're talking about another price increase coming up in May or June. So there is some upward movement on pulp price. On the other hand, we'd say secondary fiber price has been a little softer than we expected. So we'll see. A lot of it depends on Asian buying and what happens there.  And if the Chinese are not in the market, you could see a little sloppier pulp market in the second quarter. We'll see.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jason Gere with RBC Capital Markets.","Jason Gere - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I guess just talking about the diaper business in the U.S., and last quarter, we saw a lot more promotional spending out there and it didn't really kind of drop to volumes. I guess, can you just put a little color around what you saw the last 3 months on the competitive side, even from -- on the retail side as well? I know the trends don't look all that great, but I'm just wondering if this kind of came in line with your expectation. And do you see more the focus on price realization going forward as opposed to a little bit more price investment coming back as we saw in the fourth quarter?","Thomas J. Falk","As we talked on the last call, some of the activity in the fourth quarter, we believe was related to our launch of Diaper-Pants and our competitors were responding to protect, as they would typically do, in a major launch situation, as we would do if it was the other way around. And so some of that rolled off. And in the first quarter, we were pleased to see where we got really no price realization in North America in the fourth quarter, we had a couple of points of price realization in the first quarter. So that's a positive sign. The price increase appears to be in place across all the major retail channels in North America. There's still a fair amount of promotional activity out there, but it is a reduced rate from where it was in the fourth quarter. So we feel pretty optimistic about how it moves from here. And there's lots -- we got innovative products in the marketplace with our mainline Huggies. We got more innovation coming, so does P&G. So -- but the good news for CEO mom is that there'll be lots of news in the diaper category over the next couple of quarters, and then that makes it that much more challenging for private label and others in the category.","Jason Gere - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then what about training pants? I mean, that seems to be one of those categories that's kind of taken the hit over the last couple of years. How do you re-engage the consumer? I know we're probably not there yet. We have to wait until birthrates go up. But how do you kind of manage that business right now? And what do retailers talk to you about the shelf space that you have?","Thomas J. Falk","Well, I mean, it's a terrific category still, and it's a very good category for the retailer. Now the reality of it is, we have 3 years of a declining birthrate that totaled close to 8% decline in live births in the U.S. That's essentially piled up in the training pant category, because that's about where toilet training occurs, is around age between 2.5 and 3.5. And so we've gotten good visibility on that with our retail customers. We're driving lots of innovation. We're launching some new products around that space. We got a terrific GoodNites business that's in that space in the aisle. We're launching a new GoodNites bed mat that'll be out there for overnight use for children in that space. And so I think while everybody would like it to grow faster, they also understand the reality of what's happened in the demographics for the near term.","Jason Gere - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then just on Consumer Tissue with the U.S., just given where pulp prices have been, have you seen any changes from your competitors out there in terms of trying to take down price or get a little bit more promotional there?","Thomas J. Falk","Not really. I mean, I think the pricing has gone in, and the -- as high as pulp got, we never really even fully recovered the highest level of pulp price in the finished product selling prices. And so I think there's a sense that we're still probably behind from where we were. So I think so far, again, that market has been relatively rational as well in the near term.","Jason Gere - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then just the last question was a clarification. I think, Mark, you were talking about the Personal Care margins. Did you say they were going to be equal to kind of 2011 levels?","Mark A. Buthman","Equal to 2011 full year.","Jason Gere - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Full year. So you're talking just -- so it would be a slight decline from where you ended the first quarter, which I think you were...","Thomas J. Falk","I'd say ballpark, we were around 17 for the full year. I would think we'll be around 17 as the right target for 2012. We would say we're in that ballpark.","Operator","Our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays Capital.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I just wanted to follow up on Jason's pricing questions, actually. So pricing in U.S. facial tissues number [ph] in Q4 private label kind of hasn't come around. Are they near that now there, so pricing's in line in that category?","Thomas J. Falk","Yes, I mean, I think so. I'm not -- we took price in facial tissue through sheet count change. And so it is kind of a complicated question. So I'm not sure you'd see it at every account, but we have seen it in some accounts.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then the other piece also following up from Q4 was the pack count change in diapers in North America I think hurt volumes. And you'd expected kind of the household, like the pantry inventories to recover in Q1. So was that a little bit of a benefit?  Because the volumes sequentially in North America -- it sounded like Personal Care's were a little bit better.","Thomas J. Falk","Yes, that's probably right. We talked about that in the last call where we had -- we took the full hit of the pantry low. And we usually don't even see that much of the pantry destocking effect of lower count. And so probably our volume was more reflective of what's actually happening in the category in the first quarter.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Or is it better maybe to look at sort of an average of Q4 and Q1, or not really? It really is more Q1, you think, is reflective of category.","Thomas J. Falk","Yes, I would think that most of the pantry and retailer ordering pattern stuff should be flushed through by now.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. Okay, and then the final thing, which is paper towels, you mentioned distribution gains. So was that Viva in particular regaining some distribution or is it Scott?","Thomas J. Falk","A little bit of both. Actually both brands had a pretty solid first quarter. So that was encouraging to see.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And what do you think is driving it? Because I feel like Viva -- there was, when you go back, it was a bit like you guys were pushing on the revenue realization, this great high-margin, high-priced product you have at the time when, unfortunately, consumers were going other direction. So do you think regaining shelf space there is any sign of kind of confidence on the retailers?","Thomas J. Falk","Well, I think shelf space, I think, as you know, many of the retailers, some large ones in particular, had gone to a much more streamlined shelf set. I think much of that has been rolled back as the consumers wanted to have a bit more selection. We've had a terrific creative campaign with Mike Rowe behind Viva, and that's really resonated well and driven a lot of interest in the brand. We've had some innovation in news as well and that -- all of the collection of that has led to better volume and results.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. Great. And then my final question was just on K-C Professional, because you did mention on -- that growing in international was a big focus. So about, to the degree you can talk about it, like ballpark, how big or small is that business today? How do you really go about expanding that business? Is it kind of the high-margin very big-city-focused? And how much do you expect that to play into the growth story over the next couple of years for that business?","Thomas J. Falk","Yes, I mean, we're already in a lot of markets already. But I'd say if you looked at Russia, China, would be -- and maybe India, would be the new growth platforms over time that we'd be looking at, where we're maybe not as well represented. Latin America, we've got a pretty good-size business, but we're really putting more dedicated resource against it and driving it. I don't know, Paul, if you've got a geographic split of that in terms of emerging markets versus developed markets but...","Paul J. Alexander","Yes, Lauren, if you look at total K-C Professional, about 25% to 30% is in KCI.","Thomas J. Falk","Yes, and so that would compare to 37% of the total company. So it's a little underweight. And on Health Care, it would be even more underweight. So that just gives you some sort of perspective on it.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And the bulk of it sounds like, then, is in Latin America at this point.","Thomas J. Falk","Latin America will be the biggest piece, reflecting the strong footprint we have in Latin America. We've got a lot more tissue in Latin America and that tends to be a good host to get some of our KCP business started. But we've got a terrific lineup of safety products and wipers that we're taking to global manufacturers around the world. So we can go to Ford or we can go to any other big company and say, \"We can give you the exact same wiper solution to drive a consistent manufacturing process in every one of your facilities around the world.\" There is really no other company in this space that can do that today.","Operator","Our next question comes from Wendy Nicholson with Citi Research.","Wendy Nicholson - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I have a couple quick ones. First of all, the $45 million in incremental marketing spending, can you break that out international versus U.S.?","Thomas J. Falk","Yes, if you look at -- let me see if I've got that here handy.","Mark A. Buthman","It was roughly about 1\/3 in KCI and another...","Thomas J. Falk","Yes, it's pretty proportional to the size of the business. So you'd say, KCI got at least its fair share and probably Personal Care was a little heavier than tissue, which would reflect the launch of innovation, both in North America and in emerging markets.","Wendy Nicholson - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. Okay, and then the 1% hit on the top line from the lost sales, the -- whatever product line exits you're doing, is there any way to quantify the impact on the tissue margins that came from that initiative specifically as opposed to commodity prices or other things?","Thomas J. Falk","Well, I think the total cost savings from all of our restructuring in the quarter was about $5 million. And so within that, I think some of the advantage of that would be reflected. So not big. And it was about a 1-point drag overall for the lost sales.","Wendy Nicholson - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, fine. And then my last question -- and I don't mean to sort of beat a dead horse here, but just going back to the diaper market in the U.S. and looking at sort of the pricing trends and the market share trends, and that's the only category where it seems that fairly consistently, but particularly here in the first quarter 2012, private label is gaining, I think, 200 basis points of market share. And so I'm wondering if the spending that you're doing, the innovations you're trying to bring to market -- I mean, I look at Procter's shares and even with Dry Max and hey, it was poorly executed, whatever. But all the innovation that both of you guys are bringing to the market, both of your shares are still way off their peak, and yet private label is way up. So is there...","Thomas J. Falk","I think you might be looking at 3-outlet data, because if we look at all outlet data, I'd say private label shares were down 1.1 points sequentially and they're down 6\/10 of a point year-over-year in infant care, and this would be  diapers.","Wendy Nicholson - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And that may do it, because I'm just looking at the Nielsen data. So if a -- data is different in Wal-Mart, that's good to know.","Thomas J. Falk","Well, that would reflect Wal-Mart, club, dollar, which wouldn't be all in your database. And so...","Mark A. Buthman","This category in particular is far over-indexed to non-measured outlets.","Thomas J. Falk","Yes, I think probably the Nielsen database may only be 1\/3 or less of the total category.","Wendy Nicholson - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","So the risk of any price pullback or anything like that or increased promotional spending on the diaper business, not in the future for you.","Thomas J. Falk","Well, I think we would like to. We watch the relative price gaps versus private label. Usually, there's about a 6-month lag between when price goes in on branded products and when private label pricing takes place. So that's something that we will be watching to see what happens in the second quarter, if there is a price movement in private label or not. And so -- but I think, it looks like at this point, across the branded players, the price increase has gone in across all of the major retail outlets.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Ferrara with Bank of America.","Christopher Ferrara - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I wanted to go back, just to make sure I understand, on the EM Personal Care discussion. It sounds like you're suggesting that, that level of growth in Personal Care in KCI is sustainable. Am I getting that right?","Thomas J. Falk","Well, I mean, I'll tell you, it was a very good quarter. So it's been above where we've been. But I also think we've got an aggressive plan put together. And it was a little ahead of plan, but it wasn't a lot ahead of our expectation.","Christopher Ferrara - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Great, that's helpful. And then I guess the marketing spending, I was wondering if you could try to just break out a little bit the cadence or the pace of what the year-on-year incremental investment's going to look like, and if you can layer that into what the innovation pace looks like. Because I understand that Q1 has been a big innovation quarter. That's obviously going to continue through the year. But how do we think about the year-on-year change in marketing as we go through?","Thomas J. Falk","Yes, if I look at that strategic A&P relative to sales, we -- if you go back to like 2010, we were at a higher rate than we were in 2011. And if you look at our first quarter numbers, we're kind of coming back up close to those 2010 levels. And so I'd say that's probably the right -- more medium-term aspiration is how do we get back on the trend line to have a P&L where we're delivering innovative margin accretive growth and are able to reinvest in strategic A&P to build brands around the world. And so I'd expect to see, as we said on our January call, a faster level of growth in A&P this year than sales growth. And the first quarter was certainly representative of that. But you will have a pretty strong first half spend rate, and then we'll see how things progress in the second half and give you a better look at that in July.","Christopher Ferrara - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And one last one, I actually caught a piece of your interview on CNBC this morning. And I know you mentioned it a little in the presentation here, but you sounded reasonably optimistic about the channel. And I think you might have said something to the order of sales got better over the last month or the retailers looked more optimistic over the last month. Can you -- did you say that?","Thomas J. Falk","Yes, they were asking about the U.S. economy, and we've been with some KCP distributors recently that were North American-based. And these are folks that would sell to medium-size businesses, would be in the lodging, office supply, even some manufacturing space. And these are some of our best customers. So these are folks that are really doing great things. And they're expecting high single-digit, double-digit growth, had a solid start to the year. And so they were more optimistic. I think, the question was related to, \"Are you concerned about the U.S. economy?\" And certainly, there's plenty of things to worry about. But there's also some signs of growth that are happening here.","Operator","Our next question comes from Linda Bolton-Weiser with Caris & Company.","Linda Bolton-Weiser - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division","I know you had said something earlier in your comments about Venezuela, and I didn't quite catch what you said. Can you comment again whether you're affected by the price controls there? And also can you remind us what your percentage of revenue and profit is in Venezuela, and just the philosophy about what do you do in this situation? Do you just kind of suffer lower profitability or just what's the philosophy going forward?","Thomas J. Falk","Yes, that's great. Venezuela is a very low single-digit percentage of our sales and profits. I think last year, we announced it was 1% of sales and it was 3% of profits. We're in that ballpark kind of range, is our expectation as to where that can be. And price control went in. And we were on the list. We've worked through with our customers and with the government on how that's going to be executed in the marketplace. And our team is in the process of -- or it's in place. It was effective April 1. And so, our primary concern is to make sure that we can serve our consumers and our customers. So we want to make sure moms have diapers and our consumers have fem care products and bath tissue and facial tissue and all the things that they need to take care of their family. And we want to do that in a way that complies with the rules that the Venezuelan government has passed down. So I think we said, in my remarks, that the first quarter was a little bit more positive than we're going to see in the remaining 3 quarters, but it's still going to be a profitable business for us. And it's one that we're managing carefully. Obviously, getting foreign exchange to be able to pay the bills for imported raw materials and for imported finished product is key, and that supply of foreign exchange has been uneven at times. And so that'll be a key to our back half plan so that we can continue to operate the business successfully.","Operator","Our next question will come from Connie Maneaty with BMO Capital Markets.","Constance Marie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Just to follow up on Venezuela, what is the average price decline you have to absorb? And how strictly do you think the authorities are going to enforce the regulations?","Thomas J. Falk","I think the price change varied by category. In some cases, it was double digits. In some cases, it was less than that. And I think, like anywhere else we operate, Connie, I mean, our goal is to fully comply with whatever the rules are in the country. And if we can't operate there and make money, then we'll re-evaluate why we're there. But we want to make sure that we're complying. We assume that the government will put compliance measures in place. But I think our goal is to make sure we're in compliance. And then we'll let somebody else worry about if they can get away with playing games with the price list.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Faucher with JPMorgan Chase.","John A. Faucher - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So 2 questions here. The first is, if I look at your raw material guidance, it's dollar-based as opposed to unit-based. So the volume appears to be coming in better. You seem to be relatively optimistic. Can we read into it that better volumes with the same level of cost inflation implies a little bit more gross margin upside? So that's the first question. And then the second, just to sort of follow up on Wendy's question, which is it seems as though the diaper business in particular is better suited to this channel fragmentation, particularly in terms of online. So I guess as we look at something like diapers.com, which has a lower level of private label presence, should we expect the branded competitors to take more share as the business moves to that channel? And then secondly, it would seem as though if you don't get the consumer before she buys her first set of diapers, you run the risk of losing her because you have fewer opportunities to switch her brand preference. And I -- so is -- I guess I'm looking for some thoughts you have in terms of that channel dynamic.","Thomas J. Falk","Yes, that's great. Yes, on your first question, I'd say our growth isn't that much higher in our outlook than planned, and I think we'd attribute the same level of overall inflation assumption to a significant change in margin. I mean, it probably would be 10 basis points or less kind of thing. So broadly, I'd say we're a little bit ahead of volume. That should give us some leverage on the operating side. Obviously, if you're putting more high-cost materials through, you'd have potentially more inflation. But our inflation guidance for the year was plus or minus $50 million. So we're pretty close to a neutral cost perspective from a inflation standpoint. So I don't see a big gross margin impact relative to inflation materials related to our higher volume. So on that side. On the second question, on the channel fragmentation issue and the growth of e-commerce, and clearly, I mean, point-of-market entry is a key strategic entry point for the category. So we want to own that in every channel. And then, obviously, the subscription services for moms that are on diapers.com and Amazon and others, you absolutely want to be a part of that. You want to -- that's from a marketing standpoint. A key strategy is to make sure you have the consumer signed up and you make it just an easy choice for her to want to buy your brand. And so we're making sure we're focused on that and getting at least our fair share of consumers in that space. And we're putting more resources against e-commerce, both with our pure play e-commerce customers, as well as with our bricks-and-mortar retailers that also have e-commerce activities to make sure we're getting our fair share of that growing channel. I think there's also key events in a consumer's diapering experience around size change, where they'll sometimes will try a competitive product. And so we want to make sure we're relevant and have the right offer in place at those key moments as well.","John A. Faucher - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just to follow up on that, I mean, is that a channel where you'd say the quality of sales goes higher again? Because it seems as though it's going to be less about the discounts and more about sort of being able to leverage your marketing spend. So even if you have to spend more money online to attract her, you'll spend less in terms of price promotion going forward. Is that...","Thomas J. Falk","Yes, absolutely. You want to look at the total ROI of the whole channel, including trade funding. And so I think everybody's looking at it that way and making sure that -- and quite honestly, moms are pretty savvy shoppers. And you're finding more consumers than ever that are taking their smartphone to the store and scanning the bar code and finding out what the price is online relative to in the store. And so there's greater price transparency of that on every category these days including ours.","Operator","Our next question will come from Javier Escalante with Consumer Edge Research.","Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research, LLC","I actually would like to go back to the 3 emerging market, China, Brazil and Russia, that you highlighted. You provided a growth rate in this quarter. Wonder whether you have the growth rate for the fourth quarter. I'm trying to assess this inflection point in growth. And also, if you don't have it, basically, I would like to understand, even if you -- the horizontal growth versus the pipeline field, right? Because it seems like you increased the number of cities in China by 10%. And I understand that this 45% growth includes this pipeline field. But at the same time, you are going to have much greater -- 10% greater points of distribution, theoretically. So that would be the case of China. In the case of Brazil, you are mentioning that you already have an infrastructure, but we also know that there was a wage increase in January. To what extent this wage increase is boosting on the underlying category growth, and that would be an explanation. And also if you can help us understand also Russia. You didn't say how many more distributions cities or distribution points you gained in Russia. I'm just trying to understand, again, what is the new underlying growth in these 3 key emerging markets? If you can help us with that, that would be great.","Thomas J. Falk","Yes, I can give you a little bit of color about that, Javier, and I'd say the growth in all 3 is going to be a step up from where we were in the fourth quarter. Paul may have more precise data but...","Paul J. Alexander","Yes, I mean, at a minimum, they were all up double digits in the fourth quarter.","Thomas J. Falk","Yes. So -- but it's up another gear from that. And if I looked at the 3 of them, I'd say in China it's probably more driven by new distribution, but also going into new segments of the category. So going -- adding a Tier 3 diaper, which is the biggest segment in China, we were really only there in the Super Premium area. We've now gone into the mainline part of the category. So that's -- it's not so much the new cities, it's that we're now swimming in the widest part of the river here. And so we've got more growth from that on top of the new cities, and then adding some innovation like diaper pants. So China is probably more -- we're expanding in other parts of the category and expanding geographically. In Russia, we had a improved -- diaper product improvement going in place. And so that's probably more innovation-driven than new distribution-driven, I would say. And Brazil would probably be a similar story to Russia. We've had some good innovation coming on fem care and diapers. We are expanding into the northeast part of the country, which is more new geography for us. But I think the bigger part of the growth in Brazil is going to come from innovation than from geographic expansion.","Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research, LLC","All these initiatives seems to me that they were known, basically, when you provided guidance at the beginning of the year. And it seemed kind of like  growth rates to at least double in your largest key markets was surprising to us. So it's just -- I'm just trying to see if there is any other improvement in the underlying growth rate of the market. Because Brazil has been accelerated for a while, China, too. So I wonder whether, in addition to these initiatives that I would imagine you knew about them when you provided guidance, if there is something else happening in the underlying market? Is it that the consumer in -- are emerging markets back after the slowdown in the past 2 quarters?","Thomas J. Falk","Yes, I think it's probably too early for us to really have enough good data and analytics to give you an accurate answer to that. But I would also say the rise in consumerism across emerging markets has been an ongoing trend. And despite what you might read about it, if China is slowing down from 10% to 8%, that's still a pretty aggressive growth rate. And their incomes are improving. And they're wanting more and more of the types of products that we make and sell in those markets.","Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research, LLC","Yes, but Brazil decelerated to 1% GDP growth. And China is China, but Brazil, which is larger for you, decelerated to 1% GDP growth in the fourth quarter. That's why the question. Finally, the clarification on -- one clarification on the U.S, and I know that everybody has been asking on this, but -- and it still -- it seem unclear to me. You basically said that your market share in the U.S. is flat. And at the same time, you are growing -- your volume growth is mid- to high-single digits. So does it mean that the category volume are declining 7.5%? Is that what shall we understand it?","Thomas J. Falk","No. Our volume was down mid single digits in the U.S., and we realize price and toss that part of that. And our share, I think, was up 3\/10 of a point sequentially, and it was down 2\/10 of a point year-over-year by our all-outlet measure. So that was flat [ph] overall.","John A. Faucher - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","But that would be infant care, but you said that child care was down high-single digits.","Thomas J. Falk","Yes, the child care, the category, is down, and our volume was down high-single digits. Our shares in child care were up 7\/10 sequentially and down a couple of points year-over-year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chip Dillon with Vertical Research Partners.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","I just wanted to ask you about the higher marketing spend. You mentioned the $45 million in the first quarter, and if that's sort of a pace we should annualize to $180 million as being an increase that we should see for the full year.","Thomas J. Falk","I think that would probably be a little higher than expectation. But we'd said it would grow faster than sales. And we want to try to get it back on the trend line that we have been on through the 2010 numbers. We took a little step back in 2011. So you'll see a nice uptick at a faster pace than sales, but maybe not quite to the level of multiplying by 4.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","Got you. That's helpful. And are there any special strategies or at least any indications of what you plan to do as we get these 6 or 7 new private label machines starting up later this year, and especially next year, that are largely new people in the industry? And just your thoughts on how you are preparing for that.","Thomas J. Falk","Yes, well, I mean, I think we're actually more optimistic about the overall tissue operating rate. I mean, there's been a lot of capacity that's gone out of the market, including our Everett mill is now down. And that was 175,000 tons that's out of the market. We will be taking some capacity out of Chester. Some of the other competitors have done so as well. So we actually have seen the tissue operating rate be pretty high, in the high 80s, low 90s, and would expect that to continue for a while. And as we see the continued growth in the category, as the ability to absorb a couple of new tissue machines a year, and we haven't had that for a while. So we're not as concerned about it. I think we've got a -- in COTTONELLE, we've got a differentiated branded offering with a good innovation plan. And it's a lot tougher to make a product like that, even as you bring on new thru-air dry capacity, than you'd think. Scott Tissue is also a differentiated sheet with a unique position, and  strong, loyal brand following. And so we believe that one's well-positioned as well. So we've got good strategies in place to continue to execute our plan and focus on driving that for the benefit of our consumers and our customers.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","Got you. And just 2 quick additional follow-ons, Tom. If you could -- I know that the Everett closure was quite substantial, like a couple of hundred thousand tons. Close to that. Can you give us a feel for how much more it will be coming out, just order of magnitude in tons in Chester. And then switching gears, you noted in the slides that your volumes in diapers in China were up 45%. I believe that must be a year-over-year number, which is phenomenal. And could you talk a little bit about how much of that was the market and how much of that could have been market share?","Thomas J. Falk","Yes. On the first question, we'll probably take one machine out of Chester, and it'll be a smaller number by far than what was done at Everett. So you can probably get the ballpark on that. In China, we talked about that a couple of times on the call, where, I mean, I'd say, a good chunk of it was us expanding into new segments of the category, going into the more mainline part of the diaper category in China. We've also expanded from probably 72 to 80 cities. 72 have been in the last year to 80 at the end of the first quarter. And my guess is we also picked up some share. But it's probably -- we're still a relatively small player in China overall. We're getting to scale in the major cities that we've been in for a while. And with the fuller lineup of products, we'd expect to continue to drive that. So we're enthusiastic about the progress so far.","Operator","At this time, we have no further questioners in the queue.","Paul J. Alexander","All right, thanks, David. We'll wrap up with a closing comment from Tom.","Thomas J. Falk","Well, once again, we're off to a great start, and we're making the right investments to support the initiatives that we've talked about in our global business plan, and we want to make sure that translates into terrific value for our shareholders. So thank you for listening today.","Paul J. Alexander","Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's presentation.

We now have your presenters in conference. Please be aware that each of your lines is in a listen-only mode. At the conclusion of this morning's remarks, we will open the floor for questions. At that time, instructions will be given as to the procedure to follow if you would like to ask an audio question.","It is now my pleasure to introduce Mr. Paul Alexander.","Paul Alexander","Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Kimberly-Clark's third quarter earnings conference call. With us today are Mike Hsu, our Chief Executive Officer; and Maria Henry, our CFO. Here is the agenda for the call. Maria will begin with a review of third quarter results. Mike will then provide his perspectives on our results and the outlook. We will finish with Q&A. We have a presentation of today's materials in the Investors section of our website.","As a reminder, we will be making forward-looking statements today. Please see the Risk Factors section of our latest Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of forward-looking statements. Lastly, we will be referring to adjusted results and outlook, both exclude certain items described in this morning's news release. That release has further information about these adjustments and reconciliations to comparable GAAP financial measures.","And now, I will turn the call over to Maria.","Maria Henry","Thanks, Paul. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining the call today. Let me start with the headlines for the quarter. Organic sales increased 4% driven by higher net selling prices. We achieved strong margin improvement and growth in adjusted earnings per share while increasing brand investment. And finally, we are on track with our overall capital plan and we continue to return cash to shareholders. ","Now let's look at the details of our results starting with sales. Our third quarter net sales were $4.6 billion. That's up more than 1% versus year ago and increased the two point drag from currency rate. Organic sales were up 4%. Net selling price increased 4% and product mix improve one point while volume sale 1% . Mike will provide more color on our top line in just a few minutes. ","Moving on to profitability, third quarter adjusted gross margin was 35.8%, up a strong 260 basis points year-on-year. Adjusted gross profit increased 9% with selling prices well ahead of currency headwinds. We generated solid total cost saving of $95 million from our course FORCE and Restructuring program. Year-to-date cost savings are now $300 million. And is more likely that full year saving will be towards the low end of our $400 million to $450 million target range. Within that, our Restructuring is expected to over deliver while FORCE savings are anticipated to be below plan. On FORCE, performance has been solid in most businesses this year. That said, we were below plan in North America for our supply chain is facing tight capacity and higher than expected demand. At the same time, they were executing our restructuring activities.","Commodities turned favorable in the quarter, and were a modest benefit of $10 million. This is the first time in almost three years that we've seen commodity deflation. Other manufacturing costs also increased in the quarter compared to a relatively modest level last year. ","Moving further down the P&L. Between-the-line spending was up 130 basis points as a percent of sales. That included higher advertising as we continue to invest more behind our brands particularly in digital marketing. SG&A expense also increased compared to a relatively low spending in the year ago quarter, and included higher incentive compensation expense. We're also starting to make investments to improve our commercial capabilities to drive future growth. Most of our investments for 2019 will occur in the fourth quarter.","Foreign currencies were also a headwind in the quarter, reducing operating profit by a mid-single digit rate. All-in-all, adjusted profit was up 8%. Third quarter adjusted operating margin was 18.5%, up a 110 basis points versus year ago. On the bottom line, adjusted earnings per share were $1.84, up 8% year-on-year. A higher adjusted effective tax rate was essentially offset by higher equity incomes and a lower share count.","Now let's look at cash flow and capital efficiency. Cash provided by operations in the third quarter was $886 million, compared to $692 million in the year ago quarter. As expected, this was a strong quarter including improved working capital and lower pension contributions. Capital spending was $298 million in the quarter. That's up versus last year driven by supply chain restructuring projects. We continue to allocate capital in shareholder friendly ways. Third quarter dividends and share repurchases total approximately $570 million and we expect the full-year amount will be $2.2 billion.","Looking at our segment results. In Personal Care, organic sales were up 5%; net selling prices increased 3% and volumes and product mix were each up one point. Personal Care operating margins were 21.3%, up 60 basis points year-on-year. The improvement was driven by organic sales growth and cost savings. In Consumer Tissue, organic sales were up 3%; net selling prices increased 5% while volumes fell two points. Consumer Tissue operating margins were 17.8%, up 340 basis points versus year ago with significant benefits from higher pricing along with cost savings and modest economy deflation.","In K-C Professional, organic sales grew 3%; selling prices rose more than 3% and product mix improved one point, while volumes were down 2%. K-C Professional operating margins of 21% were up 210 basis points versus prior year. The improvement was driven by higher net selling prices and cost savings. Overall, it was a strong quarter and I am pleased that we are in a position to raise our outlook while we invest in the business for the long term.","I'll now turn the call over to Mike.","Mike Hsu","Thank you, Maria. Good morning, everyone. Let me start by saying, I'm pleased with our third quarter results. We achieved stronger improvement on organic sales margins and earnings per share. We continue to launch innovations, invest more on our brands and pursue our growth priorities. We also return significant cash to shareholders. As Maria just mentioned, we delivered 4% organic sales growth in the quarter. Our pricing initiatives are on track and driving our growth.","We also continue to improve product mix which was up one point for the third consecutive quarter. Encouragingly, the pricing of promotion environment remains broadly constructive. Let me share some of the top-line highlights for the quarter starting in North America. Organic sales in consumer products increased 4% and within that organic sale rose 4% in Personal Care and 3% in Consumer Tissue. Growth in North America was driven by 4% higher selling prices led by Consumer Tissue. Mix was up point and led by Huggies diapers which included modest benefits from the launch of Huggies Special Delivery. Volumes were down one point overall. Adult care volumes were up double digits. Poise and Depend had strong momentum driven by product innovation, marketing investment and robust consumer demand.","Baby and child care volumes were down mid-single digits compared to a mid-single digit increased last year. Results this year included softness on baby wipes and Huggies snug and dry diapers. In North America, K-C Professional organic sales increased 5% and growth was driven by continued strong price realization while category volumes remain sluggish.","Now turning to developing in emerging markets, our performance was solid with organic sales growth of 5%. That included two points a growth from Argentina. Now in terms of our key personal care businesses, in China, organic sales were up mid-teens compared to a soft performance last year. Sales were up double digits in both diapers and femcare and in diapers, our net pricing was helped by reduced and more targeted promotional spending. In addition, innovations we launched on premium Huggies are delivering strong growth and improving mix. In femcare, our innovation and premiumization strategy supported by great digital marketing continue to deliver strong results.","In ASEAN, organic sales rose high single digits led by Huggies in Vietnam. In Eastern Europe, organic sales increased high teens with healthy gains in volume and pricing. Growth was strong in both Huggies and Kotex reflecting excellent sales execution, winning innovation and strong marketing. In Brazil, organic sales were up mid-single digits compared to high teens growth last year, as we're starting to lap the price increases we took in 2018. We've also modestly increased promotion support to enhance our competitive position. Growth this quarter was relatively balanced between pricing and volume with volume growth led by adult care and feminine care.","We experienced softer results in Latin America outside of Argentina and Brazil and that included Peru where sales were down in a challenging environment. And as a result, we've dialed back the price increase we took earlier this year and we've launched a value to your diaper. Overall, I am broadly encouraged by performance in D&E markets and remain optimistic about our future growth prospects.","Finally, in developed markets outside North America organic sales were up 1% with solid performance in South Korea and Australia. Beyond sales, I'm pleased with the margin and cash flow improvement we delivered in the quarter. Our teams are working hard on both those fronts.","Turning to the full year, we're raising our outlook on both the top and bottom line. Our revised organic sales growth target is 3% to 4% which compares favorably to our prior target of 3%. While we're up 4% year-to-date, the fourth quarter is our toughest quarterly comp of the year. That said, we expect a solid fourth quarter which should bring the full year well within the 3% to 4% range. On the bottom line, we're now targeting adjusted earnings per share of $6.75 to $6.90 that's $0.10 per share higher than our prior outlook.","I'm pleased that we're increasing our outlook while we continue to invest for future success. I know many of you are starting to look ahead the next year and so I'll briefly comment on 2020. Our teams have recently started planning for next year. And in terms of the external operating environment we'll be operating in, we're encouraged with commodity cost trends. On the other hand, currencies remain volatile in recent forward rates imply headwinds to the next year, especially in Latin America. We'll continue to closely watch global economic conditions which in general suggest slower growth going forward.","At this point, we're focused on building a robust plan for next year that's consistent with our balanced approach to value creation. One that includes higher growth investments in generally aligns with our K-C strategy 2022 financial objectives. As a reminder, those objectives are 1% to 3% growth in organic sales and mid-single digit growth in adjusted earnings per share. Certainly things could evolve in the next three months but in the broad terms that's how we're currently thinking about next year. We will provide our specific outlook in January.","In summary, I'm encouraged by the progress we're making in 2019, while we invest more to enable longer term success. We're confident in our ability to deliver balanced a sustainable growth and create shareholder value. That concludes our prepared remarks and now we'll be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]","Our first question is coming from Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo.","BonnieHerzog","Good morning. Hi. I have a question on pricing in the US. I guess I'd love to hear your outlook for pricing especially as you guys are starting to lap some of the price increases you've taken over the last year. So just like to hear from your perspective if you are concerned at all that we might see pricing stagnate or even rollback, again given we're not seeing as much commodity pressures we saw last year or do you think you've got some pricing power to put through another modest increase later this year possibly early next year? Thanks.","MikeHsu","Yes. Bonnie, overall, I think your question was regarding North America specifically. Overall, obviously we're on track for this year. Volumes better than our plan which we feel good about where we are. I think we should going forward is there may not be as much list pricing extra given where the commodity environment is. We're not really seeing downward promotional pressure at this point. So I think though the category remains relatively stable, robust and consumer demand remains healthy.","I think going forward whether or not there is list pricing being-- one of the things I mentioned in our K-C strategy 2022 is our kind of commercial capabilities as I'm calling them. One area which is revenue growth management and we're really emphasizing driving that revenue realization, whether that comes from list or it comes from trade efficiencies or price tax what I might say price pack changes .So those are areas I think we're going to continue to push globally to kind of drive revenue growth of whether or not there may be list pricing.","BonnieHerzog","Okay. So it's more revenue management and not a function of price mix. if I hear you correctly?","MikeHsu","Revenue mix, yes for sure.","BonnieHerzog","Yes, okay. And then if I may just ask a second one on, you're developing an emerging market growth. So it looks like it moderated a bit sequentially. So could you walk through the key drivers of this? And then separately most of the growth in you're developing in emerging markets, it still seems to be coming from pricing and really not from volume. So how much of this has been a response to FX headwinds and then do you expect volume growth to re-accelerate here, especially given your volume comps across the emerging markets should be relatively easy? Thanks.","MikeHsu","Yes. Bonnie, great question. We feel really great, very good about D&E growth. I think that demand remains robust. We are cycling our pricing that was pretty strong in the second half last year, particularly in Latin America. Just for reference, we're up 7% year-to-date in DNA, up five in a quarter and it's five consecutive quarter, quarters of mid to high single digit growth for us in DNA. So I think we feel very good about the progress we're making. We are seeing double-digit growth in multiple markets including Central and Eastern Europe. China now importantly on both diapers and femcare.","Our ASEAN business was up high single digits. And Latin America overall was up high single digits. And even excluding a market like Argentina which has a lot of list pricing but Brazil in the quarter was up mid-single digits with volume up as well. And so I think we internally we have a lot of emphasis on driving volume. Certainly, we have some benefits from pricing this year, but we feel good about the innovation that we're launching this year that's getting traction. We feel great of our about our investments in advertising particularly on the digital side, which we continue to increase our investment in. And so part of the plan is you may not expect to have this level of pricing every year, but we are looking at drive and earn our growth going forward.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Powers with the Deutsche Bank.","StevePowers","Thanks. Good morning. Hi. So to follow up on Bonnie's question ,the gross margin and commodification that you're seeing now is great as is the pricing resiliency. But as we look to next year especially with the market concerned about potential economic slowing as you had mentioned, Mike. Does this year's gross margin upside increase the odds at all of competitive activity in the year ahead? And how do you monitor that risk from where you sit?","MikeHsu","Yes. I think any prudent person would say that could happen. I would say largely I think we've said on previous calls, the commodity inflation that's occurred has been a multi-year effect. Multi-year impact and so we're only now recovering margins from where they were from a couple of years ago. So from our side I wouldn't expect us to be very aggressive on price points going forward. But certainly we'll want to be competitive. And then as we think about next year, I think we do believe commodities are stabilizing a bit and maybe we'll be less of a factor for next year. But we still expect to see some modest pricing carryover effects from this year into next year, at least in the beginning.","StevePowers","Okay. Great. And then as this quarter began, you welcomed Alison Lewis aboard as Chief Growth Officer. Can you talk a bit more about her role and her mandate and how perhaps her presence is expected to influence the planning process as you plot out 2020?","MikeHsu","Yes. We're really excited about Alison coming on board. We feel very fortunate to have her and she brings a wealth of experience from some great companies and has great background both innovation, marketing, digital spaces. And all the areas that we're trying to grow. She -- her title is Chief Growth Officer that encompasses our marketing and our commercial functions, which include kind of our global sales. We don't have -- it's not a global sales organization, but it's a kind of center of excellence that going to drive better sales capability, revenue growth management, and digital and in our innovation. So aside from that she's got that all the functions that you might attach to a CMO as well. So we feel great about it. She's bringing a lot of thinking that's I would say additive to kind of how we're thinking about things. And she's going to bring a lot of expertise and an insight. So great start, we're really excited about it.","Operator","Our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.","LaurenLieberman","Hi. Good morning. First thing I just wanted to follow up on was the mention of capacity constraints in North America. And do you just -- what business that's been in where that surprise has been? That's my first question.","MariaHenry","Yes. The North America system is running at very high capacity levels. And it is across the segments, Lauren, in the consumer business. The high capacity is or high utilization rates are one of the drivers that are affecting our FORCE cost savings in the quarter. Typically, you like to run it at very high capacity utilization, but it does limit your flexibility when volume comes in stronger than you anticipated. And so we're seeing some additional costs as the North America team looks to maintain high service levels, deliver on the volume that is coming in and that's one of the factors that's showing up with the lower FORCE cost savings in the quarter.","LaurenLieberman","Okay. Great. And then I want to also follow up on D&E market because at least the way that we've been tracking it, it looks like where there was maybe a little bit of away disappointment in the quarter by my reckoning anyway was in KCP in the D&E markets because consumer tissue and personal care continued to be pretty solid performance as we've seen for several quarters now. But KCP slowed pretty materially being flat. So can you just talk a little bit about what's going on in that business? If this is sort of intentionally stepping away from major maybe lower margin business or if it's macro volatility and because that was I think more of a factor in the quarter than I would have expected. Thanks.","MikeHsu","Yes. Thanks, Lauren. Overall, I think we feel very good about KCP. I think it was real strong performance in North America, solid quarter overall, but D&E was about flat on organic for the quarter. I think nothing really systemic there. In fact, actually our leader there has a real emphasis on expanding D&E going forward. We feel like we have a lot of good growth opportunity. We've got a couple major projects to kind of dress a couple key markets for us which include Brazil and China for us. So I think we're very bullish about the D&E overall for KCP, but just a little softness in the quarter but nothing systemic there. We were really pleased with our 5% growth in North America which I would tell you is a great result in a market where category actually -- category demand is actually softened from what we can tell in the categories.","So I think that the strategy of kind of elevating these categories with our premium products is working fairly well.","LaurenLieberman","Okay. Great. And then I wanted to also just talk a little bit about the longer term and reinvestment. Because you mentioned when you're talking about the sort of preliminary outlook or just conversation points around next year, you've got encouraged by commodities. Of course, the FX headwinds as we can all see higher growth investments which you've already spoken to and sort of articulating your vision and sort of long-term plan. And but I was curious if you talk about sort of maybe top three priorities for reinvestment? So degree of granular you can. Is it salesforce capabilities in the US? For example, but any kind of thought process around the top three priorities for investment and to what degree that's getting started like you said in the fourth quarter of this year and should start to see results as we go into 2020.","MikeHsu","Yes. Great question. Thanks for holding us accountable. I think the one, I'd say a couple things which is I think that things have changed a lot over the past for the course let's say 12 to 18 months. And I think we feel very good about reinvesting more in our businesses. A couple of key factors is certainly I think you mentioned in your note this morning which is the market environments much more conducive to investment, given kind of the competitive environment, I think it's giving an opportunity from marketing innovation to breathe. And so we're finding that investments we are making in marketing are more productive. Investments we're making innovation are more productive.","So that's probably the first big thing. And so certainly if you follow that line of logic then one key area for us is to invest more in digital, which is very high return for us. We're making a lot of progress there. And we're up in our capability. I'd say it's multiple markets and not only kind of our high kind of e-commerce markets, a more broadly overall across markets. ","Second, we are investing in capability. I talked a lot about with Bonnie about revenue growth management. A very important capability for us, helped us realize all this pricing this year. But if there's not as much list pricing going forward it becomes a little harder. And so we have to up the capability of the organization. We've been investing this year in training and development and tools to help our organization do that. And then the third key area is the product investments. And that's kind of the lifeblood of our business is that innovation we feel very positive about the innovation that we've been launching. The 5D core diaper in China is doing very, very well.","We just launched special delivery although it's just gaining distribution now. So it's too early to tell, but we're very excited about the prospects for that in our business. And so I think those are probably the three big areas. And then when I might add is I mentioned in my prepared remarks a couple hotspots in areas that we want to address to improve our share performance. I mentioned Peru in our prepared remarks. Snug & Dry, North America just as always you're going to have some businesses. They're going to need a little bit more work or investment and those are some targets for us.","LaurenLieberman","Okay. And is there just as you're looking forward, is there any reason-- you're talking in a fairly conservative way I would think around the commodity environment. And tailwind should be material as we go into next year at least on pulp. So does anything you can offer as to why that might not be the case?","MariaHenry","Yes. I think it's too early to give a confirmed outlook on 2020, Lauren, there. We look at the forward curves in addition to looking at the spot rates. We've seen some estimates that have commodities above where spot is today. But we'll have to wait and see. And we'll give you our perspective when we get to January.","MikeHsu","And, Lauren, if I would just build on that briefly. Some of the things that are not quite as visible in the marketplace, but where we're experiencing pretty good levels of the inflation this year includes local costs in Latin America just as businesses like ours are raising prices, our suppliers are also raising prices. And that's a factor in the results this year. Where that is next year we'll see, we'll give you our perspective in January. And then also distribution costs continue to run higher year-over-year this year both in Latin America and really globally around the world.","So where that ends up again will give you a better visibility in January but those are two factors that are certainly inflationary this year that you may not see fully.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jason English with Goldman Sachs. ","JasonEnglish","Hey, good morning, folks. Thank you for taking my question. I want to come back to is Lauren's question on the capacity tightness. And, Maria, your answer, you mentioned that it's both tissue and personal care. I love to understand more what's going on in tissue because your volume has been down 2% in 2017 in North America; 2% in 2018, tracking down 5% year-to-date. So in context to the sort of multiyear volume erosion what's led to capacity tightness in that network? And the second sort of derivative question is, is this really just a byproduct of your reorganization and how many plants that you've targeted right I think there's eight maybe that you've announced or identified. How many of those sit within the North America tissue network?","MariaHenry","Sure. They are very related, Jason, on the tissue side of the house as we've been executing changes to get pricing into the market that is one of the factors that is driving the utilization rates and the capacity within our tissue plant to execute against the volume demand. The Restructuring is also a major factor in what's happening in the supply chain in North America as we execute some facility shutdowns. We re standing up additional capacity in various places across the network. So if you think about everything that's moving in North America with the pricing changes that we're making, the restructuring activities that we have going on; the innovations that we have going into the market there, there's a lot going on right now in the North America Network and obviously executing the restructuring with excellence and expeditiously is a high priority for a business.","In terms of the plant closures, we've announced seven of approximately 10 that we intend to close. One of them is our Fullerton operation, which is a tissue manufacturing facility out in California for North America.","MikeHsu","Yes. And just to pile on, Jason. So as Maria said, we like, we prefer to run at high utilization. And it doesn't leave you a whole lot of wiggle room in your base date. and then when you're working through a restructuring, you are building inventory to kind of move the tissue asset or move production over. At the same time, when volume is a little bit better than your plan to kind of add to a triple witching event. And so we got a great team. I would say these are not systemic issues. But we're just putting a lot of challenges on them and we'll work through it. I would tell you that some of these cost issues, they're not going to be systemic. But they do reflect some of the operational difficulties that you might have.","JasonEnglish","That's helpful. One follow-on just to help me consider understand how the restructuring fits in with all this. You step back and it's been a little surprising for us to see you and not defending market share a bit more aggressively in tissue. But then you mentioned your tie-down capacity and you're actually working to shut down more capacity. Is there a concerted effort here to actually shrink your tissue business volumetrically to get to a more profitable base going forward?","MariaHenry","No. There isn't. What -- the net result will be that we continue to have strong capacity in the tissue business. The more productive assets are the assets that we will be continuing to run and some of the less productive assets are the ones that will be taking out of the system. But overall, we are not looking to reduce volume in our tissue business.","MikeHsu","Yes. Jason, our teams would be really upset with us if we told them to shrink share a little bit. So we recognize actually share this year is probably one of the areas we really want to improve on. That's one of the reasons why we want to reinvest. So we're a little light in some areas and we'll work on our way back there. And that's why we want to make some of the investments we are making.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan.","AndreaTeixeira","Hi. Good morning. How are you? So I wanted to go back to 2020 initial guide. So it seems to me and your stock obviously is getting impacted now when you say you gave the initial outlook of I think the long-term is 1% to 3% organic growth. And correct me if I'm wrong if that changed with you are changed now to the 4%. And the mid-single digit EPS seems to me a bit conservative given that you're going to be lapping all these challenges in commodities. And you inflected, as a matter of fact you inflected the commodities finally this quarter. So me -- I understand when you're coming from the price increase, but the price increase it was about like 100 bps or something in some of the areas.","So I was just wondering if you can kind of unpack that long-term and why giving us that outlook if you're still moving - still looking at the commodities. And how the commodities will play out for next year? So I just wanted to, if you can unpack both the top line and the bottom line. Thank you.","MikeHsu","Yes. Andrea, I think we came out in January with under K-C strategy 2022 kind of targets for us which we said organically was 1% to 3% and mid single digits on organic and then mid-single digits on the EPS line. And so we just put those out in January. We still think those are the right ones for us. We recognized that we had a little benefit with some commodity easing perhaps this year. But on a long-term basis, we still see the fundamentals of our business kind of tracking toward that. And so we are working towards that and that's how we're thinking about our plan.","Certainly next year we think commodities are less of a factor. But we still have some FX issues particularly in Latin America. And we'll be working through those. So that's how we think about 2020. I don't know, Maria, you want to add anything to that. ","MariaHenry","Yes, no. I think that's right and the midterm algorithms that we discussed with K-C 2022 on the top line is also informed by what we're expecting for the market growth rate and is reflective of that.","AndreaTeixeira","Sorry if we can go back to China, if I can squeeze that commentary on baby diapers and also the commentary on incontinence. like if you can talk to us like how that is inflecting and how you're seeing that thing out into 2020?","MikeHsu","Sorry, Andrea, about diapers and incontinence --","MariaHenry","In China.","AndreaTeixeira","Yes. In China, yes. ","MikeHsu","Yes. Overall, I'd say diapers, we're excited about our 5D diaper, and it's off to a very good start. Overall, I think in China right now shares overall flat. I'd say we're growing at a strong pace, double-digit rate and the value in the premium tiers and then down a bit in the value tiers which is aligned with our strategy. But we think one of the key things about China we're saying is I think the terms of competition of a game is shifting back to innovation, which I think is important and good in the market in which consumers want a better product. ","We feel like we have very good products and if not the best products that are in the market there. So we feel great about that. Adult incontinence for us is still a huge opportunity. It's a relatively small category in China, but I think ripe for development and we're increasing our focus there.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ali Dibadj with Bernstein. ","AliDibadj","Hey, guys. So I want to go back to a couple things. One is around the cost savings efforts and it's really rare to see you go to the lower end of any cost savings plan like you're doing FORCE even more broadly. And to Jason's question, I think it was around the implications of perhaps, I think you are getting to consumer tissue volumes down and still having capacity issues i.e. maybe you've gone too far at least my interpretation of the subtext there. How do you get comfortable that perhaps the cost savings and the shutting down the plants from the restructuring or anything else just isn't going too far and you might have kind of pushed a little bit.","I know it's a question we've asked all of us for many, many years but this is really the -- a really big sign here particularly given the tissue volumes are down. And in that area you're running it too high of a capacity.","MariaHenry","Yes. I think, overall, we think that the plans that we have and that we're executing on the restructuring are completely appropriate, Ali. I think that working through a restructuring of this size at the same time that there are a lot of other factors going on in the supply chain network is certainly not an easy task. So as we get through the execution period on the supply chain restructuring. It's not totally surprising that there are some challenges around flexibility. And that's what you're seeing here. In terms of the savings, I think the total savings are solid and when you look at the details of it, our teams are delivering on savings from product optimization, savings from productivity and waste improvements.","We talked about coming into the year that on the savings front, we would have lower negotiated price savings associated with our long-term contract. So that's been flowing through the numbers this year. The other thing I say is that the numbers outside of North America where we've been talking about some supply chain challenges are strong on FORCE. So good savings across the globe and the challenges that we're having in North America with the high utilization rates just mean that we're incurring more costs to meet stronger volumes than we anticipated, maintain the service levels and so that's what's really going on.","I think importantly, we still see lots of opportunity for productivity in our supply chain. And so we're working through a lot of things this year with a lot of moving pieces. We're focused on getting that restructuring executed and on the personal care side, we'll be adding some capacity into the network and that will catch things up on the North America side of the house. But overall the teams are doing a good job executing it. There continues to be strong opportunity in the supply chain. And I think when we have completed the restructuring program, we're going to be in a good place.","MikeHsu","Yes. And overall I think restructuring, Ali, I'd say we're moving out of higher-cost locations into more efficient locations that will deliver low, total deliver cost lower.","AliDibadj","Okay. So just a playback so I'm dead clear on this. You anticipated more than a negative for volume and consumer tissue in North America. So some more worse than that and that's why you have this capacity constraint. And as we go forward FORCE and cost savings we should be very surprised if there's a slowdown in that pace in 2020 or beyond. Is that the right playback?","MariaHenry","But I haven't given any numbers specifically for 2020 but what I will tell you is that there continues to be opportunity for additional productivity out of our global supply chain.","AliDibadj","Okay. Thank you. And then on pricing just two vectors on that. Would love your guidance historical perspective on what happens to pricing when commodities look like they're doing what they're doing now. Certainly my perspective from outside in view is it's not just a possibility but it's a likelihood that the pricing comes down, particularly in tissue perhaps a little bit less than diapers in North America. So love your perspective there and then secondly on pricing. The word that everybody is using and certainly used over the past several months is premiumization in the whole industry. But I always find your guide is sense of this is really useful in the lens for the whole industry which is how should we think about premiumization in a world between North America where the consumer may actually be slowing down again over the next few years. And does that raise risk profiles of a lot of Kimberly-Clark and other companies as such.","MikeHsu","Yes. I mean, Ali, I think you know, we're very focused on having the right value proposition. And so I do personally believe premiumization is the path that a company like ours needs to take globally. I think certainly holds in a core market like the US, but certainly D&E and many D&E markets are ready for that too. But we're going to keep our sharp eye on kind of having the right value proposition for the consumer. And so therefore for us premiumization means we're going to earn it by making the products perform better or do more for the consumer.","So that's the first part of it. I'd say with regard to the first part of your question and when the commodities ease, I'd say part maybe the first part is that this has been a multiyear issue. And so we're still well above kind of some of the commodity levels that we were a couple years ago. And so and still recovering the margins. That said in the past and I've been around long enough seven years now. long enough to see couple cycles of this. And we have seen a little bit more promoted activity when you get some long-term deflation.","I'd say we're prepared for that. I mean one of the areas in our revenue growth management initiative is we have invested in tools, the capability to let us pick kind of the more efficient events and trade optimization and promotion optimization is a key word for us inside the halls here. And so we'll work through that. But I think we're prepared in either scenario, but right now I think we're seeing pricing and promotion relatively stable in the marketplace right now.","AliDibadj","And you're not seeing any incremental questions being raised by retailers for the industry or across the board given perhaps their greater desire for margin in these categories?","MikeHsu","I would say no more than the typical.","AliDibadj","Okay. ","MariaHenry","Yes. I just add that while we're all pleased that pulp is deflationary in the quarter. The full year 2019 pulp cost outlook is still above 2017's level and frankly all other years since 2010 with the exception of 2018. So we are happy with the trend but it's still an elevated level.","Operator","Our next question comes from Olivia Tong with Bank of America. ","OliviaTong","Great. Thanks. I want to talk a lot about specifically about D&E about pricing. Because it sort of feels a little bit like you're knocking on the upper limit that the market can handle on pricing. So can you talk about the outlook there and your overall outlook for D&E going forward?","MikeHsu","Yes. I think primarily biggest factor in D&E this quarter was we're starting to cycle or laugh our pricing that we had in Latin America last year. I mean this time last year we launched increasing prices, high single, low double digits and brought that forward being in this year. I think we've rolled over our pricing in a market like Brazil right now. And so you're starting to see that. So I think last quarter in Brazil our organic was up teens, this quarter is up mid-single digits. Still a good number with volume up, but certainly cycling the pricing.","And I don't know that we will have cycled the upper limit. There are a lot of factors in play including the FX cost. The inflation internal in the market and the wage inflation that occurs like in a market like Argentina. So I don't think I'll judge on whether we're at a limit or not. But I do think we have cycled a lot of the pricing that we had planned this year. We don't have a lot more going forward for the balance of this year. Olivia?","OliviaTong","I am here. So appreciate the answer but just in terms of the offset maybe volume increasing. Is there innovation coming to market or there are other things? Is it -- usually in the second half you've got a little bit more of an innovation heavy period, so just kind of understanding what's coming down the pipe for D&E.","MikeHsu","Yes. I think we feel good about what's been in the marketplace and overall for the year, I'd say with the levels of pricing that we have, our volumes overall have been a bit stronger in a market like Brazil with volumes up with pricing last quarter of teens. I think that's a very good result. A lot of that was an artifact of a few things which is one great in market execution. We're expanding distribution on key brands; expanding our presence on key items. And so I think that's driving very good results. We're really growing and expanding the adult care category. The femcare category and the femcare category in Brazil into more geographies.","And I think we're up double digits in those categories. And so we're really excited about that progress. Similarly, like in CEE, I'd say it's a combination of innovation and market execution and marketing. This driving high teens organic growth including volume. China, similarly the innovations working in our 5D diaper. We saw return to growth last quarter. It's accelerated this quarter. So overall I think the teams are doing -- been doing a very good job in D&E and are driving the volume with disciplined market execution, innovation and good marketing.","OliviaTong","Got it. If I can turn to pulp, obviously, that market is now --the prices there are stabilizing a bit. So could you lock-in more than you typically would at this point in the year in terms of the price on pulp? And what kind of visibility do you have on the cost outlook for yourself in 2020?","MariaHenry","Yes. I would remind you that as part of pulp price management strategy, we look to negotiate contracts that are generally a year in term. And we look closely at how we do that and we look at a combination of mechanisms. We consider floors and ceilings. We consider fixed pricing and we balance out how much we look to basically have a hedge on the pricing going into the following year and how much we want to leave flexibility to take advantage of the spot market. So we're working through all of those things. I don't have any specific thing to share with you on how we're thinking about that next for 2020 but when we provide our outlook in January, it'll be reflective of how we land on that. But obviously, we have visibility to spot market and the forward rate curves.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Strycula with UBS.","SteveStrycula","Hi, good morning. So quick clarification question. Can you quantify what Argentina was as an impact for --to the global comp in the quarter? And then I have a follow up question for Maria. ","MikeHsu","Yes, Steve, it was about two points of our total developing and emerging markets growth, and D&E is about 30% of company\u2019s sales.","SteveStrycula","Okay, super helpful. And then Maria, just to kind of piggyback on that last question, if we just assume spot rates just hold where they are for like the next 18 months, so we don't assume it better or worse. Should we think about the fourth quarter being the maximum flow through from call like pulp deflation or should we actually expect that to build further next year as we think about some of these contracts being reset on an annual basis? And then I have one last question for Mike.","MariaHenry","Sure. In terms of this year's outlook, our outlook for 2019 is generally aligned with the spot market. And then for next year, as I mentioned earlier, it -- the forecasts are still moving it, Some forecasts have the outlook for next year above spot and there's a lot of factors that are still moving around. So I hate to keep going back to this. But we'll have more to say on that in January, as we continue to lock down our mechanisms for our pulp size into next year.","SteveStrycula","Okay. I appreciate that. And then, Mike, fundamentally a lots going right for you this year or for the broader team rather. And one of the few things you mentioned on the call where you would say there's an opportunity for improvement in 2020 is maybe selectively some pockets of market share. Would you kind of comment on your top priorities from like category comp, product or category country combination for next year? And what do you think is like the mechanism of delivery in the form of reinvestment that we need to see to kind of jumpstart the shared trends in this category, country combinations? Thank you. ","MikeHsu","Yes. Maybe, Steve, great question. I think maybe the caveat or precursor is, we're right in the middle of our plans for 2020 right now. So I actually haven't even seen kind of the detailed role of a 2020 for us yet. Although, I'd say if you look at our business, I\u2019ll start with North America. Overall, I think our shares a little soft than we like this year, although we are seeing sequential progress this quarter. I think the team is feeling very good about the progress they're making especially with the innovation and the marketing plans that they have. ","So to see an ongoing improvement in North America is a top priority. Certainly we -- usually, we don't get very far into the call before we start talking about China. It remains our biggest growth opportunity, both in the near term and the long term. We're really excited about I think that the progress that the team has made. So our investments in both the product especially in diapers, and then the marketing side, both in diapers and especially in femcare, digital marketing, I think is working really well for us and I think that's really important.","I think we've had great growth in Central and Eastern Europe both either double digit growth, whether it's in the 20s, or the high teens for a couple years now, and we feel great about that. So that's continues to be a high priority. ","Latin America, as we talked about, I think the Brazil team is doing a great job executing. We have a couple pockets in Latin America, which are important markets for us like Peru that I mentioned, that we're seeing a little increased competition. And so we're going to make sure that we have the right product offering in that market to be competitive and strengthen our position in that marketplace.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies.","KevinGrundy","Hey. Thanks. Good morning, Mike. Good morning, Maria. So just to kind of build on the last question. Mike, I'm not sure if you can say much more. But if the question relates to innovation pipeline and adequacy of investments, so when we spoke with you earlier this year and you took over leadership of the company, the comments were you weren't comfortable resetting earnings kind of for the sake of resetting earnings in the absence of having the right sort of innovation pipeline to spend behind.","But kind of building on this, we've had a lot of conversations around sort of a lack of satisfaction with your market share trends in the US. Where do you kind of stand now? I mean what is the satisfaction with current investment levels for the company broadly? And then kind of marrying that up with the higher growth investments, in your slides you kind of gave us a few data points qualitatively at least between FX and commodities. And then you did include their higher growth investments looking at the next year.","How should we be thinking about that? Is there potential for acceleration relative to what we've seen? And then I have a follow-up.","MikeHsu","Yes. I think we've been working on what I would say the commercial capability development of which innovation is a key area. The four pockets that I'll talk about. Innovation, digital, marketing overall but digital especially, revenue growth management and then selling capability or in-market execution. So those are our big four. I will tell you I feel very good about the progress we're making globally across the enterprise in these areas. One of the areas I do think we're making progress is on the innovation front. And I think we're starting to see our team's work much more effectively together across markets to leverage our enterprise scale on technology. And I think that's hitting the market or is going to affect what we're doing in the market.","Some of the 5D line that we saw in China was developed by other parts of the world. The Huggies Special delivery that we just launched in North America was jointly developed between Korea, China, Brazil and the US team. And so we're starting to see more of that activity. So suffice it to say we want bigger, more impactful innovation with our consumers. And you'll see more of that going forward. And then in terms of the investment, it's just to support that. Whether it's in the product cost or it's in the marketing of that product. And be more aggressive and how we market that.","I think those are areas that we're going to want to invest in. And then the last area and it coincides with our market execution capability pillars. We want to play a bigger hand in developing categories. And we're seeing more of that I think I mentioned in Brazil, we're seeing double, high double-digit growth in adult care and baby wipes. And that's because of a concerted effort by the team in Latin America to focus on geographies and categories and expand the development of those categories. And so you'll see more of that investment going forward as well.","KevinGrundy","Mike, it sounds like -- it feels like you believe the company can execute on that and still deliver on the company's long-term EPS algorithm. I didn't detect anything that suggests an outsized investment would be needed. Is that fair? ","MikeHsu","Yes. I think that's been our stance since I think our January meeting which is, that's why we set forth these medium-term targets that would one to three top and mid single digit bottom and at the same time we would create the funds and room necessary for us to drive some of the investment that we think we need to do to improve the share position of our brand for he long term and then also build the categories in kind of the big opportunities that we have in D&E for the long term.","KevinGrundy","Okay. That's helpful. One quick follow-up. The net revenue management which you've spoken a lot about, that's a big number. I understand it approaches the company's cost of goods sold in terms of absolute dollars. Is that something you will ever put a number on for investors in terms of the opportunity in over what period of time you think it can be realized?","MikeHsu","Well, I was about to say something but Maria shaking her head. So --[Multiple Speakers] I'm just kidding. We're not ready to put a number on that it probably, they're probably not yet-- not at this point. ","End of Q&A","Operator","Our next question comes from Caroline Levy with Macquarie. At this time, we have no other questions in the queue. ","Paul Alexander","All right. So, Caroline, if you're not there, we appreciate everyone's questions today. And we'll wrap up with a quick comment from, Mike. ","Mike Hsu","Okay. Well, we're very pleased with our results this year. We have a strong quarter and we feel very good about the performance thus far this year. And we're very optimistic about our growth prospects for the future, both in the near term and the long term. And our plan is to deliver balanced and sustainable value creation. So thank you guys very much.","Paul Alexander","Thank you very much.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes this morning's presentation. You may disconnect your phone lines.

We now have your speakers in conference. [Operator Instructions]. It is now my pleasure to introduce Mr. Paul Alexander.","Paul Alexander","Thank you, and good morning, everyone, welcome to Kimberly-Clark's Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. With us today are Tom Falk, Chairman and CEO; Mike Hsu, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Maria Henry, our CFO. Here's the agenda for our call. Maria will start with a review of third quarter results. Tom will then provide his perspectives on our results and the outlook for the full year. And we'll finish with Q&A. As usual, we have a presentation of today's materials in the Investors section of our website. ","As a reminder, we will be making forward-looking statements today. Please see the Risk Factors section of our latest annual report on Form 10-K for further information. And lastly, we'll be comparing our 2017 results to 2016 adjusted results, which exclude certain items described in this morning's news release. And now I'll turn it over to Maria.","Maria Henry","Thanks, Paul. Good morning, everyone, thanks for joining the call today. Let me start with the headlines for the third quarter. We continue to deliver earnings growth and returned to positive sales growth territory in a challenging environment. We achieved excellent cost savings and reduced our discretionary spending and we returned significant cash to shareholders. Now let's look at the details, starting with sales. Our third quarter net sales were $4.6 billion, up 1% year-on-year. Organic sales rose slightly, and Tom will provide more color on our top line in just a few minutes. On profitability, third quarter gross margin was 35.8%, that's down 60 basis points as input cost inflation and lower pricing more than offset our strong cost savings.","Commodities were $115 million drag in the quarter, and we now expect full year inflation will be slightly above our previous estimate of $200 million to $300 million. This outlook includes somewhat higher cost estimates for pulp and polymer resin. Helping to offset that inflation, our teams continue to deliver significant FORCE cost savings, with third quarter savings of $125 million. ","Moving down the P&L. Between-the-lines spending was down 60 basis points year-on-year. As we mentioned on our earnings call in July, we're tightly managing overhead and discretionary spending in this environment. Our third quarter operating margin was 18.4%, up 20 basis points year-on-year. I'm encouraged with the margin improvements we achieved in our Personal Care and K-C Professional business segments and in the developing and emerging markets overall.","On the bottom line, third quarter earnings per share was $1.60, up 5% year-on-year. Lower equity income reduced earnings by about $0.03 per share, offset by a slightly better effective tax rate worth about the same amount. ","Now let's turn to cash flow. Cash provided by operations in the third quarter was $805 million and in line with our expectations. Cash flow in the year-ago quarter was $948 million and included very strong working capital improvements. Our third quarter 2017 working capital cash conversion cycle was down 6 days compared to full year 2016. I'm pleased that our teams continue to make good progress in this important area. We're also managing capital spending even more tightly in this environment, and we expect that full year spending will be slightly below our $850 million to $950 million target range. On capital allocation, third quarter dividend payment and share repurchases totaled more than $500 million. We expect that the full year dividends and share repurchases will total $2.3 billion. That number includes $900 million of expected share repurchases. ","Looking at the segment results. In Personal Care, organic sales fell approximately 2%. Organic sales were up 3% in developing and emerging markets but down elsewhere. Personal Care operating margins were 20.8% and up 100 basis points. The improvement was driven by cost savings and reduced between-the-lines spending. In consumer tissue, organic sales were up 2%, driven by North America. Consumer tissue operating margins were solid at 17.1%, although down 100 basis points. The results were impacted by higher input costs, mostly in pulp. ","In K-C Professional, organic sales in the quarter were up 2%, with gains in all major geographies. K-C Professional operating margins were strong at 20.9%, up 130 basis points. That comparison included benefits from both sales growth and cost savings. ","In summary, we continue to grow earnings in a difficult environment, we are tightly managing costs, working capital and capital spending and we continue to allocate capital in shareholder-friendly ways. ","I'll now pass the call over to Tom.","Thomas Falk","Thanks, Maria, and good morning, everyone. I'll give you some more detail on our top line sales and market conditions, and then I'll address our outlook for the balance of the year. Looking at the third quarter, our organic sales were up slightly year-on-year after being down about 1% in the first half of the year. Volumes in the third quarter increased more than 1%, while net selling prices fell about 1%. But overall, it's challenging to find growth right now in several of our large markets. ","So looking at some of those key markets. In North America, conditions remain relatively difficult, including elevated competitive activity. In the consumer categories that we compete in, the total market did grow by about 1% in the third quarter, and that's 1 point better than that same category grew in the first half of the year. In our consumer businesses in North America, organic sales were similar year-on-year after being down 3% in the first half of the year. Volumes rose 1%, led by our consumer tissue and adult care brands. On the other hand, net selling prices fell 1% as a result of competitive activity and some of the fine-tuning of our promotion strategies that we mentioned on our earnings call in July. ","Looking at our individual businesses in North America. Personal care volumes were off 1%. In the infant and child care mega category, our volumes were down mid-single digits in a continued challenging environment. Now we expect better performance in the fourth quarter as comparisons ease and we have more promotion and other brand activities planned. Volumes increased high single-digits in adult care in the third quarter. Our Poise and Depend brands benefited from category growth, from increased marketing and promotion support and from some of the innovations that we've launched in -- behind these 2 brands over the last 12 months.","Consumer tissue volumes in North America increased by 5% and rebounded nicely following a difficult first half of the year. We benefited from a stronger promotional calendar, from good merchandising execution and our comparison to a soft performance in the year-ago period. ","Turning now to our K-C Professional business in North America. Organic sales rose 2% in the quarter. That was driven by volume growth of 3%. Volumes were up in all major product categories as our team is executing its growth strategies well in a relatively sluggish market. Switching to developed markets outside of North America. Organic sales were down 3% in the third quarter. All of that decline was driven by South Korea, including in diapers, where category conditions are challenging as a result of a significant decline in the birthrate in that country. ","Moving to developing and emerging markets. Organic sales were up 3% in the third quarter, including volume growth of 4%. Looking at some of our key markets there. In Brazil, organic sales in personal care were similar year-on-year. Our volumes continue to grow with benefits from innovation across the portfolio. Selling prices came down, though, as we adjusted to the stronger Brazilian real and competitive activity. ","In China, organic sales in personal care were up mid-single digits with strong double-digit growth in feminine care. Our Kotex brand in China is benefiting from product innovation and our focus on the premium end of the market. Organic sales in diapers in China were similar year-on-year. Product mix improved while volumes and selling prices were down as comparisons were impacted by very strong growth last year and competitive activity this year. Diaper pricing continues to be less negative this year than it was last year. And going forward, we will continue to focus on driving winning product solutions on Huggies in China.","In Argentina, organic sales in personal care were up strong double digits, driven by higher selling prices. Huggies diapers' volumes continue to grow somewhat even though the category demand in Argentina is still down. And then lastly, in Eastern Europe, organic sales in personal care increased high single digits. Our volume momentum continues in this part of the world as we achieved another double-digit increase this quarter on both Huggies and Kotex. Selling prices declined in Russia and Eastern Europe, mostly reflecting price rollbacks following the strengthening of the Russian ruble. ","I'd also like to mention at the end of the third quarter, we purchased the remaining 50% of our joint venture in India. Although the categories in India are small today, we're optimistic about the long-term growth potential in this country. And then finally, I'll briefly build on Maria's financial review to say that I'm encouraged with our team's accomplishments on our FORCE cost-savings program, the way we've managed our overhead spending in this year, especially in the third quarter, and then our working capital and capital allocation.","Now I'll turn and cover our outlook for the balance of 2017. As we mentioned in this morning's news release, we're confirming our previous full year 2017 targets. We continue to expect that sales will be similar or up slightly year-on-year. Given results through 9 months, it's more likely that organic sales will be similar for the full year. ","On the bottom line, we continue to expect that earnings per share will be at the low end of the $6.20 to $6.35 range. As Maria noted, our commodity inflation estimate has increased somewhat from 3 months ago. On the other hand, we've reduced our discretionary spending plans for the year. In addition, our outlook for currency rates and the effective tax rate has improved slightly. ","So in summary, we're focused on competing effectively in the near term, we're executing our Global Business Plan strategies for long-term success and we're optimistic about our opportunities to deliver attractive returns to shareholders.","That wraps up our prepared remarks, and now we'll begin to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Ali Dibadj with Bernstein.","Ali Dibadj","I have a few questions. One is if you can talk about kind of the recent top line organic results you delivered in the context of the longer-term 3% to 5% organic range, and what you see is the gaps, whether it be particular geographies or particular business units that you need to close and, I guess, your comfort with that. That's the first question.","Thomas Falk","Yes, sure. I think a couple of comments, first on overall category growth. When you've got the birthrate going negative in big markets like the U.S. and major negative in South Korea, we'd guess the birthrate's down 7% to 9% year-to-date in Korea, which we have a hard time explaining to be honest, and don't think that's sustainable. On the other hand, it is what it is and those babies aren't born this year and they won't be in the category next year or the year after that. So category weakness is certainly there in a couple of big markets. And then we had negative 1 price, which is pretty similar in the first half and the third quarter as you had pricing that went in as a result of currency in some places like Russia and Brazil last year that's coming out as those currencies have turned around and a generally more competitive price environment, even in markets like the U.S., as the same number of competitors are chasing lower growth or lower category. So we still think the 3% to 5% is the right long-term growth opportunity. We've got good growth as emerging markets develop. But I'd say, certainly this year, that has been tough to go find.","Ali Dibadj","And just on that, I mean if you think about all those drivers, are they going to get better in 2018 at this point? Or do you just have no visibility into that? Because it certainly doesn't -- it feels like it's a pretty far reach to get anywhere near the 3%, the 3% to 5% range, even next year.","Thomas Falk","Yes, we'll give you '18 guidance in January, but I'd say your instinct is right, that it -- we don't -- we're not planning for it to snap back. We would expect -- I mean again, the babies that aren't born this year aren't going to be in the diaper category next year either. So and I think, as we understand, much of it is a millennial thing, where they're having kids a little later. Is there -- what else is going on in Korea that might be affecting it? What's the path forward as to how those recover? Those are all things that we'll be looking at. But again, I would expect it's going to be another challenging year from a growth standpoint in 2018. At least that's what we're planning for at this stage.","Ali Dibadj","And then just if I may, just the last question. Given what we're seeing on private-label trends, what's your stance on manufacturing private label for other retailers than Costco? For example, Amazon.","Thomas Falk","Yes, we do, do private label for a number of retailers and across several categories and have for a long, long time. We don't usually talk about it very much, and it is a very small part of our business. It's less than 5% of our overall sales.","Ali Dibadj","And nothing in particular about the e-commerce channel in regards to private label?","Thomas Falk","No. I mean, we -- well, I mean, I think there isn't much private label in e-commerce today. And so we really are focusing on building our branded business and e-comm across our categories and in many key markets around the world, China and Korea, especially, where it's exploded. And it is where a lot of the category is taking place.","Operator","Our next question comes from Wendy Nicholson with Citi Research.","Wendy Nicholson","Can you comment on your decision to focus on cutting your spending as aggressively as you have been? I mean, on the one hand, it's great that you've insulated your profit margins in a difficult environment. I assume there's some negative operating leverage and obviously costs are going up. But when you talk about sort of your cutting your discretionary spending, how much more fat is there to cut? And I guess, could you address the thought that, hey, if you cut less and maybe spent more, do you think that would have a positive impact on your organic top line growth? If you could talk about your -- sort of your philosophy, given just how challenging so many markets are right now.","Thomas Falk","Let me give you a couple of headlines and let Maria give you a little bit more detail. I mean, first of all, I mean, there has been some shift out of advertising and digital couponing that you guys don't see because the digital coupon value is a reduction of gross sales to get the net sales and it kind of shows up in our price calculation as we give you the analysis of change in sales. So part of that negative 1 point of price is more digital coupons, and we spent a little bit less advertising. The other -- if you've got low birthrates in markets like the U.S. and Korea, more advertising isn't necessarily going to help you stimulate category demand. I mean, it could be a share play that you really felt like you could influence it. But in this kind of environment, we also said being sharp and competitive on price is even more important, so we've probably invested a little bit more there. And then the cost cutting between the lines is, I think, kind of a normal belt-tightening you do in a tough year, but I'll let Maria give you a little bit more detail on how we've thought about that.","Maria Henry","Yes, I just follow on Tom's comments that on the growth-oriented investments that we make, we pay a lot of attention to what the ROI is on those investments. And we continually monitor that to see, are we getting what we're expecting? And then we shift our investment dollars to the highest and best use, where the strongest ROI is, given the competitive environment and the category dynamics. On the overhead spending, that is an area where you always have room on discretionary expenditures. And when the top line is where it is and as we face inflationary pressures, it just makes sense to tighten our belt on discretionary items. And while we hope that all of our spending contributes value, there's a rank order of higher-value activities and lower-value activities. And we just pull back and eliminate the areas that, again, have a lower return to the overall profitability and success of the company. And so it's regular belt-tightening below the line and a really hard look at ROIs on the growth-oriented investments.","Wendy Nicholson","Got it. Okay. And then my second question, if I can, is just on China. Because we heard a lot from Procter on Friday about their initiatives in the diaper category, how much they're investing there. Can you just remind us where exactly you are positioned, your portfolio? Are you in the superpremium end? How big is your share maybe in the pants area? I'm trying to assess how much of a threat their renewed focus in that market is on your business specifically.","Michael Hsu","Yes, Wendy, it's Mike. Yes, we're probably balanced, but we're probably -- the growing part of our business has been the premium business, but we're generally balanced overall. We have a good position in Tier 3, but also Tier 4 and 5. And the growth has been more out of the premium side of our business, and that's where we're driving more of our business. Our performance overall in China this quarter, I think as Tom mentioned, the organic was even versus -- or similar to versus year-ago. But we're very confident in our business there long term. It's obviously the world's largest diaper market. We've got a great team with great technology and we like our position there.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jason English with Goldman Sachs.","Jason English","Clearly, this is shaping up to be a pretty tough year for you guys, as I think you've conceded, Tom. What I'm trying to do is wrap my head around, parse out, what may be sort of transitory pressure and what may have some more enduring headwinds. I mean, birthrates in the U.S. look like, at some point, they should come back. Input costs obviously ebbs and flows, and right now, it's flowing against you. But what stands out in results is really the combination of pricing and cost. I think I've got to take my model back to 2004 to find an environment or a year where you were poised to deliver negative price with cost inflation.","And Ali asked the question on private label. We see in the data, it's got momentum and you're flagging competitive intensity just around so many markets, driving some negative price. So my core question is that. Is that here to stay? And if not, why not? Why should we believe that pricing pressure won't be more enduring? And if it is, what are the implications for the margin profile of your business overall?","Thomas Falk","So good, deep philosophical questions there. I'd say one thing. As you look at the Nielsen data, the private label is probably somewhat overstated because it doesn't include growing parts of the category, particularly e-commerce where there's really, really very little private label at this point, particularly in the U.S. And we saw a little bit of spike in the quarter in private label in a couple of places, in particular, markets that were probably hurricane relief-related. So if you're going to donate diapers, you may go buy private-label diapers to do it. But we'll see how that resolves as the quarter rolls forward. But at a larger view of your question, we would say that, yes, you've got to have both winning products and you've got to be price-competitive going forward. And so I don't think that's going to change.","And so we know that the prices are probably -- you're not going to get an annual price increase every year, although we haven't operated that way for a long, long time, but we are expecting lots of good local competition as well as global competition that's going to make a price competitive market. So I don't know, Mike, if there's anything you want to add to that.","Michael Hsu","No, no, I think it is an interesting observation you make, Jason, though, that with the cost inflation, seeing the pricing pressure in some of the markets isn't what you normally see. And so again, I think we're preparing ourselves to operate effectively in that environment and be able to grow profitably in that kind of a marketplace. But obviously, that's not our preference.","Thomas Falk","Some of the pulp price increase, really quite honestly, if you look at supply\/demand model, you wouldn't have predicted it would be as high as it is. So our -- another RISI forecast stated that it's going to be higher in '18. And yet you again say it's hard to believe that under the supply and demand fundamentals, it's going to be there. It's harder to price off that if you're not sure that the commodity increase is real and enduring.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kevin Grundy from Jefferies.","Kevin Grundy","First question for Tom and Mike. I wanted to come back to personal care, which came in a little bit shorter than expectations, I think, broadly in the quarter, and just understand what the surprises were to the downside. Because, Tom, I think you talked about birthrates in North America and South Korea, which were already sort of understood going into the quarter, year-over-year comparisons also understood. So was it just the competitive environment that was worse than expectations that drove some of the downside? And if so, why does that necessarily get better in Q4 or even into next year? I'd just like to try to better understand that. And then I have a follow-up.","Michael Hsu","Yes. I think, Kevin -- I think it largely -- probably competitive environment. Obviously, that I think the birthrate, particularly in the U.S. and South Korea, has been known for a while, probably larger than what we where we were expecting previously. But I think the competitive environments continues to be active out there, particularly in North America. I think what you are going to see is that we are expecting to see our performance improve, particularly in the U.S. and North America, as we finish out the year from a promotional perspective. We've fine-tuned our promotion plans. I think we are seeing some of that reflection at the shelf now, and we're expecting better performance there.","Kevin Grundy","Okay. Maria, question for you, if I may, on input cost inflation, which is becoming more topical broadly across the group and I would say certainly for Kimberly-Clark. Can you -- so the first is kind of a housekeeping. Can you just confirm that pulp purchases for the company are probably about 25% of cost of goods sold? And then related to that, just given the worries around top line, what's your expectation for pulp inflation, raw material inflation over the next 12 months, just given the potential worry here around margins and the company's ability to offset this with FORCE savings and pricing would certainly seem less applicable in the current environment given the competitive activity? So commentary there would be helpful.","Maria Henry","Sure. In terms of our commodity purchases, what we say is that, generally, commodities- and energy-related spend is just under 50% of our cost of goods sold. And then within that, our largest single commodity buy is pulp, which is about 1\/3 of that number. That will get you to about our pulp spend for the company. In terms of the inflationary pressures that we see, as I think Tom commented, it is stronger inflation than we were expecting. When you look at the fundamentals of demand and where we are in the cycle, we wouldn't expect it to be as high as it is. There is some supply constraints that seem to be in play here, so we'll have to work through that.","The higher inflation is one of the drivers of getting even more aggressive on the overhead cost that we've been talking about in the third quarter. We're fortunate to have very strong performance on our FORCE cost savings delivering $125 million of savings against $115 million of inflation that we saw in the quarter. The teams have done a great job on the FORCE cost savings. We're now at about 4.1% of our cost of goods sold in savings delivery. And that has been up year-on-year for the last couple of years. And the teams continue to expand the lens that they look at to continue to drive productivity in our supply chain. In terms of the exact numbers and expectations on where we think the commodities are going, I'm going to ask Paul to kind of run you through.","Paul Alexander","Yes, I mean, I think that for the next 12 months -- or for 2018 specifically, as Tom said, we'll give you our planning assumptions in detail when we get to January. As he also referenced, if you looked at market forecasts right now, they would suggest inflation again next year.","Maria Henry","And at some point -- if you think about commodity inflation in a band, at some point, if it gets high enough, we expect that we will be able to get some pricing against it. It's just when you've got -- when you are where we are in terms of the inflation and the volatility around it, it's a little tougher to price. But if you look historically, after some inflection point on inflation, we're usually able to get some price in the market.","Kevin Grundy","Thanks for that. Just to drill down without asking you guys to put numbers on it. For Maria and Paul, is it fair to say at this point, based on what you know and where spot prices are, that you feel comfortable that the FORCE savings can cover your input cost inflation over the next 12 months?","Maria Henry","Well again, I don't want to give a specific number on the outlook. I think our FORCE cost savings, we're in good shape to deliver the guidance that we gave for this year when you look at where we are in a year-to-date basis. I think broadly, we continue to believe we've got room to go on that program as we looked forward. So when we come back in January, we will give you our perspective on what we think on the cost savings versus the inflation estimate.","Operator","Our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.","Lauren Lieberman","So a couple of questions. First thing was just on China. I think you guys said that -- or that volume in China diapers was down this quarter. Would you just -- it could may be my mistake, but it's not something I recall hearing before. I think the pattern has sort of been strong volume with negative pricing, and then that you said pricing was better. But can you just talk a little bit, the dynamics on China volumes turning negative in the diaper business and sort of the outlook forward? My first question,","Michael Hsu","Yes, Lauren, volume was down in China, particularly in diapers. I think mix was favorable. And the pricing environment has probably stabilized versus Q2 and pretty much on kind of what our annual assumption of it at the beginning of the year. I think what's going on is probably, the volume, has been a little bit more competition chasing the world's largest market. And what's probably been different about maybe the recent quarters is a little more pickup from local Chinese players. We probably lost a little volume in our Tier 3 business, or our mid-tier business, versus our premium business. So I would say we recognize our -- competitive launch by P&G is out there, that probably hasn't affected our business as much at this point, but it's been more some local players picking up trial.","Thomas Falk","Still, looking at the part of it -- so our toughest comp of the year in China volume was against third quarter last year. So it's up against a pretty strong growth number. And so overall, yes, we're making progress there. It's a challenging competitive set, but we're pretty happy with what we've got going on. And our femcare business in China has taken off, and that grew strong double digits and kind of picked up the slack a little bit this quarter.","Lauren Lieberman","Okay. It sounds like that was also maybe the case in Brazil, a couple of markets. It seems like femcare has been an accelerating path in many markets. So I know diapers is just a much bigger category, but can you kind of talk about, as you look forward and think about growth opportunities in D and E markets, the role you expect femcare to play, and the degree to which that can balance, also perhaps, continually more competitive diaper environment?","Michael Hsu","Yes, Lauren, I think we're excited about our femcare business. Globally, I think it presents a very significant opportunity for us to both expand consumption and\/or distribution. In Brazil, specifically, femcare was up strong double digits. Overall organic sales in Brazil were even. Year-on-year, kind of a different story though. Volume's up pretty strongly, femcare up double digits, as I said. And diapers was up mid-single digits. But a little bit offset by a decline in net selling prices. I do think the economic conditions in Brazil are -- we're seeing some green shoots. Maybe a touch, a tick up in consumer confidence hasn't really translated to overall category demand yet. But I do think the team is executing much better in Brazil. We've got the right price pack architecture in place, improvements are in our product offering. And I think we're poised to grow when the market continues [indiscernible].","Lauren Lieberman","Okay. I just had one final question, and that was around the U.S. and promotional and competitive environment. So oftentimes, I hear manufacturers talk about that retailers are actually funding the stepped- up promotional environment, particularly in categories where they're traffic builders, there's a higher basket, so diapers being prime on that list. Can you talk about the degree to which you're seeing that? Or is it that retailers maybe have not been using Kimberly-Clark products in their promotional strategies, so it's required you to do something differently to kind of get back in that rotation?.","Michael Hsu","Yes, I think perhaps maybe, Lauren, I would say those statements are partially true. Which is, hey, these are high-traffic-building categories and so retailers invest a lot behind them. But I think it's also true that we're seeing though, that we believe a lot of it is competitive spending. And I think you can see it maybe in some of the other numbers that are out there. And so I think it's a little bit of both. As I said maybe in July, we weren't happy with our first half performance in the U.S. We did have to fine-tune our promotional personal approach. I think the team has made steps, particularly in family care, which as Tom mentioned, was up over 3% organically and volume was up about 5%. So I think they've made very good progress on that, improving their in-store execution. And we're doing the same in our personal care businesses. And we're expecting to see better progress.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan.","Andrea Teixeira","So going back to the Chinese diaper market, and I apologize for going back and forth here. When would you expect the destocking to be finished and pricing to improve in your view? You alluded to weak pricing being where you expect it to be, but could you be more specific on what is embedded in your guidance besides of the easier comparisons as you go into the balance of the year? And you -- are you planning any reaction to the increased competition in pants? I know it's relatively smaller to the tape category, but nevertheless, it's one of the premium categories that you want to be in. And also, can you elaborate more on the reduction on the CapEx? What will you be investing less than you originally planned? And is this reduction just a shift to next year? So if you can also elaborate on those.","Thomas Falk","Yes, sure. Maybe I'll take a couple of those and then give Mike the bulk of the China question. So I guess first of all, we didn't really call out destocking as an issue in our volume change. So I mean, a good chunk of our business in China is e-commerce and there's not a lot of inventory shift through that channel. And then second, on CapEx, I don't know, Maria, if you want to comment on CapEx before Mike gives you a little deeper answer on...","Maria Henry","Sure. Yes, on CapEx, it's -- we expect that it'll come in below our original guidance for the year. And the largest driver of that is with the lower sales for the year, we obviously aren't spending as much CapEx on growth capital. And as I talked about tightening up on discretionary spend and I talked about ROI focus on growth investments, we have that same discipline on our capital spending. And so not all projects are created equal. And we continue to invest in the high-return CapEx projects, particularly the ones that are helping deliver some of the FORCE cost savings that we've been recording. But overall, in the lower-growth environment, that reduces our CapEx spend along with a lot of discipline around the ROI and prioritizing where we are investing our CapEx.","Thomas Falk","And then on China, Mike can give you a little more detail on what's going on in pants, we've been there for a long time in multiple tiers, we're doing diaper-pants in lots of places. But maybe just give her a little more color in that.","Michael Hsu","Yes, Andrea. So to your question on pricing, I think the pricing environment is largely consistent with what we assumed at the beginning of the year. So pricing is less negative in 2017, but still down slightly versus 2016. The promotion environment remains pretty competitive and we're kind of assuming kind of it's going to stay at this level for a while. And pricing in Q3 was comparable to where it was in Q4. Our teams have made a lot of progress, notably on the cost front. And so while the pricing has come down over the last couple of years, our gross margins are performing very well. And so the team's doing a very good job there. I think the issue in the quarter for us on volume was more competitive issue around maybe some local competitors, primarily in Tier 3, picking up some volume and some trial at the mid tiers.","Thomas Falk","Did we cover all your questions, Andrea, through that?","Andrea Teixeira","Yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo.","Bonnie Herzog","I guess I wanted to circle back to the U.S. We really seem to be seeing a bit of a disconnect between broad macro indicators and then category growth rate in the U.S. So could you guys speak to the strength of the U.S. consumer? And then maybe give us a sense as to what you think might be driving soft U.S. consumption at a time when, really, the consumer environment should at least in theory be doing a little bit better than what a lot of the staples category performance suggests.","Thomas Falk","Yes. I mean, I'll let Mike unpack this a little bit more. It is a mixed bag where you're seeing decent category trends in tissue and adult care and things like that, and diapers is more of a birthrate phenomena. But Mike, maybe you want to go a little deeper on that.","Michael Hsu","Yes, maybe there are a couple of things. And as it pertains to our categories, across all of our categories, the average -- the category volume is down 1%. So I think down slightly. Bath tissue, the consumer tissue side, I'd say largely on track with where it's been. I think the decline has been in the diaper business, which, as Tom mentioned earlier, driven, we believe, by a reduction in births, right? The birthrate was down in the first quarter of 2017, down about 3%. So I do think the consumer -- if you read all the things we read, continues to be under stress. But there has been a different phenomenon in maybe the diaper business, which is a large business for us, which has probably driven down some of our consumption.","Bonnie Herzog","Okay. And then I -- my last question, I guess, is on your innovation pipeline, just in thinking about it relative to your top line weakness year-to-date. Just trying to get a sense of, if some of this pressure could also be due to some of your innovation possibly not resonating as well as expected? And then could you guys give us a sense for how full your pipeline is and will there be more in the market next year?","Michael Hsu","Yes. I think certainly, we're always looking to do better on innovation. We do have some strong innovation this year, notably in the U.S. I think in the recent quarters, been improvements in adult and femcare with Depend mainline absorbency improvement. And in China, an improvement in our Tier 5 diaper performance. So I think we've got some pretty good in the market this year. We're looking to probably improve it even further next year. And we're excited about some of those launches. But I think we're going to come back and talk more about those in January.","Operator","Our next question comes from Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets.","Sunil Modi","I guess the question, we've been hearing a theme emerging over the past few quarters, at least on all the conference calls, about the local players you mentioned in some of your remarks about China and some things you're seeing in Tier 3 cities. But if you kind of, like, think about the entire world, in Latin America and what these local players are doing, what is different, number one? And why are they gaining share? And number two is how do you address it? I mean, are there organizational design changes you might need to make in order to better address the local consumer?","Thomas Falk","Yes, maybe just I'll start and then let Mike build on it. I mean, I would say in China, it's the -- when we talk about Tier 3s, it's not Tier 3 cities, it's Tier 3 in the category, kind of the middle of the category, the mid-priced performance. Not the low end, but the kind of the middle. A lot of it is coming in through e-commerce, which essentially makes it a little bit easier to get on the unlimited shelf. And if you get trial, you can pick up a share point. And so you do see more entrepreneurial local players that sell a decent-enough-performing diaper and do it through e-comm, where they can get some attention and some trial. And it's probably too early to see what the repeat is. I'd say in other markets, we probably haven't seen as much of that phenomena. You've got some local players like CMPC in Latin America that are emerging in a lot of places. But I would say China has been the one where you've seen more of a resurgence of smaller local players. And that's mostly happened this year, I would say.","Michael Hsu","Yes, Nik. And I don't think I have any blinding insight in terms of what you do about it. But I would say it comes back to the basics at how we run our business, which is better innovation. And I think we're customizing and tailoring our innovation to make sure that we're performing and competing effectively against all competitors on all tiers. And so I think we have some ideas that we're going to do -- working on to strengthen our performance of our products. And then also investing more behind our brands. And we think Huggies is positioned very well in all markets, particularly in China. And we like our positioning there and we'll invest more behind the Huggies brand to build that business, is what we're going to do.","Thomas Falk","Yes, maybe the only thing organizationally is we are organized, where we're the local market leaders, own the response to any local competition. So the team running the China business, they're accountable for developing the strategies to deal with whatever kind of competition is in front of them. There's a global organization around to help them. But they're there on the front line every day and deciding what to do, what to launch, how to promote or what channels to go after it.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ali Dibadj with Bernstein.","Ali Dibadj","Welcome back, sorry.","Thomas Falk","It's okay. We're here all day.","Ali Dibadj","So am I. So two questions. One is, look, FORCE, for many of us, certainly me, continues to be a little bit of an abstract concept, right? So it's broad based, you're hearing lots of things. Can you maybe just give us...","Thomas Falk","It's real cash, Ali. It's spending money.","Ali Dibadj","No, no, but I'm just trying to figure out, can you just give us 2 or 3 specific examples that make up FORCE? I mean, is it a big project? Is it -- just if you could give us just something concrete that turns into the concrete dollars this year or something. Just maybe just to help guys think -- to think about it.","Thomas Falk","Absolutely.","Maria Henry","Sure. The FORCE cost savings are coming from a number of areas, and I'll kind of tick through them and then go deeper if you want to, Ali. On -- the first one is the savings that we're able to get from negotiating lower material prices with suppliers. The second one is we look to improve our productivity and waste across the system, particularly in our manufacturing operations. And there, it's things like driving OEE, eliminating waste through the whole process, going deep on lean manufacturing methodologies, things like that. The third area is overall driving down the spending across our manufacturing facilities. So that's in addition to the productivity of the equipment and the machines, it's just driving out any unnecessary spend in the facilities. ","And finally, the fourth big area is around optimizing the cost of our product, specifications of our products. So our engineering teams are continually looking for ways to lower the cost of the product while maintaining or improving the performance and the quality of the products that we sell. So we've made significant progress in all of these areas this year and last year. And with the global supply chain team being in place, they're looking across all of those areas, plus logistics, to find ways to drive savings. And if you looked at the project list that make up what delivers the FORCE cost savings, you'd see hundreds of projects across the system globally that then add up to deliver those savings. There is specific examples we talked about in the personal care area, the strong cost savings.","We've had a number of examples where we've been able to share best practices across the globe where one of our manufacturing facilities has optimized a way to drive cost out of the diaper, they share that across the system. And then other manufacturing locations implement those learnings and that helps us optimize the cost of our products. But it's really in those four areas, and there are many, many projects across the system with our teams working on that globally.","Ali Dibadj","So that's very helpful. If we we're just to dig in one of them, just to give a little more color to it. So the second one, sort of productivity and operating efficiency. So what are your OEEs right now on average? And can you -- because I'm just trying to figure out how much of [indiscernible] is left, right? So where are we on OEE, as an example?","Thomas Falk","So it varies widely across businesses. So if you looked at OEE for our tissue machine, it would be very high because it's a baseload asset that runs 24\/7. If you looked at an OEE for a diaper machine, it would be much lower because you've got lots of stops and material changes and grade changes and things like that. And so I think for us, it's -- we would measure OEE for every diaper machine in the system and there's still a pretty good delta between the best-performing machine and the worst-performing machine. And the good news is, with a lot of the work that we're doing, our best-performing machines are getting better at about the same rate as our worst-performing machines. And so we do see lots of opportunity yet on productivity to continue to get best-in-class.","Ali Dibadj","Okay, super helpful. Totally separate type of question. You mention your categories clearly are more challenged right now. We get that. But it also looks like your market shares are more challenged. And I just want to go back to this what you were just mentioning a second ago, for example in China, but more broadly, that look at reinvestment that has to be put back into the marketplace a little bit there. But not just China, in the U.S., showing less share even elsewhere. What are the things that you expect, not just from a category perspective, but from a market share perspective, you guys to be able to deliver on better results?","Thomas Falk","Yes, that's fair. We're not satisfied with our market shares this year. We're up in about 40% of the country category intersections that we track, that are the biggest ones. And our goal for the year is to be up in at least half. So we're tracking below goal. North America's probably been the one that has had the toughest hit, given the first half results that we've had. We expect them to finish a little stronger. But I don't know, Mike, if you want to give any more color on other areas you're thinking but from a market share standpoint.","Michael Hsu","No, I mean, it's a great area to pick at, Ali. It's an area that we're clearly not happy about. And that we're trying to make sure that we run the business and make sure we find the right investment behind the brands, be able to grow profitably. And we're doing that. I think we made some progress in family care. Not declaring victory because we're just taking the next step in the right direction. But we're trying to grow our shares, grow our business and then grow our profit at the same time.","Thomas Falk","Yes, if you looked at our three-month shares versus our year-to-date shares, our trend is a little better sequentially, but we're still not satisfied.","Operator","At this time, we have no other questioners in the queue.","Paul Alexander","All right. Well, thank you, everyone, for your questions this morning. And we'll conclude with a short comment from Tom.","Thomas Falk","Well, once again, we appreciate your support of Kimberly-Clark. And we'll continue to do everything we can to deliver good shareholder value over the long term. Thanks very much.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's presentation.

At that time, instructions will be given as to the procedure to follow, if you\u2019d like to ask a question.","It is now my pleasure to introduce, Mr. Paul Alexander.","Paul Alexander","Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Kimberly-Clark\u2019s Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. With us today are Tom Falk, Chairman and CEO; Mark Buthman, Senior VP and CFO; and Mike Azbell, Vice President and Controller.","Here is the agenda for our call. Mark will begin with a review of third quarter results. Tom will then provide his perspectives on our results and the outlook for the year. We\u2019ll finish with Q&A. As usual we have a presentation of today\u2019s materials in the Investor section of our website, which is www.kimberly-clark.com.","As a reminder, we will be making forward-looking statements today. Please see the risk factor section of our last Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of forward-looking statements. We will also be referring to adjusted results and outlook. Both excludes certain items described in this morning\u2019s news release. The release has further information on these adjustments and reconciliations to comparable GAAP financial measures.","Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Mark.","Mark A. Buthman","Thanks, Paul. Good morning. Let\u2019s start with the headlines. First, we achieved organic sales growth of 5% in the third quarter highlighted by 10% growth in K-C International. Second, we increased adjusted earnings per share of 7%, including benefits from organic sales growth and strong cost savings. And third, we\u2019re on track with our overall capital plan, including working capital, capital spending, and allocating cash to shareholders.","Now, let\u2019s cover some of the details of the quarter starting with the top line. Third quarter sales were $5.3 billion, even with last year. Underlying organic sales rose 5%. That included higher volumes of 3% and 1 point of growth from both higher net selling prices and improved product mix, while sales in conjunction with our restructuring activities and unfavorable currency rates each reduced net sales by more than 2%.","I\u2019m encouraged by the pickup in organic sales growth in the quarter, which Tom will talk more about in a few minutes. Third quarter adjusted gross margin was 34.4%, up 20 basis points from last year, adjusted operating profit rose 1 point with an operating margin of 15.6%, that\u2019s up 10 basis points compared to prior year.","Results benefited from our organic sales growth and $70 million of FORCE cost savings, on the other hand we absorbed $55 million of cost inflation and $25 million of negative currency translation effects, currency transaction effects also with the comparisons.","Total spending between the lines was down 10 basis points as a percent of sales as slightly lower marketing costs were mostly offset by higher administrative and research spending. Third quarter adjusted effective tax rate was 30.2%, that\u2019s down from last year, but in line with the low end of our full-year target of 30% to 32%. Equity income was up 14% as K-C de Mexico had another solid quarter.","Finally, our lower diluted share count added $0.04 of EPS compared to last year. So putting all together, third quarter adjusted earnings per share were $1.44, that\u2019s up 7% year-on-year.","Now, turning to cash flow, our cash provided by operations in the third quarter was $912 million, up 8% compared to $844 million last year. The increase included benefits from working capital and lower pension contributions partially offset by payments related to the changes we\u2019re making in Europe.","We continue to manage primary working capital well. Our year-to-date cash conversion cycle is down four days compared to full-year 2012. So we\u2019re on track to exceed our original one-day improvement target.","In terms of capital allocation, third quarter dividend payments and share repurchases totaled more than $450 million. We repurchased $150 million of KMB stock in the quarter, and we continue to expect full-year share repurchases of $1.2 billion.","Now, I\u2019ll highlight a few areas from our segment results for the quarter. In Personal Care, organic sales rose more than 5%, driven by volume growth of 5%. Performance was led by K-C International, where organic sales were up 10%. Third quarter Personal Care operating margins were solid at 17.9%, although down just slightly year-on-year.","Moving to Consumer Tissue, organic sales were up 5%, net selling prices increased 3% with higher volumes and favorable mix each adding 1 point to growth. The organic growth was driven by a 10% increase in K-C International and a 4% improvement in North America.","Consumer Tissue operating margins of 14.3% were up 80 basis points versus last year. Our margins continued to benefit from revenue realization strategies, cost savings, and disciplined management of our between the lines spending.","Turning to K-C Professional, organic sales were up 5%, net selling prices and volumes each increased 2%, product mix was favorable by 1 point. Performance was led by K-C International with 11% organic growth. Organic sales were up low-single digits in both North America and Europe. Our KCP team continues to deliver strong margins. This quarter margins were 18.4%, up 90 basis points year-on-year.","Lastly, healthcare organic sales were up 4%, driven by higher volumes in our medical device business. Healthcare operating margins of 17.4% improved nicely both sequentially and compared to prior year with benefits from organic sales growth, cost savings, and below average spending between the lines.","So that wraps up my comments, to recap; we generated solid organic sales growth, we improved adjusted earnings per share, and we continue to allocate capital in shareholder-friendly ways.","Now I\u2019ll turn it over to Tom.","Thomas J. Falk","Thanks Mark and good morning everyone. I\u2019ll comment on our third quarter results, mostly focused on our top line and then I\u2019ll address our full year outlook. So, let\u2019s start with the third quarter. As Mark just mentioned, we had a good performance in a number of areas, including organic sales growth, cost savings, cash flow, and bottom line growth.","I\u2019m particularly encouraged with our organic top line growth of 5% in the quarter, that\u2019s a solid improvement compared to the 3% growth that we delivered in the first half of the year. As I mentioned on our July earnings call, we\u2019re focused on driving better top line growth by taking full advantage of our innovation in marketing programs and our sales capabilities.","Our top line performance was strong in K-C International in the third quarter. We had 10% organic sales growth there overall, and we had excellent progress behind our targeted growth initiatives in that part of the world. For example in our diaper business, organic sales were up 45% in China, 35% in Russia, and 20% in Brazil in the third quarter.","Our growth initiatives and product innovations continued to perform very well in these markets. Elsewhere in K-C International, we delivered double-digit organic sales growth in our adult care business, our baby wipes business, and in K-C Professional; and organic sales were up high-single digits in our feminine care business. So, our underlying growth in K-C International remains very healthy. Our teams are also improving mix and implementing price increases where we can in response to currency headwinds.","Outside of K-C International, our top line performance in the third quarter picked up somewhat in several of our high margin businesses. That includes our North American Huggies diapers business, K-C Professional, and HealthCare. Our Huggies volumes were up 4% with benefits from improved Snug N Dry diapers supported by effective marketing communications and competitive promotion activity.","Looking ahead in the first quarter of 2014, we\u2019ll be reducing package counts on the majority of our Huggies business in North America in conjunction with product innovation, and these moves will help fund the innovation in the right price points across our line-up.","In North American K-C Professional, our organic sales were up 3% in the third quarter. That compares to a 1 point decline in the second quarter and reflects somewhat better volume performance sequentially in those categories. In healthcare, medical device volumes rose 8% after a disappointing first half of the year, when these volumes were only up slightly.","And finally, we continue to drive solid top line growth on our Poise, Depend, U by Kotex and Cottonelle brands in North America, and all of these brands are benefiting from product innovations and effective marketing campaigns. So overall, I\u2019m encouraged by our third quarter results, particularly on the top line.","Now let me move to the outlook. We continue to execute our global business plan strategies for long-term success. So that means, we\u2019ll pursue targeted growth initiatives, we\u2019ll bring innovation to the market, we\u2019ll drive cost savings programs, and we\u2019ll allocate capital in shareholder-friendly ways.","At the same time, we expect to deliver very good financial performance this year in 2013 with solid organic sales growth and strong improvements in adjusted earnings per share. On the top line, year-to-date organic sales were up about 4%, so we expect our full year to be right in line with our 3% to 5% target.","On the bottom line, we\u2019re narrowing our full year outlook by raising the low-end of our previous guidance range by $0.05 a share. We now expect to deliver adjusted earnings in the range of $5.65 to $5.75 per share. That represents year-on-year growth of 8% to 10%, which is towards the high end of or even slightly above our long-term global business plan objective.","In terms of commodities and currencies, our expectations for the full year are both generally tracking with our previous plan. In terms of cost inflation, total pulp costs are similar to our prior expectation, while polymer costs have moved slightly higher recently. Overall, we expect total cost inflation for the year to be towards the middle of or perhaps in the upper half of the $150 million to $250 million range we had previously assumed.","Regarding currency rates, we continue to expect about 1 point to 2 point drag from currency in our full-year sales. Through the first nine months of the year, the impact has been about 1.5%. If recent spot currency rates hold for the balance of the year, the full-year impact should be slightly similar to or slightly worse than the year-to-date drag from currency.","We\u2019re offsetting the currency and commodity cost headwinds through strong focus on driving profitable volume growth, improving net realized revenue, delivering on our FORCE cost savings, and closely managing discretionary spending. The environment that we operate in continues to be challenging, but I am encouraged by our execution so far this year.","So to summarize, we had another good quarter of financial performance. We expect strong overall results for the year and we remain optimistic about our prospects to deliver attractive returns to our shareholders. So that wraps up our prepared remarks and we\u2019ll now be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, the floor is now open for your questions. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Ali Dibadj with Sanford Bernstein.","Ali Dibadj \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hey, guys, how are you?","Mark A. Buthman","Good morning, Ali.","Ali Dibadj \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Good morning. Hey so, I guess \u2013 we included \u2013 continue to be pleasantly surprised by the KCI progress, especially in Personal Care, and you mentioned 45% growth in China, 35% in Russia, 25% in Brazil. Can you help us just aggregate that a little bit more in terms of distribution gain, share gain, category growth, to give us a look at the sustainability of some of those growth rates?","Mark A. Buthman","Yes, I mean, I would say, if you looked at the category in both those markets, it\u2019s probably grown high-single digits in China and Russia in particular, probably not quite as much in Brazil. And in both cases, Russia had a lot of product innovation, launched boy\/girl diaper pants, really doing very well in markets at premium price, so that also helps us on the mix front.","Some distributions in Russia probably a little bit more in China as we continue to expand into more cities, but in China, we\u2019ve launched some tier-6 products, which we would call are super-premium above the norm in the market, and so that\u2019s also helping us from a mix and new category penetration. So clearly outperforming the category and taking some share in all those markets, but doing with innovation and a little bit of geographic expansion.","Ali Dibadj \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","So \u2013 but it sounds like the way you ordered that, it sounds like it\u2019s more kind of same-store expansion as opposed to geographic expansion driving some of this growth. Is that a fair assessment?","Mark A. Buthman","Yes, I\u2019d say that\u2019s probably more of the case this year than last where it was probably the opposite case last year. I wouldn\u2019t predict that we\u2019re going to grow in China from 45% forever. The compounding is pretty scary, but they are definitely on a good footing over there and they\u2019ve got lots of growth opportunities ahead.","Ali Dibadj \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. And then given some of your experiences with SCA whether it would be when they bought (inaudible) in Mexico or when they bought the P&G tissue business in Europe. Given the potential SCA deal in China with Vinda, what should you expect, what do you think you\u2019re going to see if that actually goes through from them as such a good competitor?","Mark A. Buthman","Ali, we don\u2019t have much of a tissue business in China. Our business there, we got a little bit of facial tissue, but we\u2019re really mostly focused on driving diapers and fem care, and then we\u2019ve things like baby wipes and other areas we built \u2013 we\u2019ve built out, first China is a fairly tough competitive tissue market with Vinda, Hengan, APP, all there were substantial investments, and so we have chosen not to play as aggressively in that space.","Ali Dibadj \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Well, I understand totally, what about leveraging that distribution for SCA\u2019s nonwovens introduction into that geography?","Mark A. Buthman","Yes, I haven\u2019t seen that yet, again they\u2019re not going to be a controlling shareholder for a while, and there are a plenty of folks in China between Uni-Charm, [Cowl] (ph), Procter, us, as well as Hengan, it\u2019s going to be a little different competitive set than they would have run into elsewhere in the world.","Ali Dibadj \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay, cool. And then just my last quick question, also surprised about Personal Care Europe growth numbers understanding that\u2019s going through transformation of the smaller business, but can you give us a sense about the strategies there both short-term with the, I guess, 7% it was I think and then going forward?","Mark A. Buthman","Well, really this was the strategy all along where we said the diaper business was consuming resources and was probably starving the good performing businesses that we had in Europe, and so we put more emphasis on our DryNites business in Europe which is going great, and Pull-Ups and we\u2019ve seen all those businesses take off, we picked up some additional distribution as we created some shelf space and we have been able to take advantage of some of that and some of it is obviously gone to private label or other competitors, but the additional emphasis, a little bit of additional marketing spend, some innovation and some additional distribution has helped those businesses pick up a little bit. So I\u2019d say baby wipes was probably the star of that show in the quarter, but DryNites and Training Pants in Europe also had a solid quarter.","Ali Dibadj \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay, thanks so much guys.","Mark A. Buthman","Thanks, Ali.","Operator","Your next question comes from Wendy Nicholson with Citi Research.","Wendy Nicholson \u2013 Citi Investment Research","Hi, good morning.","Mark A. Buthman","Hi, Wendy. Go ahead.","Wendy Nicholson \u2013 Citi Investment Research","Just a follow-on question, with regard to KCI and the profitability there, it sounds like you\u2019re doing a lot of innovation at the premium end, but I\u2019m still surprised with everything we hear about the level of competitive activity in those markets. I\u2019m hugely pleasantly surprised that your margins are hanging in there, so this year it looks like you\u2019re going to have a healthy bump in your KCI profit margins. Is that sustainable? Do you think the KCI business can continue to expand its margins, kind of as we look out into 2014 or is that a business that\u2019s just going to need more reinvestment do you think?","Mark A. Buthman","I mean the strategy, there is to grow and improve margin as particularly as we get to scale in some of the markets where we\u2019ve been investment spending. Yes, I think the challenge in KCI this year has been -- currency has been probably the biggest headwind from a margin standpoint, and we\u2019ve had both currency issues and higher commodity costs in some markets, and so that\u2019s probably been the biggest challenge. That team has done a great job of delivering cost savings and finding ways to fund their growth out of their own P&L and doing it by basically holding their margins. I think they are slightly higher year-to-date, I think they were down slightly sequentially, so\u2026","Wendy Nicholson \u2013 Citi Investment Research","But if we could disaggregate, underlying that margin improvement, is your marketing spending up significantly year-over-year and is it just because hey now you have got local manufacturing, I think in China that\u2019s helping to offset that? I\u2019m trying to get a feel for, hey have there been one-time cost savings initiatives that are going to run out, and is that going to be harder for you to continue to up the ante in terms of investment spending, or is this a just hey, positive mix is going to keep the ball rolling?","Thomas J. Falk","Yes, if you look at, our marketing spending is \u2013 in KCI is probably pretty flat in dollar terms year-over-year, but would be up and local currency because of the exchange rate. We kind of look at it market-by-market and see as our share of voice where we wanted to be in each of the markets where we\u2019re trying to drive growth, and we\u2019re pretty comfortable with the investment spend levels. I mean, I think like anything else teams would always like to spend more and we\u2019re trying to balance that. We\u2019re still delivering our results and hitting a target for the year.","Wendy Nicholson \u2013 Citi Investment Research","Got it, okay. And then just the second question on the restructuring, the 2 point headwind to revenues, when did that come to an end? When you\u2019re going to be fully done with that?","Thomas J. Falk","It should roll off, and first quarter of 2014 would be the last big one. We had a little bit still in the second quarter of this year, so it should be fully rolled off by mid next year.","Wendy Nicholson \u2013 Citi Investment Research","","Got it, terrific. Thank you so much.","Thomas J. Falk","Thanks, Wendy.","Operator","Our next question comes from Gail Glazerman with UBS.","Gail Glazerman \u2013 UBS Warburg","Hi, good morning.","Mark A. Buthman","Good morning, Gail.","Gail Glazerman \u2013 UBS Warburg","Can you talk a little bit more about some of the product volume changes in North American Personal Care, the growth in Huggies, which I think is the first that we\u2019ve seen in awhile, the continued weakness in Little Swimmers and also kind of the snapback in feminine care? Is there any more color you can offer?","Thomas J. Falk","Yes, sure. In Diapers, we were really not strategically where we wanted to be on price in second quarter. So we had to adjust a couple of price points on key packings. You saw a little bit of that and about 1 point drag on price in North American diapers. We also tuned our marketing messages a little bit. We had launched innovation in the second quarter. It wasn\u2019t hitting as hard as we wanted, so we\u2019ve changed the ad campaign in third quarter and saw that pick up nicely.","So, great product performance where it has got the right messages on shelf and we are \u2013 it\u2019s one of those where you wish you would have done in the second quarter, but we didn\u2019t and we\u2019ve checked and adjusted and saw the results in the third quarter.","In the Child Care business, the toughest comp of the year, last year third quarter, they were up double-digits and it had more to do with timing of promotion that shipped in the third quarter last year that shipped in the second quarter of this year. And so if you look at our Child Care business year-to-date, I think the volume is down about a point, share is pretty flat, and so that\u2019s reflective of the category overall.","We continue to have as you know a pretty high share in that space. Fem Care saw a good high-single digit growth, had a little bit weaker second quarter. Some of that is stuff that will show up and share more in the fourth quarter as it shipped a little later in the quarter. So overall, we feel pretty good about the momentum in U by Kotex and you are seeing that that play out in the marketplace.","And then in the Adult Care business, its continued good in innovation and execution really a solid share performance, I think we had a record share for both the pan [ph] employees in the quarter and retailers were happy with the movement as well.","Gail Glazerman \u2013 UBS Warburg","Okay. And just in Healthcare, the pickup, I guess there were some reference in the room at least about better surgical activity, is that something you see is sustainable given the bump that you\u2019ve had over the last few quarters. Is that coming back and getting stronger or\u2026?","Thomas J. Falk","I would say, the date is a little less, immediately available. So we kind of get visibility now in the second quarter surgeries and I\u2019d say I was getting less negative, in the second quarter, so that\u2019s a positive and I think in some cases, some of the improvement in devices was additional penetration where we\u2019re able to use our pain pumps on more procedures and our sales teams had some wins in the marketplace with the device products that we\u2019re selling.","And so it was probably a function of a little bit better surgical environment and a little bit better category penetration that drove into the quarter.","Gail Glazerman \u2013 UBS Warburg","Okay. Just one last question given everything that was going on in DC over the last few weeks kind of as you exited the third quarter as is the fourth quarter, did you see any shift in volume patterns in the U.S. or not so much?","Thomas J. Falk","","Not really I mean mostly people need diapers and bathroom tissue everyday, no matter what\u2019s going on in Washington and that was the case, we don\u2019t have a very big direct government business so that was not a factor for us to any large extent. And we\u2019ll see and we start to get some consumer confidence data if they had an effect from that standpoint, but it\u2019s probably little early to read that. I know talking to some of our retail partners they did see a dip in stores that were near U.S. military bases, but that didn\u2019t overall for us play out and much from a category standpoint.","Gail Glazerman \u2013 UBS Warburg","Okay, thank you.","Thomas J. Falk","","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chip Dillon with Vertical Research.","Chip A. Dillon \u2013 Vertical Research Partners, LLC","","Yeah. Hey, good morning Tom. Hey as you look into next year, it looks like well first of all looking at 2012 and 2013, you\u2019ve been able to hit $300 million plus in the FORCE savings and you\u2019ve done so much restructuring now with the European initiative, I guess towards the end. Should we still expect that kind of rate of FORCE savings and maybe its early days, but could you give us an idea of what you\u2019re thinking about capital wise next year knowing that you haven\u2019t really done much in the North American tissue area that I know of, in terms of your planned equipment there?","Thomas J. Falk","Yeah, sure on the FORCE savings, pardon me we\u2019re pretty happy, we\u2019ve taken that up from several years ago, we were around $150 million a year to solidly above $250 million now for the last couple of years, and that\u2019s certainly our aspiration is to stay there and to continue to drive that and as I look at our teams around the world that are doing more than we\u2019ve ever done to drive transformation of their cost structure we\u2019ve really got a very robust pipeline of cost savings coming.","And so that\u2019s been great to help us this year overcome some of the currency headwinds and higher commodity costs. And so certainly we\u2019d expect a healthy level of FORCE savings to continue in 2014 and beyond. And on the capital front, I\u2019d expect CapEx to be consistent with our global business plan and that of 4% to 5% of sales kind of ranges about where we\u2019re going to be and so give or take around $1 billion and $1.1 billion something like that we will give you more specific guidance in January.","But that\u2019s about where we\u2019re roll up and I think from our capacity standpoint with all the restructuring we\u2019ve done in the North American family care arena, and all the good productivity gains we\u2019ve gotten from our Lean and FORCE savings we\u2019ve actually freed up quite a bit of capacity out of our own assets base just by getting more productive and efficient with our existing footprint which is really free capacity for us.","Chip A. Dillon \u2013 Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Got you. And moving on as you look at China I know in past calls, you\u2019ve talked about how your penetration has progressed in terms of number of cities have you \u2013 can you tell us where that stands maybe today versus a year or two ago and is it now more of an issue of, if you have accomplished the geographic penetration now is just getting more shelf space in the cities you currently are in?","Mark A. Buthman","Yes, I mean, I think our plan was to end this year around 90 cities and we are on track to hit that. I think we started the year at 70 and two or three years ago, it was 45 or 50 something like that. Probably there are different measures you can look at, but there\u2019s a couple hundred cities in China with over a 1 million people and I think so, the next city gets decreasing in size and scope.","So \u2013 but I\u2019d say, we\u2019ve gotten the good build out in the major areas and we\u2019re continuing to make sure we\u2019re on the map. We\u2019re starting to get to the point where we got enough scale that we can do national advertising and its cost effective now or that probably wasn\u2019t the case two or three years ago. So I think we are at a critical math now and certainly are planning and keeping growing that.","Chip A. Dillon \u2013 Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Gotcha. And then just the last question, you mentioned the initiative in the first quarter on the diaper front in terms of the package counts. Can you give us an idea of what sort of the net effect of that will be kind of on a unit price basis and on average?","And then secondly, as you look at 2014, you came into 2013 obviously with a real head of steam and had tremendous growth early in a year. And just looking at your guidance, if you hit the midpoint of your range, it would be basically flat at $1.37. So as you look at 2014 besides the diaper count and obviously the \u2013 or the ongoing organic growth, are there other initiatives that you could maybe point us to in terms of staying on that, on your plan, mid to up or single-digit growth rate?","Mark A. Buthman","Yes, and again we\u2019ll give you more color on 2014 on the January call. If you look at the diaper question, it\u2019s essentially going to be matching up with competitive counts in the marketplace broadly and averaged about a 7% count change now, some of that will be spent back. And so I would say the yield will be \u2013 probably be less than half of that in terms of what we\u2019ll have to work with in terms of P&L, but we\u2019ll see how that plays out as it roles out in late first quarter of next year.","And for 2014, the big question will obviously be currency rates. And so when you look at the kind of drag that currency had on this quarter, if you look at the combination of translation and transaction, it\u2019s about a 3.5 points. And at the peak it was more like a 5 point drag, when you look that where rates have peaked. So that will be the big bet for 2014. If we still see a big currency drag in 2014, it will be tough to get to the high-end of the range, but we still think that\u2019s the right range for us long-term to develop our plan around.","Chip A. Dillon \u2013 Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Thank you very much.","Mark A. Buthman","Thanks, Chip.","Operator","Our next question comes from Caroline Levy with CLSA.","Caroline Levy \u2013 CLSA Americas LLC","Good morning, everybody. A couple of questions, the first is around North American pricing environment in general, because I think one of your large competitors have signaled clearly a big focus on the North American market, so just is there any specific change in behavior that you\u2019ve noticed, any fear that there will be more discounting. I think you mentioned in that there has been some discounting if you could just talk to that?","Mark A. Buthman","Yes, I think that in the second quarter we saw some discounting in some packs and some outlets, and we didn\u2019t mess up to those quickly as we could have. We corrected that in the third quarter. I said that\u2019s more than normal competitive behavior. We had a major launch underway and competitors typically are more active to protect their business when there is a major launch activity, much like we would do if the situation were reversed.","I think some of the leadership on price count activity in the marketplace would signal that there is some behavior happening on that front that would indicate that there is some innovation happening in desired place for that, which is rational behavior. So I wouldn\u2019t say we\u2019ve seen anything that\u2019s unusual in the North American market at this point in time.","Caroline Levy \u2013 CLSA Americas LLC","That\u2019s very good news. And just moving to Latin America, a lot of companies, maybe not HPC in particular, but had experienced a big slow down in Brazil. Is everything you see such as things that even though the consumer is stretched to a business doesn\u2019t get impacted?","Thomas J. Falk","We\u2019ve got a phenomenal team in Brazil and they\u2019ve done a great job of delivering in a challenging environment. And so while they have lost couple of years, they have missed their top line target in dollars, they\u2019ve grown much faster than plan and local currency, and have better come very close to their dollar profit target.","So they\u2019ve done it with driving a lot of innovation rapidly into the marketplace and pulled things forward to get them in the category. We\u2019ve also been expanding into the Northeastern part of Brazil and just opened a new facility in Wahiawa State this year. And so that has given us more capacity to serve that big part of the market. And so we\u2019ve had a little bit of geographic expansion even in the market like Brazil, where we\u2019ve been for a while and that certainly helped.","Caroline Levy \u2013 CLSA Americas LLC","Great. And then the last one is over time, I think one of the things the push backs investors often use on Kimberly, is that it\u2019s very commodity reliant company. And if you could maybe articulate why things have changed over the last four to five years enough that you probably are able to manipulate price and SG&A spend around fluctuations in input cost. So do you think that you really are indeed vulnerable to big gross margin swings?","Thomas J. Falk","Well, I think that\u2019s one that we haven\u2019t had in the last couple of years, a big commodity push. But I\u2019ve been around long enough. I remember times when we did and so we went for about three years where commodities were double what we thought and that definitely put pressure on margins for a while. We put that around and have a more robust cost savings program and I think driving innovation is giving us a better margin profile.","But we also that\u2019s something that we\u2019re watching for and trying to do a better job of predicting and getting ahead of where we can. So with kind of the third quarter trend, where you get both commodity and currency going against you a little bit was a challenge, but the fact that we overcame that gives us confidence going forward.","Caroline Levy \u2013 CLSA Americas LLC","Thank you so much.","Thomas J. Falk","Thank you, Caroline.","Operator","Your next question comes from Chris Ferrara with Wells Fargo.","Thomas J. Falk","Hey, good morning, Chris.","Chris Ferrara \u2013 Wells Fargo","Good morning guys. One of the goal just the B2B businesses right, so HealthCare and K-C Professional both got better this quarter after I guess FORCE straight margins [ph] are good. Can you just kind of characterize that this just a change in trend, do you think the businesses are better with some of the drag that were hitting the row over for now or do you just think this is one quarter?","Thomas J. Falk","Well, if I want to start with KCP, I mean this had really pretty good execution and have delivered terrific profit margins. Our innovation has been successful in the marketplace. But we probably lost a bit of business in the part of the portfolio that we weren\u2019t selling the new innovation to and so they\u2019ve kind of gone back and try to make sure we\u2019re picking up any of those opportunities that we might have lost.","And I thought to North American business for KCP turnaround in the quarter was encouraging. So that will be one example of that. And our KCP team would still see a lot of international opportunity as we see in KCI generally. And so we think we\u2019re in very early days in China in that business and there is a huge opportunity in that market industrializes for all types of products. And so I do see a pretty robust pipeline coming for KCP in particular.","HealthCare as you know, that there is some different economic factors that work, when \u2013 in the past we\u2019ve had pandemics, you\u2019ve seen huge volume spikes and then it falls off or you have to lap it at the next year. So there is a little bit more volatility. I think we\u2019re all trying to figure out in North America in particular, what\u2019s going to happen from a healthcare spend overall? What\u2019s going to happen? What procedures? And so there is probably a little bit more variability around our outlook for that business going forward. But it was great to see a solid execution in the third quarter and good profit performance.","Chris Ferrara \u2013 Wells Fargo","Yes, and I guess profit was up 19%, I think in the release you talked about lower marketing in R&D, what\u2019s going on there? Is that sustainable reduction or is there something\u2026?","Mark A. Buthman","Well, I would say in HealthCare, if you kind of look at the year-to-date average as a better predictor of the profitability of the business, we\u2019ve had some unusual things that hit the second quarter that made a little lower than normal and probably some of those things are reversed and benefited the third quarter that made a little higher than normal. But I\u2019d say, if you look at the year-to-date number that\u2019s probably a pretty good proxy for our run rate for that business.","Chris Ferrara \u2013 Wells Fargo","Great, thanks. And just last thing, could you just remind me up from the downtown diapers in North America, I heard that the yield on that is going to be probably half of what the 7% downtown, but what do you expect in terms of volume, like assuming in profitability kind of do the same sorts of things.","Did you expect that volume, unit volume will take a little bit of a hit and even though you\u2019re trying to kind of padded in with promotional spending and then you recovered that in six months, or do you expect really in order [ph] to category volume?","Mark A. Buthman","I mean historically every time we\u2019ve done this, it\u2019s been around a while, but done a few of these. Here you do see a little bit of household inventory destocking, because the packages have less diapers and the consumer said about the same average number of packages than they\u2019re holding slightly fewer diapers.","So their usage per day doesn\u2019t change just as a result of the pack count. But their average inventory level drops by roughly half of the comp decline if you\u2019re an economist that would probably be the right answer and we\u2019ve typically seen that for a period of time. So I would expect that will be a drag in the first half of next year and eventually it kind of stabilizes.","Chris Ferrara \u2013 Wells Fargo","Got it. Thanks a lot.","Mark A. Buthman","Okay. Thanks, Chris.","Operator","Your next question comes from Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank.","Bill Schmitz \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Hey, guys, good morning.","Thomas J. Falk","Good morning, Bill.","Bill Schmitz \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Hey, can you just tell us like how that you sort of sold off a decent chunk at European business, what percentage of total sales are KCI now? I know you put it in the 10-K, but I was hoping to get like a sneak peak?","Mark A. Buthman","Yeah, KCI in the third quarter was 39% and year-to-date it\u2019s probably high 30%, 37%, 38% we might guess some.","Bill Schmitz \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay. And while sort of KCI sort of outside the Americas probably see predominantly your Personal Care business. I mean are there any sort of plans or sort of build out that consumer tissue piece of that business outside of the Americas?","Mark A. Buthman","Bill at this point, we got so many opportunities we\u2019re chasing in Personal Care are not fully exploited. I mean if you look at the KCI business, it\u2019s still heavily overweight diapers and fem care. And so it\u2019s underweight, baby wipes is underweight, adult care both Depend on employees, Childcare, Little Swimmers, GoodNites are all still a very small businesses.","So we said we\u2019ve got lot of opportunity to build out KCI across the broad Personal Care portfolio. That\u2019s a much higher return, faster growing category. There is already a lot of pad tissue in emerging markets; the category is more fully penetrated. So there maybe some areas around household towels or facial tissue, but as we get some innovation, we can bring to market. But we probably will do it in a more capital efficient way than maybe we would have above the footprint built out in the Americas.","Bill Schmitz \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Gotcha. Is there any more incremental room to kind of take pricing down the lower tiers in lot of the emerging markets? I know you had a big initiative about two years ago to get into sort of like Tier-3 and Tier-4 diapers in China. But how far long are you in this business still sort of predominantly Tier-5 and even Tier-6 diapers?","Mark A. Buthman","I mean, I\u2019d say in most emerging markets, we\u2019re in multi-tier and it\u2019s more of a Tier-3, 4. China was sort of the outlier that we started in Tier-5 basically when we relaunched Huggies several years ago, and then built down into the mid-tier, and so we\u2019re in Tier-3, 4, 5 and 6 in China basically. I mean, we just sort of created Tier-6, so we\u2019re the only ones in it. But there have been other markets. If you look at market like Mexico, we\u2019d be present in all tiers. Brazil would be probably a combination of Tiers-2, 3, and 4. Russia is mostly 3 and 4.","So we\u2019re really trying to figure out what \u2013 where is the market today and then how do we make sure we can bring a differentiated product that delivers a good experience for mom.","Bill Schmitz \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Gotcha. And then just lastly on the sort of commodity side, I mean it seems like you guys are sort of fairly unconcerned about the inflation, but it seems like your MBFK I guess was up $25 in October, to look at how pulp is starting to creep up, I mean why are you kind of less concerned than some of the spot prices might suggest?","Mark A. Buthman","Yes, MBFK is up, but eucalyptus which we use a lot more of is down, so we averaged and our outlook for that was \u2013 is $7.90 for the fourth quarter, and we give you that outlook in July with more $8.05, and on October it\u2019s below $7.70. So we\u2019re picking it up on other fiber sources. Recycled fibers, another one that we buy about 1 million tons of recycled fiber a year, and our outlook in July was for that, that averaged 245 and now we\u2019re saying it\u2019s going to average 214. And so we\u2019re seeing benefits in other fiber resources that you might not have a much visibility too that, that\u2019s helping us on that front. Oil is certainly one that \u2013 that was \u2013 that $30 million of other cost inflation in the quarter was mostly polymer, that\u2019s oil related.","Bill Schmitz \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay. I mean if you look at the Bloomberg number and maybe I\u2019m getting too far in the weeds there, but it looks like eucalyptus pulp prices are going up. So am I just looking at the wrong data set or you guys buying it differently or better, because you have to pick business in Brazil?","Thomas J. Falk","I mean we\u2019ve got a market-based contract in Brazil, but you\u2019re seeing more capacity come online and at least the stuff we\u2019re \u2013 the average forecast we\u2019re seeing has been headed down this year went rather than up. So I haven\u2019t looked at Bloomberg, but that maybe of futures price or something like that, but\u2026","Bill Schmitz \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay.","Mark A. Buthman","15% of our mix I think is now eucalyptus\u2026","Bill Schmitz \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Yeah.","Mark A. Buthman","About 25% is northern softwood, so the mix of fiber we use is really important.","Bill Schmitz \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Gotcha. And then just one last one I promise, the capital allocation, have you guys changed your view, because it seems like you\u2019re starting to get very under-levered and, this year it seems like it\u2019s going to payout more than 100% of your net income in dividends and share repurchase. So is it that going to be kind of the ML going forward?","Thomas J. Falk","As you know, we want to be solidly in the middle of the A range. And so if we drift up to the upper end of the A range, we may increase our debt just a little bit to validate that back and you may notice that Mark and his team borrowed about $800 million in May, I think to fund a $500 million debt retirement in August. And so we increased our debt by about $300 million and then that extra amount went into share repurchases versus our plan for the year.","Bill Schmitz \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Great. Thanks so much, guys.","Thomas J. Falk","All right. Thanks, Bill.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jason English with Goldman Sachs.","Jason English \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey, good morning, folks.","Mark A. Buthman","Good morning, Jason.","Jason English \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","Congratulations on another good quarter.","Mark A. Buthman","Thank you.","Jason English \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey, the question just in terms of maybe what\u2019s changed, I think you sounded slightly more cautious tone last on your reported earnings, caution that you could commence the lower end if FX rates stayed about where they are today. So what\u2019s changed?","Thomas J. Falk","Well, I would say a couple of things. We had a weaker volume quarter and we told you we weren\u2019t happy about our second quarter organic top line. And we expected to do better in the back half of the year, and we saw that show up in the third quarter, and so that that obviously gives you a little bit more confidence when the volume and innovation is working. I also would say, at the time of the call it was probably the height of the currency of mania and that seems to have pulled back a little bit as the FED tapering has been pushed out a little bit. And so that\u2019s probably given us a little bit of relief on that and it\u2019s not quite as bad of a currency drag as we would have thought at late in July.","Jason English \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","One area that surprised us this quarter was the strength in North American tissue and 4% organic sales growth, really good momentum all throughout this year. It\u2019s surprising, because it stands in pretty stark contrast to the Nielsen data where we aggregate your tissue business. And trends have been decelerating and are now probably in the red. What\u2019s the differential that\u2019s driving the outperformance for this business versus the Nielsen data?","Thomas J. Falk","I haven\u2019t analyzed this versus Nielsen. We look at our outlook shares and our shares sequentially in tissue were slightly negative. We did take price across facial and Cottonelle by a sheet count. And so of the organic top line in North America was positive price, negative volume as we would track it, so that maybe a bit of what you are seeing if you are looking at unit volume trends. But broadly, we\u2019ve had a very strong year in our Family Care business, so we\u2019re pretty happy with the results.","Jason English \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","But no concern that there is too much inventory out there, nothing to be concerned about that right?","Thomas J. Falk","","These are very high-Q, low value businesses, so retailers really don\u2019t want these in their warehouse. So we\u2019ve pretty aggressive on helping them with inventory returns.","Jason English \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","It makes sense. Thanks a lot guys. I\u2019ll pass it on.","Thomas J. Falk","","Thanks, Jason.","Operator","Our next question comes from Javier Escalante with Consumer Edge Research.","Javier Escalante \u2013 Consumer Edge Research, LLC","Hi.","Mark A. Buthman","Good morning. How are you?","Javier Escalante \u2013 Consumer Edge Research, LLC","Good morning. A couple of questions actually, it\u2019s a little bit of a follow-up on Jason\u2019s questions with regards to the disconnect of track data and shipment data. Essentially, the [indiscernible] is that the non-track channels basically which is essentially [indiscernible] you maybe growing very strong double-digits started for our assessment?","Mark A. Buthman","And I guess, however, we won\u2019t give a specific customer data on a call like this. We are doing well with Costco this year, we do well with Dollar Stores. There are other E-Com channels that are on track that are typically growing. So I would say broadly we tend to look more at our \u2013 all outlet share and try to make sure, we\u2019re fully participating in the category growth. And Nielsen is one set of data points that we would look at, but we tend to look at the broad data set more than anything else.","Javier Escalante \u2013 Consumer Edge Research, LLC","But when you say higher we got the same weak volumes, but in any event, moving into the decision of removing sheet out of facial tissue and what is the other category that you mentioned as your de-sheeting in tissue?","Mark A. Buthman","Cottonelle that tissue.","Javier Escalante \u2013 Consumer Edge Research, LLC","So basically, at least in track channel data, we see increases of private label volume share, significant increases. And considering that I would imagine that cost disruption in the U.S., it should be by now over. Do you think that given that you have pricing \u2013 private label gaining share and cost coming back would probably regain some of the shares that they lost in the past nine months. Do you think that is if volume rates going forward or pricing rates going forward, you don\u2019t see that happening?","Mark A. Buthman","Yes, if you look at a lot of the private label share gains this year was, I think in at least partly response to GP\u2019s service issues where they actually lost some shelf space to private label. We picked up a little bit as did our other primary competitor. And I think as we see GP coming back into full customer service, I would say at this point we\u2019re seeing a more normal level of competitive activity in the marketplace.","But we\u2019re pretty comfortable with our overall performance in tissue and that, we\u2019ll still be competitive as we need to in the marketplace, but with generally rising pulp prices that\u2019s also typically what the big driver is of long-term tissue price. So we\u2019d say in the near-term that\u2019s feeling more positive than not.","Javier Escalante \u2013 Consumer Edge Research, LLC","Understood. And finally on Huggies, the rebound in the quarter, which also we didn\u2019t see in track channel data, to what extent do you think that the fact that [Indiscernible] lowered their own diaper count in the second half of September could have been a benefit this quarter in personal care in North America?","Mark A. Buthman","Yeah, I think our Huggies business was pretty solid throughout the quarter and so there may have been some changeover late in the quarter that was some small advantage, but I would say it was pretty consistent growth throughout the quarter.","Javier Escalante \u2013 Consumer Edge Research, LLC","Okay, thank you very much.","Mark A. Buthman","All right, thank you Javier.","Operator","Our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.","Mark A. Buthman","Good morning, Lauren.","Lauren Rae Lieberman \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","Good morning. Firstly, I want to ask you about with just with marketing spending and some of you guys discussed advertising and some with strategic marketing. So I realize there might be kind of mixing the conversation, but having it down slightly this quarter and I believe that earlier in the year too, it\u2019s slightly different than what you\u2019ve last talked about I think that was, you made it sound like it was going to increase in the back-half of the year. So if certainly if I mean if that\u2019s incorrect and secondly why not increasing the spending when top line is coming in strongly, you\u2019ve simply got sort of somewhat excess profitability to work with?","Mark A. Buthman","It\u2019s a good question and as we look at the strategic marketing, it\u2019s a combination of advertising and promotion. It\u2019s down about $20 million in the quarter, about half of that is the exit of diapers from Europe and currency. So the fact that rates have, have dropped, so the other half of that was an actual decline in program spending. Advertising itself is flat year-on-year. So all of that decline was really what we call consumer promotion, which would be a combination of things that would flow through that, that line in the P&L generally less, a little bit less activity.","And what we look at is, are we spending at the right level and getting the current top line performance for the spending that we\u2019re making. And overall, we\u2019re pretty happy with the organic top line in the quarter. And as we look at the key markets that we are investing in, we feel like we\u2019re investing at about the right level.","And so it\u2019s really above the ROI, and the next dollar spend, is that worth chasing or you bring it to the bottom line. And so I think each of our teams around the world look at that and then our global brand teams are also challenging that to make sure that we\u2019re making smart investments if we got some flexibility in the P&L to do that.","Lauren Rae Lieberman \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. That\u2019s particularly interesting given that sales growth and organic did accelerate nicely, though it wasn\u2019t step up in spend?","","Thomas J. Falk","Yeah, but in local currency though just being flat is a pretty big increase and spend in those market. So we\u2019ve looked at KCI and say, yeah, we\u2019re actually in spending more in local currency in those markets.","Lauren Rae Lieberman \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay, understood. And then I know it\u2019s not a terribly large business that I just was curious about the really strong performance in K-C Professional in Europe because that it give us 5% price and then you also had 3%-ish positive mix and volume made high numbers mix of long and short, all three features were very strongly positive. So can you talk a little bit about that that was sort of dramatic acceleration?","Thomas J. Falk","I think that might have been our overall year of business, Paul you got with that\u2026?","Paul Alexander","Yeah, I mean Lauren we were up double-digits in K-C Professional in KCI and that\u2019s what you\u2019re referring to. In all three pieces we\u2019re up nicely in terms of volume and pricing mix.","Lauren Rae Lieberman \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","All right, yeah that\u2019s it.","Thomas J. Falk","Yeah.","Lauren Rae Lieberman \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","That\u2019s how\u2026","Thomas J. Falk","Yeah, that was really led by Latin America, but broadly was the strongest of those or that business is done well. But the European business in KCI was okay, during the quarter, looked a lot more like North America though and let\u2019s say the UK is probably coming back a little bit. You\u2019ve seen that in some of the economics statistics and Germany was okay and Southern Europe is a challenge.","Lauren Rae Lieberman \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","And then with that like you corrected me, thank you. The Latin America heading into process you said Latin America is being particularly responsible for that acceleration. Was there any kind of change in sales resources? Do you increase the sales force or broadened the footprint you\u2019re able to reach that it was big number to file?","Thomas J. Falk","Our K-C Professional team is really driving their global strategy. In fact we would say overall we did well on Latin America. We\u2019re not satisfied with what we\u2019re doing in China. We\u2019re putting more resource behind KCP in a lot of markets around the world and investing behind that. Unlike consumers doesn\u2019t show up in a strategic A&P is probably shows up more in selling expense and G&A than in the traditional strategic marketing bucket.","Lauren Rae Lieberman \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay, great. Thank you so much.","Thomas J. Falk","Thanks Lauren.","Operator","My next question comes from Olivia Tong with the Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Olivia Tong \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you. I want to touch a little bit on KCI margins clearly you\u2019ve done quite well in terms of international sales. But how do you think about margins going forward? Do you expect them to progress faster than the corporate average or is there more spending to come specific to KCI?","Thomas J. Falk","Yeah, that\u2019s a balance. We\u2019re really tracking KCI to continue to narrow the margin gap versus the rest of the company and so they\u2019ve made some progress this year, although currency headwinds have held them back from some of the progress that they help to make. And so we\u2019re trying to balance investing for growth in the places where we got great opportunity and then looking for opportunities to take cost out to help fund our margin improvement. And so we\u2019re satisfied with the progress, but we expect to continue to do more.","Olivia Tong \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it, thanks. And then on North American diapers, obviously you\u2019ve had some promotion in price adjustments this quarter, which I would expect to is probably going to continue, and then you\u2019ve got the diaper downtown on the new product. So what do you think the net impact of both price and mix will be going forward in North America? Are we still looking at either positive price mix from that plus 7%, even though it goes down to plus 3% or is that the promotion offset that?","Mark A. Buthman","Well, you should see some positive, but it won\u2019t start to happen until probably late first quarter of 2014. So for the next couple of quarters, you\u2019ll still see some drag from price promotion activity.","Olivia Tong \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","","Got it. And then just lastly, can you just talk about trends month-by-month both in developing markets and emerging markets. Did you see you mentioned Huggies Diapers in North America, but did you see any difference in trends coming from July through August through September?","Mark A. Buthman","We\u2019ve had a pretty solid consistent quarter throughout, I mean I don\u2019t want to get in the habit of we\u2019re giving out monthly data, but I\u2019d say broadly it was a pretty solid quarter month-by-month.","Olivia Tong \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","","Got it. Thank you so much.","Mark A. Buthman","All right. Thanks Olivia.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chip Dillon with Vertical Research.","Mark A. Buthman","Hey, Chip.","Chip A. Dillon \u2013 Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Hey, there. Just one last one here, I noticed the equity line really is trending very positively this year. It looks like 26% up \u2013 through the first nine months and so as you look at the future, could you talk a little bit about what\u2019s really happening in Mexico, especially now that for example you have a different competitor down there and you see that kind of growth rate continuing or is there something else going on, on that line?","Mark A. Buthman","As we go through Mexico, I think they announced late last week and had their call with their outlook. So I don\u2019t want to trump whatever Pablo might have told you on the call. But we\u2019ve been very happy with the year they\u2019ve put together. It\u2019s a tougher economic environment than they thought. So the Mexican economy was expected to grow kind of 4%, 5% in the last date I saw, it was just a little under 1%.","And so lots of exciting change happening in that marketplace. But that has probably also created some challenges in the short-term. There is lots of competition down there. So CMPC is pretty aggressive, FCA is pretty aggressive. So there is plenty of people that want to eat our lunch in Mexico. But the K-C de Mexico team has done a great job of delivering as they have for many, many years and I\u2019d expect that to continue going forward, probably not at that same kind of growth rate. But they\u2019re going to be a solid consistent top and bottom line performance for us.","Chip A. Dillon \u2013 Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Gotcha, thanks.","Mark A. Buthman","Thanks Chip.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ali Dibadj with Sanford Bernstein.","Mark A. Buthman","Hey\u2026","Ali Dibadj \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hey, thanks for the follow-up. I just want to get your view Tom on the North American consumer paper, consumer tissue business, your largest retailer said explicitly that they\u2019re going to double down on investments in pricing in paper products and there is discussion about a lot of more capacity coming online both private label and kind of lower end brands. Just want to get a sense of what you make up all of that and that\u2019s too much about nothing really in your view?","Thomas J. Falk","Well, I mean I would just start to see those guys not long ago and they want to grow their business in lots of categories. And so I think they\u2019ll, Simon and his team are aggressively are doing that as this all of other retail customers. And so we\u2019re doing well with our key customers in our family care categories and lot longer we\u2019re one of those and we want to make sure that we make it easy for consumers to find Kleenex and Cottonelle and Scott where they choose to shop. So I wouldn\u2019t say that\u2019s a big change \u2013 we haven\u2019t seen a big change in behavior at this point in time.","Ali Dibadj \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","And we\u2019re trying to connect the point specifically that they\u2019re making about pricing in particular being a driver and the point about capacity coming online?","Mark A. Buthman","On the capacity front, I think the industry operating rate is still in the \u2013 around 90%, so there has been a lot of capacity that\u2019s exited as much of the sales has come on. And where you have seen a little bit of private label share pickup, it hasn\u2019t been in [indiscernible] variance that some had been concerned about. And so, overall there is a little bit of additional capacity, but it hasn\u2019t been destabilizing the market pricing at this point in time.","Ali Dibadj \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","And so you don\u2019t see anything going forward that would change dynamics and consumer tissue in the U.S.?","Mark A. Buthman","Not at this stage. And we\u2019re focused on driving innovation with better performing Kleenex. We\u2019ve had some Cottonelle upgrades. We\u2019ve got some great Viva and Scott Towel products out there. So we\u2019ve got, and a good pipeline of innovation coming that will give us some news, we can talk about in 2014 and beyond.","Ali Dibadj \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.

At that time, instructions will be given as to the procedures to follow-up, if you would like to ask an audio question.","It is now my pleasure to introduce today's first presenter Mr. Paul Alexander.","Paul Alexander","Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Kimberly-Clark\u2019s year-end earnings conference call. On the call this morning are Tom Falk, Chairman and CEO; Mike Hsu, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Maria Henry, our CFO. Here\u2019s the agenda for the call.","Maria will begin with a review of full year 2017 results. After that Tom will discuss our announcements this morning of a new global restructuring program and also our multi-year ongoing cost savings target. Mike will then comment on our 2018 outlook and we\u2019ll finish with Q&A.","As usual, we have a presentation of today\u2019s materials in the Investors section of our website. That presentation includes an appendix with a summary of business segment results for 2017 and our key planning assumptions for 2018.","As a reminder, we will be making forward-looking statements today. Please see the Risk Factors section of our latest Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of forward-looking statements.","We will also be referring to adjusted results and outlook; both exclude certain items described in this morning's news release. The release has further information about these adjustments and reconciliations to comparable GAAP financial measures.","And now, I'll turn it over to Maria.","Maria Henry","Thanks, Paul. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining our call today.","Let me start with the headlines of our full year results. Sales and earnings were broadly consistent with our previous outlook. We achieved record FORCE cost savings and reduced discretionary spending to help offset commodity inflation and fund competitive investment, and we improved capital efficiency and returned significant cash to shareholders.","Now let's cover the details of our results, starting with our sales. Full year net sales were $18.3 billion. Total sales and organic sales were both pretty similar year-on-year. On organic sales, volumes increased 1% and product mix improved slightly. Net selling prices were down more than 1%, reflecting the competitive environment and, in some cases, improving currency rate.","Looking at the topline by geography, in developing and emerging markets, organic sales rose 3% with volume growth of 5%. In terms of key growth market, personal care volumes increased mid-single digits in Latin America and in China and nearly 20% in Eastern Europe.","In developed markets outside of North America, organic sales declined 3%. The diaper category decline in South Korea was the big driver of that decrease.","In North America, organic sales for consumer products fell 2%. Our results benefited from innovations, but were impacted by competitive activity and the lower U.S. birthrate.","In K-C Professional in North America, organic sales were similar year-on-year. Volumes increased 1% in what is a relatively sluggish market.","Moving on to profitability. Full year gross margin was 35.9%, down 70 basis points year-on-year. That reflects lower selling prices and $355 million of commodity inflation. Helping to offset those headwinds, our FORCE cost-savings program continued to deliver strong results. Full year savings were an all-time record $450 million.","Moving down the P&L, between-the-lines spending fell 40 basis points as a percent of net sales as we tightly managed our overhead. Adjusted operating margin was 18.2%, down 20 basis points. By business segment, margins rose 50 basis points in Personal Care and 60 basis points in K-C Professional. Margins in consumer tissue were down 130 basis points and were impacted by higher pulp costs.","Our adjusted effective tax rate in 2017 was 28.6%, that was lower than our 2016 rate of 30.7% as our teams did a good job executing planning initiative. Full year adjusted earnings per share were $6.23, up 3% year-on-year. That was in line with our October guidance to expect earnings to be at the low end of the $6.20 to $6.35 range.","Before I turn to cash flow, let me comment on how U.S. tax reform is going to impact us. Overall, we are pleased with the outcomes as the changes will give us a meaningfully lower ongoing tax rate.","In 2018, we expect our adjusted rate will be between 23% and 26%. At the midpoint, that's equivalent to about six points of year-on-year earnings growth. We also anticipate ongoing annual cash flow benefits from tax reform. That provides us flexibility to continue to allocate significant capital to shareholders, while we also fund increased capital spending and our restructuring program over the next few years.","Finally, I'll note that the one-time cash flow impact as a result of tax reform shouldn't be significant for us.","Now let's turn to cash flow and capital efficiency. Cash flow provided by operations was $2.9 billion in 2017 compared to $3.2 billion in 2016. The decline was in line with our expectations and driven by higher tax payments. We expect cash flow in 2018 will be similar to 2017's level.","In terms of balance sheet efficiency for 2017, we reduced primary working capital cash conversion cycle by six days and we also improved adjusted return on invested capital by 20 basis points.","On capital allocation, dividends and share repurchases totaled $2.3 billion, that's the seventh consecutive year we've returned at least $2 billion to shareholders. In 2018, we plan to repurchase $700 million to $900 million of Kimberly-Clark stock. In addition, we\u2019re increasing our dividend by 3.1%. That's our 46th consecutive annual increase in the dividend.","All together, we expect to allocate between $2.1 billion and $2.3 billion to dividends and share repurchases in 2018. That's equal to more than 5% of our current market capitalization.","So before I turn it over to Tom, let me summarize our results for the year. We increased earnings in a challenging environment, we delivered significant cost savings, reduced discretionary spending and managed our balance sheet well and we continue to allocate capital in shareholder-friendly ways.","Tom?","Thomas Falk","Thanks, Maria. Good morning, everyone. As Paul mentioned, I'll focus my comments on our new global restructuring initiative and on our ongoing FORCE cost savings program.","Let me start with FORCE. So I'm encouraged with the progress that we've made on FORCE over the last several years. Our investment back in 2015 to create a global supply chain organization that was tightly linked to our businesses is paying off.","We have more capability, we have more process discipline and we've got more visibility into our future opportunities. And most importantly, we are generating more savings, including the record performance that Maria just mentioned in 2017.","So looking ahead, our FORCE pipeline is healthy and we expect significant savings to continue going forward. And as a sign of that confidence, we are establishing a multiyear commitment to this program, which is to save more than 1.5 billion over the next four years. And those savings are on top of the benefits that we expect from our new restructuring initiative, which I'll talk about now.","So as many of you know and if you followed us for a while, you know that we have a long track record of announcing and executing strategic changes that have made us a much stronger company over time.","These actions and the execution of our ongoing strategies have generated significant shareholder value. And we've adapted appropriately to the challenging environments that we've encountered over the years.","And so today's announcement of our 2018 Global Restructuring Program is just the latest example of our proactive and strategic approach to managing Kimberly-Clark so that we can win in the marketplace and create long-term shareholder value.","Toward taking these actions to accelerate our return to delivering on our long-term top and bottom line growth objectives over time. We remain very optimistic about our long-term future. We've got a terrific portfolio of brands, we have leading technologies and we've got strong capabilities in our major countries around the world. And many of the categories we participate in have significant growth potential, particularly in developing and emerging markets.","So this restructuring program is the biggest program we have undertaken since we launched our Global Business Plan back in 2003. And this program will make our company leaner, stronger and faster.","We expect the restructuring to generate cost savings of $500 million to $550 million by the end of 2021. And that means over this time period, we will have generated more than $2 billion in total savings from FORCE and the restructuring program to help us drive sales, to handle commodity cost increases and currency changes and to improve our margins.","So these savings will allow us to do the following things: First, we'll be able to invest more to drive our top line growth, and those investments will be focused on strengthening and growing our core businesses, accelerating our personal care growth opportunities in developing and emerging markets and further building our digital and e-commerce capabilities. Mike can give you or will give you a little more color on those growth priorities when he talkies about our 2018 outlook.","And second, we'll be able to compete more effectively in an environment that has become more challenging over the last two years. A key priority for us is to maintain or improve our market share positions, particularly in key markets and businesses, investing more behind our brands will help us improve our share trends over time.","And third, we'll be in an even better position to improve our margins. Even in slow-growth conditions, we know we need to grow our profit and earnings to deliver attractive shareholder returns.","So in terms of how we'll achieve the restructuring savings, we'll streamline and simplify our overhead organization and our manufacturing supply chain. We'll also better take advantage of scale opportunities and technology. We'll continue to use our locally driven operating model, including having profit and loss accountability reside with local teams.","At the same time, we will shift more routine work and transactional activities to regional shared-service centers. And all our functions will drive more process discipline, which will help us with efficiency and sharing of best practices.","So these changes will lower our overhead spending and make us even more competitive with industry benchmarks. From a supply chain standpoint, this program will require us to close or sell about 10 manufacturing facilities and capacity at several other locations will be expanded to improve scale and cost of those facilities.","Workforce reductions in conjunction with the restructuring are expected to be in the range of 5,000 to 5,500 employees. These are difficult but necessary actions to make the Kimberly-Clark an even stronger company going forward. We also expect to exit or divest some lower-margin businesses that are equal to about 1% of company sales, and those divestitures will be concentrated in the consumer tissue segment.","To implement the restructuring, we expect total cash spending of $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion by the end of 2020. And that consists of $900 million to $1 billion in pre-tax charges and approximately $600 million to $700 million of incremental capital spending.","Because of the restructuring and other long-term investments that we've got planned, we expect our total capital spending in 2018 and 2019 will be somewhat higher than our long term target of 4.5% to 5.5% of net sales. When we get to 2020, we expect spending to return more in range of our long-term target.","We'll continue to allocate capital in shareholder-friendly ways as we execute the restructuring. And we expect to continue to increase our dividend and repurchase meaningful amounts of our stock, including in 2018, as Maria just noted.","So to summarize, we're taking aggressive action to accelerate our return to delivering our Global Business Plan objectives over time. We'll generate substantial savings over the next several years to provide more flexibility to invest and improve our margins. And we will significantly improve our company for the long term.","Now let me turn it over to Mike.","Michael Hsu","Okay, thanks, Tom. Good morning, everyone.","Let me start by expressing my enthusiasm and optimism about our long-term future. We are bullish about our categories and the Global Restructuring Program will help us operate more effectively and efficiently.","Now let me turn to our 2018 outlook. In terms of market conditions, we expect 2018 will be pretty similar to 2017. We're assuming the category growth rates were only slightly better than this past year, and we expect competitive activity will remain elevated. And we're planning for another year of commodity cost inflation.","However, we expect to deliver better results in 2018, and we'll also invest more in our brands to ensure our long-term success. On the top line, we're targeting organic sales growth of about 1%. That's similar to our expectation for overall market growth. Taking into account currency rates and last year's acquisition of our JV in India, total net sales in 2018 should grow 1% or 2%.","Now let me spend a few minutes talking about our three growth priorities that Tom just mentioned. The first priority is to strengthen and grow our core businesses. In North American consumer products, we expect better performance in 2018.","We have a strong innovation lineup that launches in every major business. Near-term activity will include upgrades on Huggies diapers and baby wipes, Pull-Ups training pants, Depend and Poise in adult care and new Kleenex wet wipes.","We would make targeted brand investments to support these innovations and to ensure we are more competitive in the marketplace. At the same time, our teams will be improving efficiencies by reducing spending on less productive items, such as non-work and media.","The second priority is to accelerate our personal care growth in D&E markets. Overall, we'll build on the progress we've made in 2017 in our key growth markets.","In Latin America, we'll launch a number of innovations in diapers, feminine care and adult care. Category demand in Brazil and Argentina has stabilized, and we\u2019re cautiously optimistic that conditions will improve modestly this year.","In Eastern Europe, we have good momentum on Huggies and Kotex and that includes our business in Russia, we will leverage innovations and strengthen our commercial programs.","In China, our fem care team will continue to focus on winning young category entrants with their on-trend premium. In diapers, important innovations will phase in throughout the year, starting late in the first quarter.","The third priority is to further build out our digital and e-commerce capabilities. We are already well-positioned and making good progress in e-commerce. Online sales in 2017 were a high single-digit percentage of company sales and increased more than 30% year-on-year. We expect to make more progress in 2018.","We will also continue to improve our relationships with consumers through our direct digital marketing programs. We are investing in tools to help improve the speed, cost and effectiveness of our programming.","Moving beyond sales, our plan is to grow adjusted operating profit by 2% to 5% in 2018. At the midpoint of our guidance, that implies margin improvement of about 40 basis points.","Cost savings will continue to be an important driver of our performance. Our teams are targeting to deliver approximately 400 million in FORCE savings and 50 million to 70 million from the restructuring. Those savings will help us offset cost inflation, which we anticipate will be between 300 million and 400 million. More than half of that inflation is projected to come in international market.","At this point, we are planning for wide spread selling price increases because of commodity inflation. That said, we have taken or expected to take selective increases in some of our businesses. That includes in KCP and in our consumer businesses in the DNA market.","On the bottom line, we're targeting adjusted earnings per share of 6.90 to 7.20, that's growth of approximately 11% to 16% year-on-year and includes the tax rate benefit that Maria described.","In terms of our earnings profile in 2018, we expect earnings will be higher in the second half of the year compared to the first half, and that primarily reflects phasing of cost savings and benefits from growth initiatives and, secondarily, some expected moderation of commodity costs in the second half.","So to summarize our outlook, we're optimistic about our long-term future. We\u2019re planning for a better year in 2018, and we\u2019re taking important steps to make Kimberly-Clark stronger to enhance long-term shareholder value.","That wraps up our prepared remarks, and now we'll begin to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ali Dibadj with Bernstein.","Ali Dibadj","I want to start with a similar question I actually asked on the P&G call just now, around the increasing difference between commodity costs going up and the inability to take prices up to offset that. I've kind of rarely seen things just coming from a price realization perspective. And I'm trying to understand kind of what's driving that.","We certainly have our views and would love you know, how much of it is retailers' fighting, how much of it is competition slow growth environment, how much is consumer just saying, these categories are relatively commoditized. And really I want to understand it because to see if you see that lack of pricing power really changing going forward or is this kind of a new reality? That's the first question. ","Thomas Falk","That's a good big-picture question, I'll give you my take and I\u2019ll maybe have Mike can pile on. I mean a couple of things. Prices are also set on expectations. So as we look at what's going on in the pulp market, it's quite frankly surpassed our expectations on how quick it's gone up and why it is even at this level.","And if you look at some of the forecast that says it should moderate later in the year a bit. And so you also want to be a little careful that you don't spend too much energy trying to take price in a particular category than the commodity falls off and you've got to give it back and then some. And so there is a bit of that where commodities are running ahead of expectations. And our expectation is for that to moderate a bit over time. So that's part of it.","I think the other point you raised, particularly in developed markets, is that with relatively low or negative category growth, it's tough. You've got the same number of competitors chasing a tougher volume target.","Having said that, there's also a lot of different ways you can get pricing in the categories. In our 2018 guidance, there's some more positive news on price. At least we are projecting it's not going to be negative as it was in 2017.","And so whether that's getting more efficient on trade or getting more efficient on some of the other between the lines, between growth and net sales, that's another way to try to get some revenue in those businesses. But Mike, maybe you want to see what else you want to add to that?","Michael Hsu","Yes, Ali, I've worked at other companies and in commoditized categories, and we are very far from being in any commoditized categories. I think we've got a long runway of growth, both in developed markets and developing and emerging markets.","And one of the reasons for that is there's still lot of opportunity for us to innovate. And you know, to think about the experience of our products, these - the product experiences are pretty good today, but they are not perfect. And I put on the Depend Underwear every once in a while, and I think it's a great product, I think there is still room for us to achieve perfection.","And so our focus is, hey, we are not going to be undersold, so we are going to be competitive on promotion, that's what you saw in the back half in North America. And we just want to be competitive there. But the way we are going to grow and the way we are going to drive value in these categories and what our retailer partners want us to do is to create innovation and bring marketing to and expand the category.","Ali Dibadj","I like the piece - so maybe I should try that depends on in and do my further research\u2026","Thomas Falk","We had fun group got here at Kimberly-Clark, Ali, so I think Mike dose that with his office store closed, the equipment.","Ali Dibadj","Look, helpful context. If you take that and you then say, okay, we are now doing an incremental cost saving plan, which is great, right? I mean you guys have shown that you can do that, FORCE looks like it has legged yet. But why do you think or how do you think reinvesting a lot of that back will actually drive the long-term growth trajectory, right?","So you talk about innovation for sure, but it sounds like you haven't been doing innovation so far over the past several years. So you're spending a lot more back and I'm struggling to get this confidence in ROI that you seem to have as opposed to just saying, gosh, three to five long term isn't achievable, let's think about a different mix of cost cutting and reinvestment pack. So really that are aligned with you're going to do from a cost-saving perspective reinvestment?","Thomas Falk","That's fair. I'll start and let Mike pile on again as well. I mean, I\u2019d say, certainly in 2017, we had some factors like the birthrate in the U.S. and Korea being more negative than expected that you can't encourage moms to use more diapers in a developed markets where the babies aren't being born in those markets.","So on the other hand, there's still huge category penetration opportunities in most of our markets around the world and Mike can talk about that a bit more. And we also have some markets in Latin America where the economic conditions were tough in the beginning of 2017.","We see that turning and being more positive in 2018. And as you look at the kind of years we had in Eastern Europe and other places, we still see strong category growth opportunities across our space. And we do believe that there's more opportunity there than maybe we put on the board in 2017. But Mike, maybe you can add something about it. ","Michael Hsu","Ali, I fully believe we'll get back to our long-term growth goals. And in the global restructuring plans to fuel we're going to need to help us get there and support both investments and the brands and also the margin improvement that we need to drive our business.","I do believe the current slowdown is cyclical and some of it is microeconomic or political, social. And some of it is competitive. And again if you think through some of the competitive dynamics, there's not a real good reason of why that's occurring. And so I think we've been in these situations as I studied our history and been in and out of them before. And I think we'll cycle through that and get back to focusing on the things that drive the business, which I already mentioned.","But I think the real important thing is the takeaways, our investments are going to focus in the three areas that Tom and I mentioned as our growth plans, which is one, to strengthen and grow our core. I think there's a lot of room to bring value-added innovation into these categories.","We've got a lot of runway left in developing and emerging markets. And to use the baseball analogy, I think we're in the very early innings of that game or very early stages of what global development.","And then lastly, I think e-commerce and digital and data really given us a transformative opportunity to change the relationship with our customers and consumers and become much more efficient and create long-lasting relationships. ","Ali Dibadj","And just the last question I had is, along the lines of increased penetration and macro kind of combining those two. Can you just give us an update on China, what you're seeing there, and also Brazil from a share, volume price perspective? Thanks a lot.","Thomas Falk","Yes. China is still a dynamic market, and we're going to continue to focus on high-impact innovation and capture the strong growth potential that's there. It remains our single-largest growth platform, both in the near term and long term. And obviously, yes, Ali, as you can see and probably heard our competitors see the opportunity and plan aggressively and hard there too.","So price has been a major factor, and I think the price situation in 2017 has stabilized, albeit at a lower level. I think our team has done a phenomenal job with our cost programs and our margins have never been higher even at this lower-price level. But I do think the long term driver of growth in China continues to be not price, but it is innovation and product quality and product innovations.","And so we are expecting a better year of fem care and China has a winning formula, even growing strong double-digits last year, and we're expecting that to continue. They got a great brand positioning.","And then in baby and child care, we were up low single digit in volume for the year and about even on sales, but we're very excited about the innovation we're going to be bringing. We're not ready to talk about it yet, but that's going to be coming throughout the year phasing in late in the first quarter. That's really about improved protection, comfort fit in the premium tiers.","Operator","Our next question comes from Stephen Powers with the Deutsche Bank.","Stephen Powers","So looking forward I guess building a bit on Ali's question on price. Just given the intense competitive backdrop that you've called out, I mean, do you see any prospects of pricing relief without detriment to volumes in 2018 if your input cost outlook doesn't prove conservative enough, or is that a likely risk to the implied margin outlook in guidance?","Thomas Falk","Mike can build on this, so embedded in our guidance is some improvement in the pricing environment. We've got some markets like Argentina, where there\u2019s pretty big price increases that we are taking in 2017 that will carry over. And then there are other\u2019s we expect to get some trade efficiency. I don't know that there will be that much list price change, but our teams have got plans to regenerate revenue in other ways in 2018, but maybe Mike you can give a little bit more color on that.","Michael Hsu","As Tom mentioned, we have some selective price increases in some businesses. And then we are assuming perhaps a perhaps a bit of a normalization in pricing in some of our key markets.","I will tell you the reason why 2018 is going to be better though is because of a stronger innovation pipeline that we're bringing. We've got a lot of innovation that we\u2019re bringing out, particularly in the U.S., China and Brazil, in Latin America, and we\u2019re investing more in our brands with harder hitting messaging and advertising.","Stephen Powers","But, I mean, like appreciating that innovation pipeline and understanding the direction of external forecast, I just I guess I'm just really test the logic of guiding commodities below spot prices at the midpoint of your guidance and not allowing for at least a wider range that contemplates upside risk input costs.","And I guess what I'm trying to get at is if that upside risk to input cost does manifest, do you think given the competitive backdrop, there's actually pricing relief, or is that a likely risk to margins?","Thomas Falk","Well, we'd say, when you look at the range of commodity inflation that we've seen last year that we are forecasting for 2018, I've seen much big sharper cycles in commodity cost. And typically, if you have sharp swings in commodities, you will get some list prices change, and so we're not afraid of that. I think it's just that in this environment, given the swing that we've seen and what we expect, that's probably not going to move the needle on list price much in most places.","Stephen Powers","And just one last question, different tact. On the new restructuring program, the cash costs to achieve seem high just relative to past programs and relative to the projected savings. And the 5,000-plus in workforce reductions seem potentially disruptive. So just trying to get underneath how you're assessing the aggregate kind of financial execution risks of this program relative to past initiatives that you've undertaken? Is there more uncertainty associated with this program, or do you view it as comparable to past programs? ","Maria Henry","Yes, I\u2019ll comment on the cash cost. This program includes a number of activities that are on the more expensive and restructuring. And I'll give you two examples. One is when you are shutting down facilities and factories, there are costs associated with moving equipment and doing the shutdown. So when restructuring tend to include plant shutdown, they tend to run on the more expensive and on the cost side.","The other thing is we are moving to a global business services platform for our more transactional and standard work. And when you do that, when you think about it, we are removing a role that is in country, so we are paying the full severance on that position that we are taking out, and we are hiring that role in a different location in our shared services center.","And we are probably only picking up labor arbitrage and some productivities that you're paying the full load on the cost, on the severance side and you're not getting 100% of that same amount back on the benefit.","So those are two of the factors that are involved in our restructuring that tends to weight the cost on the higher end of our restructuring program. What I can tell you though is that as we look at the programs across our supply chain and also across our overhead structure, they have very strong, strong returns and will position us well for the future.","Stephen Powers","One last clean up on the restructuring program. The 10 facilities that you expect to close or potentially sell, is there in the benefits of the program, is there any forecast to gain associated with the sales in those assets? I guess that's a question for you, Maria, just to clarify.","Maria Henry","No, it is not.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jason English with Goldman Sachs.","Jason English","I'll try to keep mine to two quick questions. First, the commentary on pricing, your expectation for sort of normalization of pricing in some markets I think is the word you used, and of course the guidance for improved pricing in next year, albeit just kind of back to sort of a neutral posture, it does kind of contrast the kind of trajectory we've been seeing throughout the year.","Is there any evidence of competitors kind of moving in this direction as you wrapped up last year as we come into this year? In other words, is there anything you can give us that you are seeing is tangible market that makes expectation feel a little more credible?","Thomas Falk","Yes, Jason, I think maybe the better word I should have chosen is stabilization versus normalization, because I think normalization implies return to some level. But I would say right now, we are assuming that it's dropped to a level, will stay there.","I think maybe the dynamic and maybe I'll talk a little more about North America is you know, I do think, we said in June of last year that, hey, we're competitive and achieve competitive levels of spending on promotion because we felt like we were getting beaten in the marketplace in the beginning of last year.","And I think the team has executed and strengthened their promotion plans and fine tuned them. And so in the third quarter, we improved some performance. In the fourth quarter, particularly in family care, did not get the takeaway.","But I do think in some degrees we are going to have to continue to fine-tune. And so we don't want to drive overall down in the categories. We do want to focus on our innovations and bring in our value added. And so we are looking for the market to, maybe a better word, stabilize. ","Jason English","And then a bigger picture question, sorry a bit more long when they exist or not exit quite concisely. I want to go to get to market growth. And Michael, I think you talk to your section by saying you're bullish in your categories long term. But if we think about the environment we are in, your GDP growth globally, pretty solid, a little choppy here and there, but all in all pretty solid, income growth pretty solid, and we've got inflation in the system the use of sort of flattering to revenue growth. And all that yields a whopping 1% sort of global category growth, I think, is the figure you gave out, which frankly isn't very growth.","So how do we sort of where we are at today with 1% with your comments sort of bullish long-term? What do you think is holding us back? Where do you think the growth is? And if you can give me more color in terms of the diverging growth trajectories between your Personal Care and professional tissue, I think that would be helpful. Thank you.","Thomas Falk","Yes. I think, what we need to do is, one, we\u2019ve got a major market in North America and we got to get that back to the growth path. And I think we feel better about our prospects for this year. I think the team has got very strong plans both, as I mentioned, on the innovation front in all major categories in bath tissue, Kleenex, diapers, Pull-Ups and adult care.","And so we feel very strong about the innovation. I think we will improve versus our decline last year and so that's probably the first step. And I was personally involved in the North America business for a number of years and fundamentally believe that, that\u2019s a market that we could grow. And so that's probably the first step.","And then in our developing and emerging markets, we've had a couple of either competitive situations or micro economics situations in key markets. I think in Latin America, we grew mid-single digits last year, and we were expecting an improved performance this year. And I think we're modestly perhaps saying that the economic conditions are going to modestly improve and so we're excited and looking forward to that.","And then in China, I think, we've been in - it's a big market for us and then been a bit of a competitive situation. And again, I think in our earlier remarks we said, I think that situation has stabilized, we have some great product innovation coming that we think will get us back on a faster-growth trajectory in diapers. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.","Lauren Lieberman","I wanted to talk a little bit about Consumer Tissue, that's on the business that\u2019s getting a lot of air time these days, but it's still very big and considerably moves the needle. So first, if you can just talk a little bit about North America, right? We've had pretty sustained negative trend in organic sales growth this year. A lot of it driven by volume more so than pricing.","And then also in the - with the restructuring, you talk about some low margin exit. So a little bit about where those exits are coming from, dynamics in North America tissue and thought process and plans around improving that, that performance in particular. Thanks.","Thomas Falk","So maybe Lauren, I'll start with the exit part, because we\u2019re not going to be able to tell you very much about that right now until we get farther into it, won\u2019t be able to share those details appropriately with the effected business. But again it's less than 1% of our sales, so it's not going to be a big deal either way. Then maybe Mike can comment on North America and some of the dynamics that are going on there. ","Michael Hsu","Lauren, I think the competitive market conditions in North America tissue, I think we expect that to remain, but we are expecting improved performance behind our innovation, differentiated product news and stronger advertising. Q4 volume and price were both down about 2% which drove a net sales decline of 4%.","And what I will say is what I was telling Jason earlier, have we improved the competitiveness of our promotion programs, and if you recall in our previous quarter, in the third quarter, I think, our volume in consumer tissue was up 5.","And so in the fourth quarter, we were disappointed because I think what we had about the same kind of merchandising and achieved merchandising our consumer takeaway was lower than we expected. We do expect 2018 to be better. We're going to remain competitive on promotion, but, of course, stay balanced there.","But the big difference is we've got a lot of product news and probably the most that I've had since I've been here at K-C. In bath tissue, we've got great news on Cottonelle, we're not ready to share exactly what that is yet, but I will tell you it's going to lead their category superiority for us in bath. It's got, extra soft, which is also a big business for us, we're bringing making it softer and thicker and that's important for helping us differentiate versus other brand and private label.","And then our retailers are very excited about the innovation we\u2019re bringing to extend and expand occasions for Kleenex, which is an iconic brand and with our wet wipes launch. So we've got a lot of great products.","And then I think the other thing that affected the fourth quarter is we were not as strong on our advertising as we need to be, and I think the team has realized that and learned that. They've got very good hard-hitting advertising coming this year to support these launches and we're excited about that.","Lauren Lieberman","And then with regard to private-label activity I guess, both in tissue and in diapers, there's certainly a lot of talk out there in terms of private label having more impact, consumers being more open to it. Can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing in your business, what you're seeing in terms of pricing pressure just coming from retailers giving more attention to their own private labels, or that's not something that's really been terribly on your radar screen as an incremental challenge of late? ","Michael Hsu","Yes, I guess, Lauren, I'd say yes and no, I think it depends, on which category. But in general, I'd say in our personal care categories, if you look over the longer term, I think in our key categories, private label penetration has been down over the last five years. But we have had some increases and some spot increases from year-to-year.","And in this year, we're probably seeing a little more private-label growth in tissue, and that's a big reason why we\u2019re very focused on differentiation and advertising, because that's the only way for us to drive the long-term health programs.","Lauren Lieberman","And then just a final question, and you had mentioned digitally-only commerce and data and so on as being one of the key priorities going forward and where you're going to reinvest. My understanding is that you were a bit of a leader, a bit very much of a leader in terms of e-commerce penetration in China and it's been everyone else need to kind of catch up where you were, but the reverse was the case in the U.S.","So could you talk a little bit about where you are today versus where you were at the start of 2017 on your e-commerce penetration in the U.S., your relative market share positions online versus offline? And anything concrete and planned for 2018?","Thomas Falk","Yes, so we\u2019re strong leaders in China and Korea. They're both major e-commerce markets for us. And in the U.S., I would say we got off to a slow start years ago but we've been catching up fast. I think we've had three straight years of share growth online in the U.S.","And I think, overall, across all categories, I think we have about a fair share for our position. What we've had very strong double-digit growth, while I don't know how to actually describe it, but its strong double-digit growth. And we\u2019re excited about it.","And the reason why it's so important for us, Lauren, I think why it's uniquely important for our categories, we are in very high involvement categories that are frequently used and our consumers are in these categories for years or in some cases, many, many years.","And so it pays to have an effective long-term relationship with our consumers. And I think with the advances in what's happening with data analytics, online access and advertising and then with e commerce, we've got an opportunity to really kind of change the model and make it much more efficient for us, our retail partners and our consumers.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo.","Bonnie Herzog","Just had a quick follow-on question on private label. I'm wondering if you guys have plans to expand your private-label manufacturing footprint? I think you guys have mentioned in the past that it accounts for less than 5% of the overall sales. So just curious if you have any plans to increase that?","Thomas Falk","No, private label is still less than 5% of our overall sales and really didn't move the needle significantly in the quarter.","Bonnie Herzog","And no plans going forward to step that up, just given some of developments we've seen with private label in some of your categories and some of your comments?","Thomas Falk","We are primarily a branded manufacturer and we do a limited amount of private label to specific customers where we think it advantages our overall relationship with them, but we are not out trying to sell private label to everybody up and down the street.","Bonnie Herzog","And I just wanted to move over to China and your business there. Just hoping you guys could drill down a little further on again your diaper business in the market and highlight some of the key changes that you've seen following Procter's launch in the summer. And then going forward, other than innovation that you touched on, what other levers do you plan on pulling to really stabilize your business there?","Thomas Falk","Yes, I think I'd say, overall, I don't think our business was impacted significantly by the Procter launch overall. Obviously, you can talk to them about how they felt that went in the product.","But we feel very good about our product line up. I think we did lose some share in diapers this year. But we see it primarily impacted by local players who have guided an increase in online brands that have gained some trial. And I don't know how long that trial is going to stick and how well the repeat is going, because we don't have data on that, but they are getting some trial and that has impacted our business a little bit.","Our focus is on making the best product out there and we are very confident that we've got great products out there and we are going to have better products coming out throughout this year.","Operator","The next question comes from Olivia Tong with Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch.","Olivia Tong","First, just some clarity on your outlook, particularly on the cadence, how many moving parts there are. Can you give a little bit more granularity on the margins as you model out, do you expect margins to actually be down in the first half and then up in the second half?","And then just for clarity I think you said that EPS is better in second half versus the first half. Do you mean in absolute earnings or in growth because typically you do deliver more earnings in the second half versus the first half. Thanks.","Thomas Falk","Yes, so we probably aren't going to give you quarterly margin profile. I'd just say 40 basis points for the year is the right way that we think about it and manage the business. And then on the second half versus first half, we'd say absolute profitability or the size of the earnings per share will be larger in the second half than the first half and we weren't referring to the earnings growth rate per se.","Olivia Tong","And then secondly, just my question is about Amazon as entering more and more of your largest categories with their own brands before. Now you've got Presto!, Mama Bear. Before that there was Kirkland and before that many others. So we know this isn't the first time you've had a retailer relationship where you've had to wear different hats, but it certainly seems a little bit different this time around. So perhaps, you can talk a little bit about, how you approached it differently this time around versus previous instances?","Thomas Falk","I mean, Olivia, we haven't confirmed that we are making Mama Bear, so we really don't talk about any private-label relationships and we do some with a few customers. And then those are kind of private conversations with those customers and we don't talk about their business and we let them talk about it.","And so I would say that pretty much every retailer we sell to does private label, and so there is that inherent discussion as to what they are trying to do with their brand and their overall category strategy, and then how do we fit with our brands and what we can bring from an innovation standpoint. And that's the challenge that our customer teams have every day is just putting together a strategic plan with our key accounts that drive the business over the next two or three years.","Olivia Tong","Just to clarify, I meant more that Amazon\u2019s obviously a retailer, but also they're selling your product but also you\u2019re competing with them in terms of product as well. So just wanted to clarify that.","Thomas Falk","Like every other retailer we do business with, I mean, I think everybody has private label on the shelf in some form. And so we've got to bring news and ideas and innovation that drive the business with them and then that makes them excited about it.","Olivia Tong","And then just lastly, the CapEx increase for this year, how much of that is related to the new restructuring program as opposed to potentially a bit of a build back of some of the things you may have had originally planned for 2017, but then got shelved as things got a bit more challenging as the year progressed?","Thomas Falk","I mean, I would say that all of it is related to the restructuring program, and Maria maybe you want to comment further on that.","Maria Henry","Yes, I think we gave an incremental CapEx number related to the restructuring program, and clearly a portion of that will get spent in 2018. The other comment that I would make is that on the restructuring program itself, we started that last year, earlier in the year. And a lot of work and effort went into to looking at the opportunities that we have across our supply chain as well as in our overheads.","And so as our teams were working on the supply chain portion of that restructuring, we've had to imagine they were delaying some of the CapEx that they would have spent in 2017 until we had a total view of how the actions we were going to take to optimize our overall footprint. So I would imagine there's also some catch-up there on projects that got delayed from 2017 as our teams were working on the restructuring. ","Operator","The next question comes from Ali Dibadj with Bernstein. ","Ali Dibadj","So I wanted to drill a little bit further on private label, and I understand cagey is the wrong word, but the caution you have in terms of talking about it. I mean it's certainly...","Thomas Falk","I'm not cagey, Ali, I have been pretty transparent that I\u2019m not going to talk about this.","Ali Dibadj","That\u2019s just the wrong word, the wrong word, but you're trying to manage the relationship with these retailers as well. So I get that can\u2019t give too much detail about it. But generally preponderance of evidence is that you're experimenting with Amazon. You might be doing something probably with Walmart, although I don't know for sure on that one. As you work with the retailers on private label and 5% sounds small, but most of that\u2019s probably in the U.S. so almost double that, right, for percentage of your sales?","Thomas Falk","It's less than 5%. And I think you would be way high on your estimate of how big it might be.","Ali Dibadj","So it's not 5%. Okay. So look, either way as you are kind of doing it feels like more and more and although small and we start somewhere, can you talk a little bit about the impact on margins for you generally for the retailer? You mentioned when you were answering one of the questions that you do it only when you feel like you have a - it helps the relationship. Can you talk about what that looks like in terms of helping the relationship? Just some more context about private label and your interaction with the retailers would be great.","Thomas Falk","Yes, I think I can give you just a little bit of general color and maybe Mike might want to build on that. I think I've been around the business relationships with private-label customers for a long time, and we haven't done a lot of it ever, but we have done it with a few strategic people.","And it is for retailers that are serious about their private label; it is a pretty intimate relationship. It's their brand; it's their name on the package. They are involved in what goes in. They want to test the product. They care a lot about the materials and how you make it. And so we've got to put dedicated people working on the business that shows the retail partner that we care about their brand and their business as much as they do.","And if the retailer's willing to partner like that, it can be a good profitable relationship for both parties. If it's a business that is going to get auctioned every quarter and the low bidder gets the business, that's not kind of a relationship that we\u2019re ever going to be looking for. So I don't know, Mike, if there's anything that you want to add to that. ","Michael Hsu","Well, Ali, I think the only two things I would add is, yes, it's a small piece of our business, it's not strategic because it's not going to be a growth driver for us mostly because we\u2019re capacity-constrained. And so we don't have the capacity to give to a lot of private-label out there.","I will say, as Tom mentioned, we do a small amount. And may the reason why we do a good job at it is because we care about it for our customers and we want to have a good relationship and just like everything we do, we care about what we do, we want to bring good quality work to what we do.","And so we got a few selected relationships out there and actually with the different sets of customers. But again, it's not a primary where you're - significant growth driver for us going forward.","Ali Dibadj","And where does the shelf space typically come from when they push private-label further? And do they tell you about, look, we want private label to be this big of the category?","Thomas Falk","Yes. So retailers typically are working with their category captains and category challengers to talk about where the shelf is going to go. And I would say most retailers in a brick-and-mortar world typically over - and this is true across most formats. So over allocate space to private label relative to share and they typically often give preferred shelf space to private label.","And so the brands know that they are fighting for their spot in the shelf as well. You got to justify with innovation. And when you do category line reviews, you've got to justify why you need that real estate and what it's going to do for the retailer when you get it.","Operator","Our next question comes from Wendy Nicholson with Citi Research.","Wendy Nicholson","I'm just wondering. First of all, I just heard your comment say you're capacity-constrained in that sort of feature decision process on private-label manufacturing, but with regard to the 10 facilities that you're not sure you're not going to shut as part of the restructuring, first of all, how much of that is in the U. S. versus outside?","Thomas Falk","Yes, I guess, a couple of things. I didn't say we are capacity constrained, I think someone was asking me about going to be building facilities to make private-label, which I said that's probably not where we're headed.","And then secondly, just because of where we are in the announcement phase and also the consultation phase with various works consults and unions and other things, we really can't give you any more color at this point where the 10 facilities are. But I would say that the combination of the 10 affects every region.","Wendy Nicholson","Because I guess one concern I have just first blush is some of the private-label manufacturers in your categories that we've talked to, their growth is actually being held back it sounds like because they don't have the capacity particularly in North America. So there's part of me that's worried that if you sell those plants to those players, it sort of might give oxygen to some of the private-label manufacturers who are going to be competing against you? Is that crazy logic on my part?","Thomas Falk","I would say you're barking at the wrong tree there. I think most of the plants will be closed versus being sold.","Wendy Nicholson","And then my second question, just going back to kind of high-level, sounds like you don't want to back away from the 3% to 5% long-term revenue target. So I assume the restructuring program is sized to enable you to meet that target. But my question is, you also commented at one point how much margin expansion you've seen, and it's true over the last four, five years your EBIT margins have gone up much more than your peers, the ones we cover anyway.","And so wondering, is the restructuring program designed to fuel that growth, I get it, but do you really think margins can expand? I heard your guidance for 2018, but longer term, is this restructuring program enough to fuel faster top line growth and long-term margin expansion? Or is there a risk actually that your current margins reflect some over earning and that you kind of have to reinvest more and so maybe margins stay flat. Does that make sense?","Thomas Falk","That's a complicated calculus when that we are speculating. We think so I think is the answer. And so we feel like the restructuring program will give us a more efficient, more effective way to run the business. We are at kind of cyclical peak in the commodity cycle and that may well swing the other way at some point over the intervening years.","And so while we are not counting on that, that we also realize we've had higher commodity costs both last year and projected for 2018 than we had in the previous several years. And so we will see. Basically, our view is that it is and that we do believe we have the possibility to get our business growing at that level and this is the right plan to get us moving in that direction.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jonathan Feeney with Consumer Edge Research.","Jonathan Feeney","Just one question. I wanted to ask about the genesis of and the planning around for long-term standpoint major restructuring like this. I mean in restructuring inside your company broadly. You're talking about, you identified 10 plants, you talked about 13% headcount. How much of this specifically would you say were costs you could have addressed if you had the management bandwidth and whatever, and maybe should have two or three years ago, but you can only do so much in a certain period of time?","And how much of this, roughly speaking, are redundancies that are the results of real technological changes or marketplace changes in the past couple of years? I'm just trying to understand the timing of all this and whether you\u2019re going to digging deeper into things you\u2019d prefer not to have to do, and how much of it is like, no, really things are changing really, really quickly and maybe we could expect more of this sort of thing in the years ahead? Thanks very much.","Thomas Falk","That's a great question, Jonathan. I'll let Maria kind of expand a little bit on our process. I will tell you I think I had investor once tell me that he thought every CPG company restructure every five years. And I think your point would be, gosh, it would be great if we could avoid adding the cost in the first place so we didn't have to restructure it.","But we've probably historically proven that we're not capable of that. On the other hand, I think this restructuring program was an excellent piece of work by our team and Maria and Mike, and I help lead it. But Maria, why don't you comment a little bit on the process and how we got here.","Maria Henry","Yes, what I'd say, I'd start by pointing back to a few years ago. Actually, if you think about it, we hired a global supply chain leader coming up on three years. And she put a team in place and that team has been doing a lot of work over the last couple of years to assess and identify opportunities and you've seen a lot of their work along with our global teams in the mills delivered through the FORCE cost savings. But as they've done that foundational work leading into 2017, I think it gave us a good footprint on the overhead side of the house.","We did a lot of work with both our IT teams and finance teams to get our information lined up in a consistent way so that we could understand better and have better visibility into our SG&A spend. And that work started, I'd say, a couple of years ago. So in 2017, we were in a really good position from the actions we had taken to go ahead and launch a very comprehensive process to look at our cost structure.","We used a consulting firm to help us upfront to get the program structured and just set up governance, to provide expensive benchmarks for us. But it was our teams though that did the work. And there were several hundred people involved in this process.","The program isn't an across-the-board reduction plan; it's not a textbook BBB approach. We actually went function-by-function to look at the work that we're doing, where we're doing that work in order to identify opportunities to do things differently. Really we had a lens to say how can we run our business fundamentally on a lower-cost structure.","And so on the SG&A side, we took a whiteboard approach and classified our activities into what's baseline, what do you need to do to keep the business running versus what are differentiated activities. We then went hard at looking for ways to reduce the spend on the table stakes types of activities and free up that money to invest in more differentiated capabilities and activities.","And then on the supply chain side, I would say what we do with the restructuring is really accelerate the work that our global supply chain teams were doing on the network optimization because we wanted to get a comprehensive view of our opportunities globally. That enabled us to then identify the programs that have the best returns, take advantage of our global scale and prioritize our investments.","And at the same time all of these cost work was going on, Mike and his operating team were taking a fresh assessment on our markets, our category growth rate, our competitive position, our innovation pipeline, and I'll let Mike talk about that more in a minute.","But the combination of all of that work together, the extensive work on the G&A side, the comprehensive view of our global supply chain, and also an affirmation of our belief in the long-term growth algorithm from the growth work the teams have done are really coming together in the restructuring program that we have announced as well as our commitment on the FORCE target as well as our 2018 guidance on our longer-term outlook.","Michael Hsu","Yes, we went through maybe a concurrent process to, hey, what is strategically where we\u2019re going to get our growth from and how do we best position ourselves to achieve that growth, and that includes restarting, we\u2019re accelerating our growth in North America, a lot of the work that we talk about with the NE and also by leveraging technology, both this digital and e-commerce technology, but also our own product-making technologies and how do we drive that more effectively.","And so kind of we went through a process and worked on where we want to place our bets. And at the same time, I think, we also said what kind of company do we want to be and how do we want to evolve our organization. And I think the words that kind of came out over and over again we are smarter and faster.","And as Maria mentioned, we means we want to be low cost, smarter means we want to leverage our scale more effectively and faster means we are an agile organization, we are locally empowered, we could do better by simplifying some of the work that\u2019s done locally. So I think we\u2019re very excited about development in this program and looking forward to the returns.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan.","Andrea Teixeira","Just on the pulp estimate, and I appreciate your pricing commentary, but we before we go into pulp, I understand where you're saying in the U.S. will be more mix rather than pricing for innovation. So just to on a comparable basis, you are not taking prices in the U.S. correct?","Thomas Falk","In terms of list price at this point in time, again, we don't talk a lot about forecasting, but I don't think there will be major list price changes. That doesn't mean that there won't be opportunities with trade or promoted price points or things like that, that could be a factor.","Andrea Teixeira","Yes, and then following up - sorry, go ahead.","Thomas Falk","No, just saying Andrea that we like to be more efficient with our trades, and we still think we have a lot of opportunity to get better at that. And that goes into the proverbial work that we use is just fine tuning. ","Andrea Teixeira","I understand that, that makes sense. On the pulp side though, from what I understand, the pulp spot prices are closer to 1,200. And I get it that obviously throughout the year, it may change, right? But now you are saying on average, you are looking at 1,050 I think to 1,100 as you put it in the guidance.","So you're saying, even though the beginning of the year will be - so you're expecting to go down to an average of that number, I\u2019m expecting that you believe you will be below thousand at the end. So if you can help me kind of like break down that estimate? So as the cadence of the year for pulp. Is there any indication that you are seeing that the back end of the year will be below thousand?","Paul Alexander","Andrea, this is Paul. So just to level set everyone. Our outlook on pulp is solely based on what the industry forecasters tell us. So I don't think we are calling it any different than what you'd see if you ask when see about their outlook for 2018.","And in terms of the cadence, I think the forecast would show some slight moderation starting late Q1 and then into the back half of the year. But I don't believe that there is any one time period that's supposed to be below $1000 a ton.","Andrea Teixeira","And the same for oil, I'm assuming, right? For oil, you're kind of using external, external\u2026","Thomas Falk","Yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from Iain Simpson with Societe Generale.","Iain Simpson","A couple of questions for me, please. Firstly, it's very encouraging to see mid-single-digit growth in China and thanks for the extra color. Just on diaper, what's the birthrates in China doing now? And could you comment a little bit on what percentage of diaper in China is online for both you and the market?","And second, I know you've had a few questions on it already, but pretty much everywhere in the world consumer tissue is sorry consumer tissue is a commodity category. The U.S. is pretty unique in that respect. So looking about pricing in U.S. consumer tissue, even with input costs doing what they are doing, is this structural? And what gives you confidence that what we're seeing in just U.S. consumer tissue becoming a commodity like it is everywhere else in the world? Many thanks.","Thomas Falk","Yes, just on China, I'd say, first, we saw about 18 million verse this year was the estimate, and I think that\u2019s driven pretty good double-digit growth in the category overall. Again, I think we underperformed the category on that cell just based on some of the competitive dynamics. But we do expect to improve that trajectory over time.","The second part of your question was online and where we are. I think we believe we are the leaders in e-commerce in China. We've got great relationships with all the major e-commerce players and great capability. Over 50% of our business is currently sold online.","Michael Hsu","We are probably over-indexed relative to the category a bit.","Thomas Falk","Yes.","Michael Hsu","And then your last question, maybe I'll debate a bit. I mean, I would say, I don't think consumer tissue is a commodity category and we have terrific brands in specific markets. There are tougher category trading conditions in some places, I will not dispute that.","But I look at our Hendricks brand in the U. K. where we've got a strong little 30 share, very high brand loyalty, decent profit margins and good, good opportunities to innovate around that space.","We've got in specific markets in Latin America where we got very strong branded positions as well and other specific markets like in Korea and others in Australia. And so sometimes tougher from a margin standpoint, but I may be biased, I probably am, but I think it's a long way from a commodity category.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies.","Kevin Grundy","Thanks for squeezing me in and I appreciate it. My question relates to your appetite for M&A. So you've obviously been less active on this front and tend to discuss it less than a number of companies in the CPG space, particularly those that are struggling to find growth. So we talked a lot about the difficult environment, we can appreciate that, but does this lend itself at all perhaps to greater openness for M&A in order to diversify away from some of these categories and given the strong cash flows of the business, albeit with slowing top line growth?","So a number of questions around that, how actively are you looking at assets? Is that any more less than recent history? Would you need to build out your business development capabilities? What categories, geographies may be interest, et cetera. So any commentary there would be helpful. Thank you.","Thomas Falk","Yes, sure. I would say our view hasn't changed. We've typically felt like we had enough organic growth opportunity in the portfolio and that was the right thing for us to chase, that was the best opportunity to create long-term shareholder value.","So I've been around long enough that we've done a bunch of M&A, we built most of our Latin American business through M& A in the '90s and early 2000s. There aren't that many of those kinds of opportunities left in the world that are things that we know a lot about that would be highly likely to be able to be integrated and create shareholder value.","Having said that, we picked up small opportunities. We bought the other half of our business in India late last year from our partner. We bought the other half of our business in Israel a couple of years ago from our partner. So there are some of those types of those opportunities that are small and make sense. But in our core space of things that we think we know how to do, we just haven't seen a lot that's out there that we think is shareholder value creating.","Kevin Grundy","And fair to say doesn't seem like it's a big priority. I can appreciate the view that you don't want to overpay and go into categories where you don't have a lot of background or expertise or scale, et cetera, but it doesn't seem like it's a big priority to build out capabilities, personnel and otherwise to explore higher-growth categories and the ones you're participating in. Is that fair?","Thomas Falk","That's correct. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Priya Ohri-Gupta with Barclays.","Priya Ohri-Gupta","Just a quick one on housekeeping. Could you just tell us the split of the charges associated with restructuring plan that are going to be cash versus non-cash this year? And then secondly, how should we think about on your plans to fund some of the added cash fund needs that you have over the next couple of years, particularly given the portion that\u2019s expected to be incurred this year? Thank you.","Maria Henry","Sure. For 2018 of the charges, a little more than half of them will be cash charges for this year.","Thomas Falk","And then in terms of funding it, maybe you\u2019d also comment on cash flow expectations and so forth.","Maria Henry","Sure. In terms of cash flow for next year, I commented that we expect cash from operations to be similar to 2017. Included in there, we've got the cash that we will spend on to fund the restructuring. On the tax line, we get the cash flow benefit of tax reform.","And as you know, with the restructuring charge that we take, there are also cash tax benefits that we'll have in 2018 that net us out to similar operating cash flow for 2018. Beyond that, we did give the higher expectation for capital spending. And so we would expect that we would take on some additional debt as we get into 2018 to fund the higher CapEx.","Priya Ohri-Gupta","And in terms of the higher debt, should we anticipate that being through CP related, or something more longer term? Thank you.","Maria Henry","Yes. We do have plan to make more use of CP. That will give us the benefit of the very low rate that we\u2019re getting on that. And we've got a lot of capacity on the CP front.","Operator","Our next question comes from Iain Simpson with Societe Generale.","Iain Simpson","Just on your M&A comments, you highlighted that pretty much all of the acquisitions that you've done recently were buying out minorities. Could you just remind us what businesses with minorities you kind of have? And is there any comment you could make as to anything we should bear in mind on that? I mean the obvious one is Mexico but I just wondered if there were any we should be aware of. Thank you.","Thomas Falk","In Mexico, we're the minority, we own 48% of that one and the other 52% is a publicly traded company, so that won\u2019t be a little bit more complicated. Other than that, there is a very, very small minority shareholder interest in Central America.","I think it's less than 5% of the operations and it's a family that seems pretty happy with that investment. And we've got a minority partner in Korea that owns 30% of the Korean business, and I think that\u2019s about it in terms of what's left out there.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan.","Andrea Teixeira","I just want to - back into Maria's explanation about the financial expenses and layer into your guidance. As you take on more debt, I\u2019m assuming you're assuming a much lower rate for, as you were saying. I just want because you are taking more debt, but you are guiding for 20% lower financial expenses. Is that something related to hedging, or anything that we may not be aware that would bridge the gap?","Maria Henry","Sure. We've done a lot of work to lower the tax - the interest expense for the company. In 2017, we took out, as they came due, some or I should say replaced some high coupon bonds with much lower interest expense vehicle.","For example, this summer, we took on $500 million of euro debt that's priced below 1%, as an example. And also as we closed out this year and with tax reform expected to come, we took out a very high coupon bond that was going to originally be due in November of 2018.","So we took that out in December to pay the arbitrage on the tax rate and get benefits there. So the actions we took in 2017 and have been taking to replace high coupon debt with low interest vehicles and then the early retirement of the November bond is what's driving the lower interest expense for 2018.","Thomas Falk","And then maybe just to add, we expect to maintain the A rating and so the debt increases are fairly modest relative to historical standards for us.","Andrea Teixeira","So the average interest expense or the average interest rate is how much, if you can share against the 2017 average?","Maria Henry","Yes. It is down. I don't think we share the specific.","Thomas Falk","We probably should say in a couple of weeks and you can do the math in the footnote.","Operator","At this time we have no other questioners in the queue.","Paul Alexander","All right, Bob. We thank everyone for your questions and we will conclude with a comment from Tom.","Thomas Falk","Once again a lot of news for Kimberly-Clark. We are expecting another better year in 2018. We've got an aggressive plan to go execute and we appreciate your support. So thank you very much for your time with us today.","Paul Alexander","Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes this morning's presentation. You may disconnect your phone lines.

Alexander","Thanks, David, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Kimberly-Clark's Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. With us today are Tom Falk, Chairman and CEO; Mark Buthman, Senior VP and CFO; and Mike Azbell, Vice President and Controller.","Here's the agenda for our call. Mark will begin with a review of third quarter results and our full year outlook. Tom will follow Mark and focus his comments mostly on the strategic changes we're making in Europe. After that, we'll finish with Q&A.","As usual, we have a presentation of today's materials in the Investor Section of our website.","Let me remind everyone that we will be making forward-looking statements today. There can be no assurance that future events will occur as anticipated or that our results will be as estimated. Please see the Risk Factors section of our latest Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of forward-looking statements.","I'd also like to point out that we will be referring to adjusted results and outlook today, both of which exclude certain items described in this morning's news release. The news release has further information on these adjustments and reconciliations to comparable GAAP financial measures.","Now I'll turn it over to Mark.","Mark A. Buthman","Thanks, Paul, and good morning. Let's start with the headlines. First, we delivered organic sales growth of 3%, highlighted by 9% growth in K-C International. Second, we significantly improved adjusted gross and operating margins, with both reaching 2.5-year highs. And third, we're raising our outlook for 2012 adjusted earnings per share for the second consecutive quarter.","Now let's cover the details of the quarter.","Third quarter sales were $5.2 billion, down 3% versus last year. Underlying organic sales rose 3%, driven by increased volumes of 2% and higher net selling prices of 1%. Unfavorable currency rates were a 5% drag on our top line, and lost sales in conjunction with our pulp and tissue restructuring further reduced sales by 1%.","Third quarter adjusted gross margin was 34.2%, up 290 basis points from last year. The increase was driven by organic sales growth, $85 million of FORCE cost savings and benefits from input cost deflation.","Moving down the P&L. Adjusted operating profit rose 8%, with an operating margin of 15.5%. That's up 140 basis points compared to the prior year. The growth in operating profit came despite a pretty significant currency headwind and continued investment between the lines. That includes a $25 million step up in strategic marketing investment and higher administrative and research spending to build capabilities and support future growth, particularly in K-C International.","The third quarter adjusted effective tax rate was 31.8%, toward the high end of our full year target of 30% to 32%. Compared to last year, the third quarter rate reduced it -- reduced adjusted earnings per share by $0.05. All in all, third quarter adjusted earnings per share were $1.34, up 6% versus last year.","Cash provided by operations in the third quarter was strong at $844 million. That's up from $750 million last year despite higher pension contributions.","Speaking of pension, let me comment briefly on the move we're making to reduce the size and potential future volatility of our U.S. pension obligation. This month, we offered about 10,000 former employees a one-time option to receive a lump sum distribution of their pension benefit. The benefit obligation associated with this offer is about $570 million. That's 15% of our total U.S. pension obligation. The payments will be funded from our pension plan assets and will occur by the end of the year. Depending on the amount of participants who choose this option, it could trigger a one-time, non-cash settlement charge in the fourth quarter. If that happens, we expect to exclude it from our adjusted earnings per share. Further details about this action are included in this morning's news release.","Now I'll highlight a few areas from our segment results for the quarter. In Personal Care, organic sales rose 6%, with volumes up 4% and net selling prices advancing 2%. K-C International had another quarter of strong volume growth, with high-single to low double-digit growth in each major region. Our key growth initiatives continue to perform very well. In fact, in the diaper category, China volumes grew about 45%, and volumes in Brazil and Russia were each up approximately 15%.","Elsewhere, our Personal Care volumes were up high-single digits in Europe. In North America, although volumes were down low-single digits, market shares were up or even with year-ago levels in every category, except baby wipes. Third quarter Personal Care operating margins of 18.1% rose 150 basis points, driven by organic sales growth, cost savings and input cost deflation.","Moving to Consumer Tissue, organic sales were up more than 1%, driven by higher volumes. Overall, net selling prices were flat as gains in K-C International were offset by higher promotional spending in developed markets. Consumer Tissue operating margins continue to be up year-on-year, with 150-basis-point improvement in the third quarter.","Turning to K-C Professional & Other, organic sales and volumes were even with year-ago levels. Organic volumes were up in K-C International and in the washroom category in North America. On the other hand, volumes were down in southern Europe and in our safety business. Operating margins of 17.5% were up 280 basis points, driven by cost savings and input cost deflation.","And lastly, Health Care organic sales and volumes were down 1%. Volumes in both surgical and infection prevention and medical devices were off slightly compared to strong year-ago performance. Operating margins of 14.9% were up 110 basis points, driven by lower input cost.","Now let me shift to our full year outlook. We expect to continue our momentum for the first 9 months of the year. We'll stay focused on our targeted growth initiatives, investing behind innovation and brand building, cost reduction and continue to allocate our capital in shareholder-friendly ways. On the top line, through 9 months, we're at nearly 5% organic net sales growth, so we're right on track with our full year target range of 4% to 5%.","Our FORCE program continues to perform very well. With $215 million of savings in the bank year-to-date, we're tracking to exceed our full year target of at least $250 million of savings.","In terms of commodity costs, our outlook has improved slightly. We now expect deflation of $100 million to $150 million for the year. As a reminder, our previous plan was for deflation to be $0.00 to $100 million for the full year.","So adding it all up, we're now targeting 2012 adjusted earnings per share in a range of $5.15 to $5.25. As a reminder, our previous guidance was $5.05 to $5.20 per share. We're pleased with the performance of the business, and we continue to invest for our long-term success.","So that wraps up my comments. To recap, we achieved solid organic sales growth led by K-C International. We delivered significantly higher margins with healthy levels and cost savings, and we've increased our full year outlook for adjusted earnings per share.","Now I'll turn it over to Tom.","Thomas J. Falk","Thanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Since Mark has reviewed our third quarter results and our full year outlook, I'll just add that I continue to be encouraged by the progress that we're making this year. We're delivering against our growth initiatives. We're reducing our costs aggressively, and we're reinvesting for the future, all while generating strong cash flow and returning significant amounts of cash to our shareholders. So while the environment remains challenging, our plan is working.","Now let me turn to the changes that we're making in Europe. These actions will allow us to better focus on our strongest market positions and growth opportunities, will improve our underlying profitability in Europe and now enable more sustainable returns going forward for us in this part of the world. And just to be clear, these changes only impact our Western and Central European business. Our Consumer business in Eastern Europe is managed as part of our K-C International team and will not be affected by the changes that we announced today.","We will be exiting the open diaper category in Western and Central Europe, with the exception of the Italian market. We'll also be divesting or exiting some other low-margin or slower-growing businesses in certain markets, and most of these are in the Consumer Tissue segment. These businesses have not been able to meet our growth or return targets and, unlike the rest of our European businesses, they've not been earning their cost of capital.","Now most of you that have followed us for a while, have been investors for a while, know that we've been in the European diaper market for more than 20 years, and we have made a number of attempts to find a winning business model there. So despite all these efforts, we have not been able to deliver sustainable, profitable growth or earned acceptable returns on capital. In fact, even with some relative progress this year, we're still operating this business at basically break-even levels. So after we've completed a comprehensive review of our business and our strategy, we've concluded that we can create more shareholder value by getting out of this business rather than by continuing to try to turn it around.","Now our diaper business in Italy generates solid cash flow and acceptable gross margins. So staying in Italy will maximize the efficiency of some of our assets that are shared with our child care operations there and enable our scale as we go to market in Italy.","Beyond our moves in the diaper market, we're not in a position today to identify what specific markets or products we'll be divesting or exiting, and we're in the process of communicating with our employees and our customers, and we want to get that behind us first.","To win our cost structure with these moves, we'll streamline our manufacturing footprint and our administrative organization in Europe, and this will include the sale or closure of 5 manufacturing facilities and the transfer of some production to other facilities to improve our productivity. Total workforce reductions are expected to be in the range of 1,300 to 1,500 positions.","Restructuring costs for these changes will be incurred through 2014 and are expected to total about $250 million to $350 million after tax. The businesses affected by today's announcement generate annual net sales of about $500 million and a very modest operating profit. About 75% of the sales are in Personal Care, and most of the rest are in Consumer Tissue.","We'll be moving quickly to implement these changes. More than half the charges are expected to be occurred in the fourth quarter of 2012, and the lost sales associated with these moves will commence beginning in the first quarter of 2013.","We expect the European market to remain challenging going forward, so our teams there will continue to focus on improving our profitability and generating solid cash flow and returns on capital. At the same time, we'll be placing more focus on our strongest branded positions, particularly in the U.K., Italy, Spain and Switzerland. We'll also be investing in those areas where we can deliver profitable growth, like our Child Care business, our Baby Wipes business, our moist bathroom tissue and facial tissue businesses.","And I would like to recognize the accomplishments of our European team this year. They are on track to achieve their full year plan in what we all recognize as an extremely challenging environment in Europe. And I'm confident that they will execute these changes that we're talking about today with excellence. Today's changes are another example of our financial discipline and the portfolio management approach that we use to run our company every day.","So to summarize, we're encouraged by our continued strong execution this year. We're optimistic that the strategic changes we're making will further improve our portfolio, and we're convinced that our global business plan will continue to deliver shareholder value.","That wraps up our prepared remarks, and now we'll begin to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Gail Glazerman with UBS.","Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just, I guess, sticking on Europe for a moment. Can you just give a little bit of color on what your remaining sales will be in Western and Central Europe? And any sort of color on initial conversations with customers that will continue to buy other products?","Thomas J. Falk","Yes. I mean, our total consumer business in Europe is a little over $2 billion, and so this will bring it down by about $500 million. We also have, obviously, a Health Care business and the K-C Professional business as well, so our total sales in Europe are over $3 billion. And from a customer standpoint, those contacts are underway as we speak. And so it'd be premature to give any additional color on that at this point.","Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And switching gears a little bit, I guess, feminine care volumes in the U.S. and North America were a little bit weaker in the quarter. I'm just wondering if you can offer some color there?","Thomas J. Falk","Yes. I think fem care -- a couple of things going on. I mean, first of all, our overall share is relatively stable sequentially, and so we're not seeing a lot of movement there. And we are seeing -- there was a lot of promotional activity in July and August. That probably hurt our Kotex Natural Balance business. Our U by Kotex line continued to do very well in the quarter. But other than that, I'd say there was a little bit more promotion in July and August. It abated a bit in September, and so hopefully, it'll be a little more stable in the fourth quarter.","Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay, and K-C Professional. I realize there is the tissue impact, but volumes seem like they were a bit weaker than they've been trending. Was there anything kind of incremental going on there?","Thomas J. Falk","Yes, a couple of things. In North America in particular, our washroom business was fine. It was up about 3%. The areas that were probably hit hardest were things that more -- closely associated with manufacturing like safety and wipers. Part of that may be distributor inventory destocking near the end of the quarter, because it seem like things slowed down a little bit in the end of September. It could also be a little bit of softness in manufacturing, so that was part of it. Europe was a little light in KCP. Part of that was the comps last year. They were up 6% or 7% last year in the third quarter, so they had a little tougher comp. And I also think that if you talk to those guys anecdotally, yes, Germany is slowing down just a little bit. The U.K. is slowing down a little bit, so you saw some of that. Other than that, I would say, though, the rest of that business was pretty much on track.","Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And I guess, just broadly speaking, when you look around the world, you're still posting, for instance, 45% growth in China. If you're looking at kind of a same-store sales-type basis, the markets that you've been in, were there any changes there? And any incremental changes in consumer behavior I guess, in either Western Europe or North America?","Thomas J. Falk","No. I would say it felt like there wasn't a big shift. I don't think anything got hugely better sequentially. And so -- I was in China not long ago, and we're still doing well in established markets. And I'd say the category is still probably growing mid-single digits, mid- to high-single digits, so that might be a same-store sales equivalent. We're getting growth because we're participating in a broader part of the category, moving from the premium to the mid-tier and building that out. We're also expanding our distribution into more cities. And so we've really got 3 growth drivers in our China business; the category itself, and greater penetration, participating in a broader range of the category and then driving our distribution into more cities. And I was in Europe not long ago as well, and I saw some of the same things. I mean, despite all the headlines that you read, I mean, people need diapers and bathroom tissue and facial tissue every day, and so you aren't seeing big trends in consumer behavior there. I think the U.S. is much the same where we've had good innovation. Mom is still willing to pay more for a better product. If you've got the same product as somebody else, there's a little bit more price competition in the market maybe than there was a quarter ago. But that's maybe the only subtle shift that you've seen.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Ferrara with Merrill Lynch.","Christopher Ferrara - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just wondering if you could give a little more detail on the European exit, right? So it sounds like, using your percentages, that the cash costs of the exit are somewhere like $125 million to $220 million. Can you give a little more color on the returns on that spend? Right? Because -- what might be the opportunity to drive a more efficient structure, right, on the European business in general in that exit, right? Because the cash costs again -- I mean, just trying to understand what the benefit is over time or even in the near term.","Thomas J. Falk","Yes, Chris. I think about this maybe more as a divestiture where we're not getting a lot of proceeds. And actually, we have to pay some severance to -- which is most of the cash costs of the charge. And really, part of it is as we're shutting this $500 million in sales, we got to shut all of the overhead that goes with it. So our team over there has gone through all the back office processes to say, \"Look, we've got to streamline and exit all of that.\" And this was roughly 20%, 25% of our sales in Europe, and so you've got to shed 25% of your back office costs. For those of you who have gone through that, that's not an easy thing to do. And so the team has come up with a plan to do that and actually improve our margins in Europe going forward by exiting these businesses. But it's not a classic restructuring where you'd spend this money and you get these cost savings that you might have seen in other areas.","Christopher Ferrara - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Right. So does that mean that this is a cost drag in the near term? Because your point -- I mean, it's hard to eliminate stranded overhead that quickly. And then also, what do you bake in as prospects to getting cash on some of these, your ability to sell these plants and facilities? I mean, is anything baked into your assumptions right now? And how do you assess the probability of being able to get some real proceeds on this stuff?","Thomas J. Falk","If you look at the range built into the restructuring charge, that -- the variable and the range is really the range of proceeds that might be available. And so the -- you look at the diaper business, which isn't profitable at this point, there's not a lot of EBITDA there to get a multiple on. So we may have some facilities that we'll look to sell, and we'll get some proceeds from some of the activity. But I don't think it's going to be a huge driver of value creation.","Christopher Ferrara - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And then, I guess, just following up on that, I mean, what pushed you over the top to make the exit as opposed to just milk the business? I mean, did you guys expect a continued deterioration? Or was milking it not an option really in these competitive categories?","Thomas J. Falk","Well, we brought in a new management team in Europe late last year, and we challenged them to go pull together a plan that will help us be successful in Europe and that all options are on the table. And rather than give us an incremental change that restructures it one more time and makes it a little better then 2 or 3 years later, we're going to go back at it again, we just fundamentally had to ask ourselves is -- we've been in the diaper business 20 years. We really haven't been successful yet. How much more can we do? And do we have a chance to win here, or can we free up some resources to really win in some of the other good businesses we have in Europe and maybe even free up some resources to invest more aggressively in emerging markets? And it really -- it came down to that call, is do you want to spend more, chasing the European diaper opportunity? Or do you want to go harder in China, Brazil, Russia, Eastern Europe? And I think the team made us a strong recommendation, and we're going forward to make it happen.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Can we just stay in the diaper stuff in Europe for a sec?","Thomas J. Falk","Sure.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So would you be willing to license the Huggies brand to a third party? Or would you just be selling assets if it was a divestiture?","Thomas J. Falk","I think that we'll look at what those alternatives are when we go into a sale process. I think the thing that will be a little tricky is, given that we're still in eastern Europe and we're still in Turkey and we're still in a lot of the other adjacent geographies, still in Italy, that that gets a little more challenging to manage inside the EU. But we'll take a look at that when we get into the sale process.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Got you. And what if someone said, \"We'd want the wipes business, too.\" Is that a non-starter?","Thomas J. Falk","The wipes business has been a phenomenal growth for us. And so -- and we've got good margins in that business. And so we do believe that that's an opportunity for us to continue to drive and grow. And so we still believe in the businesses that we're in in Europe. Our Child Care business, our DryNites business, our Baby Wipes business are doing phenomenally well, very profitable with good margins. And those are core businesses for us.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Got you. And how about fem care? Because it wasn't really mentioned in the prepared comments.","Thomas J. Falk","Yes, we don't have much of a fem care business in Europe today, so there's really no change in the status of that.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then just moving to a different topic, should we be concerned about acrylic acid prices and super absorbers, given what's happened in Japan with the fire at the factory?","Thomas J. Falk","We haven't seen that yet. Obviously, everybody's watching that. But we've -- we're not affected, and the Nippon Shokubai wasn't our supplier. We're starting to watch that very carefully, but it hasn't spiked in the marketplace. Obviously you've seen some weakness in commodities lately, generally, that's maybe helped. But that's something that we'll have to see how that plays out.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, great. And then one last one, I guess, for Mark. If you look at your payout ratio and your dividends and also on the share repurchase activity, can you guys still fund that with your U.S. cash flow?","Mark A. Buthman","Yes, well, Bill, I think the answer is we're generating more cash outside the U.S. than we need to grow as fast as we are. So we've got to continue to repatriate. And you've seen our -- some pressure on our effective tax rate, and part of that is driven by the costs of bringing that money back to the U.S. So we need to repatriate to continue to fund -- to some amount to continue to fund dividends and share repurchases.","Thomas J. Falk","Yes. And we routinely repatriate somewhere in the $500 million to $1 billion level every year and have been for a while.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Does that impact your thinking on the payout ratio? I mean, trying to take it higher just because, obviously, there's an EPS impact with the tax rate?","Mark A. Buthman","Our dividend payout ratio is about where we targeted it to be. So it's not a specific goal we have, but we want to be a strong dividend payer, top-tier dividend payer in the CPG space. We're -- that's a place where we're at, and I'd expect us to continue to be there. I wouldn't expect over time to increase the payout ratio significantly.","Operator","Our next question comes from Alice Longley with Buckingham Research.","Alice  Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","My question is about price mix in the U.S. in Consumer Tissue. It was, I think, negative 1%. It had been 5% to 6% in the first half of the year. Could you give us a sense of where that is going in the fourth quarter maybe into 2013, given that raw material cost pressures aren't so onerous anymore?","Thomas J. Falk","Yes. We saw -- we've annualized all of the price increases and de-sheeting effect that would have driven positive price in the last several quarters. And we saw a little bit of price softening in the third quarter, predominantly in the premium bath segment around our Cottonelle business, and it was really responding to competitive pricing levels in the marketplace. So -- but it's hard to tell at this stage whether that's retailer-led or manufacturer-led, but it's more just trying to make sure we're -- we had to spend a bit back to be competitive on shelf. I would say that's probably likely to continue in the fourth quarter based on what we've seen in promotional plans that are in place. And obviously, pulp prices just went up a tick, but they're still down year-on-year. And so we're in a kind of an equilibrium point where you're not seeing huge swings in pulp either way that's going to drive pricing to a great extent, I think.","Alice  Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","What about pricing in Personal Care? What should -- what do you think that will look like going ahead? Is that -- it was 2% in this quarter. Does it stay at 2%? Or does that slow as well?","Thomas J. Falk","Most of the pricing in Personal Care was really taken in overseas markets in response to big currency swings. So places like Brazil where we had the big currency shifts, you had more price being generated. So I think I'd look for the big -- where you have big currency swings, you're likely to have some price offset in either direction. And so I'd say that's probably the best way to measure that.","Alice  Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","No, I understand that. I'm talking about North America Personal Care. North America price was 2%.","Thomas J. Falk","Yes. I think we pretty much annualize all the price changes in North America as well. So I wouldn't look for a lot of price movement in the fourth quarter. [indiscernible]...","Alice  Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","So that might be 0 in the fourth quarter?","Thomas J. Falk","Well, it really is when the pricing went in, like midway through the fourth quarter last year. So we may get a little bit of benefit but not much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ali Dibadj with Sanford Bernstein.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","So a couple of things on the European changes. One is, when we -- you talked about this before, or this option before. We used to hear things like, \"Look, it's too integrated; they're too many dis-synergies,\" but it doesn't read that way. So is there anything that had changed leading up to this that sent you [ph] to this conclusion about, look, there just aren't that many dis-synergies in breaking this up, number one. And number two, on Europe still, is given the cash charges -- it's one of my favorite topics. What should we expect from a change in buybacks or dividends going forward, given what you're going to have to do and given the earlier question about where your cash is actually generated?","Thomas J. Falk","I guess a couple of things. It is difficult to unbolt a business, and it is very difficult to shed the overhead that goes along with it. And so that's not a trivial exercise, and the team has spent a fair amount of time being very thoughtful on how you do that and still run the business. And so it's an aggressive move, and I give all the credit to the European team for working hard to come up with an aggressive plan that, we think, works. And so I think that it's -- we've changed the leadership team as we talk, came in with a fresh perspective and challenged a lot of previous assumptions and came up with a way that we think will work for us and then give us a chance to be successful in Europe. On the cash question, we've got plenty of cash. And actually, particularly as it's generated internationally, it gets collected in an in-house bank in Europe, and we've got the ability to use those funds in Europe to fund those. So it won't have any significant impact on our stock buybacks or dividend payments going forward. So this is relatively a couple of hundred million dollars on a company with $3 billion in cash flow. It's not going to wiggle it much.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay, cool. But now on commodities, the number, the new number is generally much better than expected. It doesn't all flow to the bottom line, obviously, and of course there's some volume deleverage that's there in some of the categories, some of the businesses. But to try and understand how much of the reinvestment, in some sense, you have to make, is volume delevered versus pricing investments versus marketing investments, versus other types of things, and kind of what's that gap? If you can help us quantify, that might be helpful.","Thomas J. Falk","Yes. Maybe, if you think about our overall plan for the year, Ali, and where we're better or worse, you'd say we're certainly better on commodities but we're worse on currency. And actually, if you look at it, we'd say it's $100 million to $150 million of commodity benefit, and we're probably going to have $75 million of translation hit on currency and probably nearly an equal amount of transactions. So commodities and currencies are going to kind of wash relative to our original planning assumptions for the year. And so we're actually a little bit better on volume overall than our plan for the year. And so most of that's in K-C International. We're spending marketing at about the rate -- maybe even slightly ahead of what we thought. And where we really have over-delivered is on our cost savings number. We've taken that guidance up a couple of times and have had good performance on cost savings this year. And that's -- a little bit more volume and much better cost savings is why we're -- been able to raise our guidance twice this year and are going to outperform our plan for the year.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. And then last question is just Personal Care sustainability. Clearly, that's been doing really well, especially driven by international. Have you seen any relief in the North American market? The numbers you're reporting don't suggest that, but are you seeing any interesting signs about growth rates, number one? And then number two, China in particular, you mentioned, is growing very well, and you kind of just aggregate it in terms of leaking buckets [ph]. But if you give us a sense of when you start lapping some of the distribution gains in China so we can kind of think about the transition going forward to a more normalized growth rate.","Thomas J. Falk","Yes. That's a fair comment. In the U.S. -- I mean, I think the -- our original plan for the birth rate in the U.S. was for it to be up slightly this year, more second half-driven. It looks like it's going to be probably flat. So it's negative in the first half, positive in the second half. We'd expect it to be slightly positive in 2013 based on that. But -- so if you look at the category on a units basis, we thought it was going to be down 1%. It's probably going to be down 2% for the year in the diaper category. If there was any bright spots for us in the third quarter, our Child Care business did quite well, driven by our GoodNites brand, which we've got a strong offer there. We also had some innovation with some new products that were launched into that market. It was also a hot, dry summer in the U.S., so we sold a lot of Little Swimmers. And so that helped our third quarter performance as well. But it also showed that mom is willing to spend a bit more for innovative, terrific products in that space. In China, we just keep adding cities and keep growing over there. So I don't think we can keep growing at 45% or 50%. But we've got an aggressive growth plan to -- if that business in total today is $400 million, it could be $1 billion by 2015. And so we do see significant growth still coming in that market.","Operator","Our next question comes from Wendy Nicholson with Citi Research.","Wendy Nicholson - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","My question goes back to Europe. And I guess the bigger-picture question, the new guy who's, I guess, maybe putting himself out of a job, was it contemplated that you should exit Western Europe in a bigger way, kind of like P&G did with the tissue towel business? Because just running the numbers quickly, if you take away the $500 million of revenues and no profit, the business, even still, is going to have, I think, a high-single-digit EBIT margin, which is better than it's been, but it still drags down the overall. So was there a contemplation that maybe there's a bigger action that should be contemplated?","Thomas J. Falk","Well, I guess the first thing I would tell you, Wendy, is that the guy is actually a girl. And so Kim Underhill has done a great job with her team in Europe, and she's not putting herself out of a job. She's actually going to take the $1.6 billion business that we have in Europe that we think will be a little bit better than the high-single-digit margins that you've delivered and put together a plan to grow those businesses and get it to the point where it is accretive to the company overall. And so we won't do that, and these restructuring actions will take a couple of years to go. And in places it takes a while to take capacity out in Europe. But that's certainly the vision, is to get Europe to be a contributing part of the company, with growth prospects and the opportunity to launch innovation and really run it like the rest of Kimberly-Clark long term. And that's what's exciting for the team over there.","Wendy Nicholson - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Can you talk about kind of what -- more specifically, what you see? Because in that tissue towel business, I've always thought that that, in and of itself, is a hard business to make a lot of money in given private label. Do you think innovation makes it different? Is it just your cost structure? Is it the fact that the Procter brands are gone? What makes Europe, from a consumer tissue perspective, so much more attractive today than it's been for a while?","Thomas J. Falk","Yes. I guess it's a couple things. First of all, it's launching innovation -- you're absolutely right that the bath tissue category is highly private label-penetrated and is not necessarily the place that we're going to win. We've got a great brand in Andrex. We're going to continue to maintain that and invest in it. It's more about how do we drive Kleenex facial tissue more aggressively in markets around there? How do we drive Moist? We've just launched Andrex Moist and relaunched that in Europe, in the U.K., with great success. So how do you start to build out with the great brands that we have into adjacencies that have got a better margin structure? We also see that in our Personal Care space. Are we going as hard with DryNites and Baby Wipes and Pull-Ups as we can? And in some ways, by being in the diaper business, that was constraining funds to invest in these other categories. We haven't put our best foot forward always. And so this frees us up to be able to invest more aggressively behind those growth opportunities that we do have in Europe.","Wendy Nicholson - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Got it. And then I just had a quick follow-up on China, the phenomenal growth that you're seeing there. Number one, can you give us kind of what category growth is? And I know your strategy, historically in China, has always been, I think, to compete kind of at the high end and be very selective about where you distribute in and what price points. Is that strategy still in place? Or is there a chance that, because you're getting so much bigger, you're going to go more down-market and compete at multiple price points?","Thomas J. Falk","Well, I mean, we're in the top 2 tiers. We've got all we can handle to drive that aggressively at this point in time. There are some very good companies that compete at the lower end and it's tougher to differentiate in that space. So we're going to go at the mid to top end of the market. We actually think the market is moving in that direction anyway as consumers are trading up in China. And so that -- we're on trend, and that's helping us as well.","Operator","Your next question comes from Caroline Levy with CLSA.","Caroline S. Levy - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, Research Division","The insight on China, that's very helpful. A couple of things. Are you able to give us an outline of -- in how many categories you gained share in the U.S.?","Thomas J. Falk","Yes. I mean, if you look at -- versus a year ago, I think we were up in all but Baby Wipes. Up or flat in all but Baby Wipes and maybe paper towels. Is that fair?","Paul J. Alexander","That's correct. And that's the same -- on a year-to-date basis actually, we're up or flat in 7 of 8 categories.","Caroline S. Levy - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, Research Division","Okay. And moving on to SG&A. I'm assuming your advertising marketing was up. That was the $25 million increase? Is that right?","Thomas J. Falk","Yes.","Paul J. Alexander","Yes.","Caroline S. Levy - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, Research Division","And what percentage increase is that?","Paul J. Alexander","Yes, we don't disclose that, but it's well above...","Thomas J. Falk","A little faster than sales, yes.","Paul J. Alexander","Well above the organic sales growth.","Thomas J. Falk","Yes.","Caroline S. Levy - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, Research Division","And you referenced some investment spending in the G&A line. Can you help us understand that a bit?","Thomas J. Falk","Yes. I mean, as we're growing in our emerging markets, building capability in those areas -- so we've opened research centers in Colombia and Korea, for example, where we've spent some money to get those up and going. And as we're building marketing capability and our teams around the world, we're having to add some resource. So as we go into China, for example, when you're growing at the rate that we're growing, we've just got to build some infrastructure to be able to support that. So that's part of the increase there.","Caroline S. Levy - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, Research Division","Okay. Do you -- are you able to give a sense of what the impact to EBIT and earnings was from currency?","Thomas J. Falk","Yes, I think we've disclosed some of that. Paul, do you want to give some of the details?","Paul J. Alexander","Yes. So on a translation standpoint, that should be in the news release. It was about a $25 million drag. And then if you also add in transaction impact, it's about an $0.08 drag on the quarter.","Caroline S. Levy - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, Research Division","And then the final one is if you could just run us through the puts and takes of the major commodity inputs as you see them now.","Thomas J. Falk","Yes. In the quarter -- I mean, the biggest swing was fiber, which was, what, $45 million positive? And that's across virgin fiber as well as recycled fiber, were both positive in the quarter. Our other material buckets were about $25 million positive, which is mostly polymer and super absorbent and things like that. And then we had some distribution expense, in part because of the high diesel cost in the summer that swung the other way, $10 million or $15 million.","Caroline S. Levy - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, Research Division","And your assumption for the balance of the year is sort of more of the same or even more favorability? Is -- when you say...","Thomas J. Falk","Yes. Going forward, I think the biggest shifts in our commodity cost assumptions was in pulp, which is probably about $20 a ton lower than what we would have had in our last guidance, and that accounts for most of it. Oil is tracking pretty much where we thought it would. Now obviously it has come down a little bit in the last few days, but we're expecting oil to be in the mid-$90s. And I think most of the commodities that we buy that are based on oil are kind of targeting that kind of a price.","Caroline S. Levy - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, Research Division","And the pulp price you assume then?","Thomas J. Falk","Pulp price, I think for northern soft was like $870 a ton, something like that.","Paul J. Alexander","Yes. That's the midpoint of our full year range. Yes.","Thomas J. Falk","Yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just was curious what percentage -- or to what degree the downtime you guys have taken every year has actually been in the European diaper business or even in the -- some of the tissue areas that you may be exiting.","Thomas J. Falk","I wouldn't say Europe was a disproportionate part of that. I mean, if anything, probably just because of the sheer size of the U.S. business, more of the downtime has happened in the U.S. Europe has had probably its fair share, but I wouldn't say it was a disproportionate part of it.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. So that's not a swing factor going forward in terms of how we think about downtime?","Thomas J. Falk","Actually, in the quarter, I don't think we've talked about this much, but downtime was actually a slight positive in the quarter, which we talked about last year. We took more of the downtime in the third and fourth quarters, and that continued a bit into the first and second quarters. Our inventories are pretty much tracking to where we need them to be, and so we're in a reasonable shape from an operating rate standpoint.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then just -- another question on sort of how you manage the brands going forward in Europe. So is -- are GoodNites and wipes really not marketed under the Huggies brand?","Thomas J. Falk","Well, I mean, the brand in Europe is actually DryNites, and the wipes is marketed under the Huggies brand name. And so we'll absolutely do that. In fact, it's probably -- you have to be around for awhile to remember this, but when we went into Europe, we actually launched Pull-Ups before we launched diapers so we could be a first mover in that market. And you have lots of wipes players in the market that aren't in the diaper category. J&J is there, Beiersdorf is there. So you've got -- there's other examples where you've got a consumer-recognizable brand that -- and a differentiated product, and we can be successful in that space. And I think, as many of us know, wipes are also used in lots of non-diapering households for various uses. So it's -- we just think it's an exciting category with a lot of growth opportunity for us.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And so sorry, just to be -- the Pull-Ups is also -- is under the Huggies brand, but it's...","Thomas J. Falk","There's probably a Huggies parentage on the packaging. I haven't looked at it in a little while, but I'd be surprised if there wasn't. But it's big Pull-Ups, little Huggies.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chip Dillon with Vertical Research.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","First is just a couple of questions about Europe. I remember -- I believe when Darwin pushed the company there, the U.K. was your first entry point. And then I think you bought Mon Bebe\u00b4 in Iberia and Linostar in Italy, and it looks like you're going to keep Linostar. And I was just wondering what has been different about that business than the other regions in Europe. And secondly, could you just verify, are Linostar's revenues somewhere in the, I guess, $100 million, $150 million range a year?","Thomas J. Falk","Yes, I don't think we've used that name in a long time, Chip. So it's a -- I think the Italian diaper market, we just think the margin structure is different. The retail trade structure is different. It's much less concentrated than other parts of Europe, and so it just makes more sense for us to go to market from that standpoint. But I think your sales are probably in the ballpark. I don't know, Paul, if you...","Paul J. Alexander","It might be a little bit high, but...","Thomas J. Falk","A little high, yes.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","Got you. Okay.","Thomas J. Falk","Yes. I think it's a -- the market in Italy is about $600 million, and we're...","Paul J. Alexander","We're at low teen share.","Thomas J. Falk","Low teen share. So...","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","Got you. Got you. And then of the 5 facilities that are going to be sold or divested, is -- I mean, I'm guessing -- we're obviously -- it looks like your tissue footprint really isn't changing that much over there. I'm going to guess, on the consumer side, 10% to 15%. And would that therefore mean this is just -- one of the facilities is actually a tissue mill?","Thomas J. Falk","I think there will be several tissue mills, as well as some personal care mills. And that -- obviously we're still in the process of notifying all the teams today, so we're not going to give more specifics than that at this point. But there could -- particularly associated with some of the market exits that we're talking about.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","Okay. And obviously, what you're not giving us -- I mean, obviously, you're -- there are some upfront cash costs, and I know people have asked about this, but are you -- I mean, are you just being conservative and not assuming a proceeds number for some of these divestitures? Or do you just don't think they're going to be material relative to the cost?","Thomas J. Falk","Yes. I'd say the proceeds that we expect are the real variable in driving the range that we've provided in the guidance. So there's some proceeds at the low end of the range and there's more proceeds at the high end of the range.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","Okay. Got you. And last question. As you look at the U.S. market for tissue, we're looking at like 7 or 8 restarts or new machines that are either ATMOS or TAD that -- some are private label. I mean -- sorry, some are away from home, and some are private label. And I just heard last week that the biggest guy out there, First Quality, is adding a third machine in South Carolina in '14, and I'm assuming that they must be getting some support from the retailers. And I'm just wondering if -- are you seeing any impact on your business from this increase in private label capacity?","Thomas J. Falk","Yes. I would say not so far, and there's also been capacity that's come out of the market that I think you know we've done some of it with the Everett facility coming out, as well as some of the work that we're doing at Chester. And there have been other closures by other players in the market. So at this point, you'd say, boy, for the year, in dry bath, I think private label shares are up slightly.\" But it's maybe like a point I think -- I think it's up -- it's up 2% and it's up 1% in towel. So it's something that we're watching, but I wouldn't say at this point that it's had a huge impact on the business.","Paul J. Alexander","Yes. And from our standpoint, Chip, our shares are about flat in all categories in tissue this year. So that share gain from private label is not coming out of us.","Operator","Our next question comes from Javier Escalante with Consumer Edge Research.","Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research, LLC","Listen. On 2 follow ups, one on North America tissue pricing and the other on Europe itself. On tissue, you talk about a more assertive or aggressive promotional calendar going into the fourth quarter. So at this point, how would you characterize the promotional environment, given that pulp prices are down in the low teens? Is it as aggressive as you would expect there? Or is it the behavior by cost industries and Procter? How would you characterize the promotional environment thus far?","Thomas J. Falk","I would say we have seen some hotter promotional price points in the third quarter and we've spent some to be competitive and to obviously protect share, which we were able to do. We -- it's difficult to tell whether that's retailer driven or manufacturer driven, and so we'll obviously watch that in the fourth quarter and see how that plays out.","Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research, LLC","With regards to Europe then, basically, could you help us understand the impact on the earnings progression in 2013? Because you're going to be taking charges in the fourth quarter, my understanding is that when this stuff is done, it's going to be $500 million in sales being lost. So to what extent the costs associated with these sales are going to be matching these sales, these foregone sales? So should I be worried that there's going to be a deleverage early on as we enter in fiscal '13? How -- if you can give us some preliminary thoughts about how this decision of exiting Europe is going to impact the earnings progression of next year.","Thomas J. Falk","Yes, that's a great question, and it's one the European team is intensely focused on right now, is to get the cost out quickly, to get them out in the fourth quarter so that as we go into 2013, we don't see a dip in our profitability in Europe. I wouldn't expect a lot of growth from our 2012 results but that we shed that $500 million in sales and hold our profitability in Europe. And so that's the goal and the plan. We'll obviously give you more color on that when we provide guidance in January.","Operator","Our next question comes from Connie Maneaty with BMO Capital Markets.","Constance Marie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Most of my questions have been answered, so I'll ask my usual on Venezuela. Could you tell us what the impact of a 50% devaluation would be, given the price declines in your categories?","Thomas J. Falk","Yes. You want to know the balance sheet number or the kind of ongoing business number?","Constance Marie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Both.","Thomas J. Falk","So the balance sheet number, I think, Mark, we've got, what, a couple of hundred million in the...","Mark A. Buthman","A couple hundred million dollars.","Thomas J. Falk","In the financial assets in current U.S. dollars. So you'd have about a $100 million hit if you had a 50% devaluation. And from an ongoing business standpoint, I think the correct answer is it really depends on what happens to pricing. If you have that kind of a deval and pricing controls stay in place at the levels that they're at, then I think that's a big problem for everybody. And so we'll have to wait and see. But for perspective, it's low single-digits percent of our sales and operating profit at this point. And so we'll have to see what happens as we get more clarity on what's going on down there.","Constance Marie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Is there any discussion with the authorities to get some pricing relief? Because it does them no good to have suppliers pull out of the market because they can't make money.","Thomas J. Falk","Yes. I think, obviously, given that the elections just happened down there, I don't think there was a lot of discussion leading up to that. They were kind of focused on other things and trying to figure out who was going to be in charge. And now that that's been decided, we'll have to see what happens. I think, clearly, the government understands what the impacts of their policy changes are, and they'll have to work with the manufacturing environment to make sure they can provide for their -- for the people in Venezuela. And so we're going to try to work with whatever rules are there and find the business opportunity that works for us and for our consumers.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jason Gere with RBC Capital Markets.","Jason Gere - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I'll even make it shorter, just -- most of the questions have been answered. Just going back, I think, to Javier's question, 2 ago. So as we think about '13, is it your thought right now that the impact to '13 EPS will be minimal from the exiting of the business?","Thomas J. Falk","Yes, on an adjusted basis. So we'll still have whatever charges will flow through. But on an adjusted basis, I wouldn't see any -- a dip in profitability.","Jason Gere - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay, good. And then, I guess the other question is just, as you think about the organic sales and -- the first 2 quarters of the year, you guys beat expectations out there in the top line. This quarter, I felt like maybe some of the B2B businesses slowed a little bit or had some tougher comparisons. So I guess, one, can you talk about how organic sales kind of shaped up relative to your internal expectations and maybe where was some of the shortfall? And then, two, was there any change in cadence over the quarter July through September? I mean, we've heard about retail seeing some week September numbers out there, but -- and this is staples. But I was just wondering if there's any type of differentiation over the course of the quarter.","Thomas J. Falk","Yes. I would say, if you kind of go around the businesses, I'd say North American consumer was pretty close to on track in the quarter from our expectations. B2B was a little week. It tended to soften more late in the quarter, and so some of that may be distributor inventory-related issues. Or you had a little bit more manufacturing weakness that might have affected KCP. KCI generally had a solid quarter and outperformed expectations pretty much everywhere, was at least what we thought or even a little better. So overall, I would say it was pretty close to expectations, with a bit of the over-delivery in KCI and a little softness in KCP and Health Care.","Jason Gere - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then was there any change just over the course of the 3 months? And how does October look?","Thomas J. Falk","Yes. I mean, again, I would say September was a little lighter, particularly in the B2B businesses. And it's -- October so far looks fine. But again, we'll have more visibility of it when the month is actually closed. So...","Operator","Our next question comes from Linda Bolton-Weiser with Caris.","Linda Bolton-Weiser - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division","I guess I was a little surprised that the Consumer Tissue operating margin kind of went -- it went down sequentially, if I've got my numbers right here.","Thomas J. Falk","Yes, it's down about 40 basis points sequentially, I think.","Linda Bolton-Weiser - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division","Yes, and because the volume performance was about the same as last quarter, and of course the pricing was less positive. But that was true of the Personal Care segment as well, and yet the profitability in Personal Care looked quite good. So what am I missing here? Were there more cost saves in Personal Care than Consumer Tissue? Or...","Thomas J. Falk","Yes. I'd say we had more positive price in Personal Care, and we actually had negative price in Consumer Tissue, which we talked a little bit about. And so that was probably the biggest single difference. I mean, I would say we still got good year-on-year margin improvement in Consumer Tissue and would expect to see that continue through the year. And we also would say we're not satisfied with the margins where they're at, that we'd like them to be closer to the mid-teens. And so we still have work to do and have got aggressive cost savings programs going there as well.","Linda Bolton-Weiser - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division","Because I would think that your fiber costs actually kind of sell further sequentially. Right? From the segment in the third quarter?","Thomas J. Falk","Yes.","Linda Bolton-Weiser - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. So then, in the fourth quarter...","Thomas J. Falk","Well, there's been some pulp prices increases announced in the fourth quarter. So sequentially, you could see a bit of cost pressure from pulp. And we still think it's going to be a competitive promotional spending environment out there. So we've got to deliver the volume, we've got to deliver the cost savings to get the margin improvement that we're looking for.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Faucher with JPMorgan Chase.","John A. Faucher - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","A quick question for you, which is, you talked about sort of stepping -- new leadership stepping into this business and taking a look at where the structural advantages, disadvantages are in making that decision. You guys have been a little more static with your portfolio, it seems, over the past couple of years. So can you talk to us, as you look out, and I'm not looking for sort of specific examples of which businesses you'd like to jettison and what have you, but just sort of what percentage of your portfolio you think you need to have to sort of continual [ph] a review on? And is this something where, if we look at your results over the past 12 to 18 months, you've been a little bit more successful I think than some of us anticipated? Top line has been strong. How much of this is sort of taking advantage of a little bit of a tailwind to make some tough choices?","Thomas J. Falk","Yes. I mean, I guess I would say, John, we're all -- we're looking at all parts of the portfolio all the time. And so it's not one that -- we're doing regular strategic reviews and tracking how individual businesses are performing against the plan. And so -- and making a decision to exit the diaper category in Europe was a tough call for us. It's one that's a business that we're in all over the world. It's a core business for us. But we also had to look at the harsh reality and say we've been trying to be successful over there for 20 years, and we've haven't made any money. It's not a hobby. We've got to find a way to make a profit, or we've got to think about whether we can redeploy our effort elsewhere. And so I do give the team credit for having that conversation and framing up the discussion with us, and we're going to make the decision to move forward. And so -- but again, I don't see huge chunks of the portfolio that we're unhappy with. There's individual category\/country combinations that you want to go work on and problem solve, but I don't see there's huge chunks of it that I'm concerned about at this point in time.","Operator","At this time, we have no other questioners in the queue.","Paul J. Alexander","All right. Thanks, David. We'll wrap up with a comment from Tom.","Thomas J. Falk","Once again, we were pleased to be able to raise our guidance for the second quarter in a row and continue to deliver on our investor expectations. There's a lot happening at Kimberly-Clark today, a lot of great innovation, and we're taking the right actions, consistent with our global business plan, to run the business for a successful future.","So thank you very much for your support of Kimberly-Clark.","Paul J.

At that time, instructions will be given as to the procedure to follow if you would like to ask a question.","It is now my pleasure to turn today's conference over to Paul Alexander. Sir, you may begin.","Paul Alexander","Thank you and good morning everyone. Welcome to Kimberly-Clark's Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Here with me today are Tom Falk, Chairman and CEO; Maria Henry, CFO; and Mike Azbell, VP and Controller. Here's the agenda for our call. Maria will begin with the review of third quarter results. Tom will then provide his perspectives on our results and the outlook for the full year, and we'll finish with Q&A. As usual, we have a presentation of today's materials in the Investors section of our Web site.","As a reminder, we will be making forward-looking statements today. Please see the Risk Factors section of our latest annual report on Form 10-K for further discussion of forward-looking statements. We will also be referring to adjusted results and outlook. Both exclude certain items described in this morning's news release. The release has further information on these adjustments, and reconciliations to comparable GAAP financial measures.","And now, I will turn it over to Maria.","Maria Henry","Great. Thanks, Paul. Good morning everyone. Thanks for joining the call today. Let me start with the headlines for our third quarter results. We achieved organic sales growth of 5%. That's at the high end of our full year target. We also delivered excellent cost savings, gross margin improvement, and record adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations. And finally, we continue to improve our capital efficiency, and return cash to shareholders.","Now, let's cover the details of our results, starting with sales. Third quarter net sales were $4.7 billion. That's down 7%, driven by a 12 point drag from currency rates. Organic sales rose more than 5%, including 10% increase in developing and emerging markets. On profitability, adjusted gross margin was 36.1% in the third quarter, up 120 basis points year-on-year. Adjusted operating margin was 17.5%. That's up 10 basis points, despite unusually low G&A spending last year, and a 70 basis point drag in other expense.","Our teams continue to deliver significant cost savings in order to improve profitability and fund the investments that we're making behind our brands. Third quarter FORCE cost savings were $85 million. In addition, our organizational restructuring is on track and generated $20 million of savings in the quarter. Commodities were a $45 million benefit in the quarter, mostly in oil-based materials. Full year deflation should be about in the middle of our previously estimated range of $100 million to $200 million.","Now, on the other hand, we continue to experience significant currency headwinds. The total earnings drag from currency was approximately $0.45 per share in the third quarter. For the full year, it's likely that the currency headwinds on our bottom line will approach 25%. That's a more significant impact than we expected coming into the year, and when we spoke to you on our last earnings call in July.","On items below operating profit, we had modest benefits from lower share counts and the adjusted effective tax rate, along with higher equity income. On the bottom line, third quarter adjusted earnings per share were $1.51. That's a new all-time quarterly high on continuing operations basis, and up 1% year-on-year.","Now, turning to cash flow and capital efficiency; cash provided by operations in the third quarter was healthy at $849 million, although down versus a very strong year ago quarter of $976 million. On adjusted return on invested capital, through nine months, we have improved this metric 350 basis points. That improvement includes benefits from the spin-off of Halyard Health. On capital allocation, third quarter dividend payments, and share repurchases totaled nearly half a billion dollars. We expect the full year total will be $2.1 billion, or about 5% of our current market capitalization.","Now, let's look at the segment results. In Personal Care, organic sales rose 9%. That included 14% growth in developing and emerging markets, and a 7% increase in North America. Overall Personal Care operating margins were 20.5%, up 100 basis points. This improvement was enabled by organic sales growth, cost savings, and lower input costs.","In Consumer Tissue, organic sales were up 1%, including volume growth of 6% in North America. Consumer Tissue operating margins of 17% were up 20 basis points despite unfavorable currency effects.","In K-C Professional, organic sales increased 5%. Within that, developing and emerging markets grew 6%, and developed markets outside of North America grew 4%. The segment top line also benefited from sales of nonwovens to Halyard Health in conjunction with a limited term supply agreement. You can see this benefit in the mix other number for this segment. K-C Professional margins were 18.6%, off 30 basis points year-on-year. Overall, the margins in this segment remain healthy, and above the corporate average.","To summarize, we had another good quarter as we achieved mid single-digit growth in organic sales, we delivered strong cost savings, gross margin improvement, and record adjusted earnings per share, and we continue to improve our balance sheet efficiency and allocate capital in shareholder-friendly ways.","I will now turn the call over to Tom.","Tom Falk","Thanks, Maria, and good morning everyone. I will share my perspectives on our third quarter results, and then I will cover our full year outlook. Overall, we delivered another quarter of good financial results, and we are executing our global business plan strategies well in a challenging environment. As Maria just mentioned, organic sales growth was strong at more than 5% in the quarter. So let me spend a few minute and unpack some of our top line growth strategies for you.","As you know, we are focused on pursuing targeted growth initiatives. We are launching product innovations and making high return investments in our brands. These strategies are working. Our biggest targeted growth initiative is in the developing and emerging markets. We had another excellent quarter in this part of our portfolio with 10% organic sales growth overall. Organic sales in diapers rose double digits in these markets. We continue to benefit from innovation, expansion of diaper pants, category development, and higher net selling prices in some places.","In terms of some of our key growth markets, organic sales in diapers rose about 45% in Eastern Europe. That was driven by price increases in Russia and the Ukraine to offset currency declines there, along with double-digit volume growth in Russia. Organic sales in diapers increased more than 15% in China. Volume growth remained very strong, while net selling prices were down due to increased competitive activity.","Huggies diapers are now sold in 115 cities in China, that's up from 105 at the end of last year. We are launching product improvements in the fourth quarter of this year to further improve our Huggies franchise in China.","In Brazil, our team continues to execute well in a very challenging economic environment. Total Personal Care organic sales increased more than 10%, including 5% growth in diapers. Elsewhere in developing and emerging markets, our overall feminine care organic sales rose high-teens in the third quarter. Our momentum remains strong in Latin America, led by Brazil, and we made further progress in China.","Organic sales also increased double digits in baby wipes and in adult care in the developing and emerging markets. So, overall, we delivered a strong organic sales growth quarter in developing and emerging markets, and we are optimistic about our future there.","In our developed markets business outside of North America, organic sales were down slightly in the quarter. We continue to generate solid growth in South Korea, while market conditions remain relatively soft in Western and Central Europe.","Moving now to North America in our consumer business, we have excellent volume growth in the quarter behind innovation, brand investment, and good execution at retail. In baby and child care, volumes were up low double digits on Huggies diapers, and high single digits on Huggies baby wipes. Our second quarter re-launch of new Snug N' Dry mainline diapers is on track, and I'm encouraged that our Huggies volumes are improving.","In our adult care business, our innovation, brand investment, and category growth helped us deliver double-digit volume growth in the quarter. Pipeline shipments for Poise Impressa occurred in the last half of the quarter, and we are watching the consumer response there very closely.","In consumer tissue, Kleenex facial tissue volumes rose high single digits. We had very good execution around the back-to-school season, and paper towel volumes were up double digits, led by promotional activity on Viva. Shifting to K-C Professional in North America, volumes there increased mid single digits on our higher margin, faster-growing wiper products. In washroom products, organic sales were even with last year, and that's roughly in line with the overall market and category.","Since Maria has already discussed our profitability, the balance sheet and capital allocation, I will just add that I'm also very pleased with our performance in those areas. So, all in all, I'm encouraged by our results in the third quarter.","Now, let's move and talk about the outlook for the full year. Our teams continue to focus on the fundamentals that create long-term shareholder value, while delivering on our near-term financial commitments. In terms of our growth targets for the year, we are raising the low end of our previous guidance ranges for both organic sales growth, and adjusted earnings per share. On the top line, we are now targeting organic sales growth of 4% to 5%. Our prior target was 3% to 5%. Through nine months, we've delivered growth of about 4.5%, and that compares favorably to many other peer CPG companies.","On the bottom line, despite a worsening currency environment, we've raised the low end of our previous guidance range by $0.05 per share for the second consecutive quarter. That's largely due to our improved expectation for organic sales growth. Our updated outlook is for adjusted earnings per share this year of $5.70 to $5.80.","So in summary, we delivered a very good result in the third quarter. We raised the low end of our top and bottom line growth ranges for the full year. And we remain optimistic about our prospects to generate attractive shareholder returns.","That wraps up our prepared remarks, and now we will begin to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you ladies and gentlemen. We will now open the floor for questions. [Operator Instructions] The first question will come from Gail Glazerman with UBS.","Gail Glazerman","Hi, good morning.","Tom Falk","Good morning, Gail.","Maria Henry","Good morning.","Gail Glazerman","In terms of the diaper business in the U.S., has any of that promotion activity started to roll off in the fourth quarter? And if so, can you give any sense of how sales have progressed?","Tom Falk","I would say that it wasn't as much promotion-intense as getting the everyday price, and innovation fundamentals right. And so that is continuing in the fourth quarter. And we've got a good momentum in the diaper business overall, and expect to see that continue.","Gail Glazerman","All right. And I apologize if I missed it, but can you give some insights into the trends you are seeing in North America in feminine care?","Tom Falk","Our fem care business was sort of flattish on volume in the quarter. We got some more activity coming in the fourth quarter. There was a little bit more promotion activity in tampons in some of our competition in the third quarter. That probably affected our growth a bit, but we've got more action coming in the fourth quarter.","Gail Glazerman","Okay. And in terms of developing and emerging, are you still comfortable that you can compensate for currency with price, or do you think you've tapped out your ability to use price as a lever at this point?","Tom Falk","I would say -- and you saw it a little bit in this quarter, that we've had less price overall than maybe we've had in some markets. The rate of currency deterioration hasn't been as severe as it was, say, a year ago. On the other hand, there's still some opportunity for price in some markets. As we look at, particularly in Latin America, where you are seeing some pretty significant currency moves. Those have been places where we've been able to get some price to compensate with that. And then other markets around the world, it's been a little bit tougher to get price, particularly places like Western Europe or Australia, where there's been some currency softness.","Gail Glazerman","Okay. Thanks very much.","Tom Falk","Thanks, Gail.","Operator","Thank you for your question. The next question will come from Jason English. Please go ahead.","Jason English","Hi guys, thanks for the question. A couple of housekeeping items, and I apologize if I missed this in the prepared remarks. You referenced the deflationary number ex-fiber in the press release. Can you talk about what you are seeing in the fiber complex? And then also give us a little more color on what's driving the higher administrative cost?","Tom Falk","Yes, I think a couple of things. Fiber was about a push in the quarter, it normally would be in that number, but -- so you are seeing fairly minor movements up and down on different grades of fiber. Eucalyptus is a little higher, Northern softwood is a little lower. Secondary fiber has been a little lower. So there's not been a lot of movement on that front. As we look -- rolling forward we will see how that plays up, but we haven't seen much push from fiber. What was the other part of your question, Jason?","Jason English","Higher administrative costs this quarter.","Tom Falk","Oh, yes, G&A was more of a comp [ph] to last year; it was an unusually low quarter, so \u2026","Jason English","Got it. That's helpful. And one more question just in terms of China expansion strategy. I appreciate that you continue to build out brick-and-mortar presence in more markets. Can you talk about how your strategy may be evolving with the booming eComm business, as well as opening in more free trade zones and more participants in those markets or in the free trade zones?","Tom Falk","Yes, we've been a leader in eComm in China. It's probably been at least a third of our diaper sales. And eComm grew faster than our overall business in China in the quarter. And so, we are aggressively going after that. And China, as you may know, has been a place that's been pretty competitive for a long, long time. So I think everyone in the world sees the opportunity in China, and has been investing there pretty aggressively. So we see the Japanese competitors, other U.S. competitors, some of the European competitors are there. And so, it's a competitive marketplace for sure.","Jason English","Great. Thanks a lot, guys. I'll the pass it on.","Tom Falk","Thanks, Jason.","Operator","Thank you for the question. The next question will come from Chris Ferrara with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Chris Ferrara","Hi, good morning.","Tom Falk","Hi, Chris.","Maria Henry","Good morning.","Chris Ferrara","So I guess, on the U.S., are you seeing any competitive reaction to Snug N' Dry? I know to some extent Snug N' Dry is -- the re-phasing of it is a competitive reaction as well. But are you seeing anything from competitors with respect to promo? And how optimistic are you that the share gains that you're picking up are sustainable at these sharper price points?","Tom Falk","Yes, that's a good question, Chris. I'd say, it was a -- we saw increased coupon activity, which may be not be as visible to you in some of the Nielsen data. We saw pretty heavy advertising investment by key competition. And so, which I'd say is about the kind of competitive reaction we would expect in a major re-launch like that. We would be approaching it the same way if one of our competitors was re-launching, where you try to make sure you protect your franchise as much as you can.","Yes, I think the share gains to this point have been fairly modest. If you look at our fourth quarter share, which is maybe our low point, year-to-date we are maybe up a point versus that level. And so, this quarter, our shipment share -- our shipment volume was a little bit ahead of our share progress as we -- we had some retailers that built inventory because we had a few out-of-stocks that they wanted to try to take care of. In the second quarter, that was sort of the reverse situation, and so we caught up a bit in the third quarter.","Chris Ferrara","Got it. Thanks. And in, I guess, China. I think you said net selling prices ran a little bit lower, and volume really didn't decelerate very much. I guess, A, is that right? And then can you characterize what type of competitive pressure -- I mean is this diaper pants and Procter generally, I guess? Any more color on that would be really helpful.","Tom Falk","Yes, in China, our total diaper volume was up 15 -- our total diaper organic was up 15, volume was north of 20. So you can do the math. Price was the balance. I would say it was, in some cases, some of our non-U.S. competitors, the Unitherms and Kaos where they've had a relatively weaker home currency, were a little bit more aggressive on price, more so than other competitors in that market.","Chris Ferrara","Okay. Thank you.","Tom Falk","Thanks, Chris.","Operator","Thank you for the question. The next question will come from Olivia Tong with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Olivia Tong","Great, thank you. So Korea had a pretty nice quarter in personal care. But can you comment on the sustainability of that volume growth, particularly as you move into 2016, and you start to cycle some tougher comps? And then just longer term, how do you think about pricing, particularly in North America? Because it looks like the moves that you've made on price have obviously resulted in better volumes than what the track channel data would imply, but just curious how you think about the volume versus price dynamic going forward.","Tom Falk","So those are great questions. So, yes, we've got a very strong innovation pipeline coming, and really good execution in emerging markets. So we are still very bullish on that. We are still seeing the super premium segment of our categories grow in most of our major markets. Even in Brazil, where there's been a pretty severe currency hit to that economy year-on-year, and quite a bit of price inflation, you're still seeing mom want the very best product for baby. And we're seeing that in Russia. We're continuing to see that in China.","There's no question that the consumer is under pressure in some of those markets from a purchasing power standpoint. So we're watching that to see if category growth decelerates; have not seen that to a great extent on the consumer side, seeing a little bit more of a reaction on the B2B side. So, our KCP business was slower in the quarter in Brazil than our consumer business was. And so, that is one that we are watching the dynamic in those markets where you've seen a lot of pressure.","In the U.S., the pricing that we've done has been either surgical to get our value equation right on Huggies Snug N' Dry to make sure that we got the right price gap versus our nearest mid-tier competition. And we're seeing reasonable returns from that in terms of the volume growth.","On the tissue front, where there was a little bit of price weakness in the quarter, that's been a story that's been going on for awhile. I'd say sequentially it was slightly better in terms of the competitive deep promotion price points pulled up a little bit, so we are not seeing as much of that. So again, it's more about trying to make sure we are competitive on shelf with the right offer, and bringing the right value to the consumer.","Olivia Tong","Got it. Thanks. It's really helpful. And then just following up, on fem care, you had mentioned some incremental activity coming in Q4. Do you mean incremental, like innovation, or more pricing, promotion type adjustments?","Tom Falk","I'd say some of both. We'll have some product news and then some commercial innovation. So it will be a combination of strategic marketing. We'll do some things in the advertising and digital marketing front, as well as some in-store activity, but I wouldn't view it as -- it's not going to be a straight hot price promotion to move volume. It's more strategic around product news.","Olivia Tong","Great. Thanks a bunch.","Tom Falk","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you for the question. The next question will come from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Lauren Lieberman","Thanks. Good morning.","Tom Falk","Good morning, Lauren.","Maria Henry","Good morning.","Lauren Lieberman","On North America, two questions. So, one is on the personal care volume growth. I know, Tom, you started to mention there was a little bit of a catch-up or truing-up on inventory levels at retail and shipments versus 2Q. But, just if you could talk about I guess the Nielsen data, which shows something close to 3% sales growth for you guys in terms of takeaway, but you reported 7%. So how much of that do you think is the Impressa pipeline till at the end of the quarter, some catch-up where they've been out-of-stocks last quarter.","So that would be one bucket of question. The other would be on pricing, the sequential deceleration. How much of that was maybe sampling or couponing on Poise, any kind of new activity on other areas of incontinence or in fem care? Because it did -- got a little bit more sequentially, and I believe that all of the price adjustments on Snug N' Dry had been in there last quarter. Thanks.","Tom Falk","Yes, that's fair. I think on the volume front, if you think Poise and Impressa, it's fairly small dollars in the quarter, really just getting started. So, if you looked at our total adult care business in North America was up double digits overall on organic. If you took Poise and Impressa out, it was up high single digit. So it didn't move the needle even in adult care all that much, but we do think it's going to be a nice category for us as we start to roll it out.","On the price overall, I'd say it was a -- that probably most of it was in diapers, and so, we do have a little bit of a more training pant promotion in the summer months, so you saw a little bit of that in the third quarter. We had some -- we'd launched an improved Pull-Ups product, in August. And so we put a little bit behind that to get that going. But those were the -- largely it was, most of price promotion activity was in the diaper category.","Lauren Lieberman","Okay, great. And then just, sorry Tom, just to finish up on the volume, so the Impressa piece was small, but do you think, other than I guess the true-ups versus 2Q was what we saw in terms of shipments versus takeaway, if we assume Nielsen [indiscernible] engage for takeaway. Do you think you're back to even 2Q, 3Q combined, and 4Q is sort of shipments and consumption match a little bit better?","Tom Falk","Yes. I would think that's the case. I think a lot of the inventory that went in was either to support customer service levels. We had some high out-of-stocks for the couple of customers. And so we -- as we added the inventory, we saw better in-stock, and better performance at retail. And so, hopefully that investment continues to pay off for us and our retail partners.","Lauren Lieberman","Okay, great. And then if I could just ask one more in personal care margins; margins, up 100 basis points in that business, even with the down-drop in North America pricing, and the 13% FX headwind to top line. So, can you just talk a little bit about what's really driving that? I know you loosely said cost savings, but it just seems like an enormous gap that you guys overcame.","Tom Falk","Yes, I mean I would say cost savings were good. Virtually all the deflation -- the raw material deflation hit personal care, because tissue and KCP is mostly fiber based. And fiber was basically even sequentially, and so -- or year-over-year. So they got virtually all the benefit there. We also got some price in some markets around personal care, where we had some currency devaluation. And so, that helped as well.","Lauren Lieberman","Okay. Thank you so much.","Tom Falk","Thanks, Lauren.","Operator","Thank you for the question. The next question will come from Nyet Nuin with Xbodia Capital. Please go ahead.","Nyet Nuin","Hello. Thank you for your talk. And I have a question on the outlook that you have for the Q4. You said organic sales growth contribute 3% to 4%. I wonder why you dropped the percentage of growth from this quarter to next quarter. And then the second part is about the cash flow. I see that the cash -- the free cash flow has been reducing. So I wonder what is the reason why behind that. So there are two questions I have.","Tom Falk","Sure. I think we adjusted our organic sales growth outlook for the year. So, we're at 4.5 year-to-date. And we said we'd be four to five for the year, and that's up from three to five in the previous quarter. So, we got the fourth quarter by definition, it is going to be pretty close to our trend rate for where we've been.","On the free cash flow, like everything else in our financial statements, has been affected by changes in currency rates. And so as currencies weaken, it's -- our sales are smaller, our profits are under pressure from it, our balance sheet is smaller, and our cash flow is little smaller. And so, we've got lower cash earnings to start, but predominantly due to currency, and then that flows through the overall cash flow statement.","Nyet Nuin","Thank you. And just a follow-up on the currency question; so I see that a lot of companies are hurt by the stronger dollar compared to other markets. And since your company has a lot of sales in the emerging markets, do you have any other remedies or any other solutions in terms of trying to improve the situation beside endure the pain by the market?","Tom Falk","Well, essentially, we are -- our strategy is to maximize our local currency net income. And so, we make most of our products in the country that we sell them in. And so -- and part of our costs are denominated in local currency, and then a part are in dollar-based commodities, and we try to hedge that where we can. But we want to win in the local market, and gain market share in the local market by delivering products that are relevant, and meet the essentials for mom to care for her family.","Nyet Nuin","Got it. Thank you.","Tom Falk","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you for the question. The next question will come from Ali Dibadj with Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Ali Dibadj","Hi, guys. So I wanted to get some help thinking about how you feel the quality of your numbers are this quarter. Usually it's pristine, and this time, the top line is still very good, but driven by, as you mentioned, price promo, some inventory, some things that make it sound like the top line isn't quite as sustainable going forward truly, if there's more competition. Your margins were a little bit worse than anticipated. FORCE was a little bit lower, but you made it up through taxes being a little bit lower, at least, at least than we had modeled, and certainly some higher buyback.","So, for a company that's usually very pristine on the quality, you're clearly dealing with these tough times. I'm trying to figure out how we should think about this as a little bit different than what we've seen over the past several quarters, I guess.","Tom Falk","Actually, Ali, I was pretty happy with the quality of it. So I -- as we looked at the 5% organic top line, is pretty solid in this environment, and have been at the high end of the range that we've been aiming at, all volume. So really not any help from price to get there were in other quarters, we've been in the four to five range with three volume and two price. So, I mean, I'm pretty happy on the top line front. In this environment, where we're not getting as much price and we still got all the transactional currency hit to cover it with cost savings and still deliver improved gross margin and improved operating margin was a pretty good performance. We held our advertising and promotion investment rate as a percent of sales in the quarter, which is a positive. The year-over-year margin and present [ph] G&A was really a low watermark for us last year, and we did indicate that that probably wasn't going to be repeated.","And then other income and expense was about 30 million swing year-over-year. Last year, we had a gain from an asset sale, and this year we had currency transaction losses. And so, when you net all that down, you would say pretty good performance to have margin improvement in both gross and operating margin. And then below the line, taxes were benefit. Mexico had a good quarter though, and Mexico was a nice uptick for us which while it doesn't show up in all the operating line is still a very solid performance. So all in all, I would say we feel pretty good about the quality.","Ali Dibadj","Okay. So many levers to pull, and in a tough environment you can pull on them differentially to get to, again, good numbers throughout. If you could comment on FORCE, it sounds like that's just this quarter a little bit lower than it's been in the past, but feels like that's just kind of ramping up and may be a transition to new plan, and then another comment if you could share \u2026","Tom Falk","Yes, on FORCE, I mean we delivered 85 million, and we are at 285 for the year-to-date. So, we are on track with a 350-ish kind of number, which is \u2013- so 85 is pretty close to the run rate you would expect. And so, again, I would say good solid work on negotiating material savings, and specifications, and productivity, all delivered a solid result. And we do think there is more to come as we continue to build our global supply chain capability.","Ali Dibadj","Okay. And I just want to pick your brain because you guys are usually very open and have a lot of insight on kind of the market broadly. I want to know what you thought about this whole Walmart Wednesdays as we're calling it in terms of their panic and basically saying our margins will never be this high, and trying to react to what they believe is a normal trend in the consumer. How do you think CPG companies will interpret that or feel any repercussions of it? Not short term, but longer term.","Tom Falk","There is certainly lot of change going on at Walmart and we see them investing in the store experience. And if you have been in the Walmart a year ago and were in one today, I think you would see a difference, and we are saying our business with them is continuing to perform well. We are also investing in eCommerce. So I think they are doing a lot of right things, and our job is to make sure we are winning with all of our customers wherever mom wants to shop and that we've got the right product and right offer on shelf. And so, we are continuing to do everything we can with them and our other customers to make sure we got the right things happening in the retail space.","Ali Dibadj","Okay. Thanks very much.","Tom Falk","Thank, Ali.","Operator","Thank you for the question. The next question will come from Javier Escalante with Consumer Edge Research. Please go ahead.","Tom Falk","Good morning, Javier.","Operator","Mr. Escalante, please make sure your phone is put on mute.","Javier Escalante","I am sorry. Good morning everyone. It was in mute. I would like to have some clarifications on the emerging market piece. If you can remind us, what percentage of your sales are in Eastern Europe, which is growing at 45%? And how sustainable is that? Is it that -- I can see that the double-digit volume growth in Russia suggests like there is no price elasticity and that you have a ton of pricing power in Russia. So could you help us understand what's happening in Eastern Europe that is growing 45%? Is it that you are gaining share to competitors? Is it that the category is on fire? So that would be my first questions. And then I have a couple of follow-ups on Brazil and China. Thank you.","Tom Falk","Yes. I mean Russia and Eastern Europe is about couple of percent of our overall company sales. So it's relatively small market for us. And when you've seen what the Ruble has done over the last year, you've seen lots of price inflation in that market. It is not unlike some of the Latin American markets, where you had a significant inflationary impact, and where you got a lot of imported materials in your product, you wind up having to take price just to keep your margins reasonably whole. And we are seeing good response to diaper pants in that market, and so it's not just a straight price increase, we've also brought innovation, and we are trying to watch and make sure we've got the right price pack architecture to hit the purchasing power that mom has got during her monthly purchase cycle.","Javier Escalante","And on China now, the 5% price decline, does it have to do with increased competition from Procter as they launch this premium baby line, or is it more like price mix as you go into lower tiers, or what exactly is driving this 5% down? Should you expect this to continue, that there's going to be some price erosion? Because I have a little bit of problem understanding the trade-up dynamic that you describe with the price decline that you are also citing.","Tom Falk","Yes, in China, more of the price pressure has come from our non-U.S. competitors, particularly a couple of Japanese competitors that are in that market. They've had a relatively weaker home currency, and have invested some of that as they lost some share in China, as we've been gaining share. So we are trying to make sure we keep our volume momentum going, and that we match up with the right price points.","Javier Escalante","And finally, coming back to Brazil, you basically mentioned the personal care piece that is up 10%, which is very good. The diaper growth in China, the 5%, is all pricing. Did volumes decline as other companies are mentioning that is happening in Brazil? Do you have positive volumes in Brazil in diapers or did they decline?","Tom Falk","Our volumes in Brazil were pretty flat in the quarter. So, all of the improvement was price mix, and we did take share leadership on diapers in the quarter in Brazil, but that was really more of our other competitors shrinking a bit, and we've also got fem care -- our leadership in fem care in Brazil as we have driven some innovation on both tampons and pads in that market. So, we continue to see even in a challenging market, when you bring innovation and product news, and bring products that mom wants, consumers are still willing to invest in your category.","Javier Escalante","I guess what I'm trying kind of to finalize with picking up these three BRIC countries has to do with the state of emerging markets because, back in the summer, the markets sold off thinking that emerging markets after what is happening in China would decelerate further. You haven't seen at the end of the day any change on the consumer side or something -- it's certainly not reflected in your numbers, so it doesn't seem that you are gaining significant amount of share. So, do you think that -- have you seen any step down, say, in consumer demand in any of these key emerging markets, you didn't see it versus earlier this year, prior to the sell-off of China equities and the world, China going bankrupt? Thank you.","Tom Falk","I think, Javier, we're seeing some very modest slowdown in category growth, but less than you would think and less than you've seen in some other B2B categories. And so, GDP per capita is still going up in most of these markets, not the one, not the economies that are in recession obviously, but China for sure, and lot of the Asian economies. And so, consumers still have more money to invest in our categories. We are also still seeing super premium segments growing in a lot of these markets. So, even in Brazil, where the upper tiers of the diaper categories are growing at a faster pace, and they haven't slowdown appreciably.","Javier Escalante","That is very insightful. Thank you very much.","Tom Falk","Thank you, Javier.","Operator","Thank you for the question. The next question will come from Iain Simpson with Societe Generale. Please go ahead.","Iain Simpson","Thank you very much. I missed the start of the call, so apologies if these have already been asked. But firstly, you quantified the translational currency impact on profit. Are you able to give any sort of steer as to how we should think about the transactional impact? That would be extremely helpful. Thank you.","Tom Falk","Yes. If you look at -- in the quarter, our translational was about 12 points on the top line. Translation and transaction combined was approaching a north of 30 points. If you look at it on a year-to-date basis -- Paul, is it 25 points, something like that?","Paul Alexander","Yes. It's about 10 points on the top line for translation, and the all-in impact on earnings is approaching is 25%. So, 2 to 2.5 multiple of translation impact is a good rule of thumb.","Iain Simpson","Extremely helpful, thank you. And just secondly, if I may, you talked about eCommerce being about a third of your China diaper business. Are you able to give any indication as to how that's I guess trended over the past sort of medium-term? What that number would've been a couple of years ago or five years ago, or just anything to give us a sense as to kind of where that's come from and perhaps where it's going? Thank you.","Tom Falk","Yes, I think five years ago, eComm in China for us was probably near zero. Or if it was there, we weren't tracking it. And so, we have put more resources against this and have grown that part of the business. And eComm in China is growing at a faster rate than our overall business. So, we continue to see good returns there. And ultimately, we are trying to be present with the right offer wherever mom wants to shop. And so, we are not necessarily trying to shape the category in a particular direction. We just want to be there whatever outlet or form she wants to buy her products.","Iain Simpson","Thank you very much.","Tom Falk","Thanks, Iain.","Operator","Thank you. The next question will come from Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Bill Schmitz","Hi, Tom. Good morning.","Tom Falk","Hi, Bill.","Bill Schmitz","Are you concerned at all about some of the trade down in a lot of the emerging markets, and like will you sort of adjust to that by maybe trying to launch some stuff at lower end, specifically in Brazil and China?","Tom Falk","We were just talking about that on one of the other questions, and so far we are not seeing as much as a trade down as you would think. And we are still seeing -- we launched boy\/girl diaper pants in some of the super premium kind of tiers. We are seeing good response and growth there. So we are watching it. And obviously, particularly the economies that are in recession like Brazil and Russia, we are watching that see how the consumer performs and make sure we got the right offer, but we are also seeing really good innovation. Mom still wants the best for her baby. These are not expensive products relative to other things and she is still willing to buy those little luxuries for her family.","Bill Schmitz","Okay. I mean just because if you look in China and in Brazil, it's like Hypermarcas has taken a bunch of share, and I know they're for sale. We talked about that last time, but even like Jiangnan, it seems like they're making a pretty big comeback in some of the Nielsen data. Obviously, your share is growing as well. It seems like some of mid-tier players are the ones that are getting hit.","Tom Falk","Yes. In eComm and super premium baby stores in China is stuff that isn't tracked as well, and that's where the lot of the growth in the category is.","Bill Schmitz","Okay. That's helpful. And then, I know you don't want to give guidance for next year, , but when do you think you're going to get sort of the peak benefit from falling commodities sort of net of the currency becoming less onerous? And I know you sort touched on it a little bit, but has there been any sort of pushback by retailers on some of the pricing stuff, especially on the diaper side, because obviously polypropylene prices are way down? ","Tom Falk","We will give you guidance in January, and at this point, it's still pretty volatile environment. You look at exchange rates at the end of September and then today and they have moved quite a bit in both directions, depending on where you are at. Commodity costs have been a little bit more stable, but if you still look at lot of the forecast for oil at a $20 barrel higher next year than it is right now. And so, we are still wrestling through that and we'll have a point of view for you in January when we are little closer to the year actually getting underway. At this point, we still believe our model is right continuing to look to 3% to 5% organic and delivering a positive result in margin improvement in that kind of an environment.","Bill Schmitz","Okay. And the retail discussions, are they getting any more aggressive because obviously they see what's happened at least with some of the spot prices in some of your categories on the commodity side?","Tom Falk","I would say not in the U.S., and I think and in emerging markets, the currency impact dwarfs any commodity cost benefit in most markets.","Bill Schmitz","Okay. All right, that's very helpful. Thank you very much.","Tom Falk","Thanks, Bill.","Operator","Thank you. The next question will come from Caroline Levy with CLSA. Please go ahead.","Tom Falk","Hi, Caroline.","Caroline Levy","Hi. Good morning. Hi. I'm wondering if you can talk a little bit about adult care in the U.S., and just how P&G's entry has impacted you. I think Impressa is a different issue I guess. It only just launched, but in general sort of the non-diaper personal-care business, specifically looking at adult as well.","Tom Falk","Yes. Since Procter has launched, the category has grown a little faster, and so we've seen -- we went from mid to high single-digit growth to double-digit growth and seen that happened pretty consistently. We had double-digit growth in the quarter, including the benefits of Impressa, which were relatively modest, but still helped us. We have launched a lot of innovation in the last year to make sure that our consumers have the very best products we could offer available.","And so, as a result, I think we probably say we successful defended, we have lost less than our fair share as Procter has come in and have delivered solid growth. I'm sure when P&G talks about this later this week they will talk about a successful launch and they will probably hit their share goals. So, private label and some of the other brands have taken a disproportionate hit from the P&G entry. And so, in the meantime we are just keeping our foot on the gas to make sure we've got a great innovation coming in that space, employees in Impressa is just another good example of that.","Caroline Levy","That's great. Thank you. I know you talked about Mexico getting better again. I also missed part of the call because Coke was going on at the same time. But it seems like Brazil is deteriorating as an economy. What is going on in Mexico that you see, good and bad, over the next 12 months from where you stand?","Tom Falk","Yes, Mexico is -- I am cautiously optimistic there, and Pablo and the team will be on a call later this week, and can give you more color, but that seems executing well, and they are getting some price to cover some of the currency impact that they've hit, seen good volume growth, and good cost savings, and good margin performance. So we are encouraged by what we are seeing there. The economic growth and the economy has been a little slower than they would have hoped at the beginning of the year, but we also see some optimism that that's going to improve going forward a bit, particularly as the U.S. economy improves a bit.","Caroline Levy","Thank you. And then just China, briefly, I think you started to talk a bit about fem care, which was not really in the conversation before. Can you talk about that in more detail?","Tom Falk","Yes. We are still a very small player in fem care in China. We re-launched probably a little over a year, probably a year and a half ago, now, Paul; and saw double-digit growth in the quarter. And we are seeing some share improvements. We are not in as many cities with fem care yet as we are with our diaper business, but we are growing nicely and have good innovation there, and it's around the U by Kotex type positioning with -- aimed at the late-teen, early 20 young women as she is making some brand choices for a wife and making sure we got a relevant interesting product with a good commercial execution for her.","Caroline Levy","Thanks so much.","Tom Falk","Thanks, Caroline.","Operator","We have no further questions at this time. I will turn the conference back over to you.","Paul Alexander","All right. We thank everyone for your questions today, and we will end with a comment from Tom.","Tom Falk","Well, it's another good quarter of great execution from our team, and we are committed to continue forward and deliver on your expectations as our shareholders, and we thank you all for your support at Kimberly-Clark.","Paul Alexander","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

Please be aware that each of your lines is in a listen-only mode. At the conclusion of today's presentation, we will open the floor for your questions. At that time, instructions will be given as to the procedure to follow if you would like to ask an audio question.","It is now my pleasure to introduce today's first presenter, Mr. Paul Alexander.","Paul Alexander","Thank you and good morning everyone. Welcome to Kimberly-Clark's Year End Earnings Conference Call. Here with me today are Tom Falk, our Chairman and CEO; Maria Henry, our CFO; and Mike Azbell, VP and Controller. Now here's the agenda for the call. Maria will begin with a review of our results focusing on the full year and after that Tom will provide his perspectives on our results and our outlook for 2016 and we'll finish with Q&A. As usual, we have a presentation of today's materials in the Investors section of our website.","As a reminder, we will be making forward-looking statements today. Please see the Risk Factors section of our latest annual report on Form 10-K for further discussion of forward-looking statements. We will also be referring to adjusted results and outlook. Both exclude certain items described in this morning's news release. The news release has further information on these adjustments and reconciliations to comparable GAAP financial measures.","And now, I will turn it over to Maria.","Maria Henry","Thanks, Paul. Good morning everyone. Thanks for joining the call today. Let me start off with the headlines for our 2015 results. Our organic sales grew 5%. That's at the high end of our 3% to 5% target. We achieve excellent cost savings and margin improvements, helping us deliver adjusted earnings per share towards the high end of our original guidance. And finally, we continue to improve our capital efficiency and return cash to shareholders.","Now let's take a look at the details for our results and let's start with sales. Fourth quarter net sales were $4.5 billion, that's down 6% with an 11 points rise from currency rate. Full year net sales were $18.6 billion down 6% down 6% including a currency headwind of more than 10%. Organic sales growth was about 5% for both the fourth quarter and the full year.","On profitability, fourth quarter adjusted growth margins were 36%. The full year was 35.9% up 160 basis points year-on-year. Adjusted operating margin were 17.2% in the fourth quarter. The full year margin was 17.3%, that's up 120 basis points compared to the prior year.","I am encouraged that operating margins were up in all three business segments and across all three geographies, both America, developed markets and developing and emerging markets excluding the impact of the Venezuelan devaluation.","Our teams delivered $365 million of FORCE cost savings in 2015. That was above our initial target of at least 300 million and just $5 million shy of our all time record. We expect another strong year in 2016 with a savings target of at least $350 million. In addition, our organizational restructuring is on track and it generated $65 million of savings in 2015. We expect additional savings of at least $50 million from this program in 2016.","Commodities were $150 million benefit for the year mostly in oil based materials. That was at the high end of our original assumption for the year, but on the other hand currency declines severely impacted our earnings. For the year the all-in earnings drag was about 25%, well above our going into the year assumption for a drag of more than 15%.","On the bottom line, fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share were $1.42 bringing the full year to $5.76. That was up 5% compared to the results from continuing operations in 2014 and towards the high end of our original guidance range of $5.60 to $5.80 per share.","Turning to cash flow and capital efficiency, cash provided by operations was $2.3 billion for the year versus $2.8 billion in 2014. A number of factors drove the lower cash amounts including our debt financed pension contributions, the Halyard spin-off and higher total working capital. I expect a significant improvement in cash generation in 2016.","We reduced our primary working capital cash conversion cycle by eight days in 2015 as a result of extending payables terms. On adjusted return on invested capital we improved this metric 350 basis points including benefits from the spin-off at Halyard Health.","On capital allocations, in 2015 we've returned $2.1 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. For 2016 we plan to repurchase between $600 million and $900 million of Kimberly-Clark's stock. We also expect to increase the dividend at a mid single digit rate that's generally consistent with the 5% growth in adjusted earnings per share that we delivered in 2015.","Now let's look at the segments. In Personal Care, organic sales rose 7% continuing our long track record of delivering strong growth in this segment. Our Personal Care business grew 14% in developing and emerging markets. Operating margins were 20.5% in Personal Care, up 180 basis points. The improvement was enabled by organic sales growth, cost savings and lower input costs.","In Consumer Tissue, organic sales were up more than 1% including volume growth of 6% in North America. Consumer Tissue operating margins were 17.5%. That was up 150 basis points and includes benefits from another year of excellent cost savings performance.","In K-C Professional, organic sales increased 4% overall with 6% growth in developing and emerging markets. The segment top line also included a 1.5 point benefit from sales of nonwovens to Halyard Health in conjunction with a limited term supply agreement. So sales should be somewhat lower in 2016. K-C Professional operating margins were healthy at 18.3%, up 50 basis points year-on-year.","To summarize, our fourth quarter results capped off a very good year overall as we achieved mid single digit growth in organic sales and adjusted earnings per share, we delivered strong cost savings and broad based margin improvements and we continued to improve ROIC and allocate capital in shareholder friendly way.","I'll now turn the call over to Tom.","Thomas Falk","Thanks Maria and good morning everyone. I will share my perspectives on our full year 2015 results and then I'll comment on our outlook for 2016. So starting with this past year, we delivered another year of good financial performance in a challenging environment. As Maria just mentioned our organic sales grew about 5%. This reflects very good execution and it compares favorably to many other consumer packaged goods companies. Our volume growth was 4% and that's our best performance since 2007 on this metric.","Our business in the developing and emerging markets had another great year with 10% organic sales growth. This performance was highlighted by 14% growth in Personal Care. That's the fifth consecutive year this part of our portfolio has grown organically at a double-digit rate.","Looking at some of our targeted growth initiatives in the developing and emerging markets and in diapers our organic sales increased more than 35% in Eastern Europe, 25% in China and 10% in Brazil. Innovation across all these markets continues to help drive our growth and in 2016 we will launch more product upgrades on Huggies throughout the developing and emerging markets.","In China Huggies diapers are now sold in 115 cities and we are targeting to be in 130 cities by the end of the year. And in Brazil as a result of the continued decline in real we have recently initiated price increases across these categories.","Elsewhere in Personal Care, our organic sales in feminine care rose double-digits in developing and emerging markets. Our performance in fem care was especially strong in Latin America led by Argentina and Brazil. We also had a very good year in China and then the Middle East, Eastern Europe and Africa on fem care. In addition, our adult care and baby wipes businesses also grew organic sales at double-digit rates in developing and emerging markets.","K-C Professional organic sales rose mid-single digits in developing and emerging markets even though demand has slowed in some places towards the end of the year. Overall our business in the developing and emerging markets was 30% of company sales in 2015. Even though volatility has increased and economies are slowing in some parts of the world we remain very optimistic about our growth prospects. For 2016 we are targeting organic sales growth of at least high single digits for our business in the developing and emerging markets.","Turning to our developed markets business outside of North America organic sales for 2015 were even with the prior year. We continue to generate very solid growth in South Korea while market conditions were relatively soft in Western and Central Europe.","Moving to our North American consumer business we delivered 5% volume growth and excellent operating profit performance. In adult care we delivered high single digit volume growth with benefits from innovations, brand investments and category growth. Our market shares improved sequentially as the year progressed with shares up 1 point in the second half of the year compared to the first half.","In baby and child care volumes were up mid-single digits on Huggies baby wipes and low single digits on Huggies diapers. Our second quarter relaunch of Snug \u2018N Dry diapers is on track and helped deliver volume growth in 2015.","In consumer tissue, volumes were up mid-single digits with benefits from market share gains, good retail execution, and increased promotion support. Performance was led by Cottonelle bathroom tissue and Viva towels.","In K-C Professional in North America, volumes increased mid-single digits on our higher margin wiper products business and our washroom products organic sales were up low single digits, roughly in line with the overall market.","Maria has already highlighted how we continue to manage our company with financial discipline, so I'll just add that I'm encouraged with our cost savings delivery, our margin improvements, our improvements in return on invested capital and the cash that we've been able to return to our shareholders.","I am also pleased that we delivered bottom line earnings growth towards the high end of our original commitment even though currency rates were much worse than we had planned for the year. So all in all I am proud of our team's accomplishments in 2015. We have good momentum overall and we're focused on driving further improvements going forward.","Now let's move on to our outlook for 2016. We will continue to focus on the fundamentals that create shareholder value. So in 2016 we will deliver healthy levels of organic sales growth, cost savings and margin expansion. We will improve working capital, cash from operations and return on invested capital and will return a significant amount of cash to shareholders again in 2016. At the same time we will continue to invest in our brands, our growth initiatives and our capabilities in order to improve Kimberly-Clark over the long-term.","In terms of our specific 2016 targets, on the top line we expect organic sales growth of 3% to 5%, that's consistent with our long-term objectives. On the bottom line we have targeted adjusted earnings per share in a range of $5.95 to $6.15. That is up 3% to 7% year-on-year. Similar to this past year, at this point we are expecting that earnings will be higher in the second half of the year compared to the first half.","Like other multinational companies, we're facing continued currency headwinds. We're planning that currency translation will reduce sales and earnings by 5% to 6% this year. The all-in drag on earnings including currency transaction is expected to approach 15%. These projections are based on forward exchange rates as of a couple of weeks ago which are pretty consistent with recent spot rates in most cases. To reduce the impact of currency headwinds we plan to raise selling prices in some of our international markets.","We're expecting a relatively benign year on the commodity front. We're starting the year planning for a total impact between $100 million of cost deflation to $50 million of cost inflation. Although some commodity costs should benefit from lower oil prices, others like polypropylene resin in North America are being impacted by market specific dynamics. In addition, cost for materials in some international markets are expected to increase due to local inflation.","So as we said before, it is important to look at currencies, commodities and selling price assumptions together since they are all somewhat related. On average we're expecting the net impact of these three factors to result in a high single digit drag in our 2016 earnings. With that in mind, the underlying growth of 3% to 7% EPS growth that we've included in our outlook is pretty healthy. As we always do we'll continue to closely monitor the environment and we'll provide updates on our progress and outlook each quarter as the year unfolds.","So in summary, we delivered another year of good financial performance in 2015. We expect to continue our momentum in 2016 and we remain very optimistic about our prospects to generate attractive shareholder returns through our global business plans.","This wraps up our prepared remarks and now we'll begin to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Eve Powers [ph] of UBS.","Stephen Powers","Hi, yes it is Steve. Thanks. Tom, maybe starting with first looking at North America, it looks and sounds like competition and promotional intensity held roughly flat sequentially, would you agree with that? And if so, what's the assumed outlook there as you look forward to calendar 2016, just given it is all that's happening in that marketplace in P&G in general?","And a similar question on China given the general demand conditions there, but also obviously a highly competitive market there too?","Thomas Falk","Yes, I think broadly the market was pretty similar Q3 to Q4, but also there was more activity in the second half of 2015 than there was in the first half. So if you looked at percent sold on deal [ph] and the level of A&P support across the category was probably increased for all the major brands. We got quite a bit of innovation coming in 2016. We believe are our primary competitor does as well. So I would guess that the current level of competitive activity will continue. We'll forget about the progress in our unit volume growth on diapers in North America and we feel like we've got good momentum on diapers and training pants for sure.","In China, we saw a bit more competitive pricing being spent in the market by some of the competitors which we matched up to at some extent, but we saw some of that in the third quarter as you may recall, but had a very strong volume quarter again and again have lots of innovation coming. So still tons of competition around, but I wouldn\u2019t say it is getting worse, but it is continuing.","Stephen Powers","Okay, thanks. And then shifting gears a little bit, given another round of devaluation in markets like Brazil and Russia et cetera, what is your confidence on the continued ability to push through incremental pricing? You mentioned another round in Brazil, but is there a level at which it just becomes too difficult to maintain an incrementality?","Thomas Falk","Yes, I think we're watching the consumer carefully, particularly as you see GDP [ph] per capital go backwards in some of these markets. In Brazil for example we saw category volumes decline a bit in the fourth quarter for both diapers and bathroom tissue which you don\u2019t see that too often in Eastern Europe. The Ukraine in particular has been a market that has been hard hit if you look at category volumes. Some of that is because there has been quite a bit of parallel imports there that because of some value-added taxes that they put in place. So we are watching the consumer.","On the other hand we've got real transaction exposure hitting these markets. You are trying to cover the transaction cost just to try to keep the shape of the P&L in order. And I think every major CPG [ph] is in that balancing act right now.","Stephen Powers","Okay and lastly Maria, if I could, so based on the dividend and buyback outlooks and then combine that with CapEx and defined benefit contribution, it looks as though maybe we should assume and you might be adding it again to your debt balance in 2016, is that a fair assumption or is there something I'm missing in there?","And if it is fair can you just talk about how you view the borrowing environment given all the volatility we're seeing in capital markets generally and if there is a certain profile of incremental debt that we should assume or perhaps some timing that will be great? Thanks.","Maria Henry","Sure, the way that we think about it is we are very focused on maintaining our single A credit rating. So at any point in time, we're looking at whether our effected cash flows, our focus is on continuing to fund the dividend to spend CapEx at healthy levels given the significant opportunities that we have in our business for high ROI return types of projects and then we look at share buyback to balance out what we do with the remainder of both our cash flow and our remaining debt capacity under that single A credit rating metrics. So we'll see how that unfolds during the year.","You know that we set our debt up in 2015 and entered the year at $7.8 billion, but as a reminder, a bit chunk of that came from the debt financed pension contributions that we made in 2015, but going forward we expect stronger cash flows in 2016 from operations. And so we'll balance those things out as we go through the year.","Stephen Powers","Okay, thanks very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Wendy Nicholson with Citi","Wendy Nicholson","Thomas Falk","Hey Wendy.","Wendy Nicholson","Hi good morning. A couple of things, number one, I think you gave us the organic sales growth breakdown for China, Eastern Europe and Brazil just for the full year. Can you give us those for the fourth quarter specifically?","And then with regard to Brazil pricing, do you intend to raise prices consistently across all the segments? I know there is a very big gap between the various segments and I'm just wondering how much risk of trading down there might be.","Thomas Falk","Paul will give you some of the quarterly details and then we can talk about pricing in general.","Paul Alexander","Yes, Wendy, for the quarter, so Eastern Europe first of all was up about 25% largely due to higher selling prices. This is in diapers. In China, organic sales were up more than 15%, all driven by volume. Volume was a little bit north of 20% in the fourth quarter. And then in Brazil Personal Care was up about 15%, diapers was about 10%, with both higher volumes and selling prices.","Thomas Falk","Yes and then to your other question, we are trying to be smart as we look across categories, the level of pricing also is affected by the amount f innovation that we have coming. So we can bring a better performing product, we will probably be a little more aggressive on pricing in that space, but we're also looking at it by peer to see what's possible. Part of that is also driven by how much is the local content of a particular product makeup versus the U.S. dollar components for using a ton of imported materials, you are going to be more likely to have to price up for that.","Wendy Nicholson","And then thus far have you seen much trading down across the segments in Brazil or not so much?","Thomas Falk","We've seen a little bit of the trading up, trading down phenomena like we have seen in other markets where the super premium segments are growing where you\u2019ve got real innovation and some differentiation and then you\u2019ve seen some uptick in the value and the middle segments have taken a bit of a hit. We\u2019ve seen that in other markets and some other situations.","Wendy Nicholson","Got it and then I just had one last one on your regional operating margins, means the progression in North America just continues to be fantastic, but there's still a lag or the international margins are still significantly below and that makes total sense. But my question is going forward just given that we continue to see such outsized growth from your international business, there is obviously an inherent drag there on your overall margin expansion, I\u2019m just wondering kind of conceptually the FORCE savings or cost savings sort of the margin expansion priorities, how much of those are oriented towards the international business versus North America, so at what point do you think we will start to see that gap close?","Thomas Falk","Well, the good news is our international business is closing the gap and so their margins have improved this year. So even though the sales from [indiscernible] they came much closer to the dollar target than you might think given the size of the currency hit that they took. And so they really use very minimal margin drag on the company. In fact this year because they shrunk as a percent of the company\u2019s overall sales we actually had a slight margin tailwind this year from a mixed standpoint.","But getting back to the root cause we tend to focus on gross margins in emerging markets and trying to narrow that gap, and narrow the gap is a little closer than operating margin, because in some markets where we are investing in A&P or building infrastructure to support a larger business, we're not quite as efficient between the lines in the international market share, but that\u2019s one that the team is working on and our markets that are at scale like Korea you'd see margins there that are at or above the North American levels in individual categories.","Wendy Nicholson","Terrific that\u2019s very helpful, thank you.","Thomas Falk","Thanks, Wendy.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bill Schmidt with Deutsche Bank. ","Thomas Falk","Hi, Bill.","Bill Schmidt","Yes, good morning. Hey, just one quick one, how big is Argentina both sales and profits directionally and do we start getting concerned about what\u2019s going on down there?","Thomas Falk","What last year or this year Bill, it\u2019s a little small for this year\u2026?","Bill Schmidt","Right.","Thomas Falk","I think it\u2019s 2% or 3% of sales and probably similar from profits, had a great year last year and part of the other expense that we took in the quarter was the devaluation that happened in mid December, that part was a $0.03 hit to our fourth quarter results. But I actually feel pretty optimistic about Argentina over the long term and so as we see the new government coming in place and they\u2019re opening up their markets, so there is some product categories for example that were imported.","Like our K-CP business for example in Argentina had to import all their safety products and we didn\u2019t manufacture anything locally there well over the last year. So we were not allowed to import. So you had to kind of go out of that business. That\u2019s all going to open up in 2016. So there will be a translation and transaction hit, but I\u2019m more optimistic about the future of Argentina going forward.","Bill Schmidt","Okay, great. Actually just one another quick one, on the working capital side is working capital going to turn positive next year because I know that's a pretty significant use this year?","Maria Henry","Yes, our working capital use was a bit higher in 2015 than we would like. There were a number of factors that impacted that including the negative impact of currency on our derivative settlements and we also had a tax receivable that moved up into accounts receivable at the end of the year. I mean despite the use of cash we made really good progress on our per working capital metrics as I talked about in my prepared comments. So for 2016 working capital is clearly an opportunity for us and we'll be sure to get at that and as I said our cash from operations to be significantly higher in 2016 versus 2015.","Bill Schmidt","Great, thanks very much.","Thomas Falk","Thanks Bill.","Operator","Our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.","Lauren Lieberman","Thanks, good morning.","Thomas Falk","Hi, Lauren.","Lauren Lieberman","First thing on the other income line of expense, so the hit from devaluation Argentina this quarter is that kind of a one quarter effect or should we think about it being at these elevated levels throughout the year?","Thomas Falk","No, you pretty much had the right year of payables down on the data devaluation occurred, so I don\u2019t know Maria, if you've got anymore color on that?","Maria Henry","Yes we took a significant hit on the devaluation in the fourth quarter and then it will just depend what happens to the currency from here and how we have to re-measure the balance sheet moving forward.","Lauren Lieberman","Okay, great. And then on K-C Professional, you mentioned sort of slowing demand at the end of the year in emerging markets, can you talk about that also for North America if you\u2019re seeing any slowing in demand there and your outlook for that business being the more cyclically tied piece of the portfolio?","Thomas Falk","Yes I would say this, we had probably different causes and different market sets and they are little softer fourth quarter on the top line than we were expecting overall for the year they had decent organic growth which is what we tend to look at. In North America, we saw some distributor inventory destocking because we look at our out-the-door sales versus our in-the-door sales in the fourth quarter. They sold more out-the-door than they purchased in-the-door. So I think those guys at calendar year end and they were doing some inventory level trimming as they hit their year end. I\u2019d say in other markets like Brazil, which is a big market for K-CP, there you see more just a decline in GDP has had a pretty big impact on business activity. It has affected the key K-CP market much more than the consumer market for the year.","In other markets China kind of a mixed bag with a little weaker quarter for us and yes some of that was execution on our front that we need to improve and there is plenty of competition there, probably a bit of the economic slowdown, but again that market is still growing overall, it\u2019s just not at the same pace that it once was. So lots of different issues in individual markets that kind of added up to a little less than we were thinking we\u2019re going to get on the top line.","Lauren Lieberman","Okay, great. And then on cost savings, so certainly notable that you\u2019re starting the year talking about FORCE being $350 million, to the question on restructuring though, I think sort of came in at the lower end of the expected range for savings in 2015. If I layer on then the $50 million you\u2019re expecting in 2016 those still have you kind of below the $120 million to $140 million in the total realized, so does this mean it extends a little bit further into 2017 or is it just going to be kind of a lower end of the range on the total program?","Maria Henry","Yes, our overall restructuring program is firmly on track. We delivered savings of $65 million in 2015 and that brings the total to date to $70 million and our guidance for 2016 is another $50 million of savings putting our cumulative level within the target range of $120 million to $140 million for the full program and we still expect to realize some additional benefits in 2017. So we\u2019re clearly on track in terms of the savings that we expect to realize for that program.","Paul Alexander","Lauren this is Paul. I would just build on that. Remember we said the charges would end in 2016, but as Maria has mentioned the savings is really through 2017.","Lauren Lieberman","Okay. Perfect and just a final quizzing on SG&A, I know in the release you mentioned FX was impacted and I just wanted to check if there was anything else in SG&A because it was a little bit higher than it might this quarter and just thinking it was mostly FX or any other kind of investments in marketing?","Maria Henry","Yes, there is a couple of things you mentioned FX that clearly has an impact on the reported expense levels. But our expenses are higher as we\u2019re investing in capabilities and we also had some higher variable compensation expense in the fourth quarter and for the year given our strong performance. And when you look year-over-year I think it\u2019s probably also worth noting that we have lower levels of spend in the second half of last year, so organization was really focusing on the spend and the restructuring program which is a lot of work. And this year as we said on our second quarter earnings call again we were intending to invest in capabilities and we did that.","Lauren Lieberman","And Maria can you still elaborate on those capabilities? I mean is that, is it people, is it mostly in selling, is it in marketing or is it actual dollars in the marketplace already?","Maria Henry","Yes it\u2019s in a number of areas. Clearly and our selling capabilities is an area that we\u2019re focused on investing in, in marketing capabilities particularly around electronic commerce as we grow in new channels and then we also had some investments in the area of IT in terms of data analytics and things like that all focused on supporting our organic top line growth efforts.","Lauren Lieberman","Okay. Thank you so much.","Thomas Falk","Thanks Lauren.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Ferrara with Wells Fargo.","Thomas Falk","Hi good morning, Chris. Chris, are you there?","Operator","Chris your line is open, you need to un-mute your line, if you are muted. Our next question comes from Javier Escalante with Consumer Edge Research.","Javier Escalante","Hi good morning everyone. My question has to kind of the bigger picture of the company's earnings power right, if you step back and look at 2015 you got 25% impact of currency and yet deliver, if my calculation is correct, nearly 30% currency neutral earnings. This year you\u2019re targeting something about 20% currency neutral earnings. So if you can help us understand kind of like this sustainability of that, how much of this earnings growth in 2016 has to do with savings versus leverage versus that kind of smart because one of the things that are not seen now is that the share repos are coming down relative to the past, so basically the financial side of the EPS growth is less of a contributor. So if you can explain us what is - what do you think is the earnings power of this company because 20% on top of 30% currency neutral EPS growth is pretty substantial? Thank you.","Thomas Falk","Yes Javier, I think maybe the way to think about it is looking at the net of price of currency and raw material inflation or deflation and when you net those three things together, it\u2019s a little smaller drag as we talked about for 2016 is probably a high single digit drag. So then to deliver 3% to 7% growth puts your real earnings power more in the low double-digit range which is still above where our historical average has been.","So the things that helped us get further along in 2015, it will help us again in 2016. There has been strong volume growth and so good organic top line and a strong cost savings program and we\u2019ve been ramping that up over the years and it\u2019s been never more important than in times like this. And so, if you look at the organic top line drivers we feel pretty good about the innovation program that we\u2019ve got as well as a portfolio of markets that we\u2019re growing and where the categories are still growing there is still opportunity for geographic expansion.","On the cost savings front, the three factors that are driving us there are negotiated material savings, our basic productivity programs and material specification changes and we are getting organized to deliver that on a even more consistent basis going forward with some of the works that we\u2019re doing with a new global supply chain leader. So I feel pretty good about volume growth and our cost savings performance and hopefully that delivers the earnings power, it overcome some of the currency drag and other things that we have got facing us.","Javier Escalante","And finally on North America again, tissue pricing in North America down 2% is that a temporary promotional activity or do you see think that this is elements of the pass through of lower commodity prices starting to kick in and is it something that is led by you or is it something more of a reaction to say your competitors, thank you.","Thomas Falk","Yes, on the tissue front they didn\u2019t really get too much of benefits from deflation in the year and more of it was oil related which benefited the Personal Care segment. They got a little bit of transportation benefit from lower diesel and things like that but beyond that it wasn\u2019t much benefit from deflation. The pricing was a little bit more competitive in the marketplace and we tried to make sure we matched up to that. ","I think any time you have a discussion about this it is always the other guy that started it. So I\u2019m sure there are some cases where we were aggressive behind innovation and trying to drive our business and that may have precipitated a response or maybe the converses through. But I do think the overall market was a little bit more competitive. We\u2019ve seen that for several quarters and we feel good about the volume performance. We grew share in 5 of 6 of the North American consumer tissue categories and we saw good margin improvement behind cost savings. So overall, I think the execution was there and we delivered on the plan and expectations for the year.","Javier Escalante","But as if I understand correctly, so you basically see the Q4 is slightly aggressive pricing as something more like a one off I suppose to the pass through finally kicking in because the category has been very positive, so in terms of very constructive in terms of pricing, do you think that this is sustainable into 2016?","Thomas Falk","You haven\u2019t seen much commodity benefit again, so our forecast is calling eucalyptus data a little bit in \u201916 so, that will help at the movement I\u2019d say the competitive environment is going to be a pretty similar in \u201916 to what it was in \u201915.","Javier Escalante","All right, thank you very much.","Thomas Falk","Okay, thanks Javier.","Operator","Our next question comes from Nick Moody [Ph] with RBC.","Unidentified Analyst","Yes, thanks. Hey, I was wondering if may be you can give us kind of a state-of-the-union on category growth globally? I mean clearly we\u2019ve seen some dramatic headlines on the economies in general across the world, but just curious what you\u2019re seeing from a category perspective, and you are expected to be flat going into 2016 or kind of decelerate or accelerate any thoughts around that would be helpful?","Thomas Falk","Yes, I'd say broadly we still let\u2019s say the category opportunity is 3% to 4% on average. If you look at a market like China, we'd still say high single digit growth. It is going to be the year of the monkey in China which is a good year and so you typically have a little bit of an uptick in the birth rate, restarts with the forecasters were calling for, the birth rate in the U.S. is actually ticking up. I\u2019d say there are places we're watching our markets like Brazil and the Ukraine which are going negative where the GDP is as happened to see us as a very short term category issue or is there a bigger trend in place? But let\u2019s say if you guess the category growth rate was three to four or may be rounding down closer to three reflecting some of the challenges in some markets around the world.","Unidentified Analyst","Great and then just one last question, as you take pricing in many of these emerging markets, have you seen the price gaps and dislocate with some of the local players that may not be under the same currency pressures, just any context on the magnitude of may be some of the dislocation would be helpful?","Thomas Falk","Yes, most local markets we are playing in local currency and so you\u2019re turning to look at transaction exposure as the driver for pricing. So and most of these places most of the competitors including local players, by pulse this is denominated in dollars or they buy super absorbent that\u2019s denominated in dollars or they buy not lot of them that are using polymer that's priced in dollars. And so, there is a transaction exposure that affects everybody and that tends to drive pricing more than trying to price for the translation exposure.","Unidentified Analyst","Great, thanks so much.","Thomas Falk","Thanks, Nick.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Purcell with J.P. Morgan.","Thomas Falk","Hey, John.","John Purcell","Hi, yes just a little bit of a follow up there on sort of the last comment on the pricing. You guys are looking for a little bit more price mix sequentially in 2016 versus 2015 and the gross margin performance has been amazing with less pricing that what we\u2019re generally seeing from peers, is that something where the markets are, you have good visibility because the markets are letting you take that or it\u2019s pricing that went in later in 2015 that sort of rolling through into 2016 so, I guess just, what\u2019s the visibility is that, more transactional pricing rolling through mix what have you?","Thomas Falk","Yes, there is a mix of that I would say, if you look at the markets where we\u2019ve been most successfully getting pricing is turning to be Latin America, Brazil had, had quite a bit in \u201915 we\u2019ve announced some of the recent currency moves more in '16. We'll see my guess is when Argentina the dust finally settles and the pricing rules right down there more visible there will likely be some pricing opportunities in that market.","Eastern Europe has been the other place where you have seen real currency volatility or everyone in those markets has been pretty aggressive on pricing and so that would account for most of it. If you looked at a lot of the other developed markets like Australia, where there has been a little bit of currency movement or even Western Europe, you\u2019re probably not going to get a lot of pricing for the sized currency moves that you\u2019re seeing there.","It will be very low single digits if at all and so I think, that's sort of the way it's shaking out is we've got a few hotspots where there has been big currency swings where you get price recovery because everybody is being hit with the same wave of transactional cost hits. And then there are lots of other markets where you have and then manage with cost savings and mix or innovation or other things that are going to drive your revenue realization.","John Purcell","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Thanks John.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ali Dibadj with Bernstein.","Ali Dibadj","Hey, guys.","Thomas Falk","Good morning, Ali.","Ali Dibadj","Hey, just a few questions, one is on cash flow sources and uses and if you think first at level of a more detail on the working capital kind of impact this year and then how and why it's expected to go down next year so from the sources perspective? As well as, why your CapEx remains in this kind of billion dollar range even after Europe and how you\u2019re got spun-off so that\u2019s from the sources perspective?","And on the uses side, your buyback range is lower than has historically been the case and if you add that to your dividend guidance you\u2019re kind of the shareholder return seems to be a little bit off course versus what we\u2019ve seen recently and so I\u2019m trying to get a sense of it that\u2019s just kind of macro concerns trying to be cautious or if there is something else going on and I am trying to adjust for Europe and Halyard Health and kind of both those, so both sources of news please.","Maria Henry","Sure, let me take a crack at it and then and Tom can certainly jump in here and let me start with CapEx. We\u2019re fortunate to have a lot of opportunity to invest in high return capital projects that support both our top line growth and savings. As you think about our CapEx, you can think of the spend in three areas, growth which supports expansion capital and also investment behind our innovations.","Cost savings, which is a second category a lot of that supports the four savings that you\u2019re seeing come through and that we talk about. And then the third category on maintenance if we funds are operations to adequately maintain, productive and safe manufacturing environment. So those are the three categories and I think the range of $950 million to $1.50 billion is about right for our business now given the opportunities that we haven and the size of our operations and the opportunities that we have for expansions in some of the geographies.","We\u2019ll continue to monitor that over time. As you know we hired a head of global supply chain and wondering how our organizations will work with the finance team and the local operators to make sure that we continue to make sure that we\u2019re optimizing our CapEx spend as we move forward.","On working capital, I said that I thought out working capital usage was a bit higher than we'd like it to be. I think they are areas of opportunities that we have in 2016 are around areas like inventory. We talked about strong performance on payables in 2015 and so, again with our global supply chain organization working with our local teams will be focusing on what we can do on the inventory side and then in \u201815 we also had some negative impacts on working capital from currency on our derivative settlements that we used to manage our exposures on the balance sheet, and then also we had a large tax receivable that moved up into AR at the end of the year, so when you look at the numbers after in there, that\u2019s in there too.","I think the third part of your question was around buybacks and that is back to what I said earlier that we\u2019re very focused on maintaining our single A credit rating. So there is, as you know at certain metrics around single A and we watch those very closely and then look at how did the cash flows come in and make sure that we fund the dividends in that churn business through CapEx and then the remainder just remains how much we buyback and we use the cash flow and then any capacity that we have on the debt side within that A rating to really fund buybacks. So depending on where the results of the operations come in will depend on the flex \u2013 within the range on the share buybacks for 2016.","Ali Dibadj","Okay, okay and I guess it has been over the past several years you've certainly been giving back more \u2013 then you have been carrying from few capital perspective so that obviously has an impact going forward. Switching gears on taking prices up more in the particularly developing an emerging markets, I mean the FX headwinds for both the Personal Care and the Consumer Tissue business in this quarter, has been there for a while and been quite significant. So like negative 23%.","We\u2019re only talking about 6% price mix say in those in that market or in the Personal Care business. So there is still a very large gap between the currency and what you\u2019re taking from a pricing perspective. In your goal of taking prices further up, what gap should we think about between those two numbers as a target?","Thomas Falk","Well the way to think about it in terms of how we\u2019re approaching it is, we are not necessarily trying to cover the translation exposure, which is probably the biggest piece of it, we are trying to cover the transaction exposure, but as you look at our net income impacts that also includes things like the balance sheet re-measurement in Argentina that flow through other expense or any other hedging gains or losses.","And so, they\u2019re looking more like the run rate transaction exposure and the impact on imported materials and what their ongoing cost of goods is going to be and using that to think about pricing going forward and then balancing that with what your innovation plan looked like, what are the things can we do to substitute the local source material and avoid the transaction exposure and so it\u2019s a market by market approach.","And again I would say in Latin America and Eastern Europe is where you found both of those markets are just I'd say used to dealing with high inflation and so when you get hit with this people aren\u2019t shy about taking price, but other markets you\u2019re not going to see that in Korea, you\u2019re not going to see that in Australia.","Ali Dibadj","And so my last question is a little bit on that in terms of just the growth rates you\u2019ve seen obviously in developing and emerging have been still very strong. You have to decelerate a little bit to high single digit as opposed to low doubles, but still very, very strong. Can you try to help again with how much of that is kind of shelf space gaining or distribution gaining versus same-store sales and focus if you could and then answer a little bit on China, specifically given the massive volume improvements you\u2019ve seen in massive growth you\u2019ve seen volumes as opposed to pricing and perhaps you guys have seen it we\u2019ve certainly seen it the disconnect in the Nielsen data in China which clearly is not perfect if you think of all channels, but there is a very quick deceleration in the backend of the quarter last year and do you see that being in disconnect because online is growing more or the data is good or what\u2019s going on there because you\u2019re going to have to continue to get very good numbers in terms of growth in China to make some of your top line targets for this year, so I\u2019m trying to figure out data and how that\u2019s a disconnect there?","Thomas Falk","Yes and I think the biggest disconnect is e-commerce in China, Ali and so Singles Day was November 11 which was huge for us as well as for all of the online players. So that probably skewed the Nielsen data which tends to look at measured and baby stores because there was a lot of online activity in particularly in November. But again I\u2019d say if you were to decompose our growth in China, we increased the number of cities and I think we started the year at 105, we ended the year at 115, we'll be at 130 by the end of this year.","Now each incremental city is incrementally a little bit smaller, but we still are seeing good geographic expansion. We\u2019re still growing share in the cities that we\u2019re in. We\u2019re doing a ton in e-commerce and that channel is growing pretty dramatically in China and so it\u2019s probably a third of our diaper sales were in e-commerce which is overweighed the rest of the categories. We\u2019re still seeing good mid-tier super premium segment growth where we tend to do better. So again, I\u2019d say China we are pretty bullish, lots of competition but good growth in innovation coming and some geography expansion as well.","Ali Dibadj","Thanks very much.","Thomas Falk","Yep, thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.","Lauren Lieberman","Oh, thank you.","Thomas Falk","Hi Lauren.","Lauren Lieberman","Hi sorry. I just wanted to know if you could update us on your fiber mix because I thought it was interesting you didn\u2019t mention you are planning assumptions for Northern Softwood. So I was just wondering what the balance was between Eucalyptus and Northern Softwood currently?","Thomas Falk","Yes we\u2019ve been talking about eucalyptus for a while that is the biggest grade that we buy, so I don\u2019t know Paul, it\u2019s probably what two thirds of our fiber mix on the virgin pulp side I would guess, is that right?","Paul Alexander","It would be two-thirds of if you\u2019re just looking at Eucalyptus versus Northern Softwood, then also consume some fluffed pulp and [indiscernible]. So overall I\u2019d say Eucalyptus is still roughly half of our fiber mix.","Thomas Falk","So, it\u2019s a bigger single grade, which is why we started quoting that one versus Northern Softwood.","Lauren Lieberman","Okay, and do you have a range for the Northern Softwood outlook?","Paul Alexander","We have not given a range, I mean but it should be down a little bit year-on-year.","Thomas Falk","We\u2019re part of this take whatever receives as looking as essentially what our forecast would be.","Lauren Lieberman","Okay. Do you have a sense for how your fiber mix currently compares with some of your bigger competitors in tissue in North America, like is there a difference in terms of your fiber mix and then obviously what you are looking for in terms of inflation or deflation versus your competitors?","Thomas Falk","So I haven\u2019t looked at that in a while my guess would be laws that were pretty similar to P&G and GP might have a little bit more variability just because some of their tissue mills are more connected to their own internal pulp sources, but that would be might my hypothesis. And then on the K-CP front we all run with a lot of recycle fiber on that front, so we will be pretty similar on the K-CP front.","Lauren Lieberman","Okay and then move to Eucalyptus, do you think that happened kind of in parallel or was P&G more biased towards Eucalyptus earlier then you were?","Thomas Falk","Well, I think this is probably more fiber morphology than you are interested in on a Monday morning, but Eucalyptus helps make tissue soft, but it is not as strong as Northern Softwood. So you get that right now, Hardwood makes it soft and Softwood makes it weak or makes it soft or makes it strong. So we\u2019ve been trying to drive more softness and use more Eucalyptus and you\u2019re trying to figure out what is to make the tissue stronger using other mean so that you don\u2019t give up the strength that Northern Softwood will bring you. So, but I think there are even some markets where we\u2019ve run a 100% Eucalyptus sheet and are able to do that and still hit adequate strength targets.","Lauren Lieberman","Okay, all right. Thank you so much.","Thomas Falk","All right, thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jason English with Goldman Sachs.","Thomas Falk","Hey, Jason.","Jason English","Hey good morning folks. Thanks for squeezing me in. I guess I'll pick up one question\u2026","Thomas Falk","Hey Jason, we take all our calls here this morning. So yes, we'll be here until you guys run out of questions.","Jason English","Oh goodness, hopefully I\u2019m the last. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll just want to be on the call all day. But I\u2019m going to take up where we left the last one of the questions around fiber and the outlook many people including ourselves see downside risk to pulp prices as we go to next year clearly your forecast is not coined for that only modest deflation. Curious first if there are factors you see into that that would prevent more downside to where pulp prices go?","Thomas Falk","Yes that\u2019s a tough one to call, we tend to just look at the, we take two or three industry forecast - being one and I think we\u2019ve looked at a couple of others and we don\u2019t apply an immense amount of judgment to that. We tend to take a look at what the predictions are calling for. I do think the weakening of the U.S. dollar in some of these local markets may not be fully captured in the forecasters because they\u2019re looking at forward currency rates as well.","And so if you look at our Brazilian producer who is selling their products in dollars or Canadian producers selling their products in U.S. dollar there is certainly you could make an argument that there could be some price decline.","From a capacity standpoint, there the Canadian market should be pretty stable for a while, they have to run their mills this time of the year or they freeze up, there is some additional capacity coming on in Brazil, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be until the end of 2016. So we will see what happens at this point \u2013 we\u2019re not \u2013 we are seeing a little bit of weaker spot prices for Northern Softwood, but the Eucalyptus market has been relatively balanced and there is not a huge spot market on that at this stage.","Paul Alexander","And Jason, I would just add that remember as we talked about earlier these are lot of big moving pieces in our planning assumptions but think about all of them together, so if pulp does weaken more than we are expecting you could see some offsets in a bit higher promotion spending.","Jason English","Sure, especially in context of the higher promotional spending without any cost relief this past year, you talked a little about those dynamics earlier, can you elaborate more and give us a sense of sort of where you see the competitive activity settling out now and if we do see pulp relief how much worse do you think it could get?","Thomas Falk","I would say the competitive activity has been relatively modest in tissue. We've been \u2013 we've had a lot of news between Viva Vantage. We've had some improvements on Kleenex. We've had some upgrades on Cottonelle and so we want to make sure we get our fair share of the quality promotional support as have some of our other competitors. The good news is you didn\u2019t see much private label movement in the fourth quarter I think private label shares were pretty flat.","I think it was private label is up half a point on the year on bath, was up a little more on towels, but we were up in both categories so I think it is just the normal competitive environment and we'll see what happens going forward if you do see a big move in pulp that typically would lead to a change I think relatively modest moves that we are talking about, shouldn\u2019t have a major impact on promoted pricing.","Jason English","Got it. Thanks a lot guys, I'll pass it on.","Thomas Falk","All right, thanks Jason.","Operator","And at this time we have no further questions in the queue.","Paul Alexander","All right, thanks everyone for the questions and we'll conclude with a comment from Tom.","Thomas Falk","Well, once again we wrapped up the year with a very solid performance in 2015. We've got great momentum and we appreciate your support of Kimberly-Clark.

At that time, instructions will be given as to the procedure to follow if you would like to ask an audio question.","It is now my pleasure to introduce today\u2019s first presenter, Mr. Paul Alexander.","Paul Alexander","Thank you and good morning everyone. Welcome to Kimberly-Clark\u2019s year-end earnings conference call. Here with me today are Tom Falk, Chairman and CEO; Mark Buthman, Senior VP and CFO; and Mike Azbell, Vice President and Controller. ","Now here is the agenda for the call. Mark will begin with a review of our 2014 results, focusing mostly on the full year. Tom will then provide his perspectives on our results and then address the [indiscernible], and we\u2019ll finish with Q&A. As usual, we have a presentation of today\u2019s materials in the Investors section of our website. That presentation and this morning\u2019s news release both include our detailed planning assumptions for 2015.","As a reminder, we will be making forward-looking statements today. Please see the Risk Factors section of our latest annual report on Form 10-K for further discussion of forward-looking statements. We\u2019ll also be referring to adjusted results and outlook. Both exclude certain items described in this morning\u2019s news release. The release has further information on these adjustments and reconciliations to comparable GAAP financial measures.","And now I\u2019ll turn it over to Mark.","Mark Buthman","Thanks, Paul. Good morning. Let\u2019s start with the headlines for the year. First, we generated mid-single digit growth in organic sales and adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations. Second, we improved our margins, boosted by significant cost savings; and third, we delivered another strong performance managing our balance sheet.","Now let\u2019s cover the details of our results. Fourth quarter sales were $4.8 billion, down one point versus prior year. That brought full-year sales to $19.7 billion, up one point compared to 2013. If we exclude currency and restructuring impacts, our organic sales were up 3% for the quarter and 4% for the full year. Our momentum in KC International continues to be strong as organic sales were up 7% in the fourth quarter and 10% for the full year.","Fourth quarter adjusted gross margin was 33.9% with the full year at 34.3% - that\u2019s up 20 basis points year-on-year. Adjusted operating margin was 15.9% in the fourth quarter, 16.1% for the full year - that\u2019s up 70 basis points compared to the prior year. I was really encouraged to see our operating margins up in North America, in Europe, and in KC International. ","We delivered $320 million of force cost savings in 2014. That\u2019s the second-highest amount we\u2019ve ever achieved. We expect another strong year in 2015 with a savings target of at least $300 million for the year. In addition, we expect to deliver $60 million to $80 million in savings from our 2014 organizational restructuring program.","We absorbed $240 million of input cost inflation in 2014. Currencies were also a drag on earnings. Translation was a $75 million negative and transaction effects were also unfavorable.","Equity income was down 29% in 2014, and that\u2019s well below our original plan for the year. That was driven by performance in KC de Mexico, which continues to face challenging economic and competitive conditions in Mexico. Because the Mexican peso has depreciated significantly over the last few months, we now expect that equity income will be down somewhat year-on-year in 2015. ","Fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.35, bringing the full year to $5.51. That\u2019s up 5% year-on-year. That growth is consistent with the 4% to 7% target we set at the beginning of 2014. ","Our overall capital management was strong in 2014 as well. We continue to allocate capital in shareholder-friendly ways. Cash from operations was healthy at $2.8 billion, although we were down somewhat year-on-year. Comparisons were impacted by higher tax payments and transaction costs related to our spin-off of the healthcare business. We reduced primary working capital in 2014 with a seven-day improvement in our cash conversion cycle. Return on invested capital improved nicely, climbing 160 basis points to 19.1% for the year.","We returned $3.3 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends in 2014, and for 2015 we expect to repurchase $800 million to $1 billion of KMB stock. Regarding the dividend, we expect a mid-single digit increase this year, consistent with our growth and adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations in 2014. ","So now let me briefly recap segment results for the year. In personal care, organic sales rose 6%, continuing our track record of delivering strong growth in this segment. Full-year operating margins were solid at 18.7% - that\u2019s an increase of 90 basis points. Moving to consumer tissue, organic sales were up 2%. Operating margins of 16% were up 110 basis points, driven by cost savings and higher net selling prices. Lastly, KC Professional organic sales increased 4%, operating margins were a healthy 17.8%, although they were down slightly year-on-year. ","Now I want to cover two additional topics, and I\u2019ll start with Venezuela. As you\u2019d expect, we\u2019ve been closely monitoring events and conditions in the country for some time. Given the increased uncertainty and inconsistent liquidity, at the end of the year we decided to move from measuring results at the official exchange rate of 6.3 bolivars per U.S. dollar to using the government SICAD II floating exchange rate. The SICAD II rate has been trading at about 50 bolivars per dollar recently. As a result of this change, we re-measured our year-end balance sheet in Venezuela at the SICAD II rate with a resulting charge to earnings of $462 million. Looking ahead for 2015, using the SICAD II rate to translate results in Venezuela will reduce total company sales by about 3% and adjusted operating profit by about 4%. ","Now to wrap up, starting next quarter we\u2019ll be making a small change in how we talk about our businesses outside of North America. As you know, we\u2019ve spent the last year bringing our European operations together with our KC International organization. That integration is right on track, and as a result starting next quarter, we\u2019ll describe our businesses outside of North America in two groups: developing and emerging markets, and developed markets, and that will replace KC International in Europe. Developing and emerging markets will comprise Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Africa, Latin America and Asia Pacific, and will exclude Australia and South Korea. Developed markets will consist of western and central Europe, Australia and South Korea. ","So for some perspective, in 2014 our D&E markets business represented 33% of our company sales, 30% if you take into account the currency rate change in Venezuela. The business generated organic sales growth of 11%, excluding Venezuela, and improved operating margins year-on-year. We expect high single digit to low double digit organic growth in 2015 for our developing and emerging markets business. Our developed markets business was approximately 21% of company sales in 2014. Organic sales were up 1% with healthy and improving operating margins.","That wraps up my comments, and I\u2019ll turn it over to Tom.","Thomas Falk","Thanks Mark, and good morning everyone. I\u2019ll share my perspective on our full-year 2014 results, and then I\u2019ll address our outlook for 2015.","So let\u2019s start with 2014. We delivered on our financial commitments while making strategic changes to further improve our company. As Mark just mentioned, our organic sales grew 4% in 2014, and that was right in line with our long-term target. KC International had another great year, including excellent progress with our key growth initiatives. For example, in our diaper business in KCI, organic sales were up 25% in Eastern Europe, 25% in China, and 10% in Brazil. We continue to benefit from innovation in these markets, and in China Huggies diapers are now sold in 105 cities, and that\u2019s up from just 90 cities at the end of 2013. We\u2019re targeting to be in 115 cities by the end of this year.","Our feminine care organic sales rose as a double-digit rate in KC International. We continue to grow our brands and launch innovations in this category around the world. Our adult care organic sales were also up double digits in KCI, and baby wipes rose high single digits. ","Elsewhere in KC International, our KC Professional sales, organic sales were up double digits. This is now a billion-dollar business for us with attractive margins, so we\u2019ll be making additional investments in this part of our portfolio to drive further growth in the future. ","Moving to our North American consumer business, we generated solid sales growth and launched innovations on several brands in 2014. That included Viva towels, Goodnites youth pants, Huggies baby wipes, and our Poise and Depend adult care brands. Our North American market shares were up or even with the prior year in six of the eight categories that we track. One of our businesses had a soft year in North America, and that was mainline Huggies diapers. To improve our performance in 2015, we will be making investments in innovation, marketing and relative value to key competition.","Turning to KC Professional in North America, we delivered high single digit volume growth in safety products while volumes were down in washroom. We have made some investments to be more competitive in this category, and with better execution and an improving U.S. economy we expect to drive more growth in this business in 2015. ","Mark\u2019s already highlighted how we continue to manage our company with financial discipline, so I\u2019ll just add that I\u2019m pleased with our cost savings, our margin improvement and our cash returns to shareholders during the year. I\u2019m also pleased that we delivered on our bottom line growth target in a challenging environment.","We also made some important strategic changes to the business this past year. We successfully executed the spin-off of our healthcare business, and that\u2019s allowed both Kimberly-Clark and Halyard Health to further increase focus on their own strategies. We initiated our 2014 organization restructuring. This will help us improve our efficiency, will offset the impact of stranded overhead costs from the spin-off, and will increase our flexibility to invest in future growth. We expect to make significant progress with this program in 2015. ","We also completed our European strategic changes initiative and we are realizing the benefits we expected. Over the past two years, our European consumer business has increased operating profit by 10% and improved operating margin by 300 basis points, and we\u2019re growing volumes in our high margin childcare and baby wipes businesses.","So all in all, I\u2019m encouraged with our accomplishments in 2014 and our teams are focused on driving further improvements going forward.","Now let\u2019s move to our outlook for 2015. The environment has become significantly more volatile recently, particularly with currency rates and commodity cost, so planning in this environment has become much more dynamic. Regardless, our teams continue to focus on our global business plan strategies and the fundamentals that create long-term shareholder value. In 2015, we\u2019ll leverage our brands, our growth initiatives, our innovations and marketing investments to drive organic sales growth. We\u2019ll deliver healthy levels of cost savings to improve our margins and fund reinvestments in the business, and we\u2019ll generate strong cash flow, improve our return on invested capital, and allocate capital in shareholder-friendly ways.","In terms of our specific 2015 targets, on the top line we expect organic sales growth of 3% to 5%. We\u2019ll continue to focus on driving rapid growth in personal care and KC Professional and developing in emerging markets. We will launch innovations throughout our businesses. Near-term activity in North America will include upgrades on Huggies diapers, Huggies baby wipes, and in our adult care business. Internationally, we\u2019ll introduce new or improved products across a number of categories. To support our innovations and growth initiatives, our advertising spending should be up somewhat as a percent of sales. ","On the bottom line, we\u2019re targeting adjusted earnings per share in the range of $5.60 to $5.80. That\u2019s up 2% to 5% compared to adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations in 2014. Similar to this past year, we expect that earnings in 2015 will be higher in the second half of the year as compared to the first half of the year.","Like other multinational companies, we\u2019re facing significant currency headwinds. Including the rate change in Venezuela, we expect that translation effects will reduce our sales by 8% to 9% and reduce earnings by 9% to 10%. Adding in transaction effects, currency is likely to hurt our bottom line by more than 15% in 2015. ","On the commodity front, the outlook has improved some in the past three months, but at this point we are not planning for a big commodity windfall. Oil-based costs have started to fall recently, but not nearly as much as the drop in oil prices. We expect pulp costs, including secondary fiber, to be similar to last year or even up slightly. We\u2019re also assuming that local inflation will continue in some of our international markets. Adding it all up, our plan assumes cost deflation in 2015 of zero to $150 million. At the midpoint, that\u2019s only a two point benefit to the bottom line, so the primary ways that we\u2019ll offset currency headwinds will be by raising selling prices where we can, delivering cost savings, and controlling our overhead spending. ","We will continue to focus on cash generation and capital allocation in 2015. Cash provided by operations should be similar to 2014 or perhaps up somewhat, despite the lost cash flow from the spun-off healthcare business. We expect to allocate at least $2.1 billion to dividends and share repurchases in 2015. That represents a cash return of about 5%, based on our current market capitalization. ","So in summary, we delivered on our growth targets in 2014 while making strategic changes to improve our company. We continue to focus on the fundamentals that drive our long-term performance and we remain optimistic about our prospects to generate attractive shareholder returns. ","That wraps up our prepared remarks, and now we\u2019ll begin to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions]","Our first question comes from Ali Dibadj with Bernstein.","Ali Dibadj","Hi. A few questions for you. One, I wanted to dig a little bit deeper into North American consumer tissue, given the price mix was down quite a bit. I get that you\u2019re rolling off the sheeting, I get that there is competitors in the marketplace, Georgia Pacific in particular that was aggressive. But can you tell us a little bit of how you think it should go forward? You said pricing actions. I wanted to get a sense of what you think that should look like going forward, and if you can give us any more detail if it is a capacity issue - I know we\u2019ve all heard about [indiscernible] capacity coming online, if there\u2019s anything around that that you think is more sustainable from a pressure downwards. ","Thomas Falk","Yes, I guess the way I\u2019d look at this, Ali, is probably the fourth quarter was more of a year-on-year impact than timing of promotions. If you looked at it sequentially, I\u2019d say tissue pricing in the market was pretty similar third quarter to fourth quarter; and again, we wouldn\u2019t see a big swing going forward, so I\u2019d say second half was a little bit more competitive than first half, but pulp prices have been pretty stable and aren\u2019t moving around very much, so there\u2019s not a lot of driver for competitive pricing at this point in time.","Ali Dibadj","Okay, so the capacity issue is not an issue, it sounds like, so no change there?","Thomas Falk","I mean, I think industry operating rates are still hovering around 90%, so that may be down a tick. As we look at the industry capacity increase in 2015, it looks like there\u2019s maybe net 1% additional capacity coming online. That\u2019s pretty much what the market grows every year, so there is not a huge imbalance at this point in time. So I\u2019d say we\u2019re cautiously optimistic about how that will play out.","Ali Dibadj","Okay, two other ones, one on Venezuela. Just wanted to get a sense of what\u2019s changed over the past several months that makes you change the way you\u2019re accounting for it, and moreover as we look at it going forward, how much historically, w whether it be between consumer tissue or personal care, you are benefiting from price mix from Venezuela that affects KCI, and we see good price mix in Latin America, for example, for PC, how much of that was Venezuela and how we should expect that going forward. So what\u2019s different and then kind of going forward on the Venezuela pulling out from a price perspective.","Thomas Falk","Yes, you know, I think it\u2019s something that Mark and I have been spending a lot of time watching and working with Elane Stock and the KC International team to kind of monitor what\u2019s going on on the ground in Venezuela. Really if you look at what happened with the oil price shock and that economy is so dependent on oil, we really expected probably some other deflation or devaluation action to happen, and we got to the end of the year and felt like it was the right thing to do, to move to a rate that was maybe more reflective of economic reality on the ground.","We\u2019re still getting foreign exchange at the 6-3 rate, but translating in our U.S. dollar results felt like we should use a rate that was a little closer to the economic reality, so something that we spent a lot of time thinking about and talking about in the fourth quarter. But the drop in oil prices certainly made a difference. ","It\u2019s also a key that we--you know, as we said in the last call, that we\u2019ve kept our U.S. dollar exposure there, and so we started to take some down time in the country due to lack of foreign exchange, and that also was a factor in our decision. ","In terms of the impact on Venezuela, it\u2019s been about a one point tailwind to KCI growth if you look at it in total, or if you took Venezuela out of the KCI growth rate, it\u2019d probably drop by about a point, if that makes sense.","Ali Dibadj","It does help. So last question, and it\u2019s something I asked a little while ago, a few years ago actually, and I just want to revisit it and get your point of view again, which is 2014, dividend plus repurchase was $3.3 billion, which was very impressive. But yet again, that was higher than your free cash flow, as it has been for the past several years, and it sounds like back of the envelope it will probably be the same type of return to shareholders higher than your free cash flow in 2015 as well. I want to get a sense of how you think about that, especially as you describe in a more volatile environment, and whether it\u2019s sustainable.","Thomas Falk","Yes, that\u2019s a good question. In 2014, basically the difference was the Halyard dividend, and so as part of the spin, we pulled the Halyard dividend out, so that boosted us up to the top end. But Mark, maybe you want to give a little bit more color on 2015 and how you\u2019re thinking about that.","Mark Buthman","Yes Ali, I think it\u2019s a fair assessment. As the company grows, we\u2019ve grown our balance sheet a little bit in line, but our target is to be a solid single-A credit. Heading into the year, we expect free cash flow to equal dividends and share repurchases. This year coming into the year, our outlook was to increase debt just a little bit associated with the healthcare spin, and we felt we had a little bit of capacity. But there\u2019s nothing changed about our target to be a solid single-A, and we watch those metrics pretty closely.","Ali Dibadj","Okay, thanks for all the answers. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Ferrara with Wells Fargo.","Chris Ferrara","Thanks guys. Good morning. So I guess you\u2019re looking for one to two points of pricing in \u201915. You did about two in \u201914. I guess I\u2019d like to get a sense of your confidence level that you\u2019ll be able to take incremental pricing, especially in light of where crude is sitting, from a competitive standpoint, and how much of that maybe is follow-through pricing that you\u2019ve already taken, like how much is incremental pricing in \u201915.","Thomas Falk","Yes, good question. So a fair amount of it is follow-through, and it\u2019s not going to be broadly based, so it\u2019s going to be targeted in key markets. Where you\u2019ve seen big currency moves, like Russia, Argentina, you\u2019ll see a disproportionate amount of pricing in markets like that. If you see a market like Australia where you\u2019ve had currency weakness, or the euro zone where you\u2019ve seen currency weakness, it will be much tougher to get pricing in those markets, and I think the commodity factor that you mentioned as well will make it more difficult. But in a market like Russia, you could see double-digit, mid-teens kinds of pricing in Russia and Eastern Europe, just because of the shock that you\u2019ve seen to currencies in those markets.","Chris Ferrara","I guess more specifically, I think in the personal care KCI blurb in the press release, you talked about Brazil volume being down there, and relating it to pricing. Is that the risk--I mean, volume fell off pretty markedly, I guess, in KCI without a lot of incremental pricing relative to last quarter. Could you talk about that risk a little bit?","Thomas Falk","Yes, I mean, Brazil we took some pricing on November 1, and so we had a little bit of a late third quarter, early fourth quarter buy-in ahead of that, so it was a little softer in the end of the quarter as a result of that. We were probably--year-over-year, our promotional timing was not quite as heavily back end-loaded, so I\u2019d say overall we felt pretty good about our volume in Brazil being up double digits in diapers for the year. We\u2019ve got great momentum and innovation coming, and I\u2019m expecting them to have a very solid year in 2015.","Chris Ferrara","Thanks. Just lastly, real quick, the mainline Huggies diapers, obviously that\u2019s where you\u2019ve been losing share. You commented on it, and one of the things you noted, I guess, was adjusting relative value to key customers or versus competition. Could you talk about how big a piece price will be to what you end up doing in mainline diapers, and what kind of timeframe you expect that at?","Thomas Falk","Yes, I think value, as you know Chris, is a combination of performance and price, so we\u2019ll make sure that we\u2019re competitive in our promotion calendar, that we\u2019ve got the right amount of display activity, that we\u2019re executing it well at retail. So I wouldn\u2019t expect anything major from a list price standpoint; it\u2019s really more of just making sure we\u2019re executing and more competitive with at least our fair share of display activities at competitive prices in-store, and then we\u2019ll have some product news as well coming with some mainline improvements in late first quarter and additional improvements coming during the year, just to make sure we get off to a better start and have a much better year on Huggies in 2015.","Chris Ferrara","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Olivia Tong with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Olivia Tong","Great, thanks. Appreciate it. On commodities, most of your assumptions are ahead of where current spot rates and external estimates are. Broadly speaking, I understand that many forecasters guess that prices will stabilize higher for oil, but can you give more color on your other forecasts, including pulp, and also what you\u2019re thinking in terms of resin?","Thomas Falk","Yes, from a pulp standpoint and secondary fiber, it\u2019s looking fairly stable in the outlook. I mean, they see some--we\u2019ve actually in recent weeks seen eucalyptus going up a little bit and northern softwood coming down a little bit, secondary fiber has been pretty firm - it\u2019s maybe trended down just a bit, but our outlook for both of those is to be pretty stable during the year. They don\u2019t seem to be affected as much by some of the big currency moves maybe as they have been in the past, and the underlying supply-demand balance has been fairly stable and even tight in some grades of pulp, and in some markets for secondary fiber.","So on the polymer side, we would say that over time it generally follows oil. It seems to be a little slower at this point in time, and there\u2019s been some supply constraints on polypropylene, which we use a lot of, that has held pricing up a little bit more than maybe you would expect. That one\u2019s been the toughest one to forecast, and there aren\u2019t as many good forecasting services out there for that. There is a little bit of a forward market, but it\u2019s not that reliable and not that heavily traded. So we\u2019d expect us to get some benefit on that zero to 150 million of cost deflation, and polymer is a pretty good chunk of that, but that\u2019s the harder one to call for the year, probably.","Olivia Tong","How have your discussions with retailers gone, particularly in the U.S., given what has happened with prices at the pump?","Thomas Falk","Well with the fourth quarter, we still had $55 million of cost inflation in our quarter, so we still had polymer and other materials going up $30 million, pulp was still up $15 million, distribution costs, unrelated to fuel surcharges, but just rates were up $15 million. So we haven\u2019t had any deflation yet to talk about, so I think at this point they\u2019re all watching it closely but it hasn\u2019t been that noisy at this stage.","Mark Buthman","The other perspective I\u2019d add, Olivia, is that as inflation has been moderate for the last few years, we really haven\u2019t recouped that on the way up, so that may help us if costs go down a little bit in 2015. ","Olivia Tong","Got it, thanks. Just if I could follow up with one quick question on the organic sales, you guys give that by key emerging markets. You gave for the full year, but can you give it to us for Q4?","Mark Buthman","Yes, are you referring to the diaper business, Olivia?","Olivia Tong","Right, diapers - Brazil, Eastern Europe - exactly.","Mark Buthman","Yes, so China was up almost 30% in the fourth quarter in diapers, Eastern Europe was up about 25%, and Brazil was down slightly due to the pricing action Tom described.","Olivia Tong","Got it, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bill Schmidt with Deutsche Bank.","Bill Schmidt","Hey guys, good morning. Just had a few questions. So was there any pre-buy ahead of all these price increases, especially in Eastern Europe and Russia, that might have impacted things a little bit on the volume side in the quarter?","Thomas Falk","Not so much in Eastern Europe, and some of their pricing--they\u2019ve been getting pricing all year, and there\u2019s some more going in in the first quarter. As we talked about in Brazil, there was some forward buy that probably boosted late third quarter, very early fourth quarter, and then it was a little lighter in November and December in Brazil.","Bill Schmidt","Okay, thanks. Then did you exit Italy, because I didn\u2019t see a press release, but I looked at some of the Nielsen data and it looks like volumes there are down 30, 40%.","Thomas Falk","No, we\u2019re still selling in Italy in diapers and in tissue, so. I haven\u2019t seen that in the Nielsen data. I\u2019d say our business was a little softer in the fourth quarter, but it wasn\u2019t to that extent. ","Bill Schmidt","Okay, and then as I look at the raw material guidance, the zero to $150 million, you kind of look at the different pieces, maybe I\u2019ll just confirm some of the assumptions. But I thought that every dollar move in oil was $6 million to EBIT, and then you gave us the other assumptions on polypropylene and super-absorbers, and the numbers I\u2019m getting to are significantly higher than your zero to $150 million, so I\u2019m just trying to figure out where I\u2019m wrong.","Mark Buthman","Yes, those are the rules of thumb we\u2019ve given. Those rules of thumb aren\u2019t working right at the moment, so I think eventually they\u2019ll probably work, but it\u2019s going to take a little longer for it to flow through the pipe at this point in time. So yeah, you would expect that over time if oil stays at this level for an extended period of time, that you\u2019ll see more of that flow through, but it\u2019s not going to happen at this point in the first half. We may get a little bit more as the year progresses - we\u2019ll see, but at this point based on what we know, we\u2019re not calling for that windfall to flow through at the same level as our traditional rules of thumb would have indicated.","Bill Schmidt","Yes, the reason I bring it up is that if oil really is--just oil alone is $6 million per dollar move, that alone should be $225 million next year, right?","Mark Buthman","If you got it all in one year, but it\u2019s got to flow through adhesives and packaging materials, and that\u2019s just taking a little longer at this point in time. We\u2019ve seen nowhere near that kind of drop-off in the cost of polymer at this point. It\u2019s come down modestly, and as we said, in the fourth quarter we still had inflation in those material areas so we didn\u2019t see any benefit yet at this stage.","Bill Schmidt","Okay. Not to keep belaboring this, but oil is exclusive to the polypropylene and the natural gas, right, so oil is the $6 million and then it\u2019s the different buys also in the different raw materials - is that correct? So I\u2019m not double counting in terms of the $6 million, right?","Mark Buthman","The oil--the rule of thumb that we\u2019ve given you was intended to kind of roughly cover all of our oil-based materials. We don\u2019t have that much direct oil exposure at all.","Bill Schmidt","Okay, all right. That makes sense. Thanks very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Gail Glazerman with UBS.","Gail Glazerman","Hi, good morning. Could we go back to the North American diaper situation? Your volumes have been pretty weak for a while. Have you started to take any of the actions that you\u2019re talking about, and as you think of your plan for 2015, how concerned are you that with a potential deflationary environment, the competitive environment is only going to get worse?","Thomas Falk","I\u2019d say that\u2019s started, to take some of the competitive action, yet; but it takes a lot longer to effect retail or promotion plans, so much of that work was started in \u201914 and will play out in \u201915. So a little bit better in late fourth quarter, but it didn\u2019t show up much in the numbers. We know it\u2019s a competitive environment out there. It has been, and we\u2019re going to be competing harder and we\u2019ve anticipated that there will be some competitive response in our outlook.","Gail Glazerman","Okay. Can you talk a little bit about what you\u2019re seeing in private label? Obviously Amazon made some noise earlier this week, as well as a few weeks ago. Are you seeing any incremental or less pressure there?","Thomas Falk","I would say the Amazon thing was kind of here and gone fairly quickly, so that one didn\u2019t have much of an impact in the marketplace. It probably generated more media interest than consumer interest, I would say. Private label shares didn\u2019t do much this year, so you\u2019re seeing more of the activity probably has been with Luvs and the value segment has been where more of the action has been this year in terms of share growth.","Gail Glazerman","All right. Can you talk a little bit about North American [inco], just kind of your latest thoughts on how Procter\u2019s return to the market is playing out?","Thomas Falk","Yes, I think they\u2019ve done pretty well on the light end, the part that would compete with Poise. They\u2019ve probably--I think they\u2019ve picked up seven share points. I\u2019d say we\u2019ve lost our fair share, but have defended pretty effectively in terms of promotion; and the category has grown a little bit, so our volume actually was flat overall in the quarter, despite a big competitive launch. We\u2019ve done better on the Depend end of the spectrum where we really haven\u2019t lost any share and have done well in that segment of it. We\u2019ve got more innovation coming in that space and feel pretty good about our business around the world. As we noted, we\u2019ve had double-digit growth in adult care globally as well, so it\u2019s an exciting category, on trend, and we\u2019re going to keep driving hard to get at least our fair share of the growth there. ","Operator","Our next question comes from John Faucher from JP Morgan.","John Faucher","Good morning. Just want to talk a little bit about the view on the promotional environment. This came up a little bit, but right now, given how the competitive environment is looking, the balance between marketing spend and trade promotion, do you feel like you\u2019re in the right situation there, and have you seen any risk of any of the competitors maybe tilting a little bit more towards promotion in advance of some of the raw material benefits flowing through? Then also, can you just talk a little bit about some of the timing of some of your innovation in terms of how we should see that playing out over the course of the year? Thanks.","Thomas Falk","Sure. On the trade versus strategic, I think it\u2019s a little early at this point in time because there hasn\u2019t been much deflation that\u2019s made it into anybody\u2019s P&L yet. On the tissue side, you certainly haven\u2019t seen pulp costs come down significantly, if at all, so that\u2019s not really driving anything there. You\u2019re not seeing it really either on the personal care side that would be driven by oil particularly, so it\u2019s not a factor at this stage and we feel pretty good about our mix of marketing spend going into 2015. We\u2019re trying to make sure we can drive even better performance off the trade money that we spend, so we\u2019d love to drive more volume for the same investment by executing it better at retail and coming up with the right strategic price points, the right kinds of display activity that tie into the things that retailers are supportive of, so we want to get better at that around the world where we can.","So I think from an innovation standpoint, you\u2019ll see some of the diaper stuff happen in first quarter. There\u2019s some adult care activity that\u2019s happening in the first half as well, so pretty strong calendar around the world, but quite a few things getting started already early in the year.","John Faucher","Great, thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.","Lauren Lieberman","Thanks, good morning. Can you talk a little bit about the competitive environment in diaper pants? I know that\u2019s been a place where in emerging markets, you seem to be a bit ahead of the game, but Procter talked about launching a new and improved in the second half of the year, so just curious if you see any change in dynamics in that category in terms of share, or even a deceleration in the diaper pants segment as the economies in emerging markets have been a bit tougher. Thanks.","Thomas Falk","Yes, that\u2019s been a pretty exciting business around the world, and really we\u2019ve been a strong player but also Unicharm and Kao, two Japanese competitors--you know, in Japan diaper pants are the majority of the diaper category, and they\u2019ve got terrific products, so we\u2019ve been competing with them for some time. We have been launching diaper pants pretty aggressively around the world, and Procter has recently kind of entered that part of the category both in China and Russia, and a few other places - Brazil, so there\u2019s a lot going on there. It\u2019s really a strong source of category growth everywhere. Not seeing it slow down at this point in time. I think it will be interesting to see what happens in markets like Russia with the economic activity that\u2019s playing out there, but at this point it didn\u2019t seem to slow anything down significantly in the fourth quarter, so we\u2019ll watch that one closely going forward.","Lauren Lieberman","Great. Also just on Russia, you talked about mid-teens kind of pricing but still had really strong volume. Are you anticipating that volume decelerates because of the pricing, or do you think the consumer is going to be able to bear the pricing?","Thomas Falk","This is a bit of uncharted territory. If Russia and some of the other eastern European economies decline by mid-single digits, which is what some of the forecasters say, we\u2019ll see how that plays out in terms of consumer purchasing power. At this point, our momentum looks pretty good. Our team over there is pretty motivated, and while the size of the P&L is going to wiggle around with the exchange rates, they are really focused on improving the shape of the P&L and making sure they take market share, they drive their innovation hard, they\u2019re improving their margins, trying to get pricing where they can, and come out of it with a much stronger market position as the crisis starts to move forward.","Lauren Lieberman","Okay. Then just finally on KC Professional and kind of the cyclical exposure to an improving U.S economy, in your comments it sounded a little bit like there is some investment in price necessary, so can you talk about in what segments of business that might be, and has that been holding the business back thus far?","Thomas Falk","It\u2019s probably typically been to hold some lower tier volume, where we\u2019ve had to make some price investments to make sure we were competitive, so that\u2019s probably one soft spot. We\u2019re trying to not chase low margin business, but there are some strategic pieces of business that you have a fuller range of products in that you might be more competitive on washroom, if you\u2019ve got their safety and wiper business. But broadly, secondary fiber prices actually have continued to go up, so there have been some industry price increases still in that market as well, so that\u2019s offsetting the kind of price drag to be competitive in some markets with some customers as well. ","But overall, we think that KCP, and we\u2019ve talked to our distributors, they\u2019re looking to have a better 2015 as the U.S. economy continues to recover and employment levels are pretty good, so they\u2019re a little bit more bullish than they were a year ago.","Lauren Lieberman","Okay, great. Thanks so much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Erin Lash from Morningstar.","Erin Lash","Thank you for taking my question. A lot of my questions have been answered at this point, but I was wondering - and you kind of alluded to this a little bit earlier - but I was wondering with regards to just the logistics and transportation costs, if you could talk to whether the degree to which truck driver shortages is impacting you to any meaningful degree and offsetting some of that benefit that you might otherwise see from the decline in oil prices.","Thomas Falk","Yes, as we talked in the quarter, of our $55 million in cost inflation, $15 million was in distribution, and virtually all of that was rate increases related to driver availability. So that has been a big problem for the industry overall, and it\u2019s actually caused us some customer service issues in some of our businesses for periods of time where there was an inability to get trucks in certain lanes. So that\u2019s something that we\u2019ll continue to watch, but that certainly was a bigger drag than any benefit we got from lower diesel prices in the quarter.","Erin Lash","Got it, thank you. That\u2019s very helpful. I was wondering if you could just speak to just across your channel exposure, if there is any opportunity to further penetrate other alternative outlets - dollar stores, or if there\u2019s any areas where you feel you\u2019re under-penetrated to this point.","Thomas Falk","We try to sell our products wherever mom wants to shop, so we\u2019re doing pretty well across the channels. I think we were probably a little late to ecommerce in the U.S. - we\u2019re catching up quickly. We\u2019ve probably been ahead in ecommerce in markets like China, where we\u2019re doing quite well there, but we\u2019re also trying to make sure--you know, there\u2019s a channel of baby stores in China which is very popular, that we do well in. There are small format diaper store in markets like Argentina where they might have 6,000 little tiny mom-and-pop run shops that just sell diapers and baby formula, so our customer teams around the world are constantly challenging to say, where else is mom looking to shop, what\u2019s emerging, how do we make sure we get on the front end of it so that we\u2019re there with the right offer.","Erin Lash","Thank you, that\u2019s helpful.","Operator","Our next question comes from Javier Escalante with Consumer Edge Research.","Javier Escalante","Hi, good morning everyone. I would like to talk about the 2015 forecast for operating profit growth to be up 1% to 4%. In Slide 27, you basically said that the currency impact, including transaction costs, is going to be 15%. So essentially, what is the currency-neutral EPS growth that you guys are planning, like 20%? You cannot get there, even having all the full savings flowing through the P&L, having all the restructuring savings going through the P&L, and even taking $150 million in commodity benefits. You don\u2019t get to 20% operating profit growth. So if you can help me understand this commentary of the currency impact on profits being more than 15%, that would be very helpful.","Thomas Falk","So Javier, was that a question or a performance review? I just was--","Javier Escalante","Well, I don\u2019t see how you can grow currency-neutral profits at 20%.","Thomas Falk","So if you looked at it, it kind of--I\u2019d say it\u2019s a fair question. There are some big moving parts in the P&L, maybe more than we\u2019ve seen in the past, so if you looked at it in big buckets and said, okay, currency translation and transaction is probably $500 million to $600 million, and if we get the price that we\u2019re talking about of one to two points of price, that offsets maybe half of the currency drag. You get some commodity deflation, which is another chunk, so if you can get price and commodity deflation, that probably offsets two-thirds of the currency translation and transaction. Then you\u2019ve got to get benefits of volume growth, benefits of our cost savings program and our organization restructuring program, cover other costs increases, and deliver your profit growth year-on-year. So you\u2019ve got probably bigger buckets of activity moving through the P&L than maybe we\u2019ve had in the past, but the math actually works. ","Javier Escalante","So what would it be, then, the currency-neutral EPS growth that you are forecasting?","Thomas Falk","Well, the question would be, as you said, some of the price we\u2019re getting is because of currency, so--and these things, if you think about currency, commodity costs, and price, they\u2019re all somewhat related. So you could look at it in the absolute sense, but you might be kidding yourself that you could still get all the price in a currency neutral environment.","Javier Escalante","But it\u2019s not that currency-neutral EPS growth, it\u2019s over 20%?","Thomas Falk","Well as you said, if currency translation and transaction is 15-plus, and we\u2019re growing our bottom line EPS 2 to 5, you can do the math and add it to the 15, and that\u2019s the underlying growth. It\u2019s going to come in cost savings, volume improvement, price mix, and commodity deflation. ","Javier Escalante","But do you think that your forecast is conservative or it\u2019s aggressive for 2015, because it seems like everything has to go well to grow EPS 2 to 5%.","Thomas Falk","Well Javier, we usually try to give guidance right down the middle of the fairway, that it\u2019s the best estimate we have at this point in time of what we think is going to happen. I will tell you, there is more big moving parts flowing through the P&L, so if currency moves suddenly in one direction and we don\u2019t recover quickly enough on price, that\u2019s a risk. On the other hand, there have been other questioners on the call saying, well gosh, what if commodities stay down longer and lower than you thought and you get some benefit? So I think we will do the best we can in the environment we\u2019re in, and we\u2019ll give you visibility as we go through the year on how we\u2019re tracking against these big assumptions that we\u2019ve made.","Javier Escalante","Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Connie Maneaty from BMO Capital Markets.","Pat Trucchio","Hey, good morning. It\u2019s actually Pat Trucchio on the call for Connie. Just first, can you talk about some of the big forest projects for the year?","Thomas Falk","Yes. We\u2019ve got three big buckets of activity around forest. One is negotiated material savings, and our global procurement group is ramping up again to deliver against that. They delivered more than $50 million of bottom line benefit in \u201914 and are looking to do that, or even better, in \u201915. Productivity for us is another big opportunity area. We are driving lean continuous improvement, design for value around our organization, and are continuing to get benefits from that and would expect that to be another strong contributor. Then material specification changes, so how can we get even more effective on the product design so that we\u2019re giving mom everything that she wants and able to take cost out of design by the choices we make on that front. ","So those will be three big factors again, and we\u2019d expect that to roll forward to deliver $300 million in cost saves again for another strong year for us. ","Mark Buthman","Pat, we probably have 25% of our capital goes to productivity and waste-type cost savings projects as well, so in addition to just kind of the way we work, we\u2019re also putting some capital behind cost savings and margin improvement. ","Pat Trucchio","Okay. Then lastly, how is Poise Impressa doing in tests? Is the test regional or nationwide, and is it being expanded? When might the product come to market?","Thomas Falk","Yes, that\u2019s really just a test in one market at this point in time, in Kansas City. I haven\u2019t seen the read of the test so far. They\u2019re testing a lot of different combinations down there, so I\u2019ve generally heard it\u2019s going well but I haven\u2019t seen the output, and we\u2019ll have final launch plans once we get a read on the test and what exactly we\u2019re going to do with that. It\u2019s an interesting product, and we\u2019ll see where it plays out.","Pat Trucchio","Okay, great. That\u2019s it for me. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Caroline Levy with CLSA.","Caroline Levy","Good morning. Thanks so much. I\u2019d just like to understand better what happened in U.S. diapers. It just seems a quite dramatic market share loss and volume decline, and if you could just--you know, maybe see what you hadn\u2019t foreseen, because I\u2019m sure this was a lot below your projections.","Thomas Falk","It was about a point share loss sequentially, and I\u2019d say the trend has continued all year. Essentially, Luvs has been the big share gainer - I think Luvs has picked up two share points so far this year. They\u2019ve been on promotion really every week with a particular key retailer, and that\u2019s one that we\u2019ve been working hard to make sure we do better in that particular category with that particular customer. In the meantime, we\u2019re working to drive the business across the country with better product performance, making sure we\u2019re competitive on shelf with the right display activity and the right offer.","So it\u2019s really the basics of execution in that business, and we didn\u2019t do as good of a job as we needed to in 2014, and we will do a better job in 2015.","Caroline Levy","It isn\u2019t just about price, though? I mean, doesn\u2019t it just require you to lower your prices, or shift your mix in order to compete? ","Thomas Falk","No, I mean, I think--well, value is always a function of performance and price, so will we be more competitive on shelf and our promoted pricing? I would expect that will be a part of it, but it will also be product improvements and news and innovation that drive mom\u2019s preference in these categories.","Caroline Levy","So to that point, there\u2019s some optimism about the U.S. consumer. Do you think that we, or are you seeing any signs of consumers being willing to trade up or of demand improving in your U.S. business?","Thomas Falk","Well, when we look at our Huggies super-premium diaper, we are seeing that - we\u2019ve picked up probably half a share point this year on our super-premium Huggies diapers in the U.S., so mom will trade up for real innovation. We\u2019ve got more innovation coming behind that segment of our line-up as well, so it is also focusing on that trade-up consumer. I wouldn\u2019t say we\u2019ve seen an uptick in the numbers of consumers heading in that direction at this stage, but it\u2019s pretty early days in this oil price cycle as well.","Mark Buthman","And Caroline, that\u2019s true across categories. If you look at super-premium bath, it\u2019s growing as a percentage of the category and our share is growing. Our Viva Vantage launch in the super-premium end of the towel category this year has been a case, and continence is largely being driven by the super-premium end of the category. So even through a tougher economic time, the categories are growing not only in the value tier but the super-premium segment as well.","Caroline Levy","Right. Okay, thank you. Then just to ask about Russia, and getting back to if you take double-digit pricing, have you done that already, or is that something that\u2019s coming and therefore the demand impact has not been felt?","Thomas Falk","There were multiple price increases during 2014 as the economic crisis unfolded, and then there is another wave of pricing coming to that market in early 2015 with the recent fall of the ruble.","Caroline Levy","So do you think that the price elasticity is well below one-to-one?","Thomas Falk","I think when you see an economic shock like this, we\u2019re all going to find out what this consumer is going to do in a negative GDP growth environment. But in the meantime, there\u2019s so much of these products are based on imported raw materials, even though we make the diapers in Russia, the polypropylene and packaging materials are all dollar-based, the pulp is all dollar-based, and so you\u2019ve got to get some pricing just to cover the huge shift in the cost of those imported materials in local currency. ","Caroline Levy","Got it. Then just to your equity income line, you talked about Mexico being down because of the peso. If you were to take out the currency impact, would you be--are you seeing a recovery in sort of the local operating dynamics in Mexico, or are you still under pressure there?","Thomas Falk","Well, I think they saw--Mark and I were just down in Mexico earlier this week, and we met with Pablo and Claudio and the team down there. I think their volume growth or their organic growth was up 5% in the quarter, but it was off an easier comp in last year\u2019s fourth quarter. Their shares are stable - they\u2019re north of 60% in bath and diapers, which are their two big categories. It\u2019s a tough competitive market. The consumer is still pretty weak. There\u2019s been lots of reforms down there that have probably affected consumer purchasing power in the short term. On the other hand, they're optimistic that there\u2019s going to be better economic growth and a better consumer environment in the medium to long term. In the meantime, they\u2019ve got a fairly tough peso exchange rate that gives them a little bit of the impact of imported material costs, because a lot of their costs are dollar-based as well. ","So it\u2019s a challenging environment, but we\u2019ve got a very strong position down there and a great team to operate the business.","Caroline Levy","Thank you. I have one last one, just on China and demand there. You\u2019ve done just unbelievably well taking share for a lot of years. Are you seeing anything out there as you head into this year that suggests that the growth is going to slow or that competition has picked up their game, online in particular?","Thomas Falk","There\u2019s lots of competition in China and has been for years. Pretty much every multinational CPG in the world is doing something in China - you know, the Japanese are aggressive competitors, Proctor is aggressive, SCA just bought Vinda, which is a local tissue player, so they\u2019re in there now in some categories. So we\u2019ve got a terrific team, great innovation, and we\u2019re executing pretty well in that market, and that has been translating into terrific business results. So Mike Zhang and our China team, and Achal Argawal and our Asia team have done a great job of executing in that market, and we feel like we\u2019ve got great momentum and more good things coming.","Caroline Levy","Thanks so much.","Operator","Mr. Falk, at this time we have no further questioners in the queue.","Thomas Falk","Well once again, everyone, thank you for your support of Kimberly-Clark. We had a terrific year in 2014 in executing and delivering great value for our shareholders, and we\u2019re headed into a more challenging environment in 2015 but rest assured that our global business plan is pointing us in the right direction. Thank you again.","Mark Buthman","Thank you very much.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today\u2019s presentation. You may disconnect your phone lines and thank you for joining us today."],"12694":["Kimberly-Clark Corporation (NYSE:KMB) Q1 2018 Earnings Conference Call April 23, 2018 10:00 AM ET","Executives","Thomas Falk - Executive Chairman & CEO","Maria Henry - Senior VP & CFO","Michael Hsu - President and COO ","Paul Alexander - VP, IR","Analysts","Lauren Lieberman - Barclays","Jason English - Goldman Sachs","Ali Dibadj - Bernstein","Stephen Powers - Deutsche Bank","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Bonnie Herzog - Wells Fargo","Kevin Grundy - Jefferies","Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets","Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research","Andrea Teixeira - JPMorgan","Caroline Levy - Macquarie","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your patience and holding. We now have your presenters in conference. Please be aware that each of your lines is in a listen-only mode. At the conclusion of this morning's presentation, we will open the floor for your questions. At that time, instructions will be given as to the procedures to follow-up, if you would like to ask an audio question.","It is now my pleasure to introduce today's first presenter, Mr. Paul Alexander.","Paul Alexander","Thank you and good morning everyone. Welcome to Kimberly-Clark's First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. With us today, are Tom Falk, Chairman and CEO; Mike Hsu, Chief Operating Officer; and Maria Henry, our CFO.","Here's the agenda for the call; Maria will start with a review of first quarter results and provide a brief update on our global restructuring program. After that, Mike will share his perspectives on our results and the outlook for the year. We will finish with Q&A, with Tom, Mike and Maria.","We have a presentation of today's materials in the Investors section of our web site. As a reminder, we will be making forward-looking statements today. Please see the Risk Factors section of our latest Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of forward-looking statements.","Finally, we will also be referring to adjusted results and outlook; both which exclude certain items described in this morning's news release. The release has information about these adjustments and reconciliations to comparable GAAP financial measures.","And now, I'll turn it over to Maria.","Maria Henry","Thanks Paul. Good morning everyone. Thanks for joining the call today. Let me start with the headlines for the quarter. We returned to delivering organic sales growth, with a solid increase of 2%. Margins were impacted by significant commodity inflation. Helping to offset that, we delivered strong cost savings and reduced overhead spending, and our adjusted earnings per share increased 9%. And finally, we are on track with our restructuring program and our overall capital plan.","Now let's look at the details of our results. Let me start with sales; our first quarter net sales were $4.7 billion. That's up 5% year-on-year with a three point benefit from currency rates. Organic sales grew 2% in the quarter, led by improved performance in North America. Mike is going to provide some more color on our top line in just a few minutes.","Moving on to profitability; our first quarter adjusted growth margin was 33.8%, down 310 basis points year-on-year. Commodities were a drag of $175 million in the quarter, primarily due to higher pulp costs and secondarily, inflation and other raw materials.","We are now expecting the full year cost inflation will be between $400 million and $550 million. That's a $100 million to $150 million more than we assumed in January. Meanwhile, our FORCE cost savings program continued to deliver strong results. First quarter savings were $90 million.","Moving down the P&L, adjusted operating margins was 17.4%, down 140 basis points. Between-the-lines spending fell 140 basis points as a percent of net sales, as we continue to tightly manage overhead and discretionary spending throughout our company. In a few minutes, Mike will talk about what we are doing to improve margins from the first quarter levels.","All in all, adjusted operating profit was down 3%. In addition to the factors that I just mentioned, results benefitted from volume growth and $20 million of favorable currency translation effect, but were also impacted by lower net selling prices.","On the bottom line, first quarter adjusted earnings per share were $1.71, up 9% year-on-year. That included about seven points of earnings growth from a lower tax rate, along with benefits from lower interest expense and share count.","Turning to cash flow and capital efficiency; cash provided by operations in the first quarter was $542 million compared to $436 million in the year ago quarter. The increase was in line with our expectations and driven by lower tax payments.","We continue to allocate capital in a shareholder friendly way. Dividends and share repurchases totaled approximately $550 million in the first quarter, and we expect the full year amount will total $2.1 billion to $2.3 billion.","Looking at our results by segment; in Personal Care, organic sales were even year-on-year. Volumes and product mix, each improved 1%, offset by lower net selling prices. Overall Personal Care operating margins remain healthy at 20.4%, although down 120 basis points, including impacts from commodity inflation and lower selling prices.","In Consumer Tissue, organic sales rose 5%, volumes increased 7%, while product mix was down two points. Consumer Tissue operating margins of 15.8% were down 340 basis points. Significantly higher pulp costs were partially offset by top line growth, cost savings, and lower between-the-lines spending.","In our K-C Professional business, organic sales grew 2%; volumes increased approximately 2% and price and mix were both also slightly positive. K-C Professional operating margins were 19%, that's up 10 basis points, as our team continued to manage well in this environment.","Now let me share a brief update on our 2018 Global Restructuring Program. Initial implementation steps are underway, and we are on track with our plan.","In terms of our administrative and overhead organizations, in North America, we offered a voluntary severance plan to most of our salaried employees in the first quarter, and that plan is now closed. Soon, we will begin to share more specifics with our workforce, primarily in North America, about our redesigned organization and the resulting implications. We have also announced our intention to move our European shared service center from the U.K. to Poland, in order to reduce our labor costs.","In terms of manufacturing facilities, we have announced our intention to close our Consumer Tissue facility in California, and are planning to close our nonwovens facility in Wisconsin. We continue to expect $50 million to $70 million of restructuring savings in 2018, with the vast majority of these savings occurring in the second half of the year, as our workforce reductions ramp up.","With that, I will now turn the call over to Mike.","Michael Hsu","Thanks Maria. Good morning. I am going to focus my comments this morning on organic sales and our full year earnings outlook. As Maria just mentioned, organic sales grew 2% in the quarter, which is a good start to the year. Performance included benefits from targeted growth initiatives, innovations launched over the past 12 months, and increased investments in our brands.","On our conference call in January, I had talked about our three main growth priorities for the year. Let me now spend a few minutes on each. Our first priority is to strengthen and grow our core businesses. In North American consumer products, organic sales increased 3% in the first quarter, behind volume growth of 6%. Market shares were up or even year-on-year in five of eight product categories, and up or even sequentially compared to the prior quarter in every category.","In Personal Care in North America; volumes increased 3%, net selling prices were down 2%, reflecting increased investment levels that helped our volume performance.","In terms of innovation, in the first half, we are launching product improvements on Pull-Ups training pants, premium Huggies diapers, Huggies baby wipes, Poise pads, and Depend underwear.","In Consumer Tissue in North America, volumes rose 9% compared to a decline of 7% in the year ago period. Results benefitted from increased promotion support, a severe cold and flu season and promotion timing differences compared to last year. Product mix was down three points because of the promotion activity.","Now in terms of product news, we are introducing new Kleenex wet wipes, and bringing major bath tissue improvements to Cottonelle, and part of our Scott line-up. The bath tissue upgrades are shipping now, and come with sheet count reductions. This will improve net realized revenue high single digits on nearly $1 billion in annual sales.","In our K-C Professional business, volumes were up 2% in North America, with growth in all product categories led by wipers. K-C Professional volumes increased 4% in developing and emerging markets, led by Asia-Pacific.","In our developed markets outside North America, organic sales rose 2%. In South Korea, our diaper business continues to be impacted by lower birth rate. However, this was offset by strong results in our other consumer businesses there.","Now let me turn to our second priority, which is to accelerate Personal Care growth in developing and emerging markets. First quarter organic sales for these businesses were even year-on-year.","Looking at some of our key markets; in Brazil, organic sales were up mid-single digits, driven by broad based volume growth. Market shares were up nearly three points in diapers and two points in feminine care.","Elsewhere in Latin America, organic sales were down low single digits. That included lower volumes in Argentina, Chile and Colombia. That said, our market positions are holding up well, including in Argentina, where Huggies share is up 1 point. We expect our sales to pick up in Latin America. We have a number of product innovations launching throughout the region, and we are implementing selling price increases to help offset inflation.","In China, organic sales were down mid-single digits. A strong growth in feminine care was more than offset by lower sales in diapers. We just started to introduce a significantly upgraded Huggies premium diaper, and we have more innovation coming later in the year. We expect these innovations will improve our volume trends in the coming quarters.","In Eastern Europe, organic sales increased mid-teens. Our momentum continues to be strong in this part of the world, with another quarter of double digit volume growth, and share gains on Huggies and Kotex.","Regarding our third growth priority, which is to further build digital and e-commerce capability; we continue to make good progress. Our targeted digital marketing programs, investment in tools to improve capabilities, and customer joint business plans are producing strong results. That was especially true this quarter in North America.","So to summarize our top line, I am encouraged with our start to the year. We know we have more work to do, because we continue to operate in a competitive environment. That said, our first quarter results and our plans going forward give me further confidence in our 1% organic growth target for the year.","Now, let me turn to our earnings outlook. We continue to target full year 2018 adjusted earnings per share of $6.90 to $7.20. That's a year-on-year growth of 11% to 16%. Our teams are taking actions to improve net realized revenue and reduce costs to offset the commodity headwinds we are facing. We expect these actions will help improve our margins from first quarter levels, especially in the second half of the year.","On the revenue front, we are taking steps in several layers of our business. Key actions include the sheet count reductions in North America, and the price increases in Latin America that I just mentioned. In addition, our consumer businesses in other international markets will be raising prices and our K-C Professional team has begun to do the same in most regions.","While many of these initiatives were included in our original plan for the year, our overall expectation for selling price increases has improved slightly from three months ago.","In terms of our focus on costs, more savings should be built from first quarter levels. In addition, as Maria noted, restructuring savings will occur mostly in the back half of the year, and our teams are moving with urgency to accelerate actions. We are also redoubling our efforts to reduce discretionary spending.","In total, we expect these actions, combined with our volume growth initiatives, a slightly better currency outlook, and some flexibility that we built into our original 2018 plan, will enable us to deliver our earnings guidance for the year.","So to summarize, we are off to a good start to the year on the top line and with our market positions. We are taking steps to improve our profitability, and we are broadly on track with our 2018 plan.","Overall, we remain very optimistic about our opportunities to create long term shareholder value through successful execution of our strategies.","That wraps up our prepared remarks, and we will begin to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.","Thomas Falk","Hey, good morning Lauren.","Lauren Lieberman","Hey good morning. Thanks for the question. So I wanted to just ask a little bit about pricing. So I think the sheet count reductions on Consumer Tissues, something where you should probably have very good visibility, have done it many-many times before, and the math is pretty easy to do, thank you for that detail Mike. I was curious though on the Personal Care business, particularly in North America and in Brazil. So one is that in North America, I think we have heard and we heard last week from a major competitor about things just getting a lot tougher on the private label end of the world, in terms of retailers all kind of reacting to each other, will say and the pressure that's putting on the lower end pricing in their portfolio. So I was wondering about your visibility on pricing on North America diapers, how much pressure there is there, and if you really think you can move things up a bit more?","And then in Brazil, some chatter about some deflation in Brazil, on it being a difficult place to get pricing, and I was wondering, to what degree that was critical to your forecast? Thank you.","Thomas Falk","I am going to let Mike elaborate on it, and I guess, I'd say just kind of broadly, as you look at private label shares in North America, they really haven't moved around a lot. Our estimated first quarter private label market share for diapers in North America is about the same as the full year average last year, and actually down slightly from fourth quarter. So maybe we have a little bit different view of it than others might, but I don't know Mike, do you want to add anything else to that, other than comment on Brazil and what's going on with pricing there?","Michael Hsu","Yeah. I think, diapers specifically I think was maybe up half a share point in the quarter in North America. I think, maybe the opportunity for us is, we are evaluating some count reductions on diapers and then the other lever for us in pricing in North America would be fine tuning our trade promotion plans, right? And so, there is always an opportunity for us to adjust our frequency and our depth, and that's what we are evaluating right now.","With regard to Brazil, we had a good start to the year in Brazil. Sales and volume and share were all up pretty good. I will say, we are taking pricing and have taken pricing in Brazil and that feels like that has gone through and the market has responded accordingly.","Lauren Lieberman","Okay. And in North America, the frequency and depth, I mean, is that something that you are seeing competitors move to what's the retailer receptivity to that; because it feels like if anything, retailers are looking at diapers as, whether you [indiscernible] calling it a loss later [ph], but something to drive traffic, bringing in families and etcetera. So I think, that's a category in particular, where they'd be wanting more and more support from their suppliers, rather than less promotional activity?","Michael Hsu","Obviously Lauren, the baby category and mom is very important to retailers, and so they are very focused there. But I do maybe have a different take, which is I think a lot of the pricing activity you are seeing, may have been promotion driven versus retailer strategies. And while I think they all want to be competitive on the diaper business, I think it's, in some ways up to us, to make sure we are managing the business appropriately in the long term. And in this category, I think, innovation, and creating value add and then premiumizing the category over time is really the best way to grow our fixed consumption category, and that's where we are focused on, and I think a lot of the retailers will understand that strategy and approach.","Lauren Lieberman","Okay. Thank you.","Thomas Falk","Thanks Lauren.","Michael Hsu","Thanks Lauren.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jason English with Goldman Sachs.","Thomas Falk","Hey good morning Jason.","Jason English","Hey, good morning folks. Thank you for allowing me to ask a question. Michael, I guess in your prepared remarks, early on, you talked about increased investment in brands to drive growth. You referenced in the press release kind of pulling back, and if we look at the last few years, if you continue to sort of pull back, it looks like this will be the fifth year in a row, that as a percentage of sales, advertising, if not marketing overall, has shrunk. It begs the question of whether or not, you may be underinvesting behind your brands, particularly in the competitive environment. Can you shed your perspective or share your perspective on that, and why we shouldn't be concerned that you may need to reinvest going forward, particularly given the weakening top line, especially in emerging markets? Thank you.","Thomas Falk","Yeah, thanks Jason. Obviously, I think as a long term driver, we do want to grow our investments behind the brands. I think that investment comes multiple ways however, and so I think overall, I think, we are very balanced on our advertising spend. We have increased our promotional spend, and as we saw the markets kind of get competitive towards the back half of last year, we did show some funds in the both consumer and trade promotion.","And as we go forward this year, I think we have got very strong investments, both in terms of product and innovation in China and North America and in Latin America, and we strengthened our execution or merchandising investments in the brand.","Thomas Falk","Jason, just to build on that. I mean, everything we move to digital coupons winds up being a reduction in net sales and showing up as negative price, even though we might argue, that that's a strategic targeting of an individual consumer.","Jason English","Okay. That's helpful. And then, real quick, if you could delve in a bit more into China, the decline there this quarter is a bit surprising. Can you talk a little bit more about what's going on? You are talking about innovation -- you have been talking about innovation. It seems like you have a pretty full product cycle for quite a few years there, like your position in the market has kind of been eroding. Are there more structural reasons that you could be losing ground, perhaps with the Made in China stamp that's on your product? Maybe it's the marketing posture? I am not sure, I am hoping you could shed light on that?","Thomas Falk","Yeah. I have viewed a couple of headlines, Jason, that Mike can build on. I mean, pretty much all the big international branded players lost share in the last quarter, and so, it has been the local Chinese brands that have actually probably picked it up through e-commerce. And so, that's really just in BCC and in fem care, we had a great quarter with strong growth. And so China is a tough competitive market, it's a huge market with huge potential. Where we have got lots of innovation coming and we still believe in the opportunity there, but it's a tough competitive place in the short term. I don't know, Mike, if there is anything else that you want to add to that?","Michael Hsu","Just as Tom said, Jason, I think the China diaper category is under a little bit of pressure from the local players, and we are addressing that with the major launch of a significant product improvement on Huggies. China overall remains our single largest growth opportunity, both in the near term and over the long term. Pricing has been competitive, but I think that's stabilizing, and I really believe, fundamentally in China, well it's not structural, its product, performance and features are still the key driver of brand choice, and that's still what's driving that marketplace.","And so, we are launching our best ever diaper, that delivers a really significant improvement in both thinness, softness, breathability, and absorption. I mean, it's a pretty impressive product. We are excited about it. It's certainly better than what we had out before, and outperforms all major competitors. So we expect that's going to improve our performance, as we get into the back half of the year. Just starting to ship now.","Thomas Falk","It's going to be a competitive market for a long-long time, just given the opportunity there.","Jason English","Sure. Thanks a lot guys.","Thomas Falk","Thanks Jason.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ali Dibadj with Bernstein.","Thomas Falk","Good morning Ali.","Ali Dibadj","Hey, how are you? I have a few things; one is, just to talk a little bit more about the negative price mix dynamics in this quarter, and then kind of going forward, in particular, in North America. Because you guys just said a second ago, the retailers aren't the ones pushing you on price, they kind of have all the more buy-ins from a de-sheeting perspective and tissue at least, and maybe even on a reduced count in diapers that sounded like. But private label, seeing the Nielsen data, and you guys mentioned it, has gone up actually quite a bit, the 50 basis points is not small in the past quarter. And so, let's just even assume the retailers get it? I mean, they are getting private labels in their choice. Let's assume, even the retailers get it, how come you have more confidence that the competitors are getting? PG for example, gets it, that pricing should be more benign going forward, more positive, as opposed to you guys losing lot of share? I am trying to dig into that incremental confidence you have?","Thomas Falk","Maybe I will give you some macro view, and then Mike can give you some details. I mean, number one, if you look sequentially, price for us was negative 2 in the fourth quarter, it was negative 1 in the first quarter. So it did ease a little bit, not a lot, and we have some initiatives in the marketplace, that roughly track commodities, and you see commodities move at this level historically. You typically see some finished product, price recovery, either a pull back in trade, a little bit less depth, and you are starting to see some of that play out in different markets around the world. And so I think, that's not surprising, and we will see how the rest of the year plays out. I don't know, Mike, if there is anything else you want to add to that?","Michael Hsu","No, I mean, Ali, we are trying to be balanced. And obviously, we want to drive the organic growth, but we also want to deliver our margin commitments, and so we are walking that balance. And so the opportunity for us is, we have evaluated opportunities for count reductions and have a few -- quite a few in the plan, but the other opportunity for us is to get more efficient with our trade spending. And you know, we are looking at the competitive marketplace and our field teams have a good sense of what is required to drive the promotional list that we need, and we think we have an opportunity to fine tune it.","Ali Dibadj","So just continuing on that, are you leading the planned price increases?","Thomas Falk","I'd say in general, we are probably matching up globally with competition. And just as an example, we didn't lead it, to be clear.","Ali Dibadj","You did not?","Thomas Falk","We didn't. And some large market examples that have happened recently, we did not lead it.","Ali Dibadj","Okay. And then, from a -- production on pulp pricing, I know you guys are very loyal to the RISI numbers. Can you give us an update on what that's looking like going forward? Last quarter, we all talked about the RISI numbers being perhaps a little bit too positive in terms of pulling the pulp prices down, at least on NBSK, it seems like, towards the end of this year. Can you tell us where that is and how you guys are modeling the prices at this point, on pulp?","Thomas Falk","We use RISI, because they have been the best forecaster out there. I don't know that we are in love with any of them, and I think every pulp forecast that I have ever gotten in my career, just about always had a positive upwards slope and they are only right half of the time. So at this point, every forecast we get lately, pulp prices look like they are going higher than the last one we got. And so, you are certainly -- having seen pulp markets in the past, they can get a bit frothy, as the producers are disciplined on taking downtime and you get some Chinese demand. You can definitely see some upward moves in pulp price, and that's certainly showing up in some of the RISI data we have seen lately, and that's kind of the high end of our forecast range. It's kind of the worse case of what we have seen from RISI lately.","Ali Dibadj","So not tailing off until lower by the end of the year, effectively, what you are saying?","Thomas Falk","I think that's what the current outlook would look like.","Ali Dibadj","Okay. And then my last question is, just this mix between -- I think between the lines, as you call it, or A&P, I guess, spend, as part of between the lines, versus trade spend. I get that you can shift from A&P to an online coupon, and you get a response, it's a transactional response. But is that building brand or are you training the consumer to be more looking for and seeking of deals, so you are actually hurting the brand over the long term? And this is the bait [ph] we have had with many other companies to --","Thomas Falk","This is a very philosophical question this morning, Ali. I'd say, first of all, every coupon is a company with some other kind of a brand message, and you want to click through -- get the consumer to click through and see your other brand equity building messages. And it is one of the things that we do think about, is that are you building equity in the right places, and to Mike's earlier comment, we believe, product innovation and having winning products, talking about in the right way, and in some cases, providing an incentive to try, is the way you build brands long term. But we are -- I think we are all trying to figure out, how do we build a one-to-one relationship versus a mass media blast, way of building brands.","Michael Hsu","Yeah Ali, we are pushing a big shift in the digital. It gets more complicated, because some of it goes into consumer promotion. A lot of it actually goes into trade, because we do some of -- quite a bit of it for our customers, with online media. And it may not necessarily even be a coupon, it could be a pure add, and we are getting a lot of efficiency in terms of ROI on it, because it's allowing us to target our consumer with a lot more precision. I would just put our Asia Pacific team out last month, and they were showing that, the hits on target more than doubled over the past year, in terms of reaching our target audience, versus the spillover that you might get on TV.","Ali Dibadj","Okay. Thanks very much guys.","Thomas Falk","Thanks Ali.","Michael Hsu","Thanks Ali.","Operator","Our next question comes from Stephen Powers with Deutsche Bank.","Thomas Falk","Good morning Stephen.","Stephen Powers","Thanks. Good morning. So I guess, a little bit more on pricing, if I could. So I guess, if the environment is as constructive as it -- I guess, it sounds like you are implying with branded and private label pressures, maybe less severe than many of us perceived. Haven't we seen more pricing to-date, and why should things change, going forward? Just because gross margin is down 300 basis points year-over-year, it's a pretty -- just implies a pretty difficult backdrop. So just a little bit more kind of clarity between what we are seeing in the actual data, and then what you are -- just like the qualitative communication today seems to be implying. There seems to be a disconnect there. So just any color you have there would be great?","Thomas Falk","The only misread that we are saying it's an easy pricing environment, and it's not. It's a challenging competitive environment. As we would look at our gross margins, it's down significantly year-over-year, it's down about 100 basis points sequentially. So it's not that far off from where it was in the fourth quarter. Some of the pricing actions we talked about are just going into the market now, or they have been announced and we will roll in, in the second quarter. So we didn't get a lot of it in the first quarter results. And I think, like everybody else, pricing has certain expectations, and as commodity cost expectations have increased during the quarter, that's caused some of our teams to go back and relook at their plans for the year, and see, where else we can generate more revenue. Mike, I don't know if you want to --","Michael Hsu","Yeah, I wouldn't Steve -- I don't think we are trying to imply whether the pricing environment is difficult or very easy or -- all we are trying to suggest is, these are the actions we are taking; which is, we have taken some account reductions. We are managing our trade budget to be much more efficient, and we are looking at the frequency and depth of our promotions.","Stephen Powers","Okay. Maybe just it would help. On the sheet count reductions, specific that you mentioned in North America, is that an issue that you have led or are you following someone else's action in the market?","Michael Hsu","I believe that our key competitor has already taken that in 2017, and so -- and we are coupling with a significant product improvement, because it's also -- it's much easier to get price or revenue recognition, when you have got innovation to package it with. It's a whole different conversation with the retailer, if you have got a better performing product. And yes, they cost a little bit more, so even a different conversation with the consumer. It's a straight list price change, that's a little harder for them to swallow sometimes. So some of the pricing actions are tying into innovation activities that we have planned, as the year rolls out.","Thomas Falk","For example, Steve, on Cottonelle, we have got a terrific product improvement superiority versus other brands, and it's a breakthrough type product for us, and that did come with a sheet count reduction, high single digit, in fact.","Stephen Powers","Okay, great. I guess -- and one last one if you could, given the way you've guided commodities, which effectively is below current spot and below year-to-date run rates. I guess, in the context of pricing, I am just trying to understand, how you frame that? What's the pitch to retail partners; because it seems on the surface, a bit muddled, but we have faced a lot of pressure. We think commodities will trend lower, but we need some pricing. I'd just love some commentary there?","Thomas Falk","Well, they are still going to be higher significantly year-over-year I think, and they are all watching it and they are seeing it across other categories as well. So it's not enough dialog.","Stephen Powers","Thank you very much.","Thomas Falk","Thanks Steve.","Operator","Our next question comes from Olivia Tong with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Thomas Falk","Good morning Olivia.","Olivia Tong","Thanks. Good morning. Can you talk about how you are feeling about your market shares and relative strength? Where you are seeing some improvement; because your commentary is clearly more optimistic than some of your competitors, and obviously you are looking to price. So just would love to hear a little bit about market share specifically, in Tissue and Personal Care?","Thomas Falk","Yeah. Mike can give you a little bit more detail. I mean, I would say, we weren't satisfied with our market shares in 2017, and we had a better start to the year and the first quarter. And so, I think -- and we track the major markets and major categories, and I think we were up in almost 60% of those in the first quarter. But we'd still say, you know, that's kind of bouncing back from a tougher year in 2017. So we are pleased, but we are not satisfied, I guess is a way to describe it.","Michael Hsu","I'd characterize it as maybe a good start to the year, but we want to continue to focus on it. Overall, North America, up about a share point, up in five of eight of our overall categories. Up in Brazil significantly; Argentina, Eastern Europe up a couple of points as well. I think the one area that we need to improve, and that's where we are bringing innovation, is in China, where we are down a couple of points in diapers.","Thomas Falk","[indiscernible].","Olivia Tong","Got it. And that sort of leads into my question about emerging markets, because it's surprising to see that your sales were worse in emerging markets versus developed markets. But typically you don't see that. So you mentioned earlier a lot of the local competitors kind of getting better in online, but I thought your shares were better or your shares were higher online than off. So can you talk about the disconnect there?","Thomas Falk","That's still true. I think online is a place where you probably have fewer barriers to entry, and so there is more players coming into that space. If you could trial in a category, you can drain off some of the growth in that category.","Olivia Tong","Is most of that new product -- most of the innovation that's launching in China, is that primarily going to be in Q2, or is it more equitable through the year?","Thomas Falk","We will have a big push in Q2. But then, there is more coming later in the year.","Olivia Tong","Got it.","Michael Hsu","A lot of it is shipping right now.","Olivia Tong","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo.","Bonnie Herzog","Thank you. Good morning.","Thomas Falk","Good morning Bonnie.","Bonnie Herzog","Good morning. I have a question on private label. I know you guys are somewhat confident about your position against private label; but some of the channel data we look at, suggests that private label continues to make inroads into some of your larger categories. So curious to hear if you guys are noticing instances, where you might be losing shelf space to private label at retail, or possibly these share gains coming at the expense of some of your competitors products?","Thomas Falk","Okay, Bonnie. Yeah, we are following the private label trends very carefully, particularly in North America. And our focus is really on differentiating our brands with value added innovation and partnering with the customers, to focus on category growth. But the overall penetration levels over -- if you looked over the past five years, had been at similar levels. Down overall in Personal Care and up a bit in Consumer Tissue. We are focused on differentiation, and we have done that well, we have been able to grow our share and that's occurred in categories like adult care, diapers, and wipes.","What we need to a better job is in the bath tissue category, where private label penetration has grown a bit over the last couple of years, and that's what, we are bringing in some significant innovation this year, with Cottonelle and Scott Comfort Plus.","Bonnie Herzog","Okay. That's helpful. And then I just had another question on your supply chain. Some of your peers have talked about steps they have taken across the supply chain to really, I guess, adapt to the changing retail inventory, [indiscernible] patterns, and I guess in a sense to more rapidly products to reduce system inventories. So I guess I am curious to hear what steps you might be taking to reduce system inventories thus far, and whether there are still improvements you can potentially make? Thanks.","Thomas Falk","That's a great question. I will have Maria build on that. And really, we are trying to keep our retailers in stock, while minimizing system inventory. There is a lot of stuff that we are working on. Maria, I know you can give them some color on that?","Maria Henry","Yeah. I think there is a couple of points there. As you know, we have got significant activities in our company to improve our overall supply chain. One, just generally through our FORCE cost savings program, and two, with our restructuring there, we have taken that global view of our manufacturing network and are taking some steps to improve our advantages there. In terms of the retailer inventory, I do think it's worth noting that that was not an issue that we saw this quarter, and so, we are working the supply chain overall, clearly it's evolving as new channels are evolving and we are working with our key customers on how to make all of that work and continuing to improve what we have got.","Bonnie Herzog","Okay. Thank you.","Thomas Falk","Thanks Bonnie.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies.","Kevin Grundy","Thanks. Good morning.","Thomas Falk","Hey Kevin.","Kevin Grundy","Hey, good morning. I wanted to drill down on gross margins a bit if we could. So if I am not mistaken here in looking at our model, it's the lowest gross margin you have delivered since the first quarter of 2012, and of course, we understand that the environment is difficult and input costs have moved higher. But how should we think about this now, particularly two pieces to it? Number one, the near term, the progression for the balance of the year, input costs clearly higher, you talked about some pricing you could potentially get. But then also the longer term component of it, so your ability to restore gross margins to current levels, I guess, I asked it in the context of a couple of things. Number one, street expectations seem to suggest something in the 36%, or even close to 37% range looking out to 2020. Is that a feasible number? You delivered something close to that, looking back to 2016. But is the environment different now, and the market sort of discussion here is not lost on you guys [indiscernible], just in terms around CPG brands strength [ph] ability to take pricing maybe perhaps impaired. So a commentary there would be helpful.","Another one, the near term, the cadence here on the gross margin for the balance of the year, and then the second piece, sort of longer term, what's your confidence now that we can come off of this sub-34% level and restored something closer to where expectations, street estimates currently are in the 36%, 37% range?","Thomas Falk","Yeah. I think those are all important questions. And I'd say if you -- we have got a pretty significant commodity exposure. And so, you are going to see some swings in our gross margin when commodities are relatively low, gross margins will spike up a little bit and vice versa, which is what we are going through right now. If you kind of look at the quarter, virtually, all of the decrease in our gross profit, if you net it all out, was the negative price item.","All the other stuff, commodity costs, net of cost savings, net of currency benefit kind of washed out, and the price kind of fell through to the bottom line. So as we roll forward, we hope we have more positive pricing comparisons, as we get some price in the market. This is probably the toughest commodity costs year-on-year comparison in the quarter. So commodity costs, we will start to lap those increases, that started to happen in the second half of last year. We expect our cost savings to build, both from our FORCE cost savings program, and our FORCE cost savings program, and our restructuring cost savings, some of which will hit gross profits, some of which will hit in between the lines.","So we have got a lot of levers pulling, that should improve our gross profit perspective, as we work through the year, and that's kind of what our guidance is built around. If that's helpful?","Kevin Grundy","I mean, directionally it helps. I mean, like more specifically, because I guess like, the market concern would be that, 2015 and 2016 were sort of peak margins for this business, the environment has now changed, particularly in the U.S., there is a balance of power shift to retail, that pricing is going to become more difficult, that those levels are just not something that can be attained to get. It will be increasingly difficult. Would you agree with that characterization on, just specifically on quantifying that number? Is that a realistic number?","Thomas Falk","I would say, if you look at our margins over a long period of time, they are going to oscillate around the commodities cycle. I mean, there is usually a lag between when commodities go up and when you get price. And then, when commodities hit bottom, there is a lag before your price adjusts downward, if it's going to. So my goal, is that there is still a positive upward slope to the line, and that hopefully over time, we are getting more efficient, we are driving more innovation, we are improving our product mix and if we can do that, we should see long term positive trend on gross margin. You can have pretty big swings, as we have seen this quarter, from commodities in any one period of time.","Kevin Grundy","That's helpful. I appreciate. If I could just squeeze in one more on [indiscernible] topic, just around balance sheet flexibility and capital deployment decisions. So the Group has obviously been weak and Kimberly included in that, with the market increasingly concerned around competitive dynamics, the mode of these businesses, etcetera, and you guys haven't traditionally looked at M&A, and your balance sheet is in good shape. So have you considered potentially buying the stock back more aggressively, would you add half a turn of leverage or so, and implement and accelerate share repurchase program? Is that something that you think about, given the pullback in the stock price?","Maria Henry","Well, I'd say a few things. We have a very balanced view on capital allocation, where we are looking to invest in our business, grow our dividends and beyond that, then we look at whether M&A opportunities and what's the excess cash flow that you have in the business to look at how much is allocated to share repurchases. From a leverage standpoint, I like our position, just around two times leverage, and maintaining our A credit rating is important to us, because it does provide flexibility, it provides assets to lower cost commercial paper, and in a competitive environment, it's important to have a strong balance sheet, so that we can deliver against our model, really in any economic cycle and also, not be competitively disadvantaged, where we have got large global competitors that also have strong balance sheets.","I would say that, while we haven't done a lot on the M&A front, we do look at it. We actively look at M&A opportunities. We have got a team of folks, and as you can imagine, given our size in the space, if something is moving, we are probably looking at it. But we are very disciplined in how we allocate our capital, and so you haven't seen us pull the trigger on M&A, because we haven't found something that makes economic sense, that we believe will create long term shareholder value. But we do like the flexibility that the balance sheet gives us, and there are advantages to having that flexibility.","Thomas Falk","Kevin, the only other build I'd add for you, is that we have just kicked off this big restructuring program. And over the next couple of years, we are going to be spending more than normal on capital spending, and maintaining a healthy share repurchase program. So that is going to put a little bit of pressure on our debt in the near term. But we think investing in our core business, with the work that we are doing, with all the restructuring program, is a very high return approach for us, relative to other things that we could do with the money.","Kevin Grundy","That's great. Good luck guys. Thank you for the questions.","Thomas Falk","Thank you, Kevin.","Maria Henry","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets.","Thomas Falk","Good morning Nik.","Nik Modi","Yeah, thanks. Good morning everyone. Good morning. Just two questions for me; the first one, just broadly on category growth, just would love to get your perspective on some of the major markets, particularly, North America. And then, the other question is, how does Kimberly-Clark measure consumer value equations, and how has the methodology changed? I guess, I am asking, because there is so much change going on in the marketplace. Like how do you make sure that you have the right value propositions relative to the peer group, just given what's going on with private label online, emerging brands, etcetera, etcetera. Thanks.","Michael Hsu","Yeah okay, hey Nik. One, on the overall category; North America I think, maybe the headline was -- the big change was in diapers, for the infant child care category, which was flat across all outlooks last quarter, which was the first time it was flat since 2016. So that was a big change. You may know that was down mid-single digits, most of last year, so that was a big change for us. And then most of the other categories in North America were generally consistent or slightly improved from prior quarters. So I think, green shoots I think on the category front in North America, and then in most other markets, I think in Brazil, we are encouraged with -- and also GDP is expected to grow about 3% this year. Unemployment was down a little bit less than we had expected in Q1. So we are off to a very good start in Brazil this year.","China, I think the diaper category overall continues to grow. It's just the -- I think, the competitive situation has gotten a little tougher, due to some product innovation from the local competitors. Any other?","Thomas Falk","And the consumer value equation question, Nik, is another philosophical question. It's one that's probably more opaque, because you don't have visibility of what everybody is doing in the digital space. But it's one that, we are continuing to trying to refine our measures and test different things to see how to assess that. I don't know Mike, if you have got anything else, so you can share that's not proprietary on that.","Michael Hsu","Nik, I think we are pretty disciplined. I mean, it's the -- the equation side is like, what are the brand benefits, product quality, the brand impression, all those -- the bundle of features and benefits that we are offering, and we are pretty disciplined about assessing our -- what we call product acceptability, or how good a product is, in absolute terms, relative to both brands and private label. And then the denominator of that equation, obviously, is the price, and our strategy is, we want to be superior on the benefits and competitive on the price, which is why you are seeing, when we talk about fine tuning promotions, I think last year I was talk about fine tuning and getting a little bit more competitive on price, and then this year, I think the fine tuning, given the commodity environment is headed the other way.","Nik Modi","Great. Thanks Mike. Appreciate it.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jonathan Feeney with Consumer Edge.","Thomas Falk","Good morning, Jonathan.","Jonathan Feeney","Good morning. Thanks. Hey good morning. Thanks very much. I wanted to follow-up on a discussion that Bonnie started, with a couple of specifics. When I look at -- was volume and North America particularly better than your expectations this quarter? And I wanted to maybe parse out, how in general, when you are making big supply chain moves, you approach that volume price balances? On one hand, you want the absorption to be right, that would tend to emphasize volume, but you also want the price to be right? Or does that supply chain move and form your strategy, in North America, specifically, at all? Thanks.","Thomas Falk","Yeah. I mean, I think, maybe to simplify it, is we really want our supply chain to track closely consumer demand and consumer takeaway. So we want -- the consumer is the boss, and want her and her purchase patterns to drive our supply chain, and we need to be able to react to that. And then our teams are planning the business in six month buckets, as to when they have promotional activity planned and we are trying to get better and better at our ability to forecast that, and make sure we deliver outstanding customer service, and can fulfill everything that we committed to our customers to go do. So we plan to have a better start to the year in North America, and I'd say, Mike had even started a little better than we would have expected, but our supply chain was able to adapt to that.","Jonathan Feeney","Okay. Thank you very much.","Thomas Falk","Thanks Jonathan.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan.","Andrea Teixeira","Thank you for squeezing me in. So my question is on the cost and expense savings program. First, if you can elaborate on the discretionary marketing spend reduction, you called in since the guidance in the last quarter. And examples of the cuts you have implemented, is that [indiscernible]. And the second part of the same question, on the manufacturing footprint, the closure of the California plant that Maria referred on the prepared remarks, that seems to coincide with increasing the imports from Kimberly Mexico, which you have a minority interest. Is that a plan for you to increase to do this cost based [ph] agreement with Kimberly Mexico? And the reason why I ask, is that, you had $90 million in cost savings this quarter, as far as I understand, which is tracking below your $460 million for the year, the midpoint of the guidance. So I want to just see if you can elaborate on those two points? Thank you.","Maria Henry","Sure. I will start with your last point, just pickup on some of the comments that Tom made on the $90 million of FORCE cost savings. That's a good first quarter for us. We expect that their savings will ramp through, as the year goes on throughout the year, and we are still holding to the $400 million target that we got for the year. In terms of the manufacturing footprint, and specifically, the plant related actions, that we are taking as part of the restructuring, as we laid out our restructuring program, we did a lot of detailed planning on, how we would fulfill demand, as we move through the restructuring, and then longer term, and we look to optimize that. What I would say is K-C de Mexico is a great partner for us, and a very strong company. They had nice results this quarter, and it's certainly an option, but as we looked at our overall footprint optimization, the majority of the sourcing comes from Kimberly-Clark plants.","And then your -- the first part of your question was around our lower SG&A expenses, and I think it was particularly around advertising. And what I'd say there, is that, we have done a deep dive on our advertising expenditures in all of our major markets, and what we have found is that, we had an opportunity to reduce the amount that we are spending on non-working advertising activities, and redeploy some of those funds to working advertising. And so that's an area that we are focused on, and that is, we talked about earlier, there is a shift between doing mass advertising and doing more specific targeted activities, some of which, such as digital couponing, end up as part of the advertising lines.","So when I look at our overall investments, I think we are in a good place, even though you see the advertising line on the P&L, a little later than it was last year.","Thomas Falk","Yeah, maybe just to put that in perspective; I mean, it's going to be roughly 10 basis points down from the average of last year. First quarter was the high watermark last year. Some of this also has to do with timing of innovation and when new products will launch. So I mean, we are still committed to supporting our brands at the right level, both with advertising and as well as promotion.","Andrea Teixeira","Yeah, go ahead. Sorry.","Maria Henry","I will just note, when we look at focusing on the cost reductions and the discretionary spend that I talked about, there is an intense focus, more around the general expenses, on the general and administrative expenses, on the P&L. And I think when you look at the numbers, you saw some really good progress there again in the first quarter.","Andrea Teixeira","This is very helpful. Just one quick fact check on what Maria said, $90 million obviously tracks well with the FORCE. But then this quarter, I don't think you had much of the other restructuring program savings, are you still tracking to that amount, for the full year?","Maria Henry","Yes. But we have got, in addition to the FORCE cost savings, we are targeting $50 million to $70 million for benefits from the restructuring program, and those are expected to come in the second half.","Thomas Falk","Basically in the first quarter, we announced the plan to our employees and got organized to implement it. And so, as Maria mentioned, we did a voluntary severance program in North America, that is now closed and those job reductions will start to take place in the second quarter. So we will start to get savings more in the back half of the year from that effort.","Andrea Teixeira","Okay, great. Thank you very much.","Thomas Falk","Thank you.","Maria Henry","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Caroline Levy with Macquarie.","Caroline Levy","Good morning. Thank you --","Thomas Falk","Hey Caroline.","Caroline Levy","Hi. Having just got back from many different cases in Asia, the commentary on the local competition in China was really brought home when I was there. And I am just trying to understand, how a product that can be substantially below your quality, which I believe it really is in these local cases; how the innovation is going to drive the local players out of the market; because it seems to me they are not really competing on product quality there, kind of beating on something else. That was my first question.","The second is, please, if you could address, whether you are doing any private label production, if so, if it was meaningful to the first quarter, and what percentage of your sales goes online in the U.S. right now versus China? That's three, sorry.","Thomas Falk","Okay. Yes, we can -- between Mike and I, can probably cover those. I mean, I think in China, competitors, you raise an interesting point, and there is lots of interesting products available over there, some are good and some are not. Some are very high priced, even well above the price that you pay for a premium or super premium international product. And if they get trial, they might not get repeat, but they can still pick up some market share, and our hope is that, over time, we are building loyal consumers that want to stay on our franchise. But moms, especially moms in China who want the best for baby, are exploring new ideas and trying new things and so, there is just a lot more competitive offerings in that market.","And so our belief is, product performance matters, if we do a great job of delivering on that, and talking to the consumer about it in the right way and having it in the place where you can find it, that we are going to win in any market, including China.","I think private label production, I mean, is a tiny part of our business overall, it's less than 5%. So I mean, I think, I wouldn't really comment too much on that. And then e-commerce in China, Mike what it is probably --","Michael Hsu","Overall, it's about a 50% penetration in China. About north of 70% in Korea, depending on the category we are talking. And then North America, mid to high single digit, but that varies quite a bit amongst categories, with diaper being significantly higher than that.","Caroline Levy","The diapers double digit in terms of market share online in U.S.?","Thomas Falk","Yes.","Michael Hsu","Yes. Well market share and also penetration rate.","Thomas Falk","Also just to be clear, the data is not as robust as other data we would give you, because there is a ton of retailers that are doing click and collect. Virtually, every retailer is doing some form of click and collect, and none of that is counted anywhere in an e-commerce measurement, because no one collects the data that way. So they are probably as bigger than any number we would quote you in North America, but we don't have any way to measure it really.","Michael Hsu","And I'd add Caroline, we are doing well in e-commerce. I think we grew strong double digits overall globally last year, and we are expecting similar results this year.","Caroline Levy","And last one, did you grow double digits in China e-commerce or was that down quite substantially? I guess, it must be actually?","Michael Hsu","I don't have that number right now.","Caroline Levy","All right. Thank you so much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.","Lauren Lieberman","Thank you.","Thomas Falk","Hi Lauren.","Lauren Lieberman","Just one quick question on freight costs. It's just a topic kind of across the industry, there is nothing that we have talked about much. So what are you guys seeing in terms of freight inflation? Is it generally kind of in line going into your expectations, or is that something we should just be thinking about as well?","Thomas Falk","Yeah. It's an issue, and we ship high tube [ph] low value items, so freight is a big cost for us. But we probably -- we are less of a spot freight buyer and more of a contract freight buyer because of that, and so, we probably have been buffered from some of the spot gyrations that may be some that are structured a little differently or freight is a smaller part of their costs, they might manage it in a different way.","So in our high volume freight lanes, we have contractual relationships, that we pay higher diesel, but we aren't paying some of the other costs. I mean, we may eventually have some pass-through, when those contracts are renegotiated. But for the moment, we are not suffering quite as much as others.","Lauren Lieberman","That's very helpful. Thank you so much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ali Dibadj with Bernstein.","Thomas Falk","Hey Ali.","Ali Dibadj","Hey guys I have a follow-up as well. So two things, one is, North America e-commerce clearly is one of the focus areas for you. Can you give us a sense of your online share versus your offline share, and sense of the pace of that closing, if at all?","Thomas Falk","Yeah. I mean, I'd say, broadly, in total our online share is pretty similar to our offline share. In fact, it might even be a little bit higher, because there is no private label typically in your online share. But it can vary a little bit by category. But I would say, we are competitive, because there is less private label online, we would probably want it to be even higher than our offline share.","Michael Hsu","And that would vary by category. So a little bit ahead maybe in -- in maybe Tissue and adult and fem care, and maybe we got off to a little bit of a slow start years ago on the diaper category. But we are gaining ground in diapers as well.","Ali Dibadj","Okay. And no private label, except the private label that you guys might be making or might not be making for Amazon.","Thomas Falk","You couldn't resist that one, Ali, I guess? You trying to chum the water and see if I take the bait, is that the strategy this morning?","Ali Dibadj","No, no, look, you guys are very good with that stuff. On private label in general, look I get it's for you guys, I guess it's less than 5% of sales. Can you give us a sense of the growth of that less than 5%?","Thomas Falk","I mean, I wouldn't say it has been something that we would feel like we needed to talk about or we would have talked about it. So it's one that -- we have got a very small number of customers that we do that for, and we are happy with the business, I think they are happy with the business, and -- but we really are focused on driving innovation behind our brands, and winning with that total bundle.","Ali Dibadj","But it's growing much faster than your underlying business. Is that a fair assumption?","Thomas Falk","I don't think I would agree with that statement. It hasn't changed much as a percent of sales, let me put it that way over time.","Ali Dibadj","Okay. Thank you.","Thomas Falk","Yes. Thanks.","Operator","At this time, we have no other questioners in the queue.","Paul Alexander","All right. Well then we will wrap up with a comment from Tom.","Thomas Falk","Well once again, we are off to a good start in the first quarter relative to our plan for the year. And so it's a challenging environment, but you can count on your Kimberly-Clark team to try to manage through that as best as we can. Once again, we appreciate your support of Kimberly-Clark. Thank you very much.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes this morning's presentation.

We now have your presenters in conference. Please be aware that each of your lines is in a listen-only mode. At the conclusion of today's presentation, we will open the floor for your questions. At that time, instructions will be given as to the procedure to follow up if you would like to ask a question.","It is now my pleasure to introduce today's first presenter, Mr. Paul Alexander.","Paul Alexander","Thank you and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Kimberly-Clark's second quarter earnings conference call. With us today are Tom Falk, Chairman and CEO; Mark Buthman, Senior VP and CFO; and Mike Azbell, Vice President and Controller.","Here is the agenda for our call. Mark will begin with a review of our second quarter results and then give an update on the health care spin-off. Tom will then provide his perspectives on our results and the outlook for the full year and we'll finish with Q&A. As usual, we have a presentation of today's materials in the Investors section of our website.","As a reminder, we will be making forward-looking statements this morning. Please see the Risk Factors section of our last Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of forward-looking statements. We will also be referring to adjusted results and outlook. Both exclude certain items described in this morning's news release. The release has further information on these adjustments and reconciliations to comparable GAAP financial measures.","And now, I'll turn it over to Mark.","Mark Buthman ","Thanks, Paul, and good morning. Let's start with the headlines. First we achieved organic sales growth of 5%, led by 10% growth in KC International; second, we increased adjusted earnings per share 6% driven by organic sales growth and cost savings and third, we\u2019re on track with our overall capital plan including working capital, cash generation, capital spending and returning cash to shareholders. ","Now let\u2019s cover the details of our results. Second quarter sales were $5.3 billion up more than 1% versus last year. Underlying organic sales rose 5% led by strong growth in KC International, currency rates were at 2% drag and restructuring activities reduced sales by 1 point. Second quarter adjusted gross margin was 34.8% that\u2019s up 30 basis points year on year. Adjusted operating profit was up 5% versus year ago with an operating margin of 16.1%, it\u2019s up 60 basis points compared to prior year. Results benefited from organic sales growth, $75 million of forced cost savings and $10 million of savings from pulp and tissue restructuring actions. On the other hand we absorbed significant currency headwinds. The total earnings drag including translation and transaction effects and losses was approximately $0.11 per share in the quarter. ","We also absorbed $60 million of input cost inflation. We now expect that full year inflation will be towards the high end of our previously estimated range of $150-250 million, that takes into account additional inflation in some international markets in a somewhat tighter virgin fiber market. To support our brands and innovations we increased advertizing spending by $15 million in the quarter, that\u2019s up 20 basis points as a percent of sales. ","Now moving down to P&L, equity income fell 27% driven by softness at KC de Mexico, KC de Mexico\u2019s market positions remain strong and their primary markets of bathroom tissue and diapers they have market shares well into the 60s. However given recent results and the challenging macroeconomic environment, we now expect that our full year equity income will be down compared to last year and our original expectations for this year. Putting it all together second quarter adjusted earnings per share were a $1.49, that\u2019s up 6% year on year. ","Now turning to cash flow, cash provided by operations in the second quarter was $842 million, that\u2019s up 46% year on year mostly due to working capital improvements and lower pension contributions. We continue to manage primary working capital very well, our year to date cash conversion cycle is down two days compared to full year 2013 so we\u2019re in great shape to meet or potentially exceed a one to two day improvement objective. ","In terms of capital allocation second quarter dividend payments and share repurchases totaled nearly $800 million, we repurchased $476 million of KMB stock in the quarter and we continue to expect full year share repurchases of $1.3 to $1.5 billion. ","Now I\u2019ll highlight a few areas from our segment results for the quarter, in personal care organic sales rose 7%, performance was led by KC International with organic sales up 13%. Second quarter personal care operating margins were 18.6%, that\u2019s up 50 basis points year on year led by gains in KC International and Europe. ","Moving to consumer tissue organic sales were up 3%, consumer tissue operating margins of 14.7% were up a 120 basis points year on year driven by selling price increases and cost savings. ","Turning to KC Professional, organic sales increased 3%, performance was led by 13% growth in KC International, organic sales were off slightly in North America. ","Our KCP margins were solid at 17.9% although they were down versus a very strong year ago performance. And lastly healthcare organic sales were up slightly with healthcare operating margins of 15.9% were up nicely versus a soft result last year. And I am really encouraged by the team\u2019s execution as we prepare for the spin-off. ","Now let me turn to the planned spin-off of our healthcare business which will become Halyard Health. We are making good progress overall. Our initial Form-10 registration statement was filed with the SEC in May and an amendment with first quarter financial information is filed in June. Halyard senior management team is in place and selection of the Board of Directors is underway with a lead director and chair of the audit committee are renamed.","Separation planning is well underway and we're targeting to complete the transaction at the end of October. We are continuing to assess the impact of the spin-off on our remaining K-C operations. Stranded costs are estimated to be about 2% to 3% of our annual adjusted operating profit and in near term these costs will be partially offset by incremental share repurchases and transition services agreements which we'll have in place with Halyard. ","As I mentioned in April, we expect to incur some restructuring charges in order to fully mitigate the impact of stranded overhead and to improve our overall organizational efficiency. Our work in this area is ongoing and we expect to share our plans in conjunction with our third quarter earnings communications in October.","So, that wraps up my comments. To recap, we achieved solid organic sales growth. We delivered healthy cost savings and bottom-line growth and we continue to allocate capital in shareholder friendly ways. ","Now, I will turn it over to Tom.","Tom Falk ","","Thanks, Mark and good morning everyone. I will share my perspectives on our second quarter and then I will address our full year outlook. So, starting with Q2, we delivered another quarter of good performance overall. Our organic sales growth in the quarter was 5% that\u2019s at the high end of our 3% to 5% full year target. As you think about targeted growth initiatives K-C International had another strong quarter with 10% organic sales growth and improved margins. In diapers, our organic sales increased approximately 30% in Russia and Eastern Europe, 20% in China and 15% in Brazil. Our Huggies business continues to generate excellent top-line growth in these markets and at the same time we're making good progress in improving the bottom-line.","We're also doing well in our other personal care businesses in K-C International. Organic sales were up double-digits in both feminine care and adult care and mid-single digits in baby wipes. Our focus on premium innovation and category development continues to generate good results in these businesses. Elsewhere in K-C International KCP organic sales were at a low-teens rate that was led by growth in Latin America and solid progress in China. We're continuing to push harder to further build this business where industrialization and economic development are occurring. ","We've also implemented a number of selling price increases in K-C International in response to weaker currencies and cost inflation. These have been executed well and in general have not impacted underlying demand. So, overall we have good momentum at K-C International and we remain very optimistic about our prospects there going forward. ","In terms of top-line growth in North America, volumes were on track, are ahead of plan and our adult care business and baby wipes and in our feminine care business. We're also largely on target in consumer tissue although we're responding to increased competitive promotion activity in the bathroom tissue category. On the other hand, volumes were below expectations in diapers and in our K-C Professional washroom business. And our teams there are focused on improving performance by better leveraging our innovation, marketing and selling capability. ","Regarding innovation activities we are making good progress overall. In K-C International, our focus on innovation in diapers and diaper pants, premium feminine care and adult care, continues to deliver strong growth for us. ","In North America, I am encouraged that innovations are helping grow our brands like Poise, Depend, U by Kotex, Viva and Huggies baby wipes. Our brand positions are solid overall and reflect our innovation launches and increased advertising spending. Our market shares in the U.S. improved or even with year ago in six of eight consumer categories that we track and were growing faster than the category in a number of our markets in KCI. ","In terms of bottom-line, I am encouraged with our second quarter improvement in margins and earnings despite the headwinds that Mark mentioned, some of that bottom-line improvement was due to benefits from the strategic changes we've made in Europe. We've also just started to more formally bring together our European and Middle East and Africa teams into one organization to streamline decision making and improve efficiencies there. While we got more work to do, I am encouraged by our progress in Europe. ","Finally, as Mark has already highlighted, we continue to operate our company with financial discipline by generating significant cost savings and cash flow and allocating capital in shareholder friendly ways.","So, in summary we're executing our global business planned strategies well in a challenging environment and we are essentially on track with our overall plans for the first half of the year. ","Now moving on to our outlook for the full year. We continue to be optimistic about our prospects to drive profitable and healthy growth. On the top-line, we continue to target organic sales growth of 3% to 5%. We got a good momentum in this area with 5% organic growth to the first half of the year. While comparisons get more difficult in the back half of the year, we expect to make further progress with our targeted growth initiatives and innovation programs. On the bottom-line, we expect to deliver full year adjusted earnings per share in a range of $6 to $6.15.","Compared to our previous guidance, we've narrowed the range modestly by bringing down the top end by $0.05 a share. This recognizes a slightly more difficult external environment including the outlook for commodities and business conditions for K-C to Mexico, some of the consumer tissue promotion activity in North America and overall competitive activity in general. Regardless of the environment we continue to be optimistic about our future. We're staying focused on our strategies to protect and improve our brands and our business and we remain convinced that successful execution of our global business plan will continue to result in strong returns to our shareholders.","So that wraps up our prepared remarks and now we'll begin to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Wendy Nicholson with Citi Research.","Wendy Nicholson - Citi Research","Two questions, first with regard to on the contemplated restructuring program, are you expecting that to be bigger than just to address the stranded overhead cost associated with the spin or is that limited to specifically that transaction? ","And then second of all, there has been a lot written and a lot of speculation about Proctor entering the adult incontinence market, and I\u2019m just wondering if there are anything you are doing in anticipation of that or on -- to better position yourself? Obviously you\u2019ve got an incredible position already. But is there anything you do differently now if that is coming down the pike? Thanks.","Tom Falk","Good question. Wendy, on the first one, the restructuring; we will give you more color on that in the third quarter call. I mean at the minimum we are going to make sure we eliminate the stranded overhead and Mark gave you a guidance on the range of that as 2% to 3% of our operating profit. At the same time we're asking our teams broadly to say are there other things that as we look at Kimberly-Clarke post healthcare spin that we could do to make ourselves even more efficient. And so we\u2019ll be evaluating those ideas over the next few months and give you more color on that in October. ","On the Procter front, we've been going hard to drive dependent employees pretty aggressively as you\u2019ve probably seen over the last several years. And I think having a great innovation portfolio behind those brands is the best defense for any kind of competitive activity. And so we'll continue to drive innovation and try to drive the category growth and we think that will serve us well over the medium-term.","Wendy Nicholson - Citi Research","And then just two questions, follow-up. On the restructuring side, are you contemplating any additional product line exit, what you did with diapers in Western Europe or is it really just cost related? And then secondarily, what\u2019s your confidence in the pricing dynamic in adult diapers? I mean they are obviously very expensive product. Do you feel like you've got a sufficient range of products? Is there a chance that Proctor comes in and undercuts you and there is negative pricing in the category? How do you think about that?","Tom Falk","Sure, on the restructuring, I would say it\u2019s primarily going to be cost related. I wouldn\u2019t envision there is any product line exists, going on there and so it really is more just looking at our talent where we got it and we have the right capability in the right places and other things we can do better from a shared service or centrally, that we're taking a look at as a chance to look at your overhead structure when you have a transaction like the spin. ","On the second question, on the pricing dynamic, we obviously haven\u2019t seen full visibility of what Proctor is going to do. And so we'll make sure we're competitive in the marketplace. But behind a lot of the innovation that we brought -- we have brought DEPEND Real Fit for man and Silhouette for women to the market last year. That\u2019s probably our most income challenged consumer. And because those products work so much better, we picked up 9 to 10 share points behind a more expensive product offering. And so we are not shy about pricing for the innovation when we\u2019ve got real game changing innovation to bring to market.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Ferrara with Wells Fargo.","Chris Ferrara - Wells Fargo","I guess, first on pricing, with the plus 2 in the quarter was pretty strong. I guess, I love your thoughts on -- what\u2019s driving that, what\u2019s the promotional environment like? Obviously we know there are some tissue [indiscernible] going on but, what would your outlook be? You think that plus 2 you put up, but when does it start to decelerate,\u00a0as you moved through the year or in fact do you think that some of this currency driven pricing at a lag might keep it up at that plus 2 rate for a little while?","Tom Falk","That\u2019s a great question and I think if you look at where we got most of the price, it was in the markets that have had significant currency devaluation and local inflation as a result. So places like Brazil, Argentina, Russia, the Ukraine, other markets like that where you\u2019ve seen pretty rough currency market. You've seen everybody and across all categories taking price pretty aggressively in a pretty good bit of inflation. So again I think a lot of that has happened and as we'll get some comp of that flowing through for the next several quarters. But I guess, I wouldn\u2019t say that that\u2019s a long term trend at this stage.","Chris Ferrara - Wells Fargo","Got it, that\u2019s helpful. And then I guess on topline, just a couple of quick things. First on China, obviously plus 20 is a great growth rate this quarter but it's gone from 45 to 35, from 30 to 20. So when is it -- is plus 20, is that kind of where you think China settles out or might be even slip a little bit further given how robust that bridge still is and then overall, Tom, you mentioned obviously that comps get tougher in the back half of the year for the business as a whole. You mentioned that the innovation pipeline, I think, picks up. Do you think there is a chance that you guys don\u2019t see a year on your deceleration in the back half of the year relative to what you saw in the first half of the year? ","Tom Falk","I mean, I guess I'd say so you are saying you think we\u2019re going be down some sales or just slower growth rate in the back half?","Chris Ferrara - Wells Fargo","Sorry, just slower growth rate.","Tom Falk","I guess [indiscernible] tougher comps in the back half and I\u2019d say that we gave the 3to 5 guidance we got 5 in already so I\u2019m highly confident we'll be in that range where we could have a little slower growth rate in the back half than we did in the first half in part because of the tougher comps. In china particular, we still think the -- and I know the Nielsen data isn't showing this but we still think the diaper category is growing high single digits and there\u2019s a lot going on in e-commerce that is being tracked in the Nielsen data that we\u2019re seeing happen in those markets, and so we still got a lot of innovation coming there and really we\u2019re just getting started in fem care with the relaunch there. We got a lot of additional product activity we can bring to those markets to continue to see growth and so, I\u2019d say we continue to expect K-C International\u2019s going to have high single digit growth for some time to come.","Operator","Our next question comes from Gail Glazerman with UBS.","Gail Glazerman - UBS ","Hi. I know you mentioned that you\u2019re able to pass through the prices in the emerging markets generally but it seems like in KCI tissue volumes were a little bit weak, I wondering if you could give some color there historically.","Tom Falk"," ","Yes, took price a little bit more aggressively in a couple of markets and took some volume risk on that, Brazil was one that would come to mind, and sometimes when you take price and tissue you deal with de sheeting which shows up as negative volume and positive price so you may be selling a similar number of rolls but you\u2019re actually, we measure volume in sheets not rolls, so that can be a part of it in some markets as well.","Gail Glazerman - UBS ","Okay and in the US away from home market I believe there was an effort to raise prices, I was just wondering if you could give an update on how that\u2019s being accepted.","Tom Falk"," ","Yes, several of the competitors took price, we followed, that\u2019s still rolling out as we speak, as you know in that market you got lots and lots of individual contracts and so it takes longer to have that price get betted down in the marketplace, but so far that seems to be rolling out reasonably successfully. ","Gail Glazerman - UBS ","Okay and just two last quick ones, can you give a little bit more color on the increase of competition that you\u2019re seeing in the US bath tissue market?","Tom Falk"," ","Yes, as you probably recall Georgia-Pacific had some production problems where they were on allocation at the beginning of last year, early, first half of 2013, so they\u2019ve come back with more promotion this year and are really trying to get their shelf space back and some of their market share back. Some of the other competitors in the marketplace have followed that and so we\u2019ve tried to make sure that we\u2019re competitive with primarily in Cottonelle, Scott tissues held up pretty well in this environment.","Gail Glazerman - UBS ","Okay and then just last one on pulp, you talked about maybe firmer than expected virgin fiber pricing, I am just wondering if you could break that down between kind of the nature grade, soft wood, hard wood and soft pulp and what you\u2019re seeing and expecting moving forward. ","Tom Falk"," ","Yes, I mean Northern softwood and fluff pulp has probably been the stickiest and the list price hasn\u2019t come down much, you are seeing some deals particularly on Northern soft wood below list price where we\u2019re kind of just being bought off contract because I think the producers aren\u2019t willing to bring the list down, so that\u2019s making the list price a little bit less relevant to the everyday transaction price that's happening in the market place. Eucalyptus has probably been closer to what we were expecting, still maybe a little bit on the high end of the range but again, I\u2019d say eucalyptus, you see more supply still coming into the market place and more of a predictable behavior there.","Gail Glazerman - UBS ","And on fluff are you seeing relief, FDA last week kind of talked about seeing [indiscernible], expecting fluff prices to come down, is that something you\u2019re experiencing as well?","Tom Falk"," ","I think everybody\u2019s expecting it, we\u2019re not seeing it yet.","Operator","Our next question comes from Connie Maneaty with BMO Capital.","Connie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets","Hi, good morning. Could you talk about your business in Venezuela? Kimberly is one of the few companies not to move to a weaker exchange rate so I\u2019m wondering if the additional rate is what you believe is a true reflection of your economics there and also if you could talk about whether you\u2019ve gotten any price relief.","Tom Falk"," ","That\u2019s a trick question, Connie, as to what the true exchange rate is in Venezuela at this point in time, but as we look at it and in fact we just reviewed this with our audit committee, couple of days ago, when we reviewed the 10-Q and the earnings releases, so there\u2019s about a third of the companies that we\u2019ve been able to track down there that are still using the six-three rate, there\u2019s about a third that are using some form of a blended rate or the SICAD-I rate and there\u2019re about a third that are using the SICAD-II rate and the choice as to which one they are using seems to have more to do with the type of business that they\u2019re in and which rate they qualify for, so if you\u2019re in the services arena you\u2019re probably in SICAD-I, if you\u2019re in the essential consumer products area you\u2019re in the original CADIVI rate and so essentially the only exchange that we\u2019re getting is at the six-three rate and we\u2019ve got more foreign exchange in the second quarter than we even did in the first quarter at that rate. ","So I think there has been some discussion with some Venezuelan government officials that they are considering aligning those at one rate. And I think that\u2019s probably the long-term trajectory. At this point in time, it\u2019s something we review every quarter and talk about what\u2019s the right rate. But we\u2019re not even eligible to apply for the SICAD-I or SICAD-II rate at this point in time. In the meantime we try to be completely transparent in the queue about what our balance sheet exposure is in Venezuela and so that investors if they believe there is a different rate that should be applied, they've got the information that they need to be able to do that.","Connie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets","And are you getting any relief on pricing yet?","Tom Falk"," ","Given that we\u2019re still at getting the exchange at the 6-3 rate, it's difficult to argue for pricing at that point. So if and when the rate changes, then that will be a discussion at that point in time. In the meantime we're more focused on getting enough foreign exchange to be able to continue to run the mill, to bring in raw materials and to continue to bring in some finished product and so we work with the Venezuelan government authorities on that on a daily basis.","Operator","","Our next question comes from Olivia Tong with the Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","","First question, just back to incontinence. It looks like P&G has started to test the waters a little bit in Europe. So do you have any early read on their approach on how you plan to respond to that? And then just on North American diapers, clearly volume has been a little bit difficult in Huggies, with the volume down low single digit; so can you talk about what your plan is to respond to that? Thanks.","Tom Falk"," ","Sure, on the incontinence, I mean they just started shipping in the UK, just in the last month or so. So we\u2019ve picked up some product samples and those are being tested, probably too early to tell. I'd say, at this point we would never take a competitor lightly. But we feel pretty good with the innovation program that we have and the things that we still have coming in our -- behind our dependent Poise business. On the positive side, if you\u2019re going to be the optimist here. It\u2019s that the Poise category in particular, the light bladder leakage category is still pretty underpenetrated and so having another competitor come in and talk about it from the consumer standpoint could benefit all of us, if the category grows more rapidly. ","On the North American diaper front, yes, as you mentioned, we\u2019re not satisfied with the share. I mean a lot of it has been lost particularly at a couple of large format retailers have been driven. So we are going to try to make sure we are more competitive in the second half and have more innovation coming across our Huggies line-up to get that brand back in a healthier growth profile.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it, thanks. And then on professional, last quarter you attributed the decline in North America partly to unfavorable weather, but now price seems to be a bigger drag. So can you talk through how you think about professional and developed markets given these dynamics?","Tom Falk"," ","Yes, I think the KCP business, weather was certainly a challenge, but as we look at it, we probably say we didn\u2019t execute as well as we needed to. And so we're in the process of realigning some of our sales capabilities, and that probably was more disruptive than we would have thought. So we're focused on getting that business back on track, so a little bit better performance overall in the second quarter. So we had positive volume in North America, which was a good sign. We probably spent a little bit on price to get some of that which is where you saw the negative price. But we were aligning that team to have a stronger second half and we should see that play out in the marketplace. ","","Operator","Our next question comes from Erin Lash with Morningstar.","Erin Lash - Morningstar","I was wondering if you could speak to; first of with the Child Care volumes down mid-single digits and just your expectations for that segment of the business. And if that's reflective of Pull-Ups and how that -- what you're doing, I guess, within that loss?","Tom Falk"," ","Yes, what we are seeing with Child Care is a couple of factors, it is primarily Pull-Ups. We are seeing growth in our size-6 diaper business; which would say that moms are keeping babies in diapers a little longer. And part of that is there is an economic issue where the Pull-Ups are more expensive per piece than a disposable diaper. And we\u2019re also looking as to make sure that the Pull-Up is delivering on the product performance expectations where we are seeing a little bit more leakage in Pull-Ups and is that why the consumer is deciding to stay in diapers a bit longer. And so we\u2019ve got initiatives behind both of those areas and I would expect to see some improvement in our Pull-Ups business in the back half of the year and in to early 2015.","Erin Lash - Morningstar","That\u2019s helpful, thank you. And then if I could just a follow-up on Wendy\u2019s question from earlier about potential divestitures resulting from the restructuring. Is that -- was your answer indicative of the fact that you after the spin-off of the healthcare business that you\u2019re content with your portfolio, are you constantly re-examining your portfolio to see if there are other areas that may be are less core to the business?","Tom Falk"," ","To take a long-term view, we have been around a little over 140 years and our first product was Newsprint. So our portfolio looks pretty different today than it did then. And so I guess the answer is, we\u2019re always continually challenging ourselves and what we can add to the portfolio to make us better and then are there other properties in the portfolio that we maybe aren\u2019t the right owner of long term and we have been pretty disciplined about doing that over the years. This is I think my third spin-off but coming out of a big transaction like the spin, I'd probably say in the near term, the medium term, we are pretty happy with the portfolio. ","Erin Lash - Morningstar","","Okay, thanks you, that\u2019s helpful. And then just finally building off of that question, with regards to potential acquisitions as the use of cash if you could speak and that and potentially where you might see some holding the portfolio that you would potentially look to fill by making acquisitions whether from a product perspective or a geographic perspective? Thank you.","Tom Falk"," ","Yes, we have not done a bunch of strategic M&A in fact the one business that probably was doing some M&A was in our healthcare business and then when the spin happens I am sure that that team will have some interest in continuing to look to add healthcare properties to their portfolio. As I look at our core business, we have got enough organic growth opportunities in the emerging markets. Today, a high percentage of our business in the emerging markets is in diapers and bath tissue, we have got huge opportunities to continue to grow baby wipes and Pull-Ups and our adult care business, as the global population ages. So, our KCP business as the world industrializes, has a great growth opportunity for us outside North America and Europe. And so we see a lot of things that we can go chase with big opportunity that we already own and so we're focused on those probably more than looking for the strategic acquisitions.","Operator","","Our next question comes from Javier Escalante with Consumer Edge Research.","Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research","Hello, good morning everyone. Just to kind of how you wrap it up with Venezuela, if you can tell us how much your local currency sales growth was and what percentage of the profit currently represent because I understand that you are now getting access to cadaver rates which other companies in the same space seems not to be getting access to.","Tom Falk"," ","I guess Javier, I wouldn\u2019t assume that other companies aren\u2019t getting the letters of credit at the 6-3 rate like we are, so I mean I think that may be in some categories and not others, the more essential you are, so diapers and bath tissue would be firmly in that area, the more likely you are to get the 6-3 rate. And as you look at 2013 data, Venezuela was a couple percent of sales and a little bit more than that as a percent of profits. It\u2019s probably a little bit higher than that in the first six months of the year, so we've probably seen a little bit faster growth. If you look in the second quarter, I think of the double-digit KCI growth, Venezuela was about a 1 point of that. So, it\u2019s not way out of proportion with the roll in the portfolio.","Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research","Understood, thank you. And the way that I understood your commentary with regards to pricing, you mentioned because 5 points have been both in tissue and personal care international. It seems like not all of it is in place, so does it mean that we're going to see even higher pricing going into the third quarter?","Tom Falk"," ","I mean I think most of it is in place and it's just that as you compare it to prior year, you will have a positive comp for the next several quarters as that rolls through.","Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research","Okay and finally on Mexico. You attribute the decline on the joint venture profits mostly to macroeconomic dynamics but is it -- there is a competitive aspect to it, is something happening to actual retail prices or could you elaborate more on what\u2019s happening with JV income in Mexico?","Tom Falk"," ","Yes, I mean I think if you look at our shares in Mexico, they have been very stable and so the team has defended successfully. There is more competition in Mexico as both CMPC and Mabesa in particular have been aggressive in tissue and diapers. You are also seeing a relatively weak economic environment and a more challenged consumer. There has been some of the tax reform proposals that rolled some VAT through that took spending power out of the pockets of Mexican consumers that had an effect on category health broadly. And you are seeing that in some of the big retailers, I think some of the large retailers have had negative same-store comps for the last two quarters in a row which is the first time in my career I can remember that happening in Mexico. ","And so the expectation for growth down there was to grow 3.5%, 4% and GDP has been growing more like 1% and that\u2019s having a disproportionate impact on consumer confidence. And so again we have got big shares, we are defending them. We got good margins. We are largely protecting those but we are not getting as much growth out of that market as we would have hoped for this year. ","Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research","Thank you, Tom and just one more on, I mean it has been touched before on the weaker volumes seen in diapers in the U.S. It seems to me that when you changed the diaper count earlier this year, volumes weakened. So, to what extent it\u2019s an issue of pricing that after you reduce the number of diapers per package just started losing share?","Tom Falk"," ","Whenever you do a count change, we always get a little bit of a drop in volume because if you think about it the customers are ordering the same number of cases and the consumers are buying packages at the same rate and everyone\u2019s inventory on average drops by the amount of the count change, so that\u2019s not that unusual. We were probably six months later than our primary competitor in making the count change, so we probably had a price advantage for six months and now it\u2019s more of an even competition on that front. So, I guess I would say that part of it, I could understand. We're also seeing those with a growth in Luvs and the feature promotion that they had in the second quarter that\u2019s probably something that we will be more responsive to in the back half of the year both with innovation and making sure we are competitive in key areas.","Operator","","Our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.","Lauren Lieberman - Barclays Capital","","Thanks, good morning. And just to follow up on that last comment on Luvs you respond with some news in the second half, might that imply more activity at the lower end of the market, right, because with Luvs they've got two distinctive brands one more cater into the lower end where Huggies is trying to sort of be all things to all people. So, is that something that you contemplate a more of a mid-tier priced brand or sub-brand?","Tom Falk"," ","Well if you think about it, we, both us and our primary competitor do this in a lot of different ways, so if you would go into China for example you'd find Pampers across all product tiers. You'd see the same thing for us in many markets and so it\u2019s not unusual to have the same parent brand and you'll have a sub-brand, so Huggies Snug & Dry will be our tier 4 brand that we would be focused on competing more with Luvs and I was trying to make sure on the right package price and the overall value equation, product performance and price that delivers to the consumer in that segment. And Luvs is sort of priced above private label and below the Huggies and Pampers tier 4, and so just trying to get that gap right for the value that you are delivering in the product.","Lauren Lieberman - Barclays Capital","Okay. And then on that private label segway, SCA on their call I guess late last week talked about the impact that they believe they are starting to see of the new higher grade capacity income in consumer tissue in the U.S. and that\u2019s something I think that in the past as you've commented, we don\u2019t think it will be a huge impact on the market. Any change in that? What are you currently seeing in terms of this higher quality private label product coming to shelf?","Tom Falk"," ","I mean we are seeing better quality private label. It hasn\u2019t hit our shares at this point in time, so we see Cottonelle as a differentiated offer and Scott tissue has some of the most loyal consumers in the category. And so, it\u2019s probably been a bigger factor for some of the other categories. I think in this last quarter private label bath was up about a share point year-on-year and so that\u2019s not trivial but it\u2019s something that we are watching but it hasn\u2019t had a big impact on our business at this stage.","Lauren Lieberman - Barclays Capital","And do you think that that\u2019s playing a role? I know you can pretty specifically point to Georgia Pacific, trying to regain its momentum, given their problems last year. But do you think that this share gain from private labels also influencing competitor behavior and then just the overall environment gets more competitive. The reasons may be varied but the outcome is the same that everyone gets more promotional?","Tom Falk"," ","If you look at bath tissue and towels, you walk into every store in America and somebody\u2019s branded towel and bath tissue is on deal every week of the year. And so we all take turns with the promotion, so the question is, are you going deeper, are you even trying to be even more frequent? But again, I think we've seen a little bit more depth of promotion from GP this year which is what both Procter and us to some extent have responded to.","Lauren Lieberman - Barclays Capital","Okay, great and then finally just on the healthcare spin. So, earlier in the call you said that share repurchases would partially offset the 2% to 3% dilution from stranded overhead cost in year one. So, does that mean that your ballpark figures at this point we can think about, should we think about 1% to 2% EPS dilution or is it not that high as a net number of the share repurchase?","Tom Falk"," ","That\u2019s probably in the ballpark and we'll give you a more complete answer on the third quarter call when we give you the full scope of we figure out how much of the stranded cost we can take out. If we can take all of it out, there is a scenario where you might not have any dilution but we'll, I think for a working assumption for now that\u2019s probably in the ballpark.","Unidentified Company Representative ","Yes, we will be servicing Halyard in shared services and IT and things like that, so we will be getting some income to cover those stranded costs for at least a period of time next year.","Lauren Lieberman - Barclays Capital","Okay. And [indiscernible] the restructuring you will be able to move quickly enough, so potentially some of that restructuring benefit or offset stranded has actually happened in year one of the spin?","Tom Falk"," ","Yes, that\u2019s the idea.","Operator","","Our next question comes from Chip Dillon with Vertical Research Partners.","Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners","First question is, looks like the tissue margin seem to be quite impressive I think in light of some of the competitive activity that you just mentioned. And I was just wondering if you could help us -- ","Tom Falk"," ","[Multiple Speakers] that's very nice of you.","Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners","Well hey, give credit where credit is due, how about that?","Tom Falk"," ","You want to ask a question? I thought you were just telling us we were doing a great job.","Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners","Well, you got to take the good with the bad I guess but seriously when you look at the business are you continuing to de-sheet, is that one way you\u2019re able to I guess offset some of the promotional inducements you\u2019re providing consumers or is it just totally on the cost side?","Tom Falk"," ","I'd say it\u2019s like the rest of our business, we\u2019re trying to do is products innovation wherever we can so continuing to drive premium variance even in launching flexible moist wipes in the bath tissue category around the world, in many of our international markets we\u2019re selling Kleenex moist wipes for hand and face clean up and so we\u2019re trying to really drive the higher margin segments of those businesses around the world, wherever we can to get the margins where they\u2019re investible and not dilutive to the corporate average. We are to be sure focused on costs in that business because that is a key part of the P&L but it\u2019s as much around innovation and mix management as it is a pure cost take out play.","Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners","Got you, and you know maybe, not that you would know the minds of some of these folks but we\u2019re kind of baffled or intrigued by the fact that there continues to be I guess sort of this onslaught of continued plans to build capacity by either new private label entrants or existing players and I\u2019m thinking of the Kruger announcement in the last week or two and to add I think another machine, what I think was one of your plants and [indiscernible] and then also Asia Pulp and Paper, through their St. Croix, division up in Maine and I, are they just at a completely different part of the market that so far hasn\u2019t touched you and so therefore they\u2019re seeing success without it coming at the branded expense or what do you think they\u2019re thinking?","Tom Falk"," ","Yes, I mean as we look at the North American tissue supply demand balance, there\u2019s been some new assets brought on there\u2019s also been a bunch of capacity taken out and typically in the branded, in the premium arena there hasn\u2019t been that much that\u2019s destabilized the market. At the low end when we look down at the away from home private label tissue market as sort of the bottom end, even that pricing hasn\u2019t been way out of whack, so, so far we\u2019re not seeing anything crazy happening and some of these guys may add capacity, they may wind up taking out some older rollout capacity at the same time and so just because somebody built the machine doesn\u2019t mean that more consumers are going to choose private label.","Operator","The next question comes from Ali Dibadj with Sanford Bernstein.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford Bernstein","I did want to build on that question from a previous ones, if you\u2019re seeing, all of a sudden it feels like a lot of moving parts in your competitive environment, so for the new CAD machines that are coming out in private label so that it\u2019s higher quality, it\u2019s supposed to be not for away from home use but in home use, so that might impact you in the next few years, the (NYSE:PG) [ph] incontinence move and who knows if either of those two things will be successful but it only becomes more competitive, you mentioned already more price competition from GP and so I can understand how there\u2019s a, as you term it, \u2018slightly more difficult environment\u2019 right now, but how do you think about this not just as a short term shift in the marketplace and these changes being more of a long term bad change that you have to deal with.","Tom Falk"," ","I guess I would say this Ali, we probably would say, we\u2019ve always had (proctors) [ph] of tough competitors so we know that they\u2019re always going to be there and we run up against them everywhere in the marketplace, but they all look at it and say globally there\u2019s more tough competition everywhere in the world, and so I look at the SCA coming out of Europe and they\u2019ve been very aggressive growing their business in international markets, we\u2019ve got both Unicharm and Cowle who are expanding out of Japan with terrific products in the personal care front, you know we\u2019ve got the CNPCs of the world in South America that are moving north into Mexico and so there\u2019s no shortage of people that get up every day wanting to eat our lunch. ","So we use that within our own teams as a challenge for us to move even faster on the innovation front and to make sure we\u2019re getting there with the best ideas in market, and that we've got the best marketing capability that we\u2019re sharp on cost and that make sure that we can\u2019t be beat wherever we choose to operate and so it is very much of a motivator for us to know you\u2019ve got that much good competition coming after you every day.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford Bernstein","So I get the motivational angle on it and that\u2019s a great way to manage folks for sure but do people -- do you the people internally really think that there is kind of an acceleration and increased competition in so many of the areas that you\u2019re looking at, or do you think it\u2019s kind of status quo, because it does feel like there\u2019s acceleration at least from an outside observation perspective.","Tom Falk"," ","Yes, no, we are behaving like there\u2019s an acceleration so we are spending a lot more time, war gaming possible competitive activity as we think about launch plans in individual markets for example, Unicharm is about to launch in Brazil a diaper pant, they\u2019ve been building the plant there for two years, and we\u2019ve been planning our defense strategy in Brazil for two years and have launched every pant we can think of in the marketplace to occupy all the key strategy so we probably pulled ahead and accelerated innovation in that market to make sure we were positioned correctly when they did launch and so we are monitoring competitive activity much more closely around the world and trying to incorporate that into our business plan, so that we are as prepared as we can be to not just defend but to thrive in those markets.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford Bernstein","","That\u2019s very helpful lens. If I were to ask you to focus on just one specific area which is China right now, it feels like you are shifting and have over the past couple of quarters actually successfully from driving a lot of your growth from distribution gains, much more to share gains. Can you comment on that observation if that\u2019s really what\u2019s going on there? Number one and number two is what you are broadly seeing from that marketplace?","Tom Falk"," ","Yes, I'd say that\u2019s probably, because every additional city you bring on is probably slightly smaller than the last one. They are still cities of millions of people, so they are pretty good size chunks of business. We are seeing as you get traction in more and more places and are picking up share in those places but that\u2019s -- you are getting probably more share gain although I would tell you any Nielsen data that you see in China, you should think twice about just because the coverage isn\u2019t great yet. ","I think may be the one thing that is different in China is the rapid growth of ecommerce and I think in some of the emerging markets in particular China, you could see a different form of retail development over time with a much bigger e-com particularly in areas with dense population and relatively low delivery cost. And so, I think we'll see how that plays out but we are obviously spending a lot of time with our digital marketing capability and our ecommerce team there to make sure we're fully represented in that channel.","Operator","","Our next question comes from Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank.","Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank","Just the guidance first of all, let\u2019s go down to nickel, why did you even tweak it, was the change just that Kimberly Mexico came in a little wider because the pulp prices came down a little bit, they came down less than you thought but it's not like they are up year-over-year, so if you can just comment on that briefly because it's like I said, its only nickel?","Tom Falk"," ","Yes, we were sense only nickel and basically as we look at the back half of the year, we got half the year in and a $0.20 range seemed a little wide given as tight as we usually are around numbers and Mexico was down enough that we felt like that was probably the right signal. So, we'll give you another look at it in the fourth quarter, may narrow it further at that point in time, we'll see.","","Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank","Okay, got you and then everything you guys have done over the last 10 years, there is may be much more to consumer products company rather than more of a commodity pulp company which has been great. The only metric that hasn\u2019t really moved is the gross margin, so I am curious if you think there is a compelling gross margin opportunity because you things that are in the portfolio, things about the portfolio but that gross margin line and I know commodities have a lot to do with it but that\u2019s the one that really hasn\u2019t budged and kind of to emerge as a consumer products company, I think that your gross margins are about 1,000 basis points below some of the other competitors there, so do you think that\u2019s an opportunity now that everything has kind of cleaned up?","Tom Falk"," ","Well its certainly one that it has gotten better. We're just sorry you haven\u2019t noticed it as much, Bill but it was down around 30 and it\u2019s now up into the mid-30s again. Now that\u2019s where it was before we got hit with a lot of the commodity cost inflation. And I do think that is a big driver of multiple long-term and so it's one of the things, one of the key metrics we focused on with each of business teams is as we bring innovation to market, is it gross margin accretive. And so that we're going to agree completely that\u2019s a key driver of a healthy franchise long-term.","Operator","","At this time we have no other questioners in the queue.","Unidentified Company Representative ","All right. We appreciate everybody\u2019s questions today and we'll close with the comment from Tom.","Tom Falk","","Once again thank you for your interest in Kimberly-Clark.

Please be aware that each of your lines is in a listen-only mode. At the conclusion of today\u2019s presentation we will open the floor for your questions. At that time instructions will be given as to the procedure to follow if you would like to ask a question.","It is now my pleasure to introduce today\u2019s first presenter, Mr. Paul Alexander.","Paul J. Alexander ","Thank you and good morning everyone. Welcome to Kimberly-Clark\u2019s first quarter earnings conference call. Here with me today in Dallas are Tom Falk, Chairman and CEO; Mark Buthman, Senior VP and CFO; and Mike Azbell, Vice President and Controller.","Now here is the agenda for our call. Mark will begin with a review of first quarter results, Tom will then provide his perspectives on our results and the outlook for the full year. We\u2019ll finish with Q&A. We have a presentation of today\u2019s materials in the Investors section of our website. And as a reminder we will be making forward-looking statements today. Please see the Risk Factors section of our latest annual report on Form 10-K for further discussion of forward-looking statements. ","We\u2019ll also be referring to adjusted results and outlook. Both exclude certain items described in this morning\u2019s release. The news release has further information on these adjustments and reconciliations to comparable GAAP financial measures.","And now I\u2019ll turn it over to Mark.","Mark A. Buthman","Thanks Paul and good morning. Let\u2019s start with some headlines. First we achieved organic sales growth of 5%. It was highlighted by 11% growth in developing and emerging markets. Second, we delivered strong cost savings, margin improvements and growth in adjusted earnings per share. And third we continue to allocate capital in shareholder-friendly ways. ","So let\u2019s cover the details of our results. First quarter sales were $4.7 billion, down 4% including a nine point drag from currency rates. Our underlying organic sales rose 5%. Adjusted gross margin was 35.6% in the first quarter, that\u2019s up 140 basis points year-on-year. Adjusted operating profit was up 7% versus a year ago with an operating margin of 17.4%. That\u2019s up a 180 basis points compared to the prior year. ","I am really encouraged by our margins and our cost savings performance, as we start the year. We delivered $90 million of FORCE cost savings and we are off to a very good start relative to our full year target for savings of at least $300 million. In addition our organizational restructuring is on track and generated $10 million of savings in the quarter. Commodities were at $10 million of savings in the quarter. Commodities were a $10 million benefit in the quarter, that\u2019s the first time in more than two years that we experienced cost deflation. ","On the other hand we absorbed significant currency headwinds. The total earnings drag from currency was approximately $0.25 per share or about 19% in the quarter. On the bottom line first quarter adjusted earnings per share were a $1.42. That\u2019s a strong start to the year and up 8% compared to last year.","Now turning to cash flow, our cash provided by operations in the first quarter was $20 million. That\u2019s compared to $437 million last year. The decline was primarily due to higher pension contributions, currency effects and operating working capital and the impact of last year\u2019s spin-off of our healthcare business. In February we made contributions which we financed by a debt offering to our U.S. pension plan in conjunction with the annuity transaction that we announced. As a result of these contributions we now expect that cash provided operations in 2015 will be down somewhat year-on-year. In terms of primary working capital first quarter cash conversion cycle was down seven days compared to full year 2014. So we are ahead of our three to four day improvement objective for the year.","Now moving to capital allocation, first quarter dividend payments and share repurchases totaled $0.5 billion. We continue to provide a top tier dividend payout among our peers and in February we announced our 43rd consecutive annual increase in the dividend. As we mentioned in this morning\u2019s news release in the first quarter we acquired the remaining interest in our subsidiary in Israel for $150 million. As a result we are now targeting full year share repurchases in a range of $700 million to $900 million. Full year dividends and share repurchases should be at least $2 billion or about 5% of our current market capitalization.","Now I will highlight a few areas from our segment results for the quarter, in Personal Care, organic sales rose 6%. Performance was led by developing and emerging markets with organic sales up 16%. Overall Personal Care operating margins were 19.7% in the quarter. That\u2019s up 50 basis points year-on-year. ","Moving to Consumer Tissue, organic sales were up a point, including strong bathroom tissue volumes in North America. Consumer Tissue operating margins of 18.5% were up 330 basis points year-on-year, with a strong cost savings performance and lower between the line spending. And lastly, K-C Professional organic sales increased 7%. Organic sales were up 8% in developing in emerging markets and 4% in North America. The total KCP segment top line also benefited from sales of nonwovens to Halyard Health in conjunction with a limited term supply agreement. Overall KCP margins were 16.9%. That was even with a year ago.","So that wraps up my comments. To recap we are off to a strong start in the first quarter led by organic sales growth at the high end of our 3% to 5% full year target. We delivered strong cost savings, improved margins and growth in adjusted earnings per share and we continue to focus on allocating capital in shareholder friendly ways. Now I will turn it over to Tom.","Thomas J. Falk","Thanks Mark and good morning everyone. I will share my perspectives on our first quarter results and then I will address our full year outlook. But before I do that some of you may know this is Mark Buthman\u2019s last conference call as CFO for Kimberly-Clark. We tried to figure this out the other day and we think he has done 49 or 50 of these earnings in a row and that\u2019s an amazing record. In fact you should know that we had a box of our fine Kleenex facial tissues sitting next to Mark on the table in case, just in case a tear appears in the corner of his eye because I know how much he\u2019s going to miss doing these. But seriously I would like to take a moment just to thank Mark for all the contributions he has made to Kimberly-Clark. He has been an outstanding Chief Financial Officer and a terrific leader and friend throughout his career. So I am pleased that Mark will be able to achieve his long-term goal of retiring later this year.","Maria Henry, who is an experienced CFO, some of you may know her from her work at Hillshire brands will join Kimberly-Clark next Monday and will succeed Mark as Chief Financial Officer and Mark and Maria will work together over the balance of this year to ensure that we have a smooth transition. We are all looking forward to working with Maria as we continue to focus on creating shareholder value through our global business plan.","So now let me turn back to our results and our outlook for the balance of the year. Overall we delivered very good financial results in the first quarter and we are executing well in a challenging environment. Organic sales growth in the quarter was 5% with benefits from our targeted growth initiatives from innovation and from selling price increases in some markets. As Mark just mentioned our business in developing and emerging markets had another strong quarter and it was led by our Personal Care segment. ","Organic sales in diapers rose high-teens in these markets as we continued to benefit from innovation, expansion of the diaper pant and category development overall. So this business has been growing rapidly for some time and you may not know but our diaper business in developing and emerging markets is more than 1.5 times the size of our diaper business in North America. In terms of key growth markets organic sales in diapers increased 55% in Eastern Europe, 35% in China and 15% in Brazil. Huggies volumes were up nicely in all three markets and we have innovation launching in the next few quarters to drive additional growth. We've also increased selling prices in Eastern Europe and Brazil to offset some of the currency declines that have happened in those places. We're also doing well in our other Personal Care businesses in developing and emerging markets. ","Organic sales in fem care were up mid-teens. That included very good performance in Latin America led by Brazil and also in China. Organic sales also increased double digits in baby wipes in our adult care business. ","And K-C Professional grew organic sales high single digits in developing and emerging markets in the first quarter, also a very good performance. So overall we're delivering excellent growth in the developing and emerging markets and I expect our momentum there to continue going forward. ","Turning to our developed markets business outside North America, organic sales in the quarter were even with the prior year. On the bottom line operating profit and operating margin increased significantly and that included very good results in Korea with additional progress in Western and Central Europe. ","Moving to our North American consumer business, sales volumes were up nicely across a number of our brands. That included Huggies baby wipes, Poise and Depend and adult care, goodnight suit pants, Cottonelle bathroom tissue and Scott and VIVA paper towels. ","On the innovation front in North America we introduced improved Huggies baby wipes, we started shipping new Poise pads and Depend briefs. And in March we began the re-launch of our mainline Huggies snug and dry diapers. This relaunch includes product upgrades, a new marketing campaign and increased promotion support and this new product should be out on the shelf in about 80% of our retail customers in North America by late April. ","In K-C Professional at North America we had solid volume growth in our higher margin faster growing wiper and safety products businesses. In wash room our volumes were up low single digits, which is a step in the right direction after a softer performance last year. In terms of the bottom line, as Mark mentioned we had an excellent quarter, improving margins, our focus on profitable volume growth, raising selling prices where we can and then driving cost savings helped us overcome some pretty significant currency headwinds. ","Then finally as Mark already highlighted we continue to allocate capital in shareholder friendly ways which is a key strategy of our global business plan. So all-in-all I am encouraged by our first quarter results. ","Now let me move to the outlook for the full year. Our teams continue to focus on delivering their plans for the year and creating additional flexibility to further invest as appropriate. While we\u2019re only one quarter of the way through the year and the environment out there remains very volatile I'm pleased with our execution so far and despite a more negative currency outlook we're well positioned to achieve our earnings commitments for the year. ","On the top line we continue to target organic sales growth of 3% to 5% for 2015 and on the bottom line we continue to expect full year adjusted earnings per share in a range of $5.60 to $5.80 and while currency headwinds have increased over the last three months we have good momentum with our growth initiatives and with our cost savings programs. And the commodity cost outlook has improved slightly compared to where we were at the beginning of the year. ","Our updated currency and commodity cost assumptions are included in this morning's news release, if you want to refer to those. So in summary we're off to an excellent start to the year. We continue to focus on the fundamentals that drive our long term performance and we remain optimistic about our prospects to generate attractive shareholder returns. That wraps our prepared remarks and now we will begin to take your questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen at this time the floor is now open for your questions. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Ali Dibadj with Sanford Bernstein.","Ali Dibadj","Hey guys, how are you. ","Thomas J. Falk","Hey Ali. ","Ali Dibadj","And Mark congratulations to you. I hope [indiscernible] joy not dealing with us any more on these calls, congratulations.","Mark A. Buthman","That's exactly, Ali absolutely.","Ali Dibadj","A couple of questions. One is, it looks like you are starting to enter this sweet spot, as we call it of commodities really being a tailwind and not having to put back a lot of that into pricing in the category, in promotions in the category. Historically you guys used to say 60% or 70% of the commodity tailwind you have to put back into the categories somehow or reinvest it. Is that what you are expecting going forward in this environment, is little bit more, is little bit less and are you yet at that run rate of reinvestment or should we continue to see an expansion in the sweet spot?","Thomas J. Falk","I think that\u2019s an interesting call. As you look around the world you are still seeing some inflation in some markets, and so as local currencies are really around places like Argentina for example or even Brazil, and so we had 10 million of deflation in the quarter which is good and we think that our guidance of 50 to 150 for the year is probably the right ballpark. ","I think given that last year we had close to $250 million of inflation and didn\u2019t fully recover price on that front, I hope that prices will be a little sticky on the way down. I think the other big driver historically has been pulp, and pulp is not moving around as much as the oil-based commodities and pulp has probably driven pricing more than any of the other commodities overall.","Ali Dibadj","So sounds like you think you will be able to hold on to more than historically given what\u2019s happened over the recent history of prices?","Thomas J. Falk","Yeah, that would certainly be our goal going into it. ","Ali Dibadj","Okay, so something that you said, actually linked to another question I had which is just FX and pricing. So if you look at Personal Care, developing and emerging you say negative 20% FX plus fixed price. If you look at developed non-U.S. there is a miss match there, negative eight FX pricing little lower than that, the same thing on consumer tissues. So looks like the GAAP between the currency headwind and the pricing you are able to take in those markets has widened a little bit and want to get your perspective on that as it relates to the health of the consumer that you are seeing broadly or competition as well.","Thomas J. Falk","It\u2019s tough to get full reflection of the translation impact of currency. So if you can get the most of the transaction impact covered you are doing reasonably well and so in most of these markets we are seeing that. We are getting the transaction partially or mostly covered, but we are not covering the full translation impact.","Ali Dibadj","Okay. And then last thing on pricing in North America Personal Care and Consumer Tissue negative again, is there any risk of that becoming or is it already in this kind of irrational zone, I guess to use a heavy word or do you think this is just kind of normal competition?","Thomas J. Falk","Lot of this is really stuff that happened last year and so it\u2019s preferred [ph] to being annualized. It started in second quarter, we sort of stepped up in third quarter. So it\u2019s really more the comparison. I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s gotten significantly or sequentially. You will see some pockets where there are some lower price points but overall I would say it\u2019s been pretty consistent.","Ali Dibadj","Okay, thanks again and congrats again, Mark.","Mark A. Buthman","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Gail Glazerman with UBS.","Gail Glazerman","Hi, good morning. ","Thomas J. Falk","Hi, Gail.","Gail Glazerman","Hi. Can you talk a little bit about your operating performance in consumer tissue, is a fair bit stronger than I would have expected, you are looking at 2% volume, 1% price decline, it\u2019s not intuitive where the improvement was coming from. Can you just talk about what really drove the earnings recovery?","Mark A. Buthman","Yeah, I mean a lot of it was in the U.S. where we were plus five in volume. It was very strong quarter good execution, Cottonelle continued to do well, and some of it was in the non-measured outlets where you would see, or you wouldn\u2019t necessarily see it in the Nielsen data and then we called out kind of a VIVA Vantage launch and so good strong growth there. And typically it\u2019s a strong facial tissue selling season. Facial tissue was okay, although it was being driven more by Cottonelle\u2019s Scott, Bath and Viva towels.","Gail Glazerman","Okay and can you talk a little bit about the U.S. diaper market. Last quarter you kind of talked about having to step up and may be -- address some of this share loss. How do you think you are doing and when do you think you will see the full benefit and is the [indiscernible] volume decline a reflection of comp more than actions or is that a reflection of some of the actions you have taken to-date?","Mark A. Buthman","No, it\u2019s probably the comps are getting little easier. We are up about a share point sequentially, but the re-launch of our main line Huggies didn\u2019t really start to roll until mid-March and it will roll through the end of April and so the better price getting on-shelf, we are getting better, better execution at store, stronger advertising claims are coming. So I think we'll have to see how that plays out over the balance of the year more than, than we saw in the first quarter. ","Gail Glazerman","Okay. And just the last question, just any comments on the U.S. consumer, any changes in behavior or buying pattern in terms of whether there is more willingness maybe to spend up on premium, purchasing in different channels, purchasing different sizes, just seeing any response to I guess improving confidence and lower gas pricing?","Thomas J. Falk","Yes, I wouldn't say we've seen a ton yet, as I think a lot of retailers I've talked to, have said that a lot of the lower fuel prices either been saved or has been spent inside the gas station buying an extra cup of coffee or something like that and so I wouldn't say we've seen that in category demand. So the trends have been pretty stable. It's not getting worse but it's not, we're not seeing a big shift up either at this stage.","Gail Glazerman","And are you seeing anything in the K-C Professional business, that might give you encouragement or is that pretty much more of the same?","Thomas J. Falk","I'd say, I was talking to our KCP guys recently. We just had a big meeting with lot of their U.S. distributors and they were more bullish. I mean they're seeing the continued slow steady growth in the U.S. economy, the job growth maybe it's been disappointing to some but it's been positive and pretty consistent and so they were more bullish this year, and I think last year with the top weather in the Northeast which we call out as a reason why -- partly while we were down it was still a tough winter but it wasn't as bad as it was last year. So everybody had a little bit stronger start to the year which was good. ","Gail Glazerman","Okay. Thank you. ","Thomas J. Falk","Thanks Gail. ","Mark A. Buthman","Thanks Gail. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Ferrara with Wells Fargo.","Christopher Ferrara","Hey, thanks. Guys, hey how are you?","Thomas J. Falk","Good. ","Mark A. Buthman","I'm really good, Chris. ","Christopher Ferrara","Congratulations. Gross margin, look there has been a lot of question around pricing right and obviously pricing slowed a little bit sequentially but gross margin was up pretty substantially in the quarter and when you do the math on what currency must have done to gross margins, and you look at FORCE, FORCE is good, but it wasn't a particularly extraordinary FORCE number, cost savings, restructuring savings were okay $10 million but not moving the needle, right so can you talk a little bit more about where did all of the incremental gross margin expansion come from in the quarter and how sustainable is that, right because trends, if you look at where commodities are going, where currencies going you think that you probably build on that increase. So I was hoping you could talk that through a little bit. ","Thomas J. Falk","I'll let Mark dive into the cost savings numbers, just a little bit, but essentially Chris if you think about it gross profit essentially was flat year-on-year. Sales were down 4%. So gross margin was up 180 basis points. So essentially it took cost savings, volume benefits, selling price increases all of that collectively to cancel out the translation and transaction impact on currency and so we had a great start on cost savings and maybe Mark can add a little color on where we over delivered on the $90 million. ","Mark A. Buthman","Yes, Chris, as the year progresses typically we build our cost savings program, so to start a year $90 million is really a good result coming out of the gate and it's a combination of leveraging our global sourcing organization, productivity and waste improvements and then a big contributor in the quarter was product design, which are the three typical buckets that we have. I would say the other thing is our operations are performing very well. So if you think about tissue, when we run tissue machines full I know they have low waste and high productivity. There is really good absorption. We actually don't see that element coming through in FORCE. So I would say it's just a combination of good start to the year in cost savings and just overall good operations. ","Christopher Ferrara","And I guess can we dig a little bit deeper into the state of U.S. diapers. So obviously we just had the mainline re-launch of Snug and Dry right and I guess are we seeing or will we be seeing in April the sum total of everything you're doing to get that turned and I guess how are you feeling about the brand equity there, right. How are retailers responding to it, have you gotten and have you held shelf space, have you maybe even gotten a little extra. I guess just any more detail on the prospects for that area of the business would be helpful. ","Thomas J. Falk","Well, I think a couple of things. The super-premium end of that business end of that business has grown really well and had a very strong first quarter. All of our share improvement sequentially was in the super premium and we saw great innovation, winning products out there and strong claims and saw that continue. I think on the Snug and Dry the mainline business we have a much stronger plan this year than we had last year, better product on shelf, stronger advertising claims and we have got a better retail execution plan with more distribution, more feature and display activity. And so we will watch and see how that plays out.","Again we didn\u2019t lose all the share in one swoop, and so I am sure it won\u2019t all come back in one quarter, but I do expect to make steady progress and see some improvement in that business this year.","Christopher Ferrara","All right. Thanks guys.","Thomas J. Falk","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Olivia Tong with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Olivia Tong","Good morning.","Thomas J. Falk","Hey Olivia","Olivia Tong","How are you?","Thomas J. Falk","Pretty good.","Olivia Tong","All right. Congrats Mark. Best of luck, first.","Mark A. Buthman","Thank you.","Olivia Tong","And I guess first question just, you started the year at sort of a high end of the three to five range. So it sounds like you are keeping the range, at least at three to five, which you know in Q1 certainly makes sense. But can you talk to what\u2019s going on for the remainder of the year, that could potentially just result in growth decelerating from where you started the year?","Mark A. Buthman","We will get pretty good momentum, but the comps gets little tougher in the back half, as you recall we finished pretty strong in the second half of last year and so particularly in some of the emerging markets we will see that happen. While everyone is talking about the China slowdown we haven\u2019t seen it yet in our business, but it is affecting some other competitors. So that\u2019s something we will watch as well. We've got aggressive product innovation plans going there. ","First quarter on the volume front in places like Eastern Europe we had some big price increases that took place on April 1. So we had a little bit more volume that went in the first quarter. On the other hand we will get the benefit of those price increases in the subsequent quarters. So we still should see some organic growth a little bit more of volume in place. ","So overall I would say we feel pretty optimistic and we kept the same range. As you said it\u2019s early in the year and this increases the confidence that we can achieve our plan for the year and maybe even give us the opportunity to think about areas that we could reinvest to set up for an even stronger 2016. So it\u2019s nice place to be at this point in the year. ","Olivia Tong","Got it, thanks. And then also you had mentioned that FORCE typically gets better as the year progresses and starting at a $90 million. If we just sort of roll back for the year that clearly suggests something quite a bit higher than just at least $300 million. So can you talk through some of the savings of the cost, I am sorry, the savings this year relative to years past and whether it just was a particularly good start to the year or there is quite a bit of potential upside to your existing FORCE target?","Thomas J. Falk","Olivia you have taken a page out of the CFO handbook. Take good performance and just annualize it and so for us we did have a good start to the year, I would say, given that the nature of the environment that we are dealing in with all the currency challenges and competitive challenges around the world, the teams really were focused on savings as a lever that we control heading into the year and we sort of decided while it\u2019s a good start to the year to hold our outlook for the year, phasing should typically get better, but we started a little faster. So we will give you an update when we get to the second quarter and it feels good to start but we are going to keep delivering.","Mark A. Buthman","I think we made a really strong first quarter in the emerging markets on the cost savings front and so that was a big plus, for some places we have had big currency headwinds. Those teams are looking at price and cost savings to make sure they can try to give us cost to the US dollar [indiscernible] as they can and I think that also helped get us off to a good start. ","Olivia Tong","Does the cost savings FORCE target include the impact of currencies relative to the dollar target?","Mark A. Buthman","Yes, typically that\u2019s what we would disclose that they would aim at. In some individual markets they may have local currency targets that they aim at but at a regional level they all are measured on a dollar basis.","Olivia Tong","Understood, thanks again. I appreciate it.","Mark A. Buthman","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman of Barclays.","Lauren Lieberman","Thanks. Good morning. ","Thomas J. Falk","Good morning Lauren.","Lauren Lieberman","I was just curious, going back to the consumer tissue profitability or I just -- I looked -- my model goes back to 1999 and there is not a quarter with 18.5% margin, so\u2026 ","Mark A. Buthman","Well there is now","Lauren Lieberman","Don\u2019t know, exactly, so just curious to what degree you think you\u2019ve structurally changed the profitability of that business. I understand 5% volume in North America will help a lot, but still the base was already quite good, and I guess for that question for consumer tissue, but even for the company overall, because as you pointed out it\u2019s been two years of inflation, you can\u2019t even say deflation is driving this. So I am just curious your views on whether there\u2019s structural possibility the portfolio is changing it. And if so how and why?","Thomas J. Falk","Lauren I think as you know we have been -- we have really been working hard on this over the years and we did the tissue restructuring several years ago, that had us exit some businesses and close some tissue facilities. We did the European restructuring which had us exit diapers but also had us shape our tissue portfolio. So we have really been trying to focus our business in the higher margin targeted growth areas of that business and we have been making steady progress on the margin front. It feels pretty good to be here and I think the team is excited and is looking for areas where they can invest behind great brands in profitable ways to keep that momentum going.","Lauren Lieberman","Do you feel like -- is the margin profile of the emerging markets, what does that look like? I know we can see North America versus rest of world, but I am just wondering if the D&E market profitability is also a mixed benefit. ","Thomas J. Falk","In tissue specifically or broadly?","Lauren Lieberman","I guess both, since you offered it.","Thomas J. Falk","I would say that we saw a good margin performance in emerging markets as well and the developing is still lower than developed, but they are narrowing the gap and it is a pretty solid performance. So I don\u2019t know Mark if you want to add anything any other color there or you\u2026? ","Mark A. Buthman","I mean that their goal is to grow at or better than the underlying growth rate in the local market and close the margin gap overtime. So I think you just saw us making progress on the first quarter.","Lauren Lieberman","Okay, and when you said that you have covered the transaction expense, with 9% FX headwinds at topline but 19 on the bottom line, I mean guessing you didn\u2019t mean just the pricing, that when you say you covered transaction you also mean by virtue of the cost savings?","Thomas J. Falk","Yeah, I would say because in many markets you have transaction impacts like in Western Europe and Australia it\u2019s very difficult to get any selling price and there has been a pretty good size currency hit in markets like that. In places like Brazil and Russia and Ukraine we probably had a better opportunity to close the transaction gap, but overall a combination of cost saves, volume growth, pricing we have been able to offset the currency impact.","Lauren Lieberman","Okay, all right. Thank you.","Thomas J. Falk","Thanks Lauren.","Operator","Our next question comes from Caroline Levy with CLSA.","Brian Doyle","Hi, this is actually Brian Doyle in for Caroline, just had a couple of questions. If you could comment on the just the share trends in the U.S. adult care overall and for the Poise brand in particular?","And then the second question was if you just clarify the sales to Halyard in the release it read like you were saying that was most of the 6% segment organic growth. Is that accurate and how long does the agreement run? Thanks.","Thomas J. Falk","All right, I will take the first one and I will throw Mark the second one on Halyard. On adult care trends, we probably would say we successfully defended [indiscernible] earlier this week that they successfully launched, and so we have lost less than our fair share. If you look sequentially I think we were down about a 0.5 point overall. I think if you look year-over-year Paul, we are down what? ","Paul J. Alexander","We are down about four points. ","Thomas J. Falk","A little bit more on the Poise side, less on the Depend side. We are launching more innovation this year and are aggressively competing and promoting as is our primary competitor. And so I think private label and the other small branded player have lost more than their fair share and the -- and the category growth has picked up. So we saw solid high single digit category growth which may be a little over stated because of the amount of couponing that\u2019s out there in the marketplace, but it is still a strong performance. ","Mark A. Buthman","Yes, Brain on Halyard that 3% impact which we reported as mix and other in KCP as kind of less than half of their organic growth for this quarter. So it was an important component, but it wasn\u2019t really the underlying driver and the agreement will run for two years and I'm sure there is a small markup on that. I'm sure the Halyard team\u2019s looking for alternative supplies as quickly as they can but the agreement commitment is two years.","Brian Doyle","Great, thanks a lot. ","Thomas J. Falk","Thanks Brian","Operator","Our next question comes from Bill Schmidt of Deutsche Bank. ","Russell William Schmidt","Hey good morning guys. The market\u2019s been a great run. Yes, the [indiscernible] probably on you I hope. First question is where are you getting all this extra distribution in non-scan [ph] channels because again there is a big disconnect from some of the Nielsen stuff we\u2019re getting but it seems like it\u2019s pretty clear and I think you will agree that you\u2019re doing very well on some of the non-track channel. So what are those channels and is that distribution gains or is it just better relative growth?","Thomas J. Falk","You are talking about any market in particular?","Russell William Schmidt","In North America, I think, the U.S. stands out the most. ","Thomas J. Falk","Yes, I mean North America, it\u2019s essentially Club is the biggest non-scan channel and we are probably underweight historically in Club and tissue products. And so that\u2019s been an area that we\u2019ve been trying to crack into with Cottonelle and VIVA and Scott Tissue and things like that and so had some success in the first quarter and that enabled some of that growth. If you look more broadly, particularly in Asia e-commerce is probably by far the biggest non-track channel that we\u2019re outperforming in relative to the track channels. So Korea and China in particular would be places where we\u2019d see a lot better growth in the track channel. ","Russell William Schmidt","Got you and is there like a long term sort of defense strategy against kind of what the P&G is trying to do in Russia and China, Brazil and then is there any incremental impact from some of the Japanese guys, mostly Unicharm but maybe Kao [ph] as well are probably going to start using some of the currency to get more aggressive. So what have we done so far and kind of what\u2019s the plan going forward?","Thomas J. Falk","Yes, I mean it\u2019s a tough competitive market place out there Bill as you\u2019ve noted and pretty much everybody wants the ER launched somewhere. So we\u2019ve got strong global competitors. We\u2019ve got some strong local competitors and so we kind of have good innovation in the competitive on price and execute well everyday to keep it going, and so we see that with some other things that Procter is doing on diaper pants that we\u2019d also would say Unicharm and Kao in many ways have still the best performing products that we benchmark against and so we\u2019re up against those guys in lots of different places and I'm really proud of the way the teams have executed and got better performing products with good execution in market. ","Mark A. Buthman","And I would say Bill that our categories are largely local. Our stuff doesn\u2019t ship long distances. So you might get some currency change like on commodity inputs and things but largely the battle is fought locally and I think with our model we\u2019re set up to do that as well as anybody. ","Russell William Schmidt","Okay, this makes sense and then just -- what\u2019s my last one, oh, China. Can you just disaggregate, it\u2019s impossible to figure out what is like the real comp store sales growth and how much of it is distribution expense and I think you are going to add another ten cities this year plus or minus, so is there any way to kind of look at that massive growth and separate between the two?","Thomas J. Falk","It\u2019s tough. I think if you look sequentially I think our city counts didn\u2019t change much if you look versus the first quarter last year it\u2019s 105 versus 90 last year. But I\u2019ll also tell you e-com probably was the bigger growth factor than the city count change and so some of that is category penetration or channel growth that\u2019s helping those consumers get products in a different way but Mark was just in China about a month ago, so he\u2019s probably got more relevant snapshot of what you saw when you were over there so maybe you can give us some local color.","Mark A. Buthman","Yes, I would say Bill to that the market is still growing at very healthy rates. I mean it\u2019s down from where it was but our team still is very excited and executing well in bricks and mortar but e-com is the only place where they have -- we\u2019ve invested a lot and were over indexed. And as Tom said that\u2019s probably the place where we have driven more of the relative share gains. I think the category is still growing at high single to low double-digit. ","Thomas J. Falk","Yes, double-digits this year. ","Mark A. Buthman","Yes, so we\u2019re growing at a multiple of that and city expansion is a piece of it but I would say e-com and channel expansion\u2019s the bigger component. ","Russell William Schmidt","Got you. Just a brief follow up to go, do you guys co-locate in China like some folks do in the U.S. with the e-commerce players. So I mean are they sharing the distribution space with your manufacturing?","Thomas J. Falk","Yes, our China team is working with our e-com customers to figure out and cost out the whole supply chain. So we\u2019ve done some of that in larger cities as well.","Russell William Schmidt","Great, thanks guys, I appreciate it.","Thomas J. Falk","Thanks, Bill.","Operator","Our next question comes from Javier Escalante with Consumer Edge Research.","Javier Escalante","Hi, good morning everyone. My questions had to with the SG&A line item that were much lower work than a year ago. My calculation is $48 million down. Is that something that has to do with savings or is it has to do with market expanding because you are -- it\u2019s an issue of timing ahead of their re-launch of the Huggies Snug and Dry diapers and then I have a couple of follow-ups?","Thomas J. Falk","Our marketing, the SG&A overall, the top line I mean on advertising spend standpoint we were down 10 basis points versus as a percent of sales, versus prior year but it was basically 10 balance sheet higher than the average of advertising spend for the full year of last year. So it was in the ball park of what we would expect around 4% of sales. On the SG&A probably had a little bit of currency benefit that would affect it but maybe Mark\u2019s got some additional color on that.","Mark A. Buthman","Yeah, no, Javier, I think currency when you look at the absolute dollars, currency is a big, a big shift. We obviously, if you look at the difference between gross margin and operating margin we have got some between the lines efficiencies that the business are driven but currency\u2019s probably the biggest impact.","Javier Escalante","And when you can see the launch of the Huggies diapers, is that because we already have data through mid-April and sales are down 6% in direct channels. So if there is timing issue with regards to again marketing spending that you are doing on shelf because this is the weakest quarterly, I mean monthly data that we have seen for you guys in a long time.","Thomas J. Falk","I guess I\u2019d say we have been getting the distribution started in mid-March and we should be in about 80% of channels by late April and that\u2019s really when you will start to turn on more of that marketing effort at that point of time. We are probably seeing a little bit better consumption data then I would say, you are quoting from the data that you are seeing but it is still early days on the re-launch at this point.","Javier Escalante","And finally what drove the 55% growth in Eastern Europe, and how to think about that?","Thomas J. Falk","Two factors, I mean yeah, I would say two-thirds of it was, or 25% of it was volume and the balance, the 30% of it was price. So some big price increases. Some of the volume was buying ahead of an April 1 price increase but I think if you talk to that team it\u2019s a double-digit volume growth in Eastern Europe, is the right way to think about what they are aiming at for the year and then they attempting to get as much prices they can to offset the currency impact.","Javier Escalante","In the second quarter we should expect emerging markets to decelerate then?","Thomas J. Falk","Eastern Europe you would see less volume growth but we will get the benefit of the price increase that went in. So I wouldn\u2019t necessarily assume that you will see a big deceleration.","Javier Escalante","But is 55 the right number, is it 20 or 15 for Eastern Europe?","Thomas J. Falk","55 is probably higher than you typically expect to see going forward. So you will see some deceleration on Eastern Europe overall, but I think emerging markets should still have another strong quarter.","Javier Escalante","Thank you.","Thomas J. Falk","Thanks, Javier.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Faucher with JPMorgan. ","John Faucher","Yes, thanks. Mark congratulations and I wanted to sort of go back to the CFO playbook you mentioned because this is something -- a comment that comes up multiple times on calls which is if the productivity is heavier towards the end of the year why don\u2019t we see that end of the year productivity carry over in the first-half. So you guys are alone in terms of saying that but it seems that it sort of good sustainable cost saves and I am not trying to question them. It just seems like that would end up sort of rolling over. ","And then my main question goes back to some of the comments about female incontinence and the category growth accelerating here and I guess sort of I understand that there is some couponing which is probably leading to some pantry loading, but I guess how long do you know sort of how big this category can be? ","You do hear that when you get a new product launch from a big competitor that can make the category bigger and I look at some of the advertising you guys have out and looks like you are encouraging some switching in terms of Poise. Can you talk about sort of A, how big the category can be? And B you know how do you feel about categories switching out fem care into incontinence. How does that work for you guys from an economic standpoint? Thanks.","Thomas J. Falk","Let me take the cost savings one first. John, I think it\u2019s how the math works and little bit of programming. So typically we will work out an annual budget cycle and the teams are focused on kind of annual incremental programs and you are exactly right. The programs that we had in place last year don\u2019t stop. They are delivering but we also launch and think creatively about new programs to kind of help us hit our near-term target and I think it\u2019s just a matter of the phasing as we go to those. The underlying programs sort of roll in to your base and then you are looking to build on top of that as we go. ","So you look at cumulative cost savings overtime, that\u2019s a pretty big number, but they build on each other overtime. And it\u2019s just kind of the way the planning process goes and how the businesses behave.","Mark A. Buthman","Switching to Adult care, we know for a long time that a lot of women that have white water leakage issues, and one in three women at some point in their life experience white water leakage, that they have used fem care as a solution and so given that we have a much larger share with our Poise brand in that space than we do in fem care we would love to shift into that space as a better solution and it\u2019s a place where we are going to get more than our fair share of those new consumers. ","And so you are seeing a little bit of that, of the growth and Poise has been a bit of a decline in the Fem Care category and overall we should benefit from that and consumers will get a better solution for the issues that they are trying to treat.","John Faucher","Okay, thanks.","Thomas J. Falk","Thanks, John.","Operator","At this time we have no further questioners in the queue.","Paul J. Alexander","All right. We thank everyone for the questions. And I will turn the call back to Tom.","Thomas J. Falk","So usually I get the last word on these calls, but since this is Mark\u2019s last call I am going to throw it to Mark and let Mark have the last word today.","Mark A. Buthman","Well, I am just grateful to work for Kimberly-Clark. I have a cold today. So I have the world\u2019s softest facial tissue right at hand and also have anti-viral, so I don\u2019t transmit my germs to my fellow conference call mates. I have had a good fortune that to build a career at a great company like Kimberly-Clark and work with great leaders like Tom, who always got the best out of me, work with great people like our investors, our Board of Directors, the leadership team that Tom has, my leadership team and it\u2019s been a very good one. ","I am really proud of what we have accomplished but I am also optimistic about the future. Tom has made a great selection for my successor. Maria is fantastic and she is going to see opportunities that quite frankly being around for long time, I just didn\u2019t see. And so I am optimistic about the future and committed to helping Maria and the new GSLT [ph] get started up. So thanks for your support and thanks as always for your support of Kimberly-Clark.","Thomas J. Falk","Thank you very much.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen that concludes today\u2019s presentation.

Alexander","Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our year-end earnings conference call. Here with me today in Dallas are Tom Falk, Chairman and CEO; Mark Buthman, Senior VP and CFO; and Mike Azbell, Vice President and Controller.","Here's the agenda for our call. Mark will begin with a review of our fourth quarter results, followed by an update on pulp and tissue restructuring. Tom will then provide his perspectives on our full year results and our 2012 outlook. We'll finish with Q&A. As usual, we have a presentation of today's materials in the Investor Section of our website.","This morning's presentation also includes an appendix with the details of our 2012 planning assumptions.","Before we begin, let me remind you we'll be making forward-looking statements today. There can be no assurance that future events will occur as anticipated or that our results will be as estimated. Please see the Risk Factors section of our latest annual report on Form 10-K for a further discussion of forward-looking statements.","I'd also like to point out that we will be referring to adjusted results and outlook, both of which exclude certain items described in this morning's news release. For further information on these adjustments and reconciliations to comparable financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP, please see today's news release and additional information on our website. With that, I'll turn it over to Mark.","Mark A. Buthman","Thank you, Paul, and good morning. Let's start with the headlines. First, we achieved organic sales growth of 3%, highlighted by 7% growth in K-C International. Second, we generated solid improvements in both adjusted gross and operating margins. And third, we delivered adjusted earnings per share of $1.28. That's a 7% increase compared to the prior year. ","Now let's cover the details of the quarter. Overall sales increased 2% to $5.2 billion. Organic sales rose 3%, driven by higher net selling prices of 2% and increased sales volumes of 1%. On the other hand, lost sales in conjunction with the divestiture, combined with the impact of our pulp and tissue restructuring, reduced sales by 1%. ","Moving down to P&L. Adjusted gross margin was 32.6%.  That's up 20 basis points year-on-year. The improvement was driven by higher selling prices and $70 million of FORCE cost savings. These items more than offset cost inflation of $55 million and the negative impact of lower production volumes. Fourth quarter adjusted operating profit rose 9%, and adjusted operating margin was 14.7%. That's up 90 basis points compared to the prior year. In addition to the gross margin improvement, adjusted operating margin benefited from flat between-the-line spending and higher other income. ","Fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share were $1.28. That compares with $1.20 last year. The improvement came despite a higher effective tax rate and lower net income from equity companies. So for the year, adjusted earnings per share were $4.80, at the low end of our previous guidance range of $4.80 to $4.90 a share. ","Cash provided by operations in the fourth quarter of 2011 was $517 million. That compares to $948 million in the prior year. The decline was driven by a significant improvement in working capital last year that didn't repeat in 2011, along with higher pension contributions. Fourth quarter 2011 primary working capital levels were solid overall, although receivables did increase somewhat including some impact from timing of collections. For the full year, our cash conversion cycle improved 3 days to a record low of 47 days, and I expect us to continue to show improvement in 2012. In addition, we anticipate modest pension contributions this year, which should help drive a substantial increase in operating cash flow in 2012. ","Consistent with our previous guidance, we did not repurchase any common stock during the quarter. For the year, we repurchased 19 million shares at a cost of $1.24 billion. Including dividends, we returned approximately $2.3 billion of cash to shareholders during 2011. We'll continue to allocate capital in shareholder-friendly ways heading into 2012. We plan to invest $1 billion to $1.1 billion of capital spending to grow our businesses, and we expect to increase our dividend at a mid-single digit rate, which will be our 40th consecutive annual increase. We also expect to repurchase $900 million to $1.1 billion worth of our shares this year. Together, our plans for dividends and share purchases will total at least $2 billion of cash returned to shareholders in 2012. ","Now I'll highlight a few areas from our segment results for the quarter. In Personal Care, organic sales rose 3% with volumes up 2% and net selling prices advancing 1%. K-C International had another great quarter with 11% organic growth led by Latin America, China, South Korea and Vietnam. ","In North America, organic sales fell 5%, mostly due to lower volumes. We continued to generate solid volume growth in Adult Care. On the other hand, volumes were down in infant and child care, including the impacts of category declines, competitive activity and some consumer trade-down in the Child Care category. Personal Care operating margins of 15.4% remained well below prior year. The decline was driven by input cost inflation, higher between-the-line spending and increased promotion spending in North American diapers. We clearly aren't satisfied with margins at these levels, and we expect to bring more of the 2011 U.S. diaper price increase to the bottom line in 2012, which should help improve overall margin performance. ","Now turning to Consumer Tissue. Organic sales were up 1%. Net selling prices rose 3%. Product mix was favorable by 1 point, while organic volumes fell 3%. Consumer Tissue operating margins improved to 14.3%. That's our best performance in over 2 years. That was driven by selling price increases, cost savings, input cost deflation and lower between-the-line spending. Margins were up in every region around the world, and I'm encouraged by the improved profitability that our tissue teams delivered in 2011 and expect to see further progress in 2012. ","Moving to K-C Professional & Other. Organic sales were up about 3%. The increase was driven by improved volumes and higher net selling prices. Volumes were up low-single digits in each region, despite market demand continuing to be relatively sluggish. Operating margins of 15.5% were up 150 basis points versus last year. It was driven by benefits from sales growth and cost savings. ","Lastly, Health Care organic sales were up 9%. That included volume growth of 7% and higher net selling prices of 2%. Medical supply volumes rose double digits led by growth in exam gloves and surgical products. In addition, our North American medical device business increased volumes at the mid-single digits. Operating margins of 14.3% were up considerably from last year, driven by significant litigation-related expenses 1 year ago that were connected with our I-Flow acquisition, along with benefits from sales growth and cost savings. ","So that wraps up the financial review of the quarter. But before I turn it over to Tom, I wanted to provide an update on our pulp and tissue restructuring actions. Overall, we made significant progress in 2011 and we're on track or ahead of all major elements of our plan. Actions are underway or complete at all but one of the facilities that will be impacted by last year's announcement. ","In the fourth quarter, we closed our pulp mill in Australia. We sold 2 K-C Professional facilities in Spain. We announced the closure of our pulp mill in Everett, Washington. Earlier in 2011, we streamlined a Consumer Tissue facility in Australia. In addition, as mentioned in this morning's news release, we recently made a decision to streamline an additional Consumer Tissue facility in North America that is located in Chester, Pennsylvania.","Taking into account all restructuring actions, both the January 2011 announcement and this additional streamlining action, we now expect total restructuring charges of $385 million to $420 million after-tax over the 2011 and 2012 time period within the range we expected 1 year ago. We incurred $289 million of after-tax charges in 2011. So most of the restructuring charges are now behind us. ","Lastly, in terms of the benefits from restructuring, we're ahead of plan. Fourth quarter savings were about $10 million. That brings full year 2011 savings to $20 million. We continue to grow -- expect to grow savings and reach at least $75 million in 2013, and we now anticipate savings of at least $100 million in 2014. So all in all, I'm very pleased with the progress our teams are making with all our restructuring actions. So that wraps up my comments. ","To recap, we achieved solid organic sales growth, led by K-C International. We delivered improved margins and earnings per share, and we continue to allocate capital in shareholder-friendly ways. Now I'll turn it over to Tom.","Thomas J. Falk","Thanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Since Mark has already reviewed the fourth quarter, I'll focus my comments on the full year, and then I'll discuss our 2012 outlook. ","So starting with our 2011 performance, adjusted earnings per share rose 3% in 2011. That's below our original objective for the year. That was mostly due to 2 factors. First, we absorbed about $580 million of cost inflation, and that was more than double our original expectation for the year. And second, we had soft demand in portions of our developed markets particularly in the infant and child care categories in the U.S., which continue to be impacted by a multi-year decline in the birth rate. So regardless of the reasons, we're not satisfied with the results that we delivered in 2011, and we plan to get back on track in 2012. Having said that, we did make good progress in several areas that I'll highlight briefly. ","First, we launched a number of innovations, including Huggies Little Movers Slip-On Diapers, Poise Hourglass Shape Pads, Kleenex Cool Touch facial tissue, U by Kotex tweens and an improved COTTONELLE bathroom tissue. All of these innovations are performing very well in the marketplace so far. Our innovations and our supporting marketing programs helped improve our brands' market positions. In the U.S., we improved or maintained market share in 6 of our 8 consumer categories in 2011. We also increased market share in a number of areas in K-C International such as in China and in Latin America. ","Second, we successfully executed our growth initiatives. K-C International's performance was particularly strong with 8% organic sales growth and a double-digit increase in operating profit. In China, Personal Care organic growth was 20%, boosted by our expanding diaper business, while Huggies are now sold in more than 70 cities. And in Latin America, Personal Care organic growth was more than 15%. In total, K-C International accounted for about 36% of K-C's sales in 2011. That's up 3 percentage points from the previous year. ","Elsewhere, we achieved mid to high single-digit volume growth in North America in a number of businesses including adult care, feminine care, baby wipes and our Health Care medical device business.","Third, we took aggressive steps in response to the cost environment. We achieved higher net selling prices of 2%, and we delivered $265 million in FORCE cost savings, and we tightly controlled our overhead spending. In terms of commodities, cost moderated some over the back half of 2011 from the peak levels we experienced in the summer. At the same time, our pricing and cost reduction initiatives built further momentum. As a result, our second half of the year adjusted gross margin was up 100 basis points from the first half of the year. So I'm encouraged by this performance, and I expect more improvement in 2012. ","Finally, as Mark mentioned, we made excellent progress with our restructuring actions, and we continue to allocate capital in shareholder-friendly ways. So overall, we achieved our top line goal, we missed our bottom line target last year. We also delivered a number of important accomplishments, and we plan to build on them going forward. ","Now let me turn to our 2012 outlook. In short, our plan is to continue to execute our global business plan, to invest behind our brands and to deliver improved growth in adjusted earnings per share. Now we expect economic conditions to remain challenging in the near term, particularly in developed markets. And while we're cautiously optimistic that portions of the U.S. economy are improving, we aren't planning for a big increase in market demand. Category demand will remain soft in the infant and child care categories in the U.S., and we're also closely monitoring the European marketplace and events in Venezuela. On the other hand, we anticipate another strong year for K-C International, boosted by solid economic growth and execution of our growth strategies. ","In terms of commodity costs, we're assuming a relatively benign environment in 2012. We currently expect an impact in the range of $50 million of deflation to $50 million of inflation. So costs will be down slightly in developed markets, but up somewhat in emerging markets. On the other hand, given the strengthening of the U.S. dollar over the last several months, foreign currency exchange rates will likely be a headwind for us this year. ","We have an excellent pipeline of innovation launching across the business this year, [indiscernible] activities in North America include an improved Huggies diaper, a new and improved Huggies baby wipes lineup, and exciting innovations in adult care and feminine care. We also have several launches coming in K-C International, particularly in infant care and in feminine care. So we'll support our innovations and targeted growth initiatives with an increased level of strategic marketing, and spending in this area should rise much faster than sales growth. We'll also increase our investments in research and development and selling to support our future growth and to improve our capabilities. ","At the same time, we'll continue to manage our company with financial discipline. We expect to deliver another solid year of cost savings and to return significant amounts of cash to shareholders again this year. So all in all, in 2012, we expect to deliver organic sales growth of 3% to 4% and adjusted earnings per share growth of 4% to 7%. The growth in adjusted earnings per share compares favorably to our 2011 growth of 3%. Similar to 2011, given the timing of our initiatives, we expect that adjusted earnings per share will be stronger in the second half of 2012. ","So to summarize, we continue to execute our strategies for the long-term benefit of Kimberly-Clark. We expect to make significant investments behind our brands in 2012 and deliver improved bottom line growth. And we remain convinced that execution of our Global Business Plan will continue to improve shareholder value. So that wraps up our prepared remarks, and now we'll begin to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ali Dibadj with Sanford Bernstein.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","So just a few questions. One is obviously want to drill down a little bit further on K-C North America particularly on infant and child care being down high-single digits. And you mentioned some drivers, so category softness from birth rate, competitive promotion and trade-down. Can you help just aggregate the large decline into those buckets, so we can try to figure out -- I mean, can you help us figure out going forward which one of these things are going to get better?","Thomas J. Falk","Yes, I guess I'd say a couple of things. If you looked at -- for the full year of 2011, the category for baby -- for diapers was down 2% to 3%. Our volume was down about 4%. So it was a little bit steeper in the fourth quarter with the count decline. Basically we took 7% of diapers out of every bag across the fourth quarter. Usually we don't see all of that hit. This time, we took a bigger hit from that. So that should start to roll off as consumers rebuild their household inventory. Second factor, price. We'd expected to realize more of that price in the fourth quarter. More of it wound up being spent back in trade but also in couponing, really to respond to the competitive environment. Some of that was a response to our launch of Huggies Little Movers Slip-On Diapers in the third quarter, where there was still a lot of noise in the marketplace. But that should start to get better sequentially.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. Okay, if we switch gears just a second, and obviously, you guys are very well known for strong capital allocation, giving back to shareholders. This year, I think it was $2.3 billion and I'm referring [ph] -- I think it was $2.3 billion. Next year, it sounds like it's going to be a little less than that, both dividend and share buyback. But it's been at least for the past couple of years below your free cash flow. How should we think about that? How should we think about the philosophy there, and the safety, frankly, of those things that people gravitate towards from the quarter 4 [ph]. And also particularly in the context that it looks like it's going to be a little bit less this year versus last year.","Thomas J. Falk","So last year, as you'll recall, we said early in the year, we were going to take out about $700 million of additional leverage, and that, that was going to be a higher than normal year. So I'd say this year will be another solid year. I think it'll be the 40th year in a row we've increased the dividend. So that's obviously a strong long-standing commitment, expect to see that continue. And I'd say maybe the challenge that lots of multinationals face is as we make more money overseas is getting that money back on a timely basis to be able to use it to fund dividends and share repurchases, and we've been aggressive at that. And you see that in the slightly higher effective tax rate next year than this year, as it does cost more to bring that money back. But it's not our plan to accumulate cash in the balance sheet long-term.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","So is it your plan to accumulate debt to be able to pay the dividend and the share buyback that people are used to?","Mark A. Buthman","No. I think if you take a look at the cash flow we'll generate, say, next year, round numbers, let's take $3 billion, you'll have $1 billion to $1.1 billion go to CapEx, you'll have $1 billion to $1.1 billion go to dividends, and the balance will go back to -- in the form of share repurchases. As the business grows, you want to target to be a solid single A credit. Over time as we did this year if we can take on just a little bit of leverage and keep us right in that solid range, we might make the decision to do that. But you should think about us funding those obligations primarily out of operating cash flow.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. Because that hasn't been the case for the past couple of years, obviously. So -- and then last question is, is just a broader question of what you said for reaching your top line, but we missed at the bottom line goal and then next year, gross profit will grow faster than operating profit. It seems like -- and this is not just a Kimberly question -- you have a broad, obviously, view of the whole sector, but it feels like, look this is just the new world we're in where you're going to have to invest more, one is going to have to invest more than you used to just to grow like you used to. Is that -- are you seeing any end in sight about this? Or is that just kind of the new view that we're going to have to have going forward here?","Thomas J. Falk","Well, I'd say the markets are certainly more competitive and there's plenty of things to worry about in the world today. But if I look at last year and say, wow, we had a commodity cost spike that was double our original expectations, it's tougher to get price quickly to cover that, and that showed up in our numbers. We do have a fair amount of carryover price increase coming into 2012, and commodity environment looks like it's going to be more neutral for us. So we should see that flow to the bottom line a little bit more readily in 2012.","Operator","Next question comes from Jason Gere with RBC Capital Markets.","Jason Gere - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I guess 2 questions. One, wanted to just go back on the Personal Care margins. Obviously, it's kind of the lowest that we've seen in a while. So as we think about the year progressing and coming off that floor, I mean, what's your view? Is it more commodity is going to get better as the year progresses? Or do you see the promotional environment easing? And can you get back to that 20% kind of margin that we've been accustomed to seeing for the last couple of years?","Thomas J. Falk","Yes, I'd say a good near-term target is to say -- if you look at where the fourth quarter margin was in Personal Care, it was kind of the low point to get back.  In 2012, something closer to the average for 2011 would be a good first step, and that's probably more realistic given the -- at least where the price of oil seems to be hanging these days. I'd say the things that are going to get better will be, one, getting some positive price realization as opposed to negative price drag. That's the quickest and easiest, as it's already in place in the marketplace. We've just got to bring it to the bottom line. There'll be some commodity relief, but that's not going to be a huge plus for us in Personal Care. You probably may be seeing more in the near term on tissue with lower pulp prices.","Jason Gere - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then, I guess, just shifting to my next question, I think you said when we look at the cadence of earnings for the year, the second half would be stronger than the first half. Was that correct?","Thomas J. Falk","Yes, I said the profile will be similar to what it was in 2011. So I think in 2011 the way it shook out is, I don't know, 47% of our full year earnings were in the first half and 53% were in the second half. So what you tend to see is a slightly positive bias toward the back of just because cost savings build during the year. And so you'll -- that's typically the way it plays out. We have a couple of other business, KCP and Health Care in particular, where distributors tend to have a much stronger December than January. And so there's a little bit of seasonal bias that pushes it that way as well.","Jason Gere - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Because I guess my thought was that the first half, you would see much stronger gross margins just given the easier comparisons and kind of where pulp has played out in -- unless is there any change in cadence for the organic sales, the 3 to 4, should that be pretty steady every quarter? Or, I mean, maybe the timing of innovation, I'm just wondering -- that's why I was just a little curious why the second half would -- I understand the cost savings but why the second half would be stronger than the first half especially with the gross margin kind of upside coming in the first half of the year.","Thomas J. Falk","Yes. The cost inflation should be much more favorable in the first half of the year, especially as pulp is below our full year estimate range, but some of the other factors, you said timing of innovation and the -- and marketing investments related to that affected as well.","Jason Gere - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Great. And then just the last question. I know last quarter you talked a bit about trade destocking in the Battery [ph] category. I was just wondering, just generally speaking, relationship with retailers. Are you seeing anything in North America in particular right now just in terms of how retailers are managing the inventory, especially in the category like diapers where you are seeing softer trends?","Thomas J. Falk","I would say nothing abnormal at this time of the year. And so, retailers everywhere just like companies like us are all trying to take days out of their cash conversion cycle. And so you see that kind of push, but these are pretty high-turn categories. So they can't afford to be out of stock either, so I think that's the balance point for us.","Operator","Our next question comes from John San Marco with Janney Capital Markets.","John P. San Marco - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","I was surprised you didn't call out the mix shift toward K-C International as a driver of margin decline in the Personal Care segment. Can you tell me either how operating margins compare in K-C International versus rest of world, or how much of the margin decline is being driven by K-C International's rapid growth? Or is it really just not that material?","Thomas J. Falk","The mix shift from K-C International is not that material overall. And so, I mean, we took a look at it and didn't think it was noteworthy enough to comment on.","Paul J. Alexander","And, John, this is Paul. Actually just for the fourth quarter, margins in K-C International, Personal Care were up year-over-year. So the gap is closing.","Thomas J. Falk","We got more price in Personal Care in the International business than we did in the -- obviously, North America was negative. So that was part of it.","John P. San Marco - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Sure. And then this brings me to my second question, which is, I was hoping to learn more about the 7% price decrease in Europe Personal Care. Was that promotion or list price? And then I guess why make such as severe price investment when the volume growth in that region seemed to be pretty darn strong?","Thomas J. Falk","Yes. It's really more of a timing of promotion in Europe. As to when you're on deal, you typically have bigger discounts and higher volume spikes and it's more of a function of how the trade in Europe wants to run the category. So when you're on promotion, you're going to see that kind of a relationship. If you look at the full year, you wouldn't see as big of a shift. It just happened that more of it was in the fourth quarter of this year compared to last year.","John P. San Marco - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Got it. And then the last, just one quick housecleaning. Did you say how much advertising was up for the quarter or for the year?","Thomas J. Falk","For the year, it was pretty flat in absolute dollar terms, and, I don't know, Paul, if you've got the quarterly numbers.  Similar, I think if...","Paul J. Alexander","It's the same for the fourth quarter, pretty similar to year-over-year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chip Dillon with Vertical Research Partners.","James Armstrong - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","This is James Armstrong filling in for Chip. First question, why did the diluted share count increase at the end of the year? Was there something abnormal with the options or was something else going on?","Thomas J. Falk","Well, we hit a all-time record stock price, so there was higher option exercise than normal in the fourth quarter. So that was the primary factor.","Mark A. Buthman","Yes, and we didn't buy shares in the fourth quarter, which we expected.","James Armstrong - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","Okay, perfect. And then the other question I have is on tissue and pulp restructuring, you saw a $20 million benefit in 2011 and expect $30 million in 2012. First, am I right in assuming that, that is an incremental $30 million for 2012 for a total of $50 million? And then second, why is the improvement this gradual, specifically given the Everett mill is a giant discrete item, why wouldn't you see more of $100 million in 2012?","Thomas J. Falk","Yes, good questions. The answer to your first question is yes, the $30 million is incremental to the $20 million. And the answer to the second question is we -- given we knew where this was going, we really started taking steps to reduce spend at Everett in 2011, which is why we probably got more benefit in 2011 than maybe we were expecting at the time we started the restructuring. So cutting maintenance spending, things like that, that wouldn't have a benefit when you knew the facility was going to be closed or sold were -- we were able to get more benefit there in 2011 than we expected.","Operator","Our next question comes from Javier Escalante with Consumer Edge Research.","Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research, LLC","Two questions. One, I think that Mark made a comment that you were looking to realize more diaper pricing going in 2012. And the question is, what needs to happen, because we understood that the Slip-On Diaper introduction, the couponing, you probably already knew it, and basically we should have seen a more positive mix in the fourth quarter given that you reduced the diaper count. So I'm kind of like confused how come we see diaper pricing deterioration in the fourth quarter, but at the same time, Mark mentioned that you are looking for more pricing realization and the volumes are so weak. So I'm confused about your guidance and the way you are looking at the category in the U.S.","Thomas J. Falk","No, I think in the fourth quarter, we wound up spending more on coupons competitively to make sure that we had the right value equation. Some of that was in response to our Slip-ons launch.  Some of it was just the other activity that takes place in the category from time to time. So we didn't realize as much of the price increase as we thought we would.  We expect that to be better overall in 2012 as the pricing is in effect longer, and we would expect to see a more -- competitors line up to that over time. We'll see what happens in the marketplace.","Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research, LLC","Yes, but if your volumes were so weak with less pricing, what give you confidence that you can realize more pricing? Shouldn't volume even worsen if you take more pricing? I mean, if volumes were down so much in the quarter, why is it that if you take more pricing volumes are not going to deteriorate?","Thomas J. Falk","Yes. I mean, our share overall was flat in the quarter. So we'd, say -- we picked up some share with Slip-ons and in our Super Premium segment. We've got some innovation coming in 2012 that will obviously strengthen our product line up across the board, and we believe that in the end, mom wants the best diaper for her baby and she'll choose Huggies with the product lineup that we have in place.","Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research, LLC","And finally, on the planning assumption of pulp averaging $940 to $960 per ton into 2012. Our pricing, the thing that we see in the spot market is well below that.  It's nearly or over $100 per ton in January. So 2 questions here. Why is it that you are forecasting such a conservative pulp budget number? And secondly, coming back to the question whether your earnings progression should be front-end loaded instead of back-end loaded just because of given that the cost environment is such a -- you have the carryover of the pricing in 2011 and then you have -- you're lapping very high commodity increases last year. So I'm still also confused about how much of advertising spending you need to increase in order to make these earnest progression back-end loaded again in 2012?","Thomas J. Falk","Yes, good questions. From a pulp forecasting standpoint, we look at the 3 major industry forecasters and average those, and that's basically what our process is.  We don't try to outsmart the experts in this area. And so the experts are expecting China to come back and be a stronger buyer, and that's going to lead to higher fiber prices as 2012 progresses. We'll see if that takes place, and we'll update you on our actual assumptions as we go through the year. We don't buy a lot of spot tonnage, but the current market price is below that. And so that will be a factor that will help the first part of the year. But there are other factors that will push it the other direction, and I think, as we said, overall, our guidance is to be slightly back-half loaded, not easily [ph] so, but a profile looks similar to what we saw in 2011.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Faucher with JPMorgan Chase.","John A. Faucher - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Quick question for you. On the other income line, we saw a big favorable swing. I think it was about $0.13 or so this year. And just wondering, as we look to map that out next year, it's going to be a relatively tough lap again, sort of more in the back half of the year, which would argue for a little more of a front-end loaded year. But how do we think about that line item, not just for 2012 but also sort of longer term to try and map that out a little bit better?","Thomas J. Falk","Yes. I mean, the primary thing that goes in there on a normal basis, is currency exchange or transaction gains and losses on currency hedges that we have in place. And so we had more gains this year, which was a big driver. Our guess is as we look at swings in the currency market late in 2011, we'll likely have more losses on those lines in 2012. And we also had a onetime effect.  We sold a small healthcare joint venture that went in the fourth quarter. So that kind of stuff will pop in there from time to time, when we have those small gains or losses on things. This year they happen to be gains, but in our guidance, we don't assume that any of those will take place in 2012. So that'll also be a factor in the year-on-year earnings growth rate. We won't have as much good news on that line for sure.","John A. Faucher - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. So we're probably better off just going in, predicting something closer to flat or, plus or minus low singles and then kind of going from there.  Is that the right way to look at it?","Thomas J. Falk","I'd say that sounds about right.","John A. Faucher - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then you guys talked about the working capital improvement that you're projecting out. And can you walk us through? Is that can be something we should see relatively quickly? Or is that something you think it's going to be sort of a slow build over the course of the year?","Mark A. Buthman","No, it'll be a slow build across the year. Inventories will be the key driver. We do have a lot of innovation coming to market, which is, depending on which business is launching you're going to see some ebbs and flows as we build inventories to get ready for launch. But you should think of it as more gradual, and it's -- order of magnitude, 2 to 3 days over the course of the year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Gail Glazerman with UBS.","Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Going back to inflation a little bit. Can you talk about what you're seeing in terms of -- and expecting in terms of both waste paper and resins? I mean, the white pulp, if anything, waste paper seems to have come off even sharper. Are you expecting that to rebound as you are with pulp?","Thomas J. Falk","Yes, I mean, I think our full year forecast for waste paper is higher than the current spot and that's one that -- we hit an all-time record in September, and then it dropped way off in the -- late in the fourth quarter. And so we're currently seeing prices in the market that are below our full year average. And that one, we don't have ramping back up probably quite as much as pulp this year, but there is still -- the forecast for that is to have some upward pressure as the year progresses. And resin I'd say, the -- our current outlook for the year is slightly higher than the current prices we're paying. So we're really calling for oil in that -- how does it fall, $90 to $100 a barrel kind of range or...","Paul J. Alexander","Yes, $95 to $105.","Thomas J. Falk","$95 to $105, yes.","Paul J. Alexander","Polymer for the full year shouldn't be a big factor in the year-over-year comparisons, pretty similar to 2011 average. But as Tom mentioned, it's starting off the year a little bit lower than our full year expectation.","Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And can you talk a little bit about demand trends that you're seeing in K-C Professional around the world, anything that makes you feel maybe a little bit better entering 2012 or a little bit worse given how economically sensitive it is?","Thomas J. Falk","Yes. I guess, a couple of things. I mean, our businesses in emerging markets is a place we're putting a lot of focus. So we've got some aggressive growth plan in Latin America, places like China and Russia. So we're putting more sales people on the ground, and we're really -- we're aggressively growing those areas. So we're certainly taking share and in some cases, pioneering new category spaces. I would say, Europe, for lots of reasons that all of you are likely aware of, we would say is probably one that's looking like it's going to have a tougher economic growth year in 2012. We already have strong share positions there, but the economic growth and the pricing environment in Europe is going to be tough. North America, a mixed bag. I think we're cautiously optimistic. We saw some progress in the fourth quarter in our washroom business, and we've got a lot of innovation coming in 2012. So we'd probably expect to see a fairly benign economic growth, so very low single-digit, and we could hopefully do a little bit better than that in the North American market, particularly in places like safety and healthy workplace.","Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And just one last question. You mentioned the trade-down in infant and child care, and I'm wondering, one, was that mainly in terms of product or was it private label? And was that something you're seeing in any of your other product areas?","Thomas J. Falk","Private label shares actually for the full year were pretty flat, and I think they were flatter down in all categories but one. And in diapers, what you saw more was Pampers lost a little bit of share to Luvs, and we picked up in our Super Premium segment behind the launch of our Slip-On Diapers. And we gave it up out of our tier 4 business or our mainline business, but private label shares were fairly flat. I don't know, Paul, if you've got the data there but...","Paul J. Alexander","Yes, just to build on that. In the fourth quarter, private label picked up about 1 share point in the training pant category.","Thomas J. Falk","In training pant but not in diapers.","Paul J. Alexander","Diapers, they were -- it was flat.","Thomas J. Falk","Yes.","Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. But did you see anything across any other product areas, in tissue or anything else?","Paul J. Alexander","No. As Tom mentioned, for the full year, private label was up in only 1 category, and that was about 0.5 point in feminine care.","Operator","Our next question comes from Connie Maneaty with BMO Capital.","Constance Marie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Just a couple of more questions on your outlook for commodities. It strikes me also that natural gas is at a decade low. And I think electric rates might also be lower than they were in the last year. Is it -- can you tell us what your outlook on those is? And if costs come in better than your forecast, is it your intention to reinvest it or to drop it to earnings?","Thomas J. Falk","Yes, good question. So, I mean, natural gas, I think, our outlook is what, Paul, $3.50?","Paul J. Alexander","$3.00 to $3.50.","Thomas J. Falk","Yes, and so that's a little higher than the current spot prices. Obviously, we also buy a lot of gas around the world. And so it's -- those are -- that's just the U.S. price, and there is more variability around that. For every dollar and MMBtu, it's, what, $16 million or something on a full year basis. So that can be a big impact. Now we are at least partially hedged going into 2012. And so we're typically hedging 12 to 18 months out on a rolling basis. So not all of that will drop directly to the bottom line, and part of it we will have locked in to protect against spikes. And from a pricing standpoint, I mean, it's our intention to take the benefit of the commodity costs where we can. Obviously, if it shifts too much, you'll start to see market pricing adjust in some categories, and that can be an offset. We already have our strategic marketing plan laid out for the year, and know where we want to spend it and what we are going to spend it on, and so we'll focus on that. But if we have benefit from commodity costs over that, we'll risk surprising you on the upside.","Constance Marie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. Can you describe how business [ph] does in terms of demand or takeaway or market straddle when the balance of strategic spending [indiscernible] promotion versus tilted more to advertising?","Thomas J. Falk","Again, I'm not -- the question was broken up just a little bit, Connie. Were you asking how is the business plan looking at it with strategic marketing versus trade?","Constance Marie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Yes, it's not how it --  it's more what's your experience in terms of demand or market share when the plan is [indiscernible] more towards advertising versus promotion.","Thomas J. Falk","Well, I think that one of the exciting things about the plan is that it's not just advertising by itself. It's advertising coupled with some great innovation aimed at a specific consumer need area. And so we've got great innovation in the market that we're supporting now. We've got more coming in 2012. And so we're going to spend behind those big ideas. And what we've seen is when we do that, you have stories like, you buy Kotex where you can pick up  share in the marketplace. And so that's what the plan is in 2012 is to continue to invest behind innovation, invest behind our brands in emerging markets. And that's a more sustainable way to create growth going forward.","Operator","Our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays Capital.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Couple of things. So first was just on the businesses in Personal Care that aren't infant and child care. So I know wipes tend to be a bit choppy depending on timing of promotions and such. But both fem care and adult care decelerated. Adult Care I would've thought you would have kind a follow-on benefit of the Poise launch at the end of the last quarter, and it's the first time we've seen fem care volume down slightly. Comp has been tough for a while. So any additional color you can add there would be great.","Thomas J. Falk","Yes.  Probably it's timing of innovation. We've got a lot of innovation coming in fem care in 2012, and so we probably had a little lighter promotional calendar than normal. And we're saving up our dry powder for that activity, which is going to hit later this year. And in Adult Care, I'd say, overall, shares look good and promotional calendar was a little lighter. It was around some of the same phenomena. We've got some innovation coming, particularly in North America on that front. So both businesses had a solid year overall and look like they've got great growth planned for 2012.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","On the fem care piece, was U by Kotex volume still up or was that part down as well? [indiscernible]","Thomas J. Falk","Yes. No, U by Kotex was still up.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then on the Adult, I'm just curious, though, because the Poise launch happened at the end of the quarter. So was there any kind of shifting of promotional dollars also because of the competitive dynamics in child and infant care? Was that part of it?","Thomas J. Falk","No, no, really not. I mean, we laid up a plan for those businesses and executed the plan. And I think despite the challenges in infant and child care, one of the things our North American team did a great job on this year is really insulate the key innovations. So whether it was Cool Touch or some of the new COTTONELLE variants or some of the things that we launched in independent Poise, we did those really per the plan that we tested.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, great. And then K-C International, I mean, it did -- I know the growth is still quite strong especially relative to developed markets, but there was a pretty significant deceleration sequentially. So just what were the biggest win factors there?  And the comp wasn't particularly tough. You had Venezuela in the numbers last year. So as we look forward, are we thinking high single digits or just go back to being double-digit growth?","Thomas J. Falk","No. I think that's the right range. If you look at our business in China and Latin America, those did very, very well. There's other parts of the world that aren't as strong. Australia, for example, had a relatively soft volume quarter. Korea still is quite strong. So there was nothing fundamental in the numbers that I saw that was driving that. I don't know, Paul, if you've got any other color for Lauren.","Paul J. Alexander","Yes, just the one another thing that happened in Q4, Lauren, was we started to roll off a little bit of some of the price increases that helped boost the numbers in the third quarter. But volumes continue to grow nicely and high single-digit growth overall for the business.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, great. And then on restructuring. So the additional North America tissue piece, can you just tell us a little bit more about what that facility is? Is it more private label or is it branded capacity?","Thomas J. Falk","No, the -- Chester is a large tissue facility in the Northeast that has served the heritage Scott tissue and Scott towel business for many, many years. And it's really a testimony to our Consumer Tissue  supply chain team that as Dave currently leading [ph] the organization and freed up capacity, they were able to take some capacity out of that facility and still service our business with our remaining assets. And so we challenged them to continue to improve margin and find ways to improve their cost structure, and they've served up some really exciting ideas for us this year.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, that's great. And my final thing, sorry, was just on share repurchase. So, I mean, my memory is that last quarter when you talked about making the bigger pension contribution and holding back on repo in the fourth quarter, that the expectation was a sort of above-normal year for repurchase in 2012. and just the numbers you've laid out, strong but fairly typical actually. So what's changed in your thought process on share repurchase for this year?","Mark A. Buthman","Yes, Lauren, I think on a typical basis we might buy back 700 million to 800 million of shares. We're at 900 million to 1 billion this year. If we have additional cash that we can bring back effectively, we'll probably -- there's a chance we could buy it -- be a little bit above that. But it's consistent with the plan we laid out in the fourth quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from Alice Longley with Buckingham Research.","Alice  Beebe Longley - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","I have a follow-up question about your first half versus second half guidance. I think you said the year is going to be second half weighted, similarly to 2011. So that means the year-over-year increases in earnings are likely to be even throughout the year?","Thomas J. Falk","Yes, similarly. Yes, that sounds about right.","Alice  Beebe Longley - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay. And your guidance is for an increase in your SG&A ratio driven largely by intensified marketing, it sounds like. Is that going to be weighted entirely to Personal Care? We had, in the fourth quarter, spending between-the-line in tissue was down, and promotions were also not a factor off the top line for tissue. So I'm just wondering if the increase in spending is all weighted to Personal Care in 2012.","Thomas J. Falk","It's probably heavier weighted to Personal Care. We've got more innovation coming in baby, child care and adult care and feminine care in 2012. But where we have innovation on COTTONELLE or Kleenex around the world, we'll spend behind those ideas as well. I think on the selling expense front, we are also adding selling expense capability for our K-C Professional and Health Care businesses as we grow those businesses internationally especially. So you'll see a little bit of a push in that line. And we're trying to manage the rest of our G&A to grow at a slower rate than sales if we can.","Alice  Beebe Longley - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Should we assume that SG&A in tissue is up versus 2011, the ratio?","Thomas J. Falk","In terms of including strategic marketing?","Alice  Beebe Longley - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Yes.","Thomas J. Falk","Yes.","Alice  Beebe Longley - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","So that intensifying SG&A ratio applies to both Personal Care and tissue?","Thomas J. Falk","Yes.","Alice  Beebe Longley - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay. And my final question is about margins for Personal Care. I think you said that in 2012, you should get to the average margin for 2011. Does that mean that we should see for all of 2012 the same or similar margin for Personal Care as the entirety of 2011? Or are we only going to get to the average of 2011 by the end of 2012?","Thomas J. Falk","No, I think for a full year basis, that's the right target. And so that's what we're aiming at.","Alice  Beebe Longley - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","And the idea is margins might be down in the first half and up in the second for Personal Care?","Thomas J. Falk","Certainly the comparisons will be tougher in the first half. That's for sure. And so you should expect to see more of the year-over-year quarterly improvement happen in the second half, just because the comparisons will be a lot easier.","Alice  Beebe Longley - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","And then since we've got even EPS increases through the year overall now, does that mean that operating margins might be up more for tissue in the first half than the second as sort of an offset to what happens in Personal Care?","Thomas J. Falk","Well, you -- with the lower pulp cost, you're going to get more benefit of that in tissue in the first part of the year. That's for sure.","Alice  Beebe Longley - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay. So we've sort of got reverse trends in terms of margin comps in tissue from Personal Care?","Thomas J. Falk","In the first half of the year, that's probably correct.","Operator","Our next question comes from Todd Duvick with Bank of America.","Gregory Hessler - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","This is actually Greg Hessler standing in for Todd. Just one quick housekeeping item. You guys have the February 2012 maturity of $400 million. Have you identified whether you plan to retire that with excess cash on hand or if you'd to look refinance that?","Mark A. Buthman","It would be a combination of cash on hand and short- and long-term debt. We'll make that call in February.","Thomas J. Falk","We exited the year with no commercial paper outstanding, so we got lots of flexibility.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Ferrara with Bank of America.","Christopher Ferrara - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So I just wanted to get a little bit deeper into the reinvestments you're going to make, right? So I guess, if I look at marketing research G&A as a percentage of sales, I guess, it spent a lot of time historically around 17%, crept its way up to 18.6% in 2010, came back down again in 2011. And, I guess, for your guidance to work, right, for operating profit to grow 3% to 6% and for gross profit to grow more than that -- in other words, if we assume your guidance on gross profit and for your EPS guidance to make sense, you need mRNA, basically, MR G&A to be that kind of at historical highs in 2010. And, I guess, can you talk a little bit about that? And is that right? And is that maybe why we're seeing the organic sales guidance at plus 3 to 4, which is essentially an acceleration in a pretty tough environment?","Thomas J. Falk","Yes, well, I think you're directionally right on the level of spending, and if we spend all that money and don't get any top line lift, I'm going to feel really bad about it. So yes, we are -- we do have a lot of innovation coming. We're going to invest behind it at appropriate levels. We've got exciting growth plans in our emerging markets around the world where we're building out our platform. And we've got -- we're going to continue to invest despite the challenging economic environment, and we believe this is a great opportunity for us to drive our business and pick up share in some of these markets.","Christopher Ferrara - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","That helps. And, I guess, can you just give a little color around, I guess, the disaggregation between launch spending and, I guess, you made reference to capabilities, building capabilities in the press release [ph] too.  And I think you said something about building up in Latin America. Can you just talk, I guess, about how you might think about the breakout between those 2?","Thomas J. Falk","You mean in terms of how much of it is onetime versus how much of it is part of long-term plan?","Christopher Ferrara - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Yes. Essentially, yes. I mean, how much is advertising, right, behind new product launches? And how much of it is just building up a sales force in places where you want to be more aggressive?","Thomas J. Falk","I'd say more of it is strategic marketing, and a much smaller percentage of it would be building up sales capability. And so it is one -- if you said we -- a healthy model is we're bringing margin-accretive innovation to market, enhancing our gross margin and reinvesting a part of that every year in higher strategic marketing spending. We haven't always been able to do that, because of the commodity volatility we face and the difficulty we've had in getting price increases to offset that. And so this is another step forward in that direction, but it's one that we think is a journey that if we continue to drive innovation at the right level, we'll be strategically investing in the business long term.","Christopher Ferrara - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Right, that's helpful. And, I guess, one last thing, can you try to help us out, I guess, directionally on what you think pension expense year-on-year in 2012 will be and what you think the FX drag from a profit perspective would be? I mean, even if you had it in basis points gross margin grade, EPS, pennies, either way would be...","Thomas J. Falk","Yes. The pension should be pretty flat. We put enough money in the plan last year, and as you know, we took some action several years ago to really wind up or freeze our DB plan, so that we don't have as big of an impact. We moved everybody into a defined contribution in the U.S. So that isn't as big of a factor as it may have, would have been in previous years. And FX, I don't know, Paul, if you've got any color on that from a percentage drag?","Paul J. Alexander","Yes, if you look at just translation, it could be a couple of points of operating profit headwind, and transaction is harder to quantify precisely, but it's probably in that ballpark as well. So overall, currency is going to be a mid single-digit drag on results next year.","Christopher Ferrara - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got it. And from the profit side, some of that's I suspect in gross margins or in COGS, and some of it's also in between-the-lines, is that right?","Thomas J. Falk","Right. And some of it might wind up in the other income expense line, or the transaction part, where we had gains this year, we may have losses next year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I know you talked about private label trends in diapers this year, but if you look back to like 2008 till now, it looks like private label took about 4 points of market share. Do you think that's cyclical?  Or is that a change in consumers' mindset in the diaper side? Because, obviously, that's a lot of volume that's going away.","Thomas J. Falk","Yes, our total category view would not be that significant.  Actually it spiked up in early '08 when the -- by a couple of points when the economy turned south, and then it has shifted back down. So you might be looking at some of the measured outlet data might look a little different. But on an all-outlet basis that we look at, I don't know. Paul's got the numbers in front of him, but...","Paul J. Alexander","It's about 1.5 points increase, Bill, from 2008 to today.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. I mean, that's a big increase though, right? I mean, especially because it's such capacity utilization game in diapers?","Thomas J. Falk","Yes. I mean, I would say it's not a trivial increase, but it is one that we continue to be focused on. We've got to be competitive across all spectrums. So I would say if you look back to a little longer perspective, when I was running the diaper business in the early '90s, I think private label shares were up in the mid-20s. And so they actually have come down over the long term even though they have spiked up a little bit in recent terms.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Got you. And then just on pricing again. Broadly, it seems like it's really schizophrenic. So, I mean, if you look in the U.K., and it's only a quarter of data, but it seems like you guys had a 12% price decrease in diapers. I mean, is that really just timing of promotions? But you kind of do it category by category, tissues use was way up, Procter's [ph] was flat. I mean, can we read anything in terms of like is there going to be a consistent pricing across the industry? Or kind of what's going on there?","Thomas J. Falk","Because you've got both trade as a reduction of sales and consumer coupon values as a reduction of sales, we add all of that up into a net, plus or minus, price number. You're going to have more volatility there. And so there really wasn't any list price changes in Europe. It was all a combination of trade and couponing, and the same is true in the U.S. So you're going to have more volatility in those numbers.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Got you. I mean, so we shouldn't -- it doesn't suggest that there's a change in strategy in Europe. I mean, you want to optimize, get to that double-digit operating profit number, and then take it from there. Is that still the MO in Europe?","Thomas J. Falk","Yes, absolutely.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then just on the tax rate, because like you said before, you're generating all this cash overseas and you're going to continue to repatriate it to pay the dividend and whatnot. I mean, is the tax rate for next year the new base? Or will it kind of go up every single year because more and more cash is coming in from overseas and has to be repatriated every year? And the reason I ask that is if that's the case, because it looks like the sort of evergreen 6% to 9% EPS growth [ph] algorithm, it's still in place but you lose kind of 2 points on tax. And is there going to be a 2 point tax hit every year now, going forward?","Thomas J. Falk","No, I don't think so. I think what you typically see is probably -- and Mark's looking at me, so I'll let him correct my estimate here, but I would say we've assumed in our plan something like a 30 to 40 basis point increase in the effective rate over time, makes sense. And actually, we came in at low end of our range this year. Next year is more kind of the normal level that you'd expect, and so we've got to go do tax planning and see if we can improve on that. We don't have the visibility of those at this point. But, Mark, maybe you want to add more color to that.","Mark A. Buthman","No. I think that's right. If you look at the last 10 years, tax has been a help to our algorithm. Looking forward, it's probably going to be a little bit of a drag. But I think the good news is, from an operating standpoint, the business we've got between innovation and marketing support, we should be able to have more of an operating earnings-driven plan.  But -- and we're -- our tax team works hard. We've worked hard to get to the bottom end of the range this year, and we'll work hard to get to the bottom end of the range next year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Caroline Levy with CLSA.","Caroline S. Levy - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Just a couple of quick things. Can you tell us what's going on in Mexico and what you think the outlook is for that? And also just elaborate a little bit on the Venezuela risk. And then I just want to clarify, are you -- is there very little risk of a down first quarter? Because again it seems like you did say it's going to be a back-end loaded year. I just want to understand what the risk is in the first quarter if you could help.","Thomas J. Falk","Yes, sure. On Mexico, I assume you're talking about Kimberly-Clark de Mexico, and so we've got a very strong business there. They had a little tougher finish to the year where they got hit in the fourth quarter with a weaker peso and high commodity costs and they didn't get much price realization. They're expecting a better year in 2012 as the peso should improve a bit on a relative basis and they should be able to get some pricing. So we're expecting that to be a positive. Venezuela is one that -- obviously, with a presidential election this year, it's difficult to say what exactly will happen there. It's only about 1% of our sales and about 3% of our operating profit. And so it's not a huge factor for us, and it's one that we're watching and managing very closely. And with regard to the first quarter, we don't really give specific quarterly guidance anymore, and so we'll give you a full year guidance and a little bit of a perspective on the profile, and then every quarter, we'll update you on how we did. And so that's really the message we have going forward.","Caroline S. Levy - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","And then just, sorry, a follow-on. The retail environment, when they see pulp prices down as much as they are, are you -- you tend to encounter some pressure to withdraw pricing or to fund sales in any other way, retailer-driven?","Thomas J. Falk","I mean, even at our current pricing levels, the current level of pulp cost would support that. And so we never really were priced up for the peak, and much of the pricing went into effect at pulp price levels that are pretty similar to where they are now. And so that doesn't mean they don't call and ask, but we have a very good story when they do.","Caroline S. Levy - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","And I'm sorry, are you in any way hedged on pulp? Or do you tend to just buy in the open market?","Thomas J. Falk","No, we tend to buy at a market-based price.","Operator","The next question comes from Chip Dillon with Vertical Research Partners.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","It's actually me this time. I'm having -- I just wanted to -- I have a little difficulty in reconciling the year. If we look at your pulp forecast, which is spot on to what Reese [ph] said 2011 was for NBSK, 951. And so we just made a simple extrapolation that the 2 tissue segments were roughly flat '11 to '12, and I'm not saying that, but just roughly, that would mean that the Personal Care business would have to really surge back in 2012 to like a record, like $1.8 billion in terms of EBIT, to get you there. And so it just seems like if I take your pulp forecast, and assume nothing else heroic happens in K-C Professional or Consumer Tissue, you're going to have to see quite a turnaround from the rate of earnings that you saw in PC in the second half, which was actually under $1.5 billion. So is that -- is there a different way you would encourage us to think about that?","Thomas J. Falk","Yes. I would say assuming that K-C Professional and Consumer Tissue were flat year-on-year, would probably be an incorrect set of assumptions. So we wouldn't think that was an acceptable plan, and the people that we have running those businesses wouldn't either. So yes, no, we would expect to have a decent growth year in both KCP and Consumer Tissue in 2012. We got lots of cost savings coming through. We got more restructuring savings coming through. We've got lots of brand activity going on. So I'd expect to see a positive growth year in both those segments of the business.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","And so even if they both were up about 10%, which would be $130 million, you would still have to have a number that approaches the 2010 level for Personal Care to get to, at least on my calculations, to the low end. So I guess even then, you're still saying you expect a nice recovery in Personal Care during 2012.","Thomas J. Falk","Yes. And as we talked, I mean, getting back -- we've got a lot of innovation coming, lots of investment behind that, but getting back to a margin that is roughly equivalent to the full year segment average in 2011 would be a big turnaround in that business this year.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","Okay. And then the second little question I had was I noticed on the -- well, 2 things on the -- do you actually disclose or can you tell us much natural gas you use at least in the U.S. and maybe outside the U.S. every year?","Thomas J. Falk","Yes, natural gas, we use about 16 million MMBtus a year. So every dollar of MMBtu is about $16 million in cost, and that's really just North America. We don't have -- I don't think we've given statistics outside of that. But I don't know, Paul, if you've got any other rules of thumb for him.","Paul J. Alexander","The global number, including the U.S., would be about twice that amount.","Thomas J. Falk","Yes.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","Okay. And then you also mentioned, I don't have it in front of me, but the other fiber that you use beyond pulp, I believe was 1.4 million, which was a lot higher than what I think we'd have been using in the past. And I didn't know if that is just -- I would imagine most of that kind of is reflecting the growth outside of the U.S. in Consumer and K-C Professional. Is that basically it?","Thomas J. Falk","Yes, that's basically right. I'd say that number's been kind of creeping up. I mean, it was 1.2 million not that long ago, but now it's up to about 1.4 million. And so it just reflects growth in KCP and in some cases, recovered fiber is a pretty significant source of fiber for our consumer business as well in some markets.","Operator","Our next question comes from Javier Escalante with Consumer Edge Research.","Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research, LLC","I have a question with regards to, again, to the Personal Care business, the diaper business in North America. Number one, if you can tell us how much of the decline in volumes has to do with the changing diaper count? And also whether this allocation or this change in inventory for retailers, that $30 million that you commented in the release is disproportionately allocated to diapers. I'm just trying to understand what is the underlying industry growth in diapers given that you are saying that you didn't lose share but again high single-digit volume growth is pretty high. So I don't think that -- I just trying to reconcile this.","Thomas J. Falk","No, the $30 million was really a cost of downtime in the quarter. And so that was our -- the cost of idling facilities and that was spread across our business in various places as our teams really -- they focus on hitting inventory at a target level, and if they're at target level, then they shut machines down, whatever business that is in the world. And so some of that fell on our Baby, Child Care business as our volumes underperformed expectations. As it relates to the reconciliation of our volume in the quarter versus our share, I mean there's a lot of factors that affect those, I'm sure you know. I mean, our mix was positive, and so that helped us from a share standpoint, but other than that, we really haven't got the analytics yet to unpack everything that happened from a volume standpoint. So some part of it's trade inventory, some part of it's consumer household inventory, et cetera.","Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research, LLC","But the reduction in diaper count, does it have an impact on your volume growth or in the way you measure volume growth or not?","Thomas J. Falk","No, because we're measuring thousands of diapers in our volume count. But if you think about it, consumers buying a package with 7% fewer diapers in it. And so on average in their home, their household inventory drops. But usually you'd say maybe about half of that, and based on historical count reductions, would be the impact that you'd have in the period that you did the cut reduction, because if you said, \"Okay, on average, consumer's got a half a bag in their household, that bag has 7% fewer diapers, so half of that would be 3.5.\" But this quarter, we had a bigger volume drop, and so part of that was about the count change, and probably part of it was mix, some part of it was retail or inventory changes. It's hard to digest which piece of that exactly took place here.","Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research, LLC","Let me phrase it differently then. What is your assumption for underlying diaper growth or contraction in North America going into 2012, down 2%, down 3% because of the lower birth rate? What is the industry growing at or declining at?","Thomas J. Falk","If you looked at full year 2011, it was down 4%. And I would expect it to be less negative than that in 2012. So down 2% is probably a reasonable expectation.","Operator","At this time, we have no further questioners in the queue.","Paul J. Alexander","All right. Thanks, David. We'll wrap up with a closing comment from Tom.","Thomas J. Falk","Okay. Well, once again, we're not satisfied with our 2011 performance. We're going to get back on track in 2012 and have another year where we successfully implement our Global Business Plan. Thank you for your support at Kimberly-Clark.","Mark A.

We now have your presenters in conference. Please be aware each of your lines is in a listen-only mode. At the conclusion of today's presentation, we will open the floor for your questions. At that time, instructions will be given as to the procedure to follow, if you'd like to ask a question.","It is now my pleasure to introduce, Mr. Paul Alexander.","","Paul Alexander","Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our second quarter earnings conference call. With us today are Tom Falk, Chairman and CEO, Mark Buthman, Senior VP and CFO and Mike Azbell, Vice President and Controller.","Here is the agenda for our call. Mark will begin with a review of second quarter results. Tom will then provide his perspectives on our results and the outlook for the full year. We will finish with Q&A. We have a presentation of today's materials in the Investor section of our website which is www.kimberly-clark.com.","As a reminder, we will be making forward-looking statements today. Please see the risk factors section of our latest Annual Report on Form 10-K for a further discussion of forward-looking statements. We will also be referring to adjusted results and outlook. Both excludes certain items described in this morning's news release. The release has further information on these adjustments and reconciliations to comparable GAAP financial measures.","Now I will turn it over to Mark.","Mark Buthman","Thanks, Paul and good morning. Let me start with the headlines. First, we achieved organic sales growth of 3% led by 9% growth in K-C International. Second, we increased adjusted earnings per share 8% driven by organic sales growth and strong cost savings. Third, we are on-track with our overall capital plan, including working capital, capital spending and returning cash flow to shareholders.","Now some details for the quarter. Second quarter sales were $5.3 billion and was even with last year. Underlying organic sales rose 3% with increased fines of 2% and higher net selling prices of one point. While sales in connection with our restructuring activities reduced sales by 2% and unfavorable currency rates reduced sales by a point. Second quarter adjusted gross margin was 34.5%. That\u2019s up 90 basis points from last year. The increase was driven by organic sales growth and $80 million of FORCE cost savings, partially offset by $30 million of input cost inflation.","I am really pleased with our continued momentum with FORCE. We delivered at least $80 million of savings in each of the last four quarters and we are now raising our full-year target to $300 million to $350 million of savings for the year. That ranges $50 million higher than our previous expectation and will help offset additional currency headwinds that Tom will talk about in a minute.","Moving down to P&L. Adjusted operating profit rose 6%, with an operating margin of 15.5%. That\u2019s up 70 basis points compared to last year. Strategic marketing spending was down $20 million and that comparison was impacted by a high level of innovation related spending in the second quarter last year and also some lower spending in Europe this year given the strategic changes We are making there. Foreign currency translation effects reduced operating profit by $15 million and transaction effects further negatively impacted that comparison.","The second quarter adjusted effective tax rate was 31.8%. That\u2019s up from last year but in line with our full year target of 30% to 32%. Equity income was up 28% as K-C de Mexico had another quarter of excellent performance. So, putting it all together, second quarter adjusted earnings per share was $1.41. That is up 8% year-on-year.","Now, turning to cash flow. Cash provided by operations in the second quarter was $576 million, compared to $740 million last year. The decrease was driven by higher tax payments, pension contributions and severance costs in Europe. So, halfway through the year, we are on track with our plan and expect our cash generation to improve sequentially in the back half of the year.","In terms of capital allocation, second quarter dividend payments and share repurchases totaled more than $600 million. We repurchased 300 million shares worth of KMB stock in the quarter. We now expect full-year sharing purchases of $1.2 billion. That's at the high end of our target range of $1 billion to $1.2 billion for share buybacks for the year.","Now, to highlight just a few areas from our segment results for the quarter. In Personal Care, organic sales rose 3%, driven by volume growth. K-C International had another good quarter with organic sales up 8% continue to make excellent progress with our targeted growth initiatives across K-C international. Tom will provide some more details in a minute.","Elsewhere in Personal Care, organic sales were down low single digits in North America, but high single digits in Europe. Second quarter Personal Care operating margins of 18.1%, rose 130 basis points. Improvement was driven by organic sales growth and cost savings, partially offset by cost inflation and unfavorable effects of currency.","Now, before we leave Personal Care, let me give a brief update on the strategic changes we have underway in Europe. We've now stopped selling Huggies diapers in all markets except Italy and we closed our Spanish production facility in May.","In terms of organization changes, we are about halfway through the total expected workforce reductions. So, in total, our European team continues to make good progress with the changes and they are on track to deliver their full year operating plan.","Moving to Consumer Tissue, organic sales were up about 5%, with volume growth of 3% and higher net selling prices of 1%. Volumes improved in North America in K-C International, but were down slightly in Europe. Consumer Tissue operating margins were solid, although they were down 30 basis points versus last year.","Turning to K-C Professional, organic sales were up 2%, driven by higher net selling prices. Despite flat sales volumes for K-C professional team continues to drive profitability. Second quarter operating margins of 19.1% were up 270 basis points year-on-year with strong cost savings and the benefits of pricing action. Lastly, Health Care organic sales were down 1%, driven by lower surgical and infection prevention volumes, Health Care operating margins of 13.5%, we're essentially even with year ago period and we've got more work to do Health Care profitability did pick up nicely from the first quarter.","So, that wraps up my comments.","To recap, we generated solid organic sales growth. We delivered strong margins and improved adjusted earnings per share and we continue to allocate capital in shareholder-friendly ways.","Now, I will turn it over to Tom.","Tom Falk","Thanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. I will briefly comment on our second quarter results and then I'll address our full year outlook. So, starting with the second quarter, I am encouraged by our strong cost savings, by our margin improvement and by our bottom line growth. As you can tell from Mark's discussion, we continue to perform well in these areas.","Our organic sales growth is the one part of our results that was not totally satisfied with. As you heard from Mark, our performance was strong in K-C International with 9% growth overall, an excellent progress against our targeted growth initiatives. For example, in our diaper business in K-C International, our volumes were up 45% in China and 10% and both, Russia and Brazil, an improved net realized revenue brought total organic sales growth to about 20% in Brazil.","Elsewhere in K-C International, we delivered double-digit organic sales growth in feminine care, adult care and baby wipes and organic sales were up 8% in K-C Professional within the K-C International space. So, our K-C International team delivered an excellent quarter of broad-based top line growth. They also improved their operating profit margin despite headwinds from currency and the conditions in Venezuela.","On the other hand, volume was below my expectations for some of our other businesses in developed markets, including K-C Professional, Health Care and Huggies diapers in North America. Some of that shortfall was related to fairly sluggish category demand. I want you to know that our team is focused on driving better topline growth by fully taking advantage of our innovation and marketing programs and our sales capabilities. Our year-on-year comparisons also get somewhat easier in the back half of this year. So, overall, even with the more mixed topline performance in the quarter, there were a number of positives in our second quarter results and halfway through the year, I am encouraged with our overall progress.","Now, let me move to the outlook. As we have all observed, the macro environment has become more volatile in the last few months with rapid changes in currency rates, interest rates, financial markets, economic growth rates and most recently the price of oil. Despite this volatility we will continue to execute our global business plan and that means pursuing targeted growth initiatives, launching innovation, reducing cost and returning capital to shareholders.","We have made excellent progress with these strategies overtime and I expect that to continue going forward. On the innovation front, we will continue to roll out new and improved products in K-C International, particularly diapers, premium feminine care and adult care. In North America, we launched a number of innovations in the second quarter that will be fully supporting in the back half of this year. We will also be introducing innovations on our U by Kotex and Poise brands in the third quarter.","In terms of our financial target for 2013, on the top line, we continue to expect full-year organic sales growth of 3% to 5%. Performance should be led by K-C International, which continues to target high single-digit growth. We now expect that currency will be a one to two point drag on the topline with recent spot rates implying a drag of about two points. Our previous assumption for an impact of 0% to minus 1% on the topline. The one to two point topline drag from currency should cause us similar negative translation impact on the bottomline, along with additional negative transaction effects.","Despite the more negative current environment, we are also reconfirming our full year adjusted earnings target of $5.60 to $5.75 per share. We expect to overcome additional currency headwinds primarily from higher FORCE cost savings, as Mark mentioned. In terms of selling prices in this environment, in K-C International we will be opportunistic and improving our net realized revenue wherever were able to do. While we aren\u2019t planning any significant new price increases in the near-term, if spot currency rates are maintained, I will expect that some increases will occur in some market.","As usual our earnings guidance is based on foreign exchange rates effected over the balance of the year. As currencies hold their recent spot rates for the balance of the year, it's less likely that our adjusted earnings per share will reach the upper half of our guidance range. In the past few years, as currency rates have moved in one direction, we have also seen commodity cost that\u2019s generally moved in the other direction and right now, we are not seeing that traditional pattern occur.","So even though we expect currency rates to be more negative than our previous plan, our full year outlook for cost inflation continues to be $150 million to $250 million. In fact, if oil prices hold at over $100 per barrel, that could push cost inflation into the upper half of our estimated range. As I am sure you will, we will also continue to closely watch the relationship between currency rates and commodity costs going forward.","So, to summarize, we have had a strong first half of the year. We are reconfirming our full-year top and bottom line growth objectives. While the environment has become more volatile recently, we remain optimistic about our prospects to drive profitable growth and to deliver strong returns to shareholders.","So that wraps up our prepared remarks and now we will begin to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, the floor is now open for your questions. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Ali Dibadj with Sanford Bernstein.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford Bernstein","A couple of questions. One is around KCI. So it clearly looks like it has accelerated sequentially, but still kind of lower than historical levels. I wanted to get a sense from you guys whether that\u2019s served by macro or an anomalous high growth rate before the distribution gains you had or competition. What is driving that slow down? Then, as part of that, can you give us a sense of consumer tissue clearly being driver recently of KCI growth, is that over a little bit in personal care, is that intentional or is that (inaudible), what are the implications there around capacity and margin, the way you run your business et cetera, so all of that K-C.","Mark Buthman","Yes. Good question, Ali. A couple of quick headlines and I would say overall, we entered some of the key growth markets. We talked about how things are going in China, which continues to go very well and is not really slowing down. Strong growth in Brazil despite some of the economic challenges in Brazil, our team there is executing very well and we are seeing good growth there, a lot of innovation coming in the back half on the Personal Care. Some of that launched in the second quarter in places Russia. You started to see that pickup.","I'd say where we are seeing a little bit of maybe slowdown in the quarter was probably the more developed end of the developing markets. So, places like Australia and Korea were a little slower in the quarter. Those were also big businesses for us. They have a disproportionate impact.","If you look at the segment split, I mean you still saw a strong Personal Care growth, but one of the swings in the quarter maybe wasn't as obvious, was that Venezuela did very well on Tissue and slowed down on Personal Care. It was really more of a question on what kinds of things did the Venezuelan government want to support in terms of the providing foreign exchange, so they really wanted to emphasize brining bathroom tissue and improving their in-stock position on that, so we had a very strong bath tissue quarter in Venezuela and not as much on the diaper front. Just to put that in perspective just that Venezuela swing was about a third of the volume growth in the KCI tissue number in the quarter.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford Bernstein","Okay. So, Venezuela really being the driving factor of that [CK] versus PC.","Mark Buthman","That's margin. I'd say that was the biggest swing factor that had. There wasn't really a fundamental shift in strategy.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford Bernstein","Okay. And then another a question which would touch on KCI little bit, but really around the price mix which always for us is a little bit less than we had hoped broadly. And, a couple of things we noticed, one about KCI pricing or price mix wasn't great. I want to get a sense of where you are versus inflation on that and kind of either competitive atmosphere. That's not allowing you to take prices as much as you'd like to.","Then secondly, the North America mix number was negative in both segments, so give us a sense of why that is. And, I guess, the overarching piece of this is, (Inaudible) aren't going up. Do you guys have pricing power that really is always tied to commodity prices?","Mark Buthman","Yes. I would say broadly we will try to get more pricing benefit is through mix coupled with innovation. I mean, I would say most of our businesses around the world are not assuming that you are going to get routine list price increases. You'll get it when it's driven by commodities and that's probably you didn't see as much in KCI in the quarter. I mean, KCI had, if you look at price and promotion together, we had two points of improvement in Q2 versus three points in Q1, and so it wasn't remarkably different than what we were expecting going in.","We are probably more focused on using our trade funds more effectively in KCI. Now it will be a place that we will count that as some price improvement as we roll forward. Beyond that, we'll get some [price] big currency swings in KCI and we saw some of that in Brazil the first half and in that will play out. If you see big currency swings, eventually you will see some price that moves there as well. On the North American front, we typically have some negative mix built in as more of the categories moved to the larger format tax, but beyond that there wasn't anything else that was going on there that was a big driver.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford Bernstein","Okay. So, no extra competition really got any of this from a pricing mix perspective?","Mark Buthman","No. I wouldn't say so.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford Bernstein","Okay. Thanks very much, guys.","Mark Buthman","Thanks, Ali.","Operator","Our next question comes from Gail Glazerman with UBS.","Gail Glazerman - UBS","Just a personal account on the volumes? Can you talk a little bit about what's going on in fem care and is that a trend that you would expect to continue?","Mark Buthman","No. The fem care volume in the U.S. was tougher comp. Last year we had double-digit growth, we had some pipeline filled with some new innovation that was launched and so that was more the comparison. Our shares were pretty stable, sequentially, so we didn't see much change and so we are still seeing good growth on U by Kotex and a little bit of weakness on our traditional Kotex, but we've got some good innovation coming across both of those platforms in the coming quarter, so we do feel good about our fem care plan overall.","Gail Glazerman - UBS","Okay and in terms of Europe, can you just remind me, there was reference to solid performance and contributions from non branded business. Is that something that rolls off as we enter the second half or at what point would you expect to see that business go away, if at all?","Mark Buthman","We picked up some private label contracts a year ago and so we are still seeing a favorable comp of those and those will roll off in the second half of the year. We will keep some of it in Italy, but probably we will shed some of that business as we have exited facilities.","Gail Glazerman - UBS","Okay, and in terms of North America, would the pricing benefit you saw in that this year in the quarter, how much of that would have benefitted the quarter versus what you had expected to see in the second half?","Mark Buthman","Well, we took some desheeting in the quarter that will roll into the second half and what you will see is probably more positive price in the second half in tissue in North America and less volume because we count volume in thousands of sheets. So you will see a volume drag and a positive price which net net, for us, works out to be a positive.","Gail Glazerman - UBS","Okay, and just one last question. Speaking on North American tissue. Last quarter you talked about seeing some benefit as a competitor was struggling to put stock on the shelves. Has that started to reverse yet? Or is that something that you are able to maintain?","Mark Buthman","I think we have heard and again, this is more anecdotal that they have returned to normal service and promotional levels by the end of the second quarter. Albeit, they are at a lower market share than earlier. So we are pleased that we picked up share in this environment, private label did as well and we will be watching the competitive environment in the second half. In the mean time, we have got some great innovation coming with some improved Cottonelle there. So we have got a big launch of our Cottonelle Moist. Some improvements on Kleenex. So actually a lot of news in the tissue category coming in the second half that we feel pretty good about.","Gail Glazerman - UBS","Okay, and just one last question on inflation. You mentioned oil. I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about Pulp. It seems like they are starting to be mounting pressure. Is that something that you would expect in your second half or not?","Mark Buthman","Well, our northern softwood guidance for the year really didn\u2019t change in the quarter. We still call it $8.90 to $9.10 on average for the year ago. It will be above that in the third quarter but we buy a lot more Eucalyptus than northern softwood and we are actually seeing Eucalyptus trend down just a bit sequentially. So we do think that with the weaker Brazilian currency given that all the Eucalyptus producers sell in dollars, there is less need for them to get the price increase in this kind of environment. I think the other offsetting factor that we don\u2019t talk as much about is recycled fiber. We by about 1.2 million tons of recycled fiber a year and that\u2019s actually been softer market. So overall fibers is tracking pretty close to our expectations.","Operator","Our next question comes from Connie Maneaty with BMO Capital.","Connie Maneaty - BMO Capital","Good morning. Could you talk a little bit about the organic sales growth pickup you expect in the second half? Given that KCI sales growth has trended about 9% for the last six quarters, this really suggests the pickup in developed markets. So where is it coming from? What are the new products you are especially focused on? And I hate to ask, but what is Cottonelle Moist?","Mark Buthman","Well, if you look at the Cottonelle, we have got a new talk about design that would be a moist bathroom tissue product. It\u2019s a great product, great category, growing rapidly. We will have to get you some, Connie, to try it but that\u2019s probably one are that we think would be a good growth opportunity. We have got our new Sung and Dry diaper in market. We are going to put even more muscle to be competitive behind that in the second half and we would expect to see a better baby and child care result overall in the second half than we had certainly in the second quarter. We have got some new Poise light bladder leakage products out as well.","We have got a new Depend campaign that we are launching, that for those of you that are watching the British Open this weekend, have got to watch Tony Siragusa pitching for protect your manhood with some new Depend Guards. So we will have those products that are going to start going.","So shifting to some of the B2B businesses. We also would expect to see an uptick in KCP in the second half. We really weren\u2019t satisfied with our growth in North America in KCP in the second quarter. Some of that categories was with manufacturing being a little weak and some of the laboratory services there that even make business a little weak, but we still expect to see a better performance there in during the second half.","Connie Maneaty - BMO Capital","Okay. And, also could you comment on the uptick in forth saving, whether the projects that are kicking in to contribute $50 million extra. Then also just very generally, how do you manage to take out hundreds of millions of dollars of cost every year without hitting some sort of institutional to peak?","Mark Buthman","Well, I mean, really, Connie, our teams are energized about the cost savings initiatives and each of our teams around the world is looking at that as a way to fund our future growth, so by identifying and delivering cost savings in areas that are our consumers and customers don't care about, we're able to invest more in R&D, investment in strategic brand building and help grow our business overall, so we really view that as part of the healthy growth model for our business going forward. And, so the big areas that we continue to work on, we started up a global procurement organization several years ago.","We are continuing to build capability in that function around the world and sharing information better, doing more cost structure modeling of our suppliers to understand where we are adding cost and if we change our specification, we can deliver a better value overall, so that's a big bucket for us. We are doing a lot on productivity and best practice sharing, so we measure productivity in the same way around the world and are sharing best practices.","The great news is that are our best performing facilities are getting even better, so we still see a healthy gap for us to attack between our best performing facilities and our worse performing facilities. Then the third area is product specification changes looking at the design of our products, how do we designed for value where we are taking things out that the consumer isn't concerned about, so all three of those areas contributed again in the second quarter and we've got a pretty robust pipeline of ideas for the future that we are going to go chase that give us confidence in our ability to deliver at that level.","Connie Maneaty - BMO Capital","Great. Thanks so much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.","Lauren Lieberman - Barclays","Thanks. Good morning. I had a question about the strategic spending. So, first off, down $20 million in the quarter that was kind of how you had planned things out and if you are expecting that to ramp up in the second half as the innovation activity picks up.","Mark Buthman","Yes. Absolutely. We were a little heavy last June. The second quarter was the fem wellness in the U.S. and then obviously exiting some categories in markets. We didn't spend as much in Europe as we would have last year, so those are the two big drivers of the change in the quarter, but we've also had quite a bit of innovation coming in the second half and I would expect us to spend more on strategic A&P, sequentially than we did in the first half. We will get a little bit of a currency benefit in some markets. If you look at it from our standpoint, but we still think for the full year, we'll spend at least as much as a percent of sales and maybe even a bit higher on strategic A&P this year.","Lauren Lieberman - Barclays","Okay. Great. The Poise wellness launch and it's now been a year, so where does that stand in terms of distribution? What Try On repeat has been like and so on? Because you guys have certainly have a track record of trying to cover new ground in some of your categories since it takes a bit longer to take hold.","Mark Buthman","Yes. I think, we've seen all over the world kind of mixed results. In some markets it's going great and in some markets it's one of the leading [skews] in category. In North America, it's a little slower than we would have expected and so we are regrouping and trying to make sure we know what the next steps are us there, but we do think there is a big insight here and a great consumer need and we will keep working at it. In the meantime, we've got some great growth stories around the world to continue to drive.","Lauren Lieberman - Barclays","Okay. Great. And my final thing was just Viva and shelf space, I think last quarter you guys had said you were just about back up to historic levels. Is that still true or was there more to go?","Mark Buthman","Well, I think Viva is about on track with our expectations so far this year in the U.S. And, again, we would continue to see that opportunity there for innovation and growth going forward, but right now we are managing that at about the level that we can support.","Lauren Lieberman - Barclays","Okay. Great. Thanks so much.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Faucher with JPMorgan.","John Faucher - JPMorgan","Hi. Good morning. You guys talked about the adult market in the U.S. growing sort of currently high-single digits there. I guess, as we look out over the next couple of years, what do you think is a more sustainable growth rate for that? Can you talk about category penetration versus the overall size of the category and how you are really thinking about that longer term from a growth standpoint? Thanks.","Mark Buthman","This is a great question. Even today, that\u2019s a relatively underpenetrated category in the U.S. So we think relative to the possible needs stay we may be something line 40% penetrated in the U.S. Now they may be using other products for institutional format but there is other ways that we really think we can drive growth in this category. Then broadly, as you look outside the U.S., the birth rate in many parts of the world is even lower than is in the U.S. and the populations are aging and people are living longer. So that\u2019s why we are so excited about the global growth prospects for our Depend business and our Poise business. So we think there is a lots and lots of growth ahead for those brands as we move forward.","Operator","The next question comes from Caroline Levy with CLSA.","Caroline Levy - CLSA","I wondered if you could whether your China plant opened?","Mark Buthman","Yes. I was there and cut the ribbon. I think it was in April. So China plant in Nanjing is doing well. It had a great start up with a lot of support from our Korean team. It was over to help with training and start up support. It had one of the best start ups in the history of Kimberly-Clark. So they are off to up and running and they have built a great capability and it is going to support the growth in China. They kept reminding we are need even more capacity at the rate our business is growing. So I think that will be a trip we will be making pretty regularly here in the future.","Caroline Levy - CLSA","That\u2019s great. I am trying to understand whether this is transformationals for margins and growth opportunity? Or whether this is just a step in the right direction?","Mark Buthman","Well, I think getting to local manufacturing will certainly help the margin picture in China. On the other hand, when you are growing at 45%, there is still going to be importing some product to keep up with that growth rate. So it\u2019s a balance but China is hitting its expectations for our plan this year where we are 85 cities now with Huggies versus 80 last quarter and still expect to get to 90 by the end of the year. The team over there is executing at a very high level.","Caroline Levy - CLSA","I know that you have gone to a more mainstream product from super premium but I am just trying to understand if the opening of local production offsets any potential any margin hit from selling more mainstream just as premium? Also, if you are taking a lot of market share, just given your growth rates, it was really high.","Mark Buthman","Yes, I think we picked up a couple of share points in China over the last year. It\u2019s a big market and so we are coming off a smaller base. So as we are moving in to participate in a broader segment of the category that\u2019s part of it. I will also tell you, we are launching a super, super premium product to come at the very top end of the market. So we will actually be creating a new tier for those consumers that want the very best for their babies. So we have got a lot of action in China and are really trying to make sure we are available in all the formats that a mom might want.","Caroline Levy - CLSA","That's very helpful, thank you. Just on Brazil, there were some categories in consumer but more beverage related that seemed to have taken a big hit. Did you have any reaction from consumers that you had noticed in Brazil? So aside from currency issues, were there any delivery problems? Was there any change in the takeaway trends in your business?","Mark Buthman","None. Really nothing to speak of. We are still expanding and growing in Brazil as well. So actually our board was in Brazil for a week in June. We cut the ribbon on a new plant in the North Eastern part of Brazil. So we are expanding our capability in that market as well and seeing the growth results from that.","Caroline Levy - CLSA","And able to take some price to offset currency then?","Tom Falk","Yes. We took some price in the first quarter, really following some of the currency change that ran up in 2012. We are able put that into the market. The encouraging thing was, you saw the double-digit volume growth in diapers even with the double-digit price increase. So it was a good result, good execution by the team there.","Caroline Levy - CLSA","Last one. Thank you so much and this is North America. It looks like you did loose some share and you may tucked on this in diapers to Proctor. Is there enough innovation coming in the back half, you think that could shift? Do you see any hope for the market as soft to be a little better in the back half?","Tom Falk","In diapers and our share calculation, we were flat sequentially and down about a half a point year-over-year and Lowe's was a big share gainer. Actually Lowe's took share from Pampers and from Huggies in the quarter. There was some hot promotional price points in certain channels that drove that and so we are going to make sure we are competitive and responsive to what's happening in the marketplace and we have got some terrific innovation that's launching that we are going to make more noise about in the back half so we would hope to recover some of those share impacts in the back half of the year.","Caroline Levy - CLSA","Thanks so much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Olivia Tong with Merrill Lynch.","Olivia Tong - Merrill Lynch","Thanks. Just wanted to touch a bit little more on organic sales growth, so you are at 3 to 5 to our target, what gets you to the 5 end of the range as opposed to the 3 end of a range?","Tom Falk","Well, I think this year quite frankly it'll be a bit of a challenge given that half of the year is already in the books at the three end of the range. But you if looked at it broadly and said, our categories are growing 3% to 4%, so to get to five you've got to take some share, you got to have some innovation beyond your core category growth. So, we think that's doable, but we also would say 3 to 5 is probably the range to plan for and we want to deliver that consistently over a long period of time.","Olivia Tong - Merrill Lynch","Got it. Thanks. Then you typically run through how many categories where you gain shares flat versus down. Can you run through that quickly?","Mark Buthman","Yes. Maybe I will turn that over to Paul, but in the U.S. I think we were flat for up year-over-year and 5 off 8 or something like that. Paul, is that about right?","Paul Alexander","Yes. That's right and we were down in three categories in those three where diapers as Tom has mentioned down about half a point, also down about half a point in facial tissue and about a point in child care.","Mark Buthman","Very high share base we've gotten nearly mid-60s kind of share there.","Olivia Tong - Merrill Lynch","Got it. Then just following up on child care, what drove the volume decline? Is that related to weather since you called out the Little Swimmers or is it something more systemic there?","Mark Buthman","I really hate blaming anything on the weather, because it sounds kind of lame but we did have a cooler weather spring this year and we had a hotter drier spring last year. I think that's part of it, so Little Swimmers was the little softer this period of time. We don't think we are still digging into that to understand what's going on there and will we see that business come back over the summer month, so that's part of it.","I think the diaper category overall, the birth rate was lower than we expected or longer than we expected. That's kind of piling up a little in the child care category, so that's a little weaker. So, those were some of the factors that drove that and so that's one that we are kind of big into a little bit in the second half as well.","Operator","Our next question comes from Alice Longley with Buckingham Research.","Alice Longley - Buckingham Research","Hi. Good morning. Did I catch you saying earlier in the call that your categories in North America were sluggish in the second quarter? Did you mean they were slower than in the first quarter? And, if so, why would that be?","Mark Buthman","Yes. I think in K-C Professional in particular you see things manufacturing both particularly seeing a little bit slower. We have a small scientific business that sells a lot into laboratories to do research and that one segment seems to have been a little bit more affected by the sequester, where any government funded research is more discretionary has been closed down, so that was a little weaker. Things are related to welding in general, where we sell a fair amount of supplies into that space were a bit slower.","Other segments like lodging, we are okay. So, you saw that was pretty stable. Health Care, which affects both, our Health Care business and our KCP business, was less negative in the second quarter but was still negative in terms of overall surgeries. I think, year-to-date, the best data we have seen that surgeries are down about 3% is more like more of that in the first quarter than in the second, but still a drag year-on-year.","Alice Longley - Buckingham Research","Okay, so there wasn't any particular weakening in the categories for tissue or personal care?","Mark Buthman","I think tissue and personal care or probably the child care segment was weaker than we had expected and it's a bit of a seasonal business because of the impact of Little Swimmers. So it's not always fair to compare that sequentially because, you will probably see, we sold more Little Swimmers in the second quarter than the first quarter but that's not necessarily a value comparison.","Alice Longley - Buckingham Research","So that would probably be weather, so that wouldn\u2019t persist into the second half?","Mark Buthman","Yes.","Operator","The next question comes from Javier Escalante with Consumer Edge Research.","Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research","I have a question with regards to tissue margins. The negative leverage that you have in the quarter, considering that you have better savings, you have the volume benefits from Georgia Pacific, you have positive pricing and the commodity impact seems to be coming on the lower end of your forecast. So why is it that margins fade in the last quarter and we have this margin contraction in this quarter?","Mark Buthman","Yes, a good question, Javier. Two key drivers of that. One is, facial issue is our weakest in the second quarter and that's a higher margin item than the overall basket in consumer tissues. So obviously we do pretty well in the fourth quarter and first quarter with cold and flu. Second quarter, you have got spring allergy but it's an easy or light facial tissue quarter. So that affects your margin mix in that segment. The second driver was, in Europe, we had quite a bit of startup activity around some new Andrex product improvements that we are preparing. That was a drag on margin in the second quarter versus the first. That asset went down in the second quarter. I was in Europe in late June and went to the plant to see the new process and we are excited about the new product we are going to be making in the balance of the year but it did cost us some margin in the second quarter.","Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research","Thank you, and changing businesses, on healthcare, it has been negative for the past four quarters. Would you explain us what part of the business, I know that it's kind of like a conglomerate of different businesses, but what is happening there? Why we have four quarters in a row of negative sales growth? Thank you.","Tom Falk","Yes. A couple of things. The underlying category trends we have talked a little about that the number of surgeries has been less than we have thought. I think everybody in the healthcare space is trying to figure that out. I think the best guess we have heard is that it's more and more consumers are in high deductible, consumer directed healthcare plans and that that's part of it. I think the other part is that you are seeing more of a push to alternate therapies before surgery. So rather than getting your knee sculped, go do PT for a couple of months and see how that goes before he puts in the hospital and cuts your knee open.","So that's part of the of it. I think the other part that, as a synthetic nitro prices ran up last year, we were pretty aggressive on pricing on disposable exam gloves, and as a result, we have shut some volume in that process but it was lower margin volume and while it hurts your topline comparison, it's the right thing to do to get that business moving in the right direction.","Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research","Understood, and finally on China. If you can tell us what is the organic sales growth, not jus the volume just to understand what is the impact on price mix from the roll out of the mid-tier diaper, if you could please?","Tom Falk","Yes. I mean there is not much price mix in that number. It's a pretty clean number. I will ask Paul if he wants to give you a more precise estimate.","Paul Alexander","Yes, Javier, On a rounded basis the 45% volume growth for diapers would have been 40% plus on total organics. So, as Tom said, not much difference there.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jason English with Goldman Sachs.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs","Hey, good morning, folks. Thanks for the question. We closed on China. So I guess I will kind of pick that back up. You have been having a trend of success in the diaper market in China. We are hearing of new competitors or the existing competitors plan to get more aggressive, Kao, LG, Pigeon and even Biostime, who has had good success in formula trying to come out in diapers as well. Should we be concerned about this or is this just more in your ways in par for the course?","Mark Buthman","Everybody wants a piece of China, so when you go over there you will find every company you've ever heard of is trying to build the business there and so I think we are competing pretty well, but it's a big market and there is room for lots of competitors, but we also expect at some time it will rationalize. There's still hundreds of diaper brands that are local in the Chinese market. There's probably thousands of fem care brands as you add them up all across China.","In the mean time, we are aiming at mom. We are doing well in the digital space in China, which is increasingly important channel, so we actually have a higher share in e-com in China than we would in the measured outlets and so we really feel like we have got underpinnings with great products, great brands and the team is executing pretty well on the field right now.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs","Thanks. Back to U.S. real quick. Tissues, the facial tissue business, we saw the effect of (Inaudible) in the Nielsen data this past period. We also saw your market share take a pretty substantial step back. Is that just temporary on your transition here to the new [count] or is there the reason to be worried about price gaps going forward?","Mark Buthman","We usually see a dip in second quarter from first quarter, because there is a lot of promotion around cold and flu and we don't promote it heavily in the spring, because the consumer need isn't as great and so we typically see a dip in second quarter from first quarter, so little deeper than last year so you are down year-on-year, but we would expect that to come back from a dollar share standpoint in the back half","Jason English - Goldman Sachs","Great. Thanks a lot, guys. I will pass it on.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank.","Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank","Hey. Guys good morning. When we are assessing the margin benefits from the European divestitures because obviously you are exiting zero margin businesses. Then I just kind of look at the SG&A cost and yes they were down year-over-year in dollars. Is that a trend that might continue throughout the year as the European thing starts to get some more attraction?","Mark Buthman","Yes. You are starting to see some of the margin improvement year-on-year in personal care from the European exit, so that's part of the year-on-year increase from that standpoint. We are well through the overhead savings. We should see a bit more of that flow in, in the back half, but I don't know if it will be big enough that we will call out in the G&A numbers but we'll expect to see the overall margin improvement from Europe will be a part of the story this year for sure.","Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank","Okay. Great. Then maybe I'm looking at the wrong data, but even with this number that I have, so it's up quite a bit year-over-year. Am I just looking at the wrong stuff or you guys kind of looking at the forward curve?","Tom Falk","No. I mean I think the stuff we see, I don't Paul if you've got the specific data on year end? We're spending about $800 average for the year and I think the July price was [8.15] or something like that, so we are in the ballpark on that like that. It's up a bit. I think last year's average was 795?","Paul Alexander","Yes. That's about right. I think, Bill, in the first half of the years it is up year-over-year and Tom's comments earlier were referring that from here forward we are starting to see prices come back down in July and August.","Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank","Okay. Got you. Thanks so much guys. I appreciate it.","Operator","This time we have no other questioners in the queue.","Paul Alexander","All right. Thank you, David. We will wrap up with our comments from Tom.","Tom Falk","Very good. Well, once again we are pleased with the execution in the first half, not satisfied with the top line and expect us to see us continue to execute our global business plan and deliver value for shareholders. Thank you very much for your interest and support of Kimberly-Clark.","Paul Alexander","Thank you."],"12315":["Kimberly-Clark Corporation (NYSE:KMB) Q1 2014 Earnings Conference Call April 21, 2014 10:00 AM ET","Executives","Paul Alexander - Vice President, Investor Relations","Mark Buthman - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Tom Falk - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Analysts","Ali Dibadj - Sanford Bernstein","Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank","Gail Glazerman - UBS","Wendy Nicholson - Citigroup","Chris Ferrara - Wells Fargo","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Connie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets","Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research","Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your patience in holding. We now have your presenters in conference. Please be aware that each of your lines is in a listen-only mode. At the conclusion of today's presentation, we will open the floor for your questions. At that time, instructions will be given as to the procedure to follow if you'd like to ask a question.","It is now my pleasure to introduce today's first presenter, Mr. Paul Alexander.","Paul Alexander","Thank you and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Kimberly-Clark's first quarter earnings conference call. Here with me today are Tom Falk, Chairman and CEO; Mark Buthman, Senior VP and CFO; and Mike Azbell, VP and Controller.","Here is the agenda for our call this morning. Mark will begin with a review of our first quarter results and he'll also give an update on the health care spin-off. Tom will then provide his perspectives on our results and the full year outlook. We'll finish with Q&A. As usual, we have a presentation of today's materials in the Investors section of our website.","As a reminder, we will be making forward-looking statements today. Please see the Risk Factors section of our last Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of forward-looking statements. We will also be referring to adjusted results and outlook. Both excludes certain items described in this morning's news release. The release has further information on these adjustments and reconciliations to comparable GAAP financial measures.","And now, I'll turn it over to Mark.","Mark Buthman","Thanks, Paul, and good morning. Let's start with the headlines. First, we achieved organic sales growth of 4% and delivered $80 million of cost savings in the first quarter. Second, we continue to allocate capital in shareholder-friendly ways. We're on track with our capital spending plans to grow our business, and we returned three-quarters of $1 billion to shareholders in the first quarter through dividends and share repurchases. And third, we're making good progress with health care spin-off activities.","Now, let's go to the detail of our results. First quarter sales were $5.3 billion. That's down 1% versus last year. Underlying organic sales rose 4% led by strong growth in K-C International. Currency rates were a 3-point drag and restructuring activities reduced sales by a further 2%.","First quarter adjusted gross margin was 34.7%, up 10 basis points year-on-year. Adjusted operating profit was even with year ago with an operating margin of 16.2%, that\u2019s up 20 basis points compared to the prior year. Results benefited from organic sales growth, $70 million of FORCE cost savings, and $10 million of additional savings from pulp and tissue restructuring actions. In addition, total between-the-line spending was down 90 basis points as a percent of sales. That's mostly due to lower G&A spending including incentive compensation.","We absorbed $65 million of cost inflation and significant currency headwinds in the quarter. The total earnings drag from currency, including translation and transaction effects and losses in other income and expense, was approximately $0.15 per share. And while the adjusted effective tax rate was down slightly compared to last year, that was offset by lower equity income. Putting it all together, first quarter adjusted earnings per share were $1.48. That's even with our all-time record performance last year.","Now turning to cash flow, cash provided by operations in the first quarter was $437 million. That's down compared to $607 million last year, mostly due to higher pension contributions and working capital. Given our normal pace of cash generation and with most of our pension contributions for the year now behind us, going forward I expect cash provided by operations to pick up significantly from first quarter levels.","As I mentioned at the beginning of my remarks, first quarter dividend payments and share repurchases totaled $750 million. And as you know, on February, we announced our 42nd consecutive annual increase in the dividend. In terms of share repurchases, we bought back $465 million of KMB stock in the first quarter, and we continue to expect full year buybacks of $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion.","Now before we move into our segment results, let me give you a brief update on Venezuela. We measure our results in Venezuela at the rate at which we transact our business in the country. Since March of last year, that's been at the official exchange rate of VEF6.3 per US dollar. To date, we've not had access to US dollars through either the complementary currency exchange system known as SICAD or the recently announced SICAD II auction process. At this time, it's not clear if we'll be able to access either of those systems going forward or what amount of currency exchange will transact through those mechanisms in the market as a whole. So as a result, we continue to measure our operations in Venezuela at a 6.3 rate.","Now in terms of bottomline earnings, although it wasn't the case in the first quarter, our full year plan continues to assume that we'll have some year-on-year earnings decline from results in Venezuela as a result of the ongoing uncertainty in that country. Like all multinationals that do business in Venezuela, we continue to closely monitor the currency market and the overall business environment there.","Now I'll highlight a few areas from our segment results for the quarter. In Personal Care, organic sales rose 7%. Performance was led by K-C International with organic sales up 13%. First quarter Personal Care operating margins were 19.2%, up 80 basis points year-on-year led by gains in K-C International and Europe.","Moving to Consumer Tissue; organic sales were up 3% driven by higher net selling prices and slightly favorable mix. Consumer Tissue operating margins of 15.2% were healthy, and were up 10 basis points year-on-year.","Turning to K-C Professional; organic sales increased 4% with volumes and net selling prices each up 2 points. Organic sales improved 16% in K-C International, but were off 2% in North America. KCP margins were solid at 17%, although down versus year ago, including the impacts from a slow start to the year on the topline in North America.","Lastly, Health Care organic sales rose 1%, driven by higher volumes in medical devices. Health Care operating margins of 18.1% were up significantly versus soft performance last year. Although I don't expect full year margins to be at the first quarter levels, I am really encouraged by the team's focus and execution, while we work on preparing for the spin-off.","Now, speaking of the health care spin-off, let me give you a little update on our progress. Detailed Separation planning and preparation to carve-out financial statements are well underway and broadly on track. We'll be seeking Board approval to file the spin Form 10 registration statement with the SEC in early May. Robert Abernathy who will lead the new company has assembled his senior leadership team, including naming a Chief Operating Officer and his Chief Financial Officer. We're continue to assess the impact of the spin-off on the remainder of Kimberly-Clark's operations, and as you'd expect, that includes analyzing potential actions to streamline our work and mitigate stranded costs.","While this work continues to be in progress, we expect to incur some restructuring charges in order to mitigate our stranded costs. We'll provide more specifics in connection with our second quarter earnings communication in July. And finally, we expect the spin-off to be completed at the end of the third quarter or potentially in the fourth quarter of 2014.","So that wraps up my comments. To recap, we achieved solid organic sales growth and cost savings. Our capital allocations plans are on track, and we're making good progress toward the spin-off of our health care business. Now, I'll turn it over to Tom.","Tom Falk","Thanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. I'll show my perspectives on our first quarter results, and then I'll address our full year outlook. So starting with Q1, overall we had a solid quarter, solid start to the year, particularly given the headwinds we faced and the difficult earnings comparison with Q1 last year being our strongest quarter. Organic sales growth in the quarter was 4%, that\u2019s right in line with our 3% to 5% full year target. At our targeted growth initiatives, K-C International had another strong quarter with 12% organic sales growth.","In diapers, our organic sales increased about 30% in China, 25% in Russia, and 15% in Brazil in the first quarter. So our Huggies business has good momentum in these three markets and broadly throughout Kimberly-Clark International, and we've got more innovation coming yet this year to help us drive additional growth. We're also doing well in our other Personal Care businesses in K-C International. That includes feminine care, which our organic sales there grew double-digits. Our adult care business was up high-single digits; and our baby wipes business, which was up mid-single digits. So, our focus on premium innovation and developing these categories continued to generate great results in these businesses and markets around the world.","Elsewhere in K-C International, our KCP organic sales were up in the mid-teens rate, with strong growth in Latin America and solid progress in KCP in Asia. So on an annual basis now, the K-C Professional portion of our K-C International business is $1 billion for us and with attractive margins. So we're continuing to push hard to take advantage of opportunities where industrialization and economic development are occurring. So overall, we're executing well on K-C International, and we're very optimistic about our top and bottomline growth prospects in that part of the business.","In terms of topline growth in other parts of our business, we're broadly on track except for K-C Professional in North America. There we're off to a slow start in the year. There were some impacts from the severe weather that we had in the US in January and February and conditions in that business have improved more recently and we're expecting better performance as we roll forward into the year.","On the innovation front, we're off to a good start for the year. In K-C International, we continue to launch innovations across our product lineup. We got a heavy focus on Huggies diapers and diaper-pants, premium feminine care products and adult care offerings coming to market this year.","In North America, we've launched innovations on Huggies diapers, Depend briefs and Viva towels. We've got more near-term activity happening, including improvements to Huggies diapers and baby wipes, new Poise microliners and upgrades to our U by Kotex product lineup. Our brand positions in North America remain solid overall. Our first quarter market shares are up even with year-ago levels in six of the eight US consumer categories that we track.","In terms of the bottomline, as Mark mentioned, we had headwinds from currency exchange rates and cost inflation. To offset these challenges, we raised selling prices where we can. We're driving our cost savings programs and we're controlling our overhead spending carefully.","And finally, as Mark already highlighted, we continue to allocate capital in shareholder-friendly ways, and that's a key part of our global business plan. So overall, we're executing well in a challenging environment.","So now as we move to the outlook for 2014, we continue to be optimistic about our prospects to drive profitable and healthy growth, and that means we're focused on delivering solid organic sales growth, increasing our advertising and research and development spending and generating healthy levels of cost savings and cash flow and then allocating that capital that we generate in the business in shareholder-friendly ways.","In terms of our financial objectives, we're confirming our previous outlook for 2014 top and bottomline growth. On the topline, our organic sales growth target remains 3% to 5%. We got solid topline momentum right now and that's driven by our targeted growth initiatives and our innovation and we expect that to continue going forward. On the bottomline, we continue to expect full year adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $6 to $6.20.","We're closely monitoring the external environment, including currency markets, commodity costs and the overall competitive and economic environment. As I'm sure most of you know, currency markets in particular have been more volatile since the beginning of the year, most notably in Latin America, Eastern Europe and the Middle East. So going forward, we're planning for currency raise to be broadly similar to spot rates that we've seen in the marketplace recently.","And in terms of input cost inflation, at this point in time, it's more likely that our full year input cost would be in the upper half of our previously estimated range of $150 million to $250 million. And that's mostly due to additional inflation in some international markets, particularly in Latin America. So regardless of the environment, we're staying focused on our strategies and our plans to improve our business. We're convinced that successful execution of our global business plan will continue to result in strong returns for our shareholders.","So that wraps up our prepared remarks. And now we'll be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Ali Dibadj with Sanford Bernstein.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford Bernstein","Hey, just a few questions, some short term, some longer term. More on kind of short and medium term, it looks like your net price of only 1% is lower than currency. Obviously it's lower than what we'd expect inflation to be globally, and we've seen this for a lot of HPC categories. Can you give us a sense of whether that's just a timing issue or do you believe some of your categories are kind of secularly deflationary here? And I guess is your pricing any different than your competition, so are you closing or expanding price gaps? And then just that gap in terms of net price versus currency and what do you expect for inflation seems to be pretty big and not closing recently?","Tom Falk","Yeah, I guess I\u2019d say Ali, if you look across our segments, I mean the only one that had negative price in the quarter was Health Care, and that's probably one that is a carryover of adjusting some of the exam glove prices related to the fall-off of synthetic nitrile. So as the commodity cost in that particular area has dropped, we've seen more price drop there. Across the balance, I would say we've done a pretty good job in K-C International of getting price to wherever there's been major currency weakness, particularly in Latin America. In North America, broadly there has been relatively little price. We've gotten a little bit in tissue through some de-sheeting and you saw that in the quarter. We've got a little bit in diapers. Again, there we got some of the count reduction. It's just starting to go into effect. We didn't get much of that in the first quarter, so you'll get a little bit more in the second quarter.","And I think broadly, our strategy is to try to line up where we can and be competitive in the marketplace and then win on innovation, and that's a strategy that's worked pretty well for us over the long term.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford Bernstein","But it doesn't sound like you see the gap between even just currencies in your overall net price closing any time soon.","Tom Falk","Well, if you look at the amount of price that we got, it was roughly equal to the amount of cost inflation that we had in the quarter. I think it was what Paul, $60 million-ish of price and about $65 million of cost inflation. So if you just looked at those two numbers, obviously currency was a factor as well, and there was a lot of other moving parts, but those two more or less lined up.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford Bernstein","So two other kind of broader questions. One is if you just look at your representation online versus offline in both diapers and Consumer Tissue, in North America at least it looks not to be the same between online and offline representation for you guys, and I was just trying to get a sense of how you guys think of that channel, whether you plan to close that gap and what it's going to take to do so, so one is an online question.","And then the other one, I might as well throw it in here is just over the years and decades really, you guys have as a company focused more and more on pruning some pieces of the business, Heath Care most recently, but Western Europe before that, go back to Neenah as far back as you want, I mean just along the timeframe that's been happening, do you see ever a time where you were a separate Personal Care and Consumer Tissue business just given the different trajectory those two businesses are on?","Tom Falk","I guess on the first question on the online versus offline in diapers versus tissue, I'd say the Personal Care stuff is probably a little bit more efficient to ship on an online environment. It's not to say that you won't see it in the offline or having tissue move into online as well, but I do think Personal Care, diapers in particular is a bigger item. And I think many of the online retailers want diapers for a lot of the same reasons that other retailers are focused on that category, because they want to get the young family as a regular customer. So, I remember not that many years ago when Toys\"R\"Us was our largest diaper customer, because they were trying to capture the young family at that point. So I guess I would say I don't expect that gap to close. I would expect diapers and Personal Care will probably be bigger online, but we'll see if we're out by everything online, then maybe that gap will eventually close.","On the portfolio shaping question, we've been around for 140 years and our first product was newsprint. And so thankfully, it's people who have been shaping our portfolio for a long, long time. So at this point, I don't see a path to what you described that you break them apart. There's a lot of efficiency in going to market together. Tissue is a strong cash generator, but there are some markets in the world where we don't have a big tissue presence. Today, our business in China is predominantly Personal Care, although we've got a rapidly growing KCP business in China, which is again tissue related in many areas.","So again, we think we're doing all the right things to shape the portfolio. We'll continue to challenge and test that, and we're not afraid to make calls that we think are shareholder-friendly over the long term.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank.","Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank","Could you just talk about some of the SG&A leverage, kind of why maybe some of the incentive compensation, I don't know if it got reversed or was always based on plan and then what the advertising spending did in the quarter and if the outlook for the year is still to grow it faster than the sales?","Tom Falk","Yeah, I think on the incentive comp, last year's first quarter was a little high. And so, it's partly removing the accruals around for the three-year restricted shares, and as you start to have your performance level and plans tick up, so we topped it up a bit last year in the first quarter. This year, with some of the weakness in currency, it got reduced a little bit. So the net swing was probably a good chunk of the swing on the G&A front, but nothing fundamentally changing on the plans beyond that.","And then on the advertising, we're basically down 10 basis points from last year, but up nicely sequentially. And so, we'd say last year's first quarter was the highest quarter of the year, and so we were well above the other three quarters in the first quarter. We've also got a little bit more back-end loaded innovation. So we feel pretty good about the level of spend in advertising. I think research spending was up 10 basis points in the quarter, so we continue to invest in R&D and product development.","Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank","So the same, the guidance still prevails for advertising spending and growing faster than sales for the year?","Tom Falk","Yeah.","Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank","Is it too earlier to ask you questions about the structure of the health care spend? I mean when will we get sort of the sense for how it's going to impact earnings, what kind of leverage are you going to put on the spend, dividend back to you guys to buy back stock? Is that still premature? Can you guys give us a little bit of a hint?","Tom Falk","Yeah, I think it's probably a little early. We'll give you more color on the second quarter. The Form 10 comes out, you get a good look at the historical financials of the thing. And so you'll have a chance to do that. And we'll have more detail on what the impact is going to be. Mark mentioned some restructuring activity, what stranded cost that we have that we're going to get rid of. So we're actively working on all that stuff and we'll have more to talk about that in the second quarter call.","Operator","Our next question comes from Gail Glazerman with UBS.","Gail Glazerman - UBS","Can you talk a little bit in detail what you're seeing in terms of the dynamics in the tissue market? I guess last quarter, you talked about the GT kind of regaining their strides. There's maybe a little bit of messiness to some of the private label. So you're any more or less concerned with the capacity that's come on over the last year? And then looking forward, we've had a couple of announcements of new supply coming on over the next couple of years. Do you think the market will be able to support that?","Tom Falk","Yeah, I would say I feel pretty good about the capacity balance in North American tissue. At this point, if I look at the volume weakness that we had in North America in the first quarter, it was more to do with weak cold and flu season and some shortfall in facial tissue. Our continental business has done a little bit, but we had a very strong first quarter last year because of some of the challenges that GP had had. And so at this point, we feel pretty good about our innovation strategy. We launched Viva Vantage, which is a new paper towel, and that's off to a good start in the quarter. And so I think we've got a pretty big innovation portfolio. We're working across all those brands. And I'd expect to continue to drive those businesses. Growth rates, they're not going to be as high as the adult care business in North America, but we still think there is opportunity for innovation and mix accretion there.","Gail Glazerman - UBS","And just kind of taking maybe a bigger macro view, you mentioned some of the weather weakness in K-C Professional, looking through that, how confident are you on the underlying, I guess, in North America and the underlying macro environment and demand environment?","Tom Falk","Gail, I hate blaming weather for anything, because you'd like to think that our products are more essential. So I was really picking on our K-C Professional team when they were trying to explain this to me with weather. People who have didn't come to work, didn't use hand towels. People are more able to get to the welding job site didn't use our safety products. And so we really lost hours of work in the first quarter. That was a significant hit. When you talk to our distributor customers, they would say they're seeing in their numbers in the first quarter and most of those guys are not public reporters. So you may be not as able to see it as easily. And they saw the March volumes picked up and they're feeling like back to more of the underlying rate of growth in the economy. So we'll see. But we've got a pretty aggressive plan baked in to try and get as much of that back in the last nine months as we can. But some of those hours lost due to weather aren't going to be recovered.","Gail Glazerman - UBS","And then just lastly on the European restructuring, when do we comp than most of the change and when would we start to see more of a steady state [ph] comp?","Tom Falk","Really I think April was about the end of the sales cut off when we exited most of the markets. So it should be pretty well flushing through the sales decline in the second quarter numbers. Paul, that makes sense?","Paul Alexander","Yeah, I think you should expect that the second quarter will look pretty similar to the first quarter. We had about 2 points of lower sales on restructuring activities. That's likely to be about right in the second quarter and then it should basically go away.","Operator","Our next question comes from Wendy Nicholson with Citigroup.","Wendy Nicholson - Citigroup","My question had to with the fem care business. The tampon market shares that we're seeing in North America look terrific, but the pad market shares are not as strong. And I'm just wondering what you think that is? Are you literally searching Kotex consumers from one product to the next, or is it something that you need more innovation or different pricing in the pad market, because shares have been down there fairly steadily for a while?","Tom Falk","Yeah, if you look at our fem care share, we have been launching a lot of innovation on tampons and have got some of really unique and terrific products that are out there and doing well in the marketplace. On the pad side, we've probably lost share on our Kotex Natural Balance and have not gained at all back on U by Kotex. And so we do have some innovation coming on the pad business. And the encourage thing is a lot of that innovation is already launching in other markets outside the US. And I mentioned in my remarks that we're actually seeing double-digit growth in fem care outside the US, which is well faster than the category growing in those markets. So we're encouraged and we expect to see some better trajectory in the US later this year.","Wendy Nicholson - Citigroup","And can you remind which is a stronger gross margin business just in the US specifically, tampons versus pads for you?","Tom Falk","Pads is historically a stronger gross margin business for us, but we're also doing some work on our cost structure to get our tampon business more efficient going forward. And so we're hoping to close some of that gap.","Wendy Nicholson - Citigroup","And then my second question is just on the international statistics that you give us, China, Russia and Brazil, the volume growth in diapers. They're just so volatile quarter-to-quarter and they're all strong and are all great and sometimes they accelerate and sometimes they decelerate. But they're just so lumpy. It's hard to tell, oh, gosh, Brazil was like it slowed sequentially a lot despite any easy comp. Can you explain why those numbers are so lumpy? Is it that your market share slumps around or is it just the supply chain issue, because just month-to-month or quarter-to-quarter, it seems really hard to predict?","Tom Falk","Yeah, I would say part of it has to do with cycle of innovation. So if you looked at China, we've been growing at 40 and now I think in the first quarter, we were at 30. We were at 70-ish cities and now we got 90 by the end of last year. We went from 90 to 95 in the first quarter. So the rate of new city expansion is probably slowing a little bit, which is why those numbers are coming down. In Russia, we launched a number of diaper pant codes last year in a boy\/girl format that's really taking off. And so that market ramped up from kind of high single-digits to mid-20s. And so that's probably the face of it there. In Brazil, we also have launched diaper pants and are expanding it into the Northeast part of the country. We've been represented there, but it's really we're putting more feet on the ground and more capability there. And so each market has got its own story as to what's going on. But mostly, it's broader distribution and timing of when innovation gets launched that can drive it from quarter-to-quarter.","Wendy Nicholson - Citigroup","But in each of those markets, you wouldn't say that either the pricing dynamic has changed? I mean we read a lot about lower price competition coming into China, but it seems like your volume growth is still strong in each of those markets broadly speaking.","Tom Falk","I mean there's a lot of competition everywhere. So in China in particular, Proctor, Unicharm, Kao are all over the mid and premium tiers. Hang On is all over the lower part of the marketplace. And so we feel like we have a winning product everyday to be able to compete and are really focused on that. Brazil, P&G is a big competitor in Brazil and Unicharm is just building a plant to launch there later this year. And so we're really trying to make sure we're driving as much innovation into the market and be prepared for that and have a very strong position in the marketplace before competition comes. In Russia, we've run into P&G as well as some other local competitors. So yeah, there is no shortage of people that want to launch everyday.","Operator","The next question comes from Chris Ferrara with Wells Fargo.","Chris Ferrara - Wells Fargo","So just back to pricing on FX, just curious do you expect there to be more FX related pricing or you're taking about as much as you're comfortable with give where the stock price are today?","Tom Falk","I think that at this point, we feel like we've done a pretty good job of getting price into the marketplace, but there's also been quite a bit of volatility. If FX markets continue to move in particular markets, we won't be shy about taking additional price. And again, some of it was taken during the quarter, so may not have been fully reflected in the quarter. So you could have some rollout effect later in the year. But broadly, we've been pretty aggressive about trying to take prices as these exchange markets have moved.","Chris Ferrara - Wells Fargo","So it sounds like based on, I guess, it seems very recently a little bit more of a recovery in currencies, you've priced all that you've done it based on the recent movement in price, maybe haven't sort of annualized all of that, not annualized, but you haven't seen a lot come through yet. So it's possible next quarter has a little bit better pricing line than this quarter. Is that basically right?","Tom Falk","Yeah, that's probably right.","Chris Ferrara - Wells Fargo","(inaudible) is calling like basically $80 and $90 per ton pulp decrease, sort of by the middle of '14. It seems like both on eucalyptus and BSK. Is that in your numbers, because that way you expect to happen as well as that part of your commodity guidance?","Tom Falk","So if you look at northern softwood, which we are calling our outlook as around $1,000 a ton give or take. The March price is $1,030. Eucalyptus, we're calling that for more $800 to $830 and the March price was $870. So on average for the year, we're probably not quite as aggressive. It depends on when you assume the (inaudible) thing happens. If you average that for the year, we're probably more in line.","Chris Ferrara - Wells Fargo","And then just one last one on Venezuela. I guess that you haven't had any transactions on SICAD or SICAD II. But I'm trying to understand the rationale for staying with the less conservative 6.3 rate. Do you guys think that on a sustainable basis, 6.3 is where you will transaction and get the proponents or the majority of whatever cash you are able to get out in the market? Or do you actually believe that you will at some point see the evaluation, you just don't know what are these yet, so you're not going to take it?","Tom Falk","I don't think I can remember in my entire career a situation like this in a significant currency market where you've got a range from 6 at the rate to if you look at SICAD II it's trading at 50. And so I do think that something is going to happen to close that gap at some point, because it's not sustainable to have that kind of a spread in a marketplace. And so I'm looking at this from two perspectives, what do we need to do operate in Venezuela, so how do we set pricing, how do we import product, how do we pay the bills and manage our exposure level. So that's one set of activities. Today, we're getting all the funds related to import at least in the first quarter at the (inaudible) rate. And we're not eligible, even applied for the SICAD I rates. And so as SICAD II just started to trade, very little funds have flowed through that and it's unclear whether anybody has gotten any money out of the country using that mechanism.","So we're going to continue to watch this. I would guess at some point, something is probably going to happen to narrow that gap. And in the meantime, we feel like we've given enough transparency. We'll also be filing our 10-Q today. It's the first time we filed the Q on the same day of the earnings call with a little bit more disclosure. So everyone will be able to see what our balance sheet exposure is. We've given enough information about how big it is in the income statements, about investors that want to apply different rate to those have got the ability to do that.","Chris Ferrara - Wells Fargo","And you're just following up to that? I mean it looks like Procter and Colgate basically generally it seems like for every 1 point of exposure on the topline, it's been like 1 point, bottomline ongoing exposure to the P&L. So you guys are about 2%. That would sort of make it look like an annualized 2% hit if you were at the 11.8 or whatever it is today. Does that make sense?","Tom Falk","It really depends on pricing. So I mean that's the other dimension here is that the price control of economy. And so you can make any exchange rate work if you get pricing really. And so it's a question of what way are you going to get funds and each of those individual exchange rates can you price for them in the business where there's enough margin to make sense to operate. So that's why you come back and say, if we're running all the different scenarios if we could only get money at this rate, what price level we have to achieve to have an operation that makes sense.","Operator","Our next question comes from Olivia Tong with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","First on SG&A, it sounded like in a response to a previous question that a lot of the decline year-over-year for this quarter has to do with timing of when incentive compensation hits the P&L. So first, is the big decline in SG&A margin this quarter just a matter of timing, because it seems like Health Care was clearly a major driver. It seems like margins for both Personal Care and Consumer Tissue were also up. So maybe you can give a little bit detail on what is sustainably lower in SG&A that's in the card for 2014?","Tom Falk","Yeah, it's probably more that last year's first quarter was a little high. If you're going to go look back, it was one kind of a high watermark, I think, in recent quarter as a percent of sales. And so this quarter is a little bit lower than average. And part of that was related to incentive comp was probably the biggest swing. And it was more about every quarter we're looking at our three-year forecast. We got the restricted shares that vest on three-year improvement in sales and ROIC and looking at what our plan looks like and making adjustments up or down. Last year's first quarter was a little higher. Increase in expense this year's first quarter was a small decrease in expense, and that swing drove a good share of the difference.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Do you expect for Q2 through Q4, the rest of the year, still expect SG&A to be down year-over-year?","Tom Falk","Yeah, we would say that this year should be flat to down slightly for SG&A is a good planning assumption.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And then on the topline, clearly 4%-plus organic is very solid, but you adjusted the midpoint on your range of 3% to 5% and the organic sales comps do get tougher as the year progresses. You mentioned some innovation. Can you talk about the cadence of innovation as the year progresses?","Tom Falk","Yeah, we've got a pretty full calendar around the world of diaper and fem care, adult incontinence improvements coming to market. So you'll hear more about things happening on that front. It's probably a little back-end loaded this year relative to maybe where it's been in the past, but still should see a solid progress on that front. And we feel we've got pretty good momentum happening in the business right now.","Operator","Our next question comes from Connie Maneaty with BMO Capital Markets.","Connie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets","I was wondering if you'd noticed any change in the rate of sales in Russia and Ukraine. It seems some companies report strong sales in January and February, but decline in March because of the unrest. So could you just give us some indication of the tempo of your business?","Tom Falk","We really didn't see a big impact on the business. Obviously, it's part of the world we're watching very closely and trying to make sure our people were safe and that our supply chains were secure. And we really didn't have any product supply problems. With some of the currency swing in Russia, we were able to get a little bit of price on Personal Care as it reflected some of the import portion of the materials. And I think Ukraine is a relatively small business for us, but didn't have any significant disruption there that was obvious in the numbers anyway. So no, it was a pretty solid quarter for that part of the world.","Connie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets","Okay. And that continues into April?","Tom Falk","No bad news so far, Connie, anyway.","Connie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets","And as the Q is coming out today, could you just tell us if you quantified the impact of a move to SICAD II and what that is?","Tom Falk","We just put the dollar exposure on the balance sheet in the Q and then you can apply whatever rate to it that you'd like.","Paul Alexander","As a reminder, in 2013, Venezuela was about 2% of our total consolidated sales and about 3% of adjusted operating profit.","Operator","Our next question comes from Javier Escalante with Consumer Edge Research.","Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research","I would like to come back to the competition pricing environment. In the US, track data shows share losses related to Procter. So what happened after you did the change in diaper count. If you were losing share when you had more diapers per pack, do you think that what would be the impact of effectively increasing prices in the US if you're losing share to Procter right now? And that would be question one.","And question two, you referred to Mexico last conference call and the income was down way beyond what the peso would suggest. So would assume the pricing environment in Mexico continues to be aggressive. So if you can give us an update on Mexico as well.","Tom Falk","On the diaper question, in the US, and so basically if you look year-on-year in the quarter, we're probably down a couple of share points on Huggies. Most of that is lost to Luvs. So Pampers has basically been about flat. And so sequentially our diaper shares are actually up just a tick, but relatively flat in this environment. And so as we look at the price change roll into the marketplace, we fully realize it on the super-premium part of the lineup that competes most with Pampers and we're only taking a part of the increase on the main line to try to narrow the gap with Luvs, because Luvs did fully participate in the price count change that went into effect in the fourth quarter. So we're hoping we can actually narrow the price gap a bit with Luvs on the main line business and line up on the premium business.","On the Mexico question, K-C Mexico is going to announce earnings later this week. And so I'll let them give you a little bit more color on their call. I guess I would say broadly economic conditions in Mexico continue to be challenging with less growth overall in the economy than forecasted. And they had a fairly challenging fourth quarter. And I'd say some of the same challenges that they had in the fourth quarter seem to continue into the first quarter. But the team down there is committed to continue to improve their business and they've got a solid track record and they'll deliver improved results in the back half for the year.","Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research","One more thing would be Venezuela situation. It seems like you flag it as a driver of topline growth this quarter. Could you tell us why was it up? It is like Wendy said it has to do with the volatility of the year ago, if you can tell us what was the organic volume growth or sales growth in Venezuela. I imagine that you don't have any pricing. And if it is significant, why was it up so much if you can explain that?","Tom Falk","It's pretty simple, Javier. If we get letters of credit to bring product and we bring it in and sell it in the marketplace. If we don't, we don't. And so in the fourth quarter, we got quite a few letters of credit. We brought the product in, in the first quarter and sold it through in the marketplace. And it was probably more heavily oriented to bath tissue. And so if you look at our international tissue growth in the Consumer Tissue category, it was probably more driven by Venezuela this quarter than it would have been in the past. If you look at the total K-C International topline, it was probably a couple of points of extra boost to the K-C International topline in the quarter, but that would be more the nature of it.","Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research","Would it be kind of a 30%, 40% growth in Venezuela?","Tom Falk","I don't have the numbers in front of me. We can give you more detail. But it's a couple of percent of our sales. And K-C International was 39% of our overall sales. So you can kind of figure out. You can get close enough to the math, I would guess.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chip Dillon with Vertical Research Partners.","Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners","First question is you did call out a pretty significantly sized, I guess, charge tied to Middle East regulation and maybe I missed it. But could you tell us what's going on there and is this truly one-time or is there something going on that could impact how we should look at the business there?","Tom Falk","Obviously it's one-time in the sense that we hope that doesn't happen again, but it's also one of the things you're planning around the world that the governments can adopt unusual tax positions that you didn't expect. And I'll have Mark give you a little bit more color. But essentially, we put capital into a market and the government decided to apply a value-added tax to that capital contribution. We obviously disagreed, but we lost the court case. So we booked a non-recurring charge.","Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners","I know this dances around quite a bit, but anything else you can tell us about the other income expense line. As I look at it sort of the recurring component of that, it was about $18 million. Was there anything that you would call out that would have explained that being so high this quarter?","Tom Falk","Yeah, it was all currency transactional losses and probably heavily oriented to the Ukraine and I think there was the other market, Argentina. So wherever you saw big currency ships and we had a dollar-based payable, you wind up taking a hit on the transactional currency line. You can't hedge some of these markets effectively. And so that flows through other income and expense.","Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners","I know we're going to get more data or detail on the Health Care and I know it was probably down a bit last year, but certainly was a great swing year-over-year. Do you think you'll see year-over-year profits go up every quarter this year? I know the third quarter is tougher comparison. And I'm not trying to pin you down, but sort of getting an idea of how sustainable this improvement is.","Tom Falk","Well, we're off to a good start, no question. They had some one-timers that went against them. Last year in the first quarter, they probably had a couple of things that broke their way this year's first quarter. So I wouldn't necessary apply this margin rate to the full year. They're probably a little ahead of expectation. So I think the good news is, is that while we're doing all this work to get ready for the spin, the business is continuing to operate and execute in a very effective level and they had a solid first quarter overall top and bottomline.","Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners","And then lastly, I know there is a corporate expense when you strip out the one-time items, was down quite a bit. And I was imagining maybe pension is helping you there. But should we see that continue to be down year-over-year throughout the year on that line?","Tom Falk","It's probably not so much pension helping us, Chip, as the other incentive comp that we talked about earlier that was in there last year and that was high last year and down this year.","Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners","And so how should we think about the rest of the year? I guess it's a function of the stock and earnings.","Tom Falk","I'd say broadly, it'd probably fall the similar G&A guidance, but it's flat to down slightly.","Operator","At this time, we have no other questioners in the queue.","Paul Alexander","All right. Thank you, David. We will wrap up with a comment from Tom.","Tom Falk","So once again, solid first quarter, lots of things going on in the business. And we appreciate your support of Kimberly-Clark. Thanks very much.","Paul Alexander","Thank you very much.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's presentation.

And at that time, instructions will be given as to the procedures to follow if you would like to ask a question.","It is now my pleasure to introduce today's first presenter, Mr. Paul Alexander.","Paul J. Alexander - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Kimberly-Clark's First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Here with us today are Tom Falk, Chairman and CEO; Mike Hsu, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Maria Henry, CFO. Here's the agenda for our call. Maria will begin with a review of first quarter results. Tom will then provide his perspectives on our results and the outlook for the full year. We'll finish, as usual, with Q&A.","We have a presentation of today's materials in the Investors section of our website. Now, as a reminder, we will be making forward-looking statements today. Please see the risk factors section of our latest Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information. Lastly, we'll be comparing 2017 results with 2016 adjusted results, which exclude certain items described in this morning's news release. The release has further information about these adjustments.","And now, I'll turn it over to Maria.","Maria G. Henry - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","Thanks, Paul. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining our call today. Let me start with the headlines for the quarter. Total sales were even year-on-year with organic sales down 1%. We achieved strong cost savings which helped us improve our margins and grow earnings per share. And we're on track with our overall capital plan.","Now let's take a look at the details starting with sales. Our first quarter net sales were $4.5 billion. That's even year-on-year, with a 1-point benefit from currency rates. Organic sales fell 1% in the quarter and Tom will provide more color on our top line results in just a few minutes.","On profitability, gross and operating margins were each up 30 basis points year-on-year. First quarter gross margin was 36.9% and operating margin was 18.6%. The margin improvements included good progress in developing and emerging markets. Our FORCE cost savings for the quarter were $110 million. So we're off to a good start relative to our full year savings target of at least $400 million. Commodities were a $35 million drag that was mostly offset by currency benefit.","On the bottom line, first quarter earnings per share were $1.57, up 3% year-on-year, while our equity income reduced earnings by $0.02 per share, offset by a lower effective tax rate.","Now let's take a look at cash flow. Cash provided by operations in the first quarter was $436 million and in line with our expectation. Cash flow was down compared to $553 million in the year-ago quarter, driven by higher tax payments this year.","On capital allocation, first quarter dividend payments and share repurchases totaled more than $600 million. That includes $300 million of share repurchases. We continue to expect that for the full year dividends and share repurchases will total between $2.2 billion and $2.4 billion.","Looking at the segments; in Personal Care, organic sales were even year-on-year. Organic sales increased 6% in developing and emerging markets, but were down elsewhere. Overall Personal Care operating margins were 21.4%, up 110 basis points. The improvement was driven by cost savings, higher volumes and favorable currencies.","In Consumer Tissue, organic sales were down 3% driven by North America. Consumer Tissue operating margins were strong at 18.9%, that's up 20 basis points. In K-C Professional, organic sales in the quarter were even with prior year. K-C Professional operating margins were 19%, down 70 basis points. The comparison was impacted by cost inflation and strong results last year.","So let me recap. We achieved significant cost savings and improved our margin. We delivered bottom line growth in a challenging environment. And we continue to allocate capital in shareholder friendly ways.","I'll now turn the call over to Tom.","Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","Thank you, Maria, and good morning, everyone. Since Maria covered the financial details for the quarter, I'll focus my comments on our organic sales in the quarter and then on our full year outlook.","As Maria just mentioned, our organic sales were down 1% in the quarter. So, in January, we said that growth would be higher in the second half of the year compared to the first half largely due to comparisons. That said our first quarter organic sales were somewhat below my expectations, most of that coming from North America.","In North America, our organic sales fell 3% in our consumer businesses, and that reflects the combination of category softness, greater competitive activity, and lower promotional shipments. Overall category growth across all channels, including e-commerce, was about 0.5% in the quarter, and that's about 1.5 points below what it was for the full year 2016.","In terms of our key businesses in North America, our Personal Care volumes were off by 1%. In infant and child care, our volumes overall were down low-single digits, which is probably in line with the mega category. Category consumption continues to shift out of diapers and into training pants, and volume growth in e-commerce is continuing to accelerate. Our market share overall was even year-on-year and up 1 point sequentially in infant and child care.","In Consumer Tissue, our volumes were down 7%, mostly in bathroom tissue. Results were impacted by competitive activity and lower promotional shipments than last year. We've got a stronger promotional calendar scheduled for the balance of the year.","We expect better performance going forward in North America particularly the back half of the year when our comparisons get a little easier. Our planned product innovations will also help drive our growth in the near term. That includes the introduction of U by Kotex Fitness in our feminine care business, improvements to Huggies diapers and baby wipes, and some new Kleenex facial tissue offerings.","In addition, we're placing even more focus on the execution of our sales and retail merchandising strategies with stronger programming going forward. In terms of the category overall, trends were a little better in the last part of the first quarter, so we're cautiously optimistic that market growth will get back to more normal levels over time.","Moving onto developing and emerging markets, we delivered 4% organic sales growth in this part of our business, and performance and category conditions were broadly in line with our expectations from January.","Looking at some of our key markets, in China, organic sales in diapers were up low-single digits as strong double-digit volume growth was mostly offset by lower selling prices. While the promotion environment remains competitive, we're optimistic that pricing won't be as negative in 2017 as it was in 2016. We also have several innovations on Huggies launching in the second quarter.","In Brazil, our organic sales in Personal Care were up high-single digits compared to a decline of 5% in the year-ago period. Category demand remains down in Brazil and our team there continues to innovate and has product improvements in market on diapers and feminine care.","In Argentina, our organic sales in Personal Care were up low-double digits, driven by higher selling prices. We re-launched Huggies diapers late in the quarter and that helped us deliver modest volume growth despite category volumes being down double digits.","At Eastern Europe, organic sales in diapers were similar year-on-year. Volumes were up double digits again this quarter with continued benefits from innovations in Russia. Selling prices were down, reflecting price rollbacks last year following the strengthening of the Russian ruble.","Lastly, in developed markets outside of North America, organic sales were down 2%, mostly in South Korea. We expect results there to pick up as the year progresses including benefits from innovation launches.","Now, moving onto our outlook and our specific targets for the year; we expect sales to increase 1% to 2% in 2017. The currency impact on sales should be neutral overall, which is about 2 points better than what we expected in January. Regarding organic sales, we also expect growth of 1% to 2%, and that compares to our original estimate of approximately 2% and reflects our first quarter results, the category conditions in North America, and slightly lower price realization due to improved currencies.","Regarding earnings, while the currency outlook has improved, our cost inflation estimate has increased by $75 million on average compared to our assumption in January. In total though, we're still planning that the net impact of changes in currencies, commodities and selling prices will be a mid-to-high single digit drag in our bottom line. That's consistent with our original plan for the year although with a different mix of these factors. Altogether, we continue to target earnings per share of $6.20 to $6.35 for 2017. And that's up 3% to 5% year-on-year.","So, in summary, we're investing in our brands and growth initiatives to help us grow and compete effectively. We're managing our company with financial discipline. And we continue to be optimistic about our opportunities to create long-term shareholder value.","That wraps up our prepared remarks, and now we'll begin to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning.","Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","Good morning, Lauren.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","I just had a couple of questions, not surprisingly, on North America Personal Care. So first was just overall from a category perspective. Does it feel to you like there's been some sort of tipping point in terms of where consumers are shopping in these categories? Meaning the Nielsen tracked versus untracked, because the data obviously looked, from a category perspective, looked far worse than what you've said in terms of what you guys are seeing on category growth. And it looks like it's dramatically different since the start of this year versus end of 2016. So that was my first question.","Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","I'll let Mike Hsu give you a little bit more color on that, but we've certainly seen a pretty strong uptick in e-commerce. And that's a trend that's happening in lots of places, but it did seem to accelerate in the U.S. in the last couple of quarters.","Michael D. Hsu - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","Yeah, Lauren, I do think maybe a shift upwards in e-commerce sales and other channels that are not scanned by Nielsen. I think if you look at the diaper category specifically, in Nielsen xAOC, you probably would've seen a high-single digit decline in volume, but across all outlets that was probably down about low-single digits across all outlets.","And so, you are seeing maybe an increasing shift to e-commerce. I will say there's probably a lot written about this topic, but our relationships across all channels are strong. Our strategy is not just manage (11:58) or pick winners across retailers, and so we do fund customers on the same program across all channels, and then we tailor our execution support to support our customer-specific strategies.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Okay. And then, also the data that Tom cited on category performance and actually market share performance for the infant and child care business, just sort of discussing what wasn't mentioned, it feels like then perhaps adult and fem care is where the sort of more material under-performance versus the categories were. So if you can just talk about that and the outlook on those businesses it would be great.","Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","Yeah, go ahead, Mike.","Michael D. Hsu - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","Yeah, in adult care, I think I'd say our volumes overall year-on-year are about similar versus year ago, and our comparisons were actually probably impacted by the base period year ago where we had strong double digit growth. We are affected a little bit I would say by strong competitive activity in the category. Price promotion remains elevated in adult care. Our market share is strong at 54%, but that is down 2 points versus where we were a year ago.","The category overall is up mid-single digits, and we expect mid-single to high-single digit growth for the balance of the year, so we still think adult care has a lot of growth in it both in the short term and the long term. We've got a strong innovation plan. We're launching a boy's overnight pad this year that's great. And then we'll continue and invest to make sure we're competitive in the marketplace.","Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","And, Lauren, fem care was down, I think, mid-singles, and part of that's timing of launch. We've got the fem care U by Kotex Fitness launch coming. That starts in the second quarter. So we expect to see a little stronger calendar in the back half of the year.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And do you have pretty good visibility on that in terms of shelves estimate? Feels like there's been some de-listings of other fem care brands. So is that freeing up space for you guys or is it coming out of your own existing space?","Michael D. Hsu - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","I'd probably say it's a bit of a mix, but obviously, for us, our goal is to get incremental space. And we're launching U by Kotex Fitness, it's got some pretty good traction and excitement from our customers, and so we're getting the right shelving and space for that. It's a very innovative product. From our side, the product is very tailored for fitness or exercise with real product differentiation there, so we're excited about it.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay, great. Thanks. I'll pass it on.","Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","Thanks, Lauren.","Operator","Our next question comes from Wendy Nicholson with Citi Research.","Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","Hey, Wendy.","Wendy C. Nicholson - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi. Hi. Good morning. Two things just following up on Lauren's line of questioning on the online stuff; can you tell us at this point, specifically your U.S. Personal Care business, how much of that is online versus through traditional trade? And second thing, I'm having a little bit of trouble understanding why there would be sort of some inflection point January 1, 2017, all of a sudden, online really starts to grow that much faster because, as Lauren said, the tracked channel data just kind of fell off a cliff.","Was there more promotional activity online? Was there greater assortment online? Is there anything that you can speak to specifically either about your business or about the category, and I'm really thinking about Personal Care specifically that would represent such a shift just over the last few months?","Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","Yeah, Wendy, I guess a couple of things I would say. Number one, giving you an accurate e-commerce or online versus off-line share is pretty tough for us to do because there's a lot of our traditional brick and mortar customers that do quite a bit of click-and-collect. And so we don't really have any visibility of that because it goes into their existing distribution system and into their existing stores and they take off their shelves.","So Amazon will be a big one that isn't in the tracked data that probably is the gap. And maybe \u2013 and again, they've had a strong quarter across lots of businesses, including ours. And I don't know, Mike, if you want to comment any more about anything that you're seeing in that specific space?","Michael D. Hsu - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","Yeah, I think, Wendy, the only thing I would add is that, obviously, the resellers have decided that mom is very important to them, and there's a strong battle to win mom. We have seen some retail price competitiveness across channels both from bricks and mortar and online, and that's probably driving some price competition and price decline into the market, which has accelerated the shift to some degree this year.","Just to give you an example, I think in the diaper category, infant\/child care mega category across training pants, diapers, infant care and child care, the category volume overall across all outlets is down 1% in volume, but down 5% in net sales. So that gives you an indication of the price deflation.","Wendy C. Nicholson - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. But there's been a lot written about, oh, with all of the shift in terms of where people shop, Walmart's going to be coming back and putting pressure on the manufacturers. Is there any \u2013 I know you said, hey, we treat all our customers equally, but in terms of incremental promotional spending that you are planning, I know you said for the back half you'll be spending more on promo, but that's been in the plans for a while. That's not a specific function of Walmart coming back and saying, hey, you need to be more friendly to us given the changing dynamics and where people shop. Is that right?","Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","I guess I would just call it \u2013 if you look at the North American price was pretty neutral quarter-on-quarter. So that would be an indication that we're not funding additional competitive spend activity.","Wendy C. Nicholson - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got it. Okay. And then I just had a quick short question on China. I know, Tom, you said specifically that you are hoping that in 2017 pricing in China won't be as negative as it was last year. Is that a statement about something you're already seeing in the market? Or is that your confidence in sort of what's going with the Chinese consumer? Or what's driving your optimism about the Chinese pricing environment? Thanks.","Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","Yeah, if you look at the pricing in Q1 versus fourth quarter last year was pretty similar. So we didn't really see further degradation. All the price decline was a carryover effect of things that happened in the first half of last year. So we would feel like it seems to have stabilized at this point in time. And the good news is you're still seeing really strong category volume growth. And so, our pricing comps will get a lot more favorable in the back half, which gives us some confidence on our organic top line outlook.","Wendy C. Nicholson - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Terrific. Thank you.","Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","Thanks, Wendy.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ali Dibadj with Bernstein.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hey, guys. A few questions from me too. One is, so just from a short-term perspective, at least for the next 12 months short-term, your organic guidance range just really ticks down a little bit, so that 1% to 2% relative to the about 2%, which really just suggest that the rest of the year will be kind of what you had anticipated when you gave the guidance the first time around at the start of the year. And I'm still having kind of trouble understanding that.","It feels a little optimistic to me. And at least, very simplistically, we look at things like even in the D&E markets, sequentially looks a little better, but the two-year stack just keeps looking like it's getting worse. The North America business, clearly, as you said yourself, a little bit worse than expected. Pricing competition, maybe you're not driving the competition yet, although looks like in Nielsen just recently you start to match, but a lot more competition in the U.S.","So, look, I'm not (19:46) accuse me of being generally optimistic, but it looks like you guys are being relatively optimistic that nothing is going to get worse, and it's just going to go back to what you anticipated before this less than expected quarter. So, I guess, can you help me quantify how that gap will be closed?","Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","Yeah, I guess I'd say, Ali, the year started out a little slow. Jan, Feb and March was much better. When we look at that and the plans that we have rolling forward with some of the innovation that we've got coming, that's what gives us some confidence. Our comps get quite a bit easier in the back half. So we knew the first half was going to be a tougher comparison to deliver organic growth. And we've got good momentum in a lot of markets around the world.","I'd say the two factors were probably \u2013 and the call down of the top line was a little slower start in Consumer Tissue in North America, and then some price rollbacks in markets where there was pretty big price recovery last year and no other currencies have strengthened. So Brazil and Russia in particular have been places where the currency was pretty weak last year, and we took a lot of price and some of that snapped back. But we'll give you an update as the year progresses. We call it, as you know, down the middle of how we see the fairway, and we'll keep updating as we go through the year.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. And just on the, I guess, shape of the fairway, (21:15) a little bit on North America, clearly, that looked pretty tough. And you talked about some things that seem like they might get better, including March, but it just seems like there's a lot more competition in the space, whether it be, again, some of that private label stepping in, whether it be Procter & Gamble directly, it does feel like some retailers like Walmart are reacting a little bit to preemptively stopping the ALDIs or the (21:43) are coming through.","Although that's small, they don't want to get them to be too big, a bigger tilt towards Amazon, where I think at least in the U.S. your shares are lower, you said before publicly versus off-line. So I guess I'm trying to figure out more broadly why there won't be more secular challenges? And this maybe not just impacting you guys, but just overall in the sector, what do you guys see from those elements, again, competition getting tougher, retailers clearly struggling to gain share from each other, tilt towards Amazon going forward, and how do you think that actually impact you guys and the sector broadly, because it does feel like those are secular challenges?","Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","Yeah, I guess we would say that 1% to 2%, we still feel like relative to our long-term goal of 3% to 5% reflects some of those secular challenges.","Michael D. Hsu - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","Yeah. And Ali, I think while I certainly acknowledge that the North American environment's gotten more challenging than it was last year. I don't think our first quarter Consumer Tissue is how we planned to perform for the balance of the year. We are expecting our execution to improve. We recognize that it's gotten a little bit more price competitive and we will be competitive in the marketplace. But a lot of it comes down to how we execute in the stores. And I think we are expecting to improve our execution of the stores.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","And so just my last question on that flows right in there, which is just your 3% to 5% long term, do you think \u2013 it used to be that you guys are delivering 3% to 5%, and then really toward the high-end of that. Emerging markets clearly slowed down, competition clearly picked up, and now we're in this kind of low-end, obviously, below that low-end of that guidance for this year. Any kind of views on the 3% to 5% sustainability over long-term? Do you still think that's sustainable?","Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","Yes. We do. In fact, Mike, maybe will comment on this because he's taking a refreshed look at the long-term strategic plan, which we won't unpack all the details for you this morning, but I'd say we still see strong category growth potential, particularly in a lot of the emerging markets. So maybe, Mike, do you want to comment just a little bit on that?","Michael D. Hsu - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","Yeah, definitely, Ali, strong potential long-term, particularly D&E. If you think about it with continued household formation, wealth creation, emergence of the middle class in a lot of these countries, our categories are still, I think, fairly early in our growth cycle, particularly if you think about fem care, diapers, adult care especially, and so we do see long-term growth.","Now, what we see near-term volatility or cyclical volatility as we're experiencing over the last year and a half or so, yes, that's probably the case. But I think right now, we are building plans to kind of keep us in that range. But, obviously, with some of these new conditions, we haven't fully analyzed what just started happening in North America this January. So I think our analysis will continue to evolve. But, right now, we are still shooting for 3% to 5% range.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks very much, as usual, guys.","Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","Thanks, Ali.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies.","Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC","Thanks. Good morning, guys.","Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","Good morning, Kevin.","Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC","Just to come back to the guidance and the acceleration there, Tom, how reliant is the improvement in the back half on category improvement? And is that something you can put a number on for us? And then I have a follow-up.","Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","Yeah, I think as you look at some of the price competition in China that's rolling off, what we're seeing is the underlying category has been robust from a volume standpoint. It's just been masked by some of the price challenges, and so we feel pretty solid that that's going to continue and flow through.","There are other markets like Brazil, Argentina, where the economy hasn't yet really turned substantially. There's still a fair amount of price recovery to go in Argentina to get back to a more equilibrium state, and so there's probably some question marks there. On the other hand, Russia and other parts of Eastern Europe still seeing actually strong category growth there even though the economy hasn't fully recovered.","And North America, I'd say it's a mixed bag. On the Personal Care front, we still see good category growth in adult care. We've got good innovation coming in fem care. Actually, the growth in the training pant category and out of diapers favors us given our share with Pull-Ups, so we feel pretty good about that.","And Consumer Tissue is one where we just got to step up our execution a bit and make sure we're getting our fair share of that category. So I wouldn't say it's dependent on improvement in category growth, it's more sustaining what we see happening and then executing against it.","Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC","And Tom, just to stick with that for a moment, if I may. So, in North America, your slide suggests overall category growth of about 0.5% in the quarter. That was down 150 basis points relative to 2016. So, more specifically, the improvement in North America embedded in your guidance, which implies like 1.5% to 3% for the balance of the year from down 1%. So, specifically, and maybe you don't want to put a number on it and that's fine, but is that something you can put a number on for us?","Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","Yeah, I don't think we could probably give you an accurate read on that specifically. And I think we'd probably say we're still trying to exactly figure it out what happened with the consumer in North America in the first quarter. There's been lots of theories. You've seen a little bit of category weakness across lots of places. So how much of it is broader economic slowdown, which you don't seem to be seeing in other areas? The job report was a little weak but not substantially so. So that's still probably what we're trying to dial in a little bit more precisely.","Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Thanks. So just one follow-up, if I may, and some of this has sort of been discussed, but maybe I'll ask it a little bit differently. So some of the commentary and what's been written around Walmart and the pricing posture and them looking to sort of solidify their lead as the price leader along with sort of underscoring an emphasis on private label, Tom, are those discussions, and, Mike, are those discussions different now?","And maybe don't comment on Walmart specifically. I wouldn't expect that. But, just broadly, are you feeling more pressure on the manufacturers at this point? That would be number one. Number two, all this promotion that we're seeing, which is not just unique to your categories, there's a number of others of course. How much of this, in your sense, is being funded by the retailers versus that which is being funded by \u2013 I'm sorry. How much is being funded by the manufacturers versus how much is being funded by the retailers? And then, lastly, are you seeing greater emphasis on private label at this point? Or is that a bit over-emphasized or overdone in terms of what's being written? Thank you.","Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","It's a pretty long question, Kevin. We'll do the best we can with that.","Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC","Sorry.","Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","I guess I would start. Price competition among retailers is not a new phenomena and it's maybe heating up a bit. Ultimately, finished product selling prices are retailers' responsibility and you didn't see a lot of price change in our North American numbers. So our trade programs are pretty much intact and maybe I'll let Mike comment a little bit more if you want on private label trends or the general nature of discussions there. I will say this though that when you've got good innovation and strong brands (29:14), it leads to a different discussion than if you don't have those things, it becomes more of an item price discussion.","Michael D. Hsu - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","Yeah, I'd say the private label trends, I think they're category specific. And so I would say, in diapers, probably the brands are holding up pretty strongly. In Consumer Tissue, maybe there's a slight improvement in private label on the (29:38) side. So I think it varies by category.","Certainly, I think given the kind of the conditions we're given, we talked about with increasing penetration of online, I think price has gotten \u2013 come more to the forefront. And we're having discussions with our customers, but they feel similar to discussions we have most years. And our job is to make sure we provide our customers with the right support. As I said, we do try to fund our customers on similar programs, and what we do tailor is how we support them execution only with promotions and through their own marketing tactics.","Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Thank you very much.","Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","Thanks, Kevin.","Operator","Our next question comes from Olivia Tong with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. Good morning.","Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","Olivia.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","In terms of first on \u2013 hi \u2013 your revised price mix outlook, sounds like it's primarily just currency related. Currencies are coming in a little bit, so some of the pricing you would've expected to take in emerging markets is no longer justified. But you also talked a lot about some of the things you need to do in North America Consumer Tissue and some other categories. So is that embedded into your outlook? Was that already in the outlook? Or is there something that's \u2013 or are you expecting more price mix, price promotion associated with that? And perhaps also where does pricing against incremental commodities inflation stand relative to your whole price mix structure? Thanks.","Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","Yeah, I guess I'd say, and maybe Mike can comment a little bit more on North America, but I'd say our overall plan in North America hasn't changed much. We just didn't get it all executed in the marketplace in the first quarter, particularly in Consumer Tissue, and so our plan for the year hasn't changed in terms of what we plan to spend broadly.","I don't know, Mike, is there anything else you want to add to that or?","Michael D. Hsu - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","Yeah, I think both in baby and child care and in Consumer Tissue, we are seeing increased promotion intensity. Our goal is to be competitive in the marketplace and we may need to increase our spending in some areas, but again, we have a pretty well established trade promotion effectiveness program, and we try to be very analytical in our approach and make sure we get the right returns on our investment trade.","Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","And then on the commodities inflation, it's not enough to drive finished product selling prices in most places, and particularly, when you see many of the international markets, the currency turning favorable, it's not a calculus that would lead to a lot of price in markets like that.","We are getting some pricing in \u2013 where secondary fiber has gone up quite a bit in K-C Professional, we're getting some price recovery. I think there's been more broad price increases across the industry that have been announced recently and so that will give us some benefit. But that's about the only one that I can think of that there's maybe a direct commodity driven price change that we'd see coming this year.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. Thanks. And then in terms of margins, those have held up fairly well despite the top line slowdown and Personal Care was the particular stand out. And given the level of competitive activity there...","Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","(32:54), Olivia.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","No, no, no, I mean they've actually been pretty decent, but just trying to understand some of the key drivers of the improvement there and how you think about the sustainability of that.","Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","Well, we would say brilliant leadership would be right at the top of the list, but jokes aside, we had a great cost savings quarter. $110 million in FORCE cost savings, a great way to start the year. And then that certainly was a driver of that. Good mix of negotiated material savings, pretty good productivity, some of this material specification changes, then an increasing element of that bucket is in some of the distribution and logistics related savings.","It's encouraging. I know Maria's a fan of this to see our inventories keep coming down and that not only delivers cash, but also delivers cost savings as we've got less stuff to store and handle. I don't know, Mike, if there's anything else you want to build on that?","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. Thanks. And then just last question. Your thoughts on sort of the deal environment; growth has obviously slowed first in emerging markets, now a bit more in developed markets. And are there any areas you think where you could expand that could help your growth? And then broadly, what's your view on the M&A environment as a whole right now, given some of the chatter and some of the attempts that have been made not too long ago in the broader HPC space?","Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","I would say there aren't that many tuck-ins internationally, but there are a few in a few places, but we did a lot of that in the 1990s and really bought up a lot of the market positions that we wanted and we've been able to consolidate some joint ventures into being 100% owned over time. And so it's a relatively light calendar of M&A activity. And yeah, we read all the same chatter that you guys read and, quite honestly, we're more focused on running our own business every day and stay pretty focused on that and don't play too much with the speculation process on what might happen. So, I think so far that's served us well.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thanks, Tom. Appreciate it.","Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","Thanks, Olivia.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan.","Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning, everyone. Thank you. I was wondering if you can please elaborate on the inventory levels in North America and China. And we benefit from your comments, but with the shift to online, and I know we discussed a lot of the call, but are you seeing inventory levels increase at the bricks and mortar? And how can \u2013 specifically in North America? And how about China? Have you cycled most of the levels of inventory there? I would appreciate. Thank you.","Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","Yeah, in terms of retailer inventories, we didn't see a big shift anywhere really, and we have pretty high cube, high velocity categories, particularly in a place like China, where so much of it is e-commerce. Often the e-com players really aren't even holding any inventory. They'll pick up at our distribution center and deliver the same day. And so there's not a lot of inventory in those systems, and I know we've seen some minor shifts in inventory across other channels, but nothing that was significant enough to call out in the quarter.","Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And if I can ask \u2013 thank you. This is very helpful. If I can ask on the FORCE program, I know you did not update much, the numbers are still there and you tracked well on the quarter. But how much of it is related to FX and also the commodities environment? Like you see some potential upside there or actually the opposite given that you did translate some of this cost savings might be \u2013 as it translates, might be higher, but if you look at the commodity outlook, how you can track that number?","Maria G. Henry - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","Yeah. Sure. As Tom mentioned, we did have a strong first quarter and $110 million of savings. And those savings came from across all the areas that our team looked to deliver against. Only one of those areas has to do with sourcing savings, which would be affected by the commodity environment. The tougher the commodity environment, the tougher the negotiations are, but we were very pleased with our team's ability to negotiate that \u2013 to continue to negotiate well in the first quarter and we would expect to see that continue through the remainder of the year.","In terms of the other areas, though, we expect that we'll continue to drive productivity in our manufacturing operation. Our global supply chain team is partnering well with the regional supply chain teams and the in-country teams to really be focused on driving the manufacturing programs, driving waste out of the system. We've got some momentum there. We continue to build supply chain capabilities in that area, so we feel good about our number of $400 million for the year.","One thing that I will note is if you look at our cost saving last year, we will have tougher comps on cost savings in the second half of this year because our cost savings really built throughout last year. But I think with the capabilities we're building and the execution and focus of the teams, we still feel good about that $400 million number for the year.","Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC","All right. Thank you, Maria and Tom.","Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","Thanks, Andrea.","Operator","Our next question comes from Eve Powers (sic) [Steve Powers] with UBS.","Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC","Or Steve. So, first, just a couple of cleanups from your original guidance; I think originally you expected interest expense to come down slightly this year versus 2016, but given how you started the year, should we rethink that? And I guess, maybe as a potential offset, you've maybe guided the buybacks to $800 million to $1 billion, but started off ahead of that pace, so is there some offset there?","Maria G. Henry - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","Yeah, interest expense, we still expect to be down slightly. We've got a refinancing that's coming up. We have a bond that comes due for $950 million in August, and that's at 6.125%, so we'll replace that with cheaper financing, which will help us.","In terms of share repurchases, we're still expecting to do between $800 million and $1 billion this year. We started out a little stronger. As you'll recall, we finished last year with a little bit more cash on hand. We had very strong cash flows last year, so we started out a stronger in the first part of this year.","Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Cool. And then one more cleanup, which is just on the commodity backdrop, just what you're now assuming full year for oil and pulp and where you expect each to exit 2017? That'd be helpful. But, broader question, maybe this is for Tom, but I was hoping you could comment a bit more on market share trends globally really, because I think you mentioned flat shares in North American Personal Care, but clearly, you under-shipped in Consumer Tissue versus consumption. And overseas, it seems like a mixed bag as well.","So just maybe more specific comments on where you're seeing relative market share strength versus weakness? And given that you're not really expecting category improvement going forward, are you embedding improving market share trends instead? Or is it simply sell-in versus sell-out timing that will drive sequential improvement over the balance of the year? Thanks.","Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","Okay. I'll do the best I can with that, Steve, and we'll see, Steve, what I leave left for you to follow-up on. In terms of pulp and oil, we'd say for pulp we're probably up $40 to $50 a ton versus our original guidance in terms of we expect in terms of market pricing for eucalyptus. So we're calling euc at $870 to $900 a ton. And I know the current price is above that, but that's kind of our outlook for the year.","Oil we're kind of in the $50 to $60 a ton still, and there may be some upside for us on that depending on where oil shakes. In the meantime, though polymer has actually gone up a bit, as there's been some supply challenges on polymer. And we don't have a lot of direct oil. We do a lot more polypropylene and oils short of the long-term proxy for that, but in the short term, they can go different directions.","Swinging to the market share front, if you looked at shares sequentially in North America, they're pretty flat; up in a couple, flat in a few, down in a couple. Year-over-year, particularly in Consumer Tissue is where we had the most negative share comparison. So that was probably a high watermark for Consumer Tissue last year.","As you travel around the world, I'd say you'd see relatively stable share positions. Brazil is up in fem care, down a little in diapers; similar story in Argentina. China shares were, I think, pretty flat to down 1-point; Korea, kind of a similar story. Positive shares in Russia, Ukraine, other parts of Eastern Europe on diapers in particular.","I don't know, Mike, if there's any other ones that jump out for you? Fem care has probably been our star and that we've had very strong share performance in most markets on fem care.","Michael D. Hsu - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","Yes. The only thing I'd add, I think, certainly, I think in China, holding on pretty very good and doing a good job out there. Central and Eastern Europe, I think we are seeing a pretty good share growth. I think Latin America, as Tom said, pluses and minuses, but we know we need to get our shares pointed in a stronger direction. And then certainly, North America, I think BCC (43:05) or infant child care, shares about flat in the quarter, but most of the other categories a little softer year-on-year versus what we expect. So we know we need to perform better there.","Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. I just want to \u2013 I think it was in response to Kevin's question earlier, you had said over the balance of the year you weren't really expecting much category improvement, but obviously, you're going to sequential improvement. So if shares are roughly neutral, which is what I gather from all of those comments in aggregate, but you're expecting improvement, it seems like you're expecting to be gaining share if you're not expecting the categories themselves to improve. Is that fair or am I missing something?","Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","I think that's a fair statement. When we get done with this call, Mike and I are going to go in and talk to our team leaders around the company. And one of the things we're going to tell is we're not satisfied with our market shares in the first quarter. So we'd expect to do better as the year progresses.","Paul J. Alexander - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","And Steve, this is Paul. Just remember, similarly to our organic growth trends from last year, the market share trends follow suit. So the comparisons get easier on both metrics as we get into the back half of the year.","Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC","Yeah. That's fair. Thank you.","Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","Thanks, Steve.","Operator","Our next question comes from Nik Modi with RBC.","Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Yeah. Good morning, everyone. So just a couple for me. Globally, maybe you can just provide some perspective, Tom, on the promotional environment. If you're looking for market share gains to accelerate or improve as the year unfolds, do you expect the promotional environment to moderate as well? Is it getting worse? Did you see that in the quarter? And then the second question is my understanding is that you've taken a price increase or a list price increase on Kleenex. And I'm just curious if you've seen Procter follow at this point? Thanks.","Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","All right. Maybe I'll have Mike comment on both of those, so on promotional environment broadly and then facial pricing.","Michael D. Hsu - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","Yeah, I think the promotional environment is, as you've heard us discuss, I think it's gotten more challenging, and our exception is at this point is that that environment will continue. And so we're going to be prepared to operate in that environment. And I think what we need to do is be competitive with our promotions and the right price points, but be disciplined about how we spent. And so that's the emphasis going forward. With regard to Kleenex, we did do a list price increase beginning of the year, and that has flowed through. I probably won't comment specifically on the profitability impact.","Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Oh, I was asking on P&G, if P&G has followed in the market?","Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","I'm not aware that there's been any change on their end.","Michael D. Hsu - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","Yeah, I don't believe so.","Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","Yeah. I think the other point, Nik, would be, as we've got innovation coming, you want to use your promotion along with your other strategic marketing tools to drive that. So we've got a pretty strong calendar coming, and so that wouldn't be unusual for us to put more money behind those ideas either.","Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. And just one more thing. I know you guys talked about March getting better versus Jan and Feb, and it just seems like no one really knows what happened in January and February. And I'm wondering if maybe you have any thoughts outside of just a macro comment? Was there anything specific to your business that you saw that really caused the weakness like a dislocation between consumption and inventory or just higher crate spend? Anything you can give us to just get us some perspective around that?","Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","No, I wish I could tell you the clear answer, because then I would have done something about it before now. But it was \u2013 and I think everybody was talking about retail store traffic was down broadly. They can't point to weather. There was theories about late income tax refunds. Again, I don't know why that would necessarily affect our category. But, on the other hand, if you're not in the store shopping, you definitely saw that in terms of retail traffic.","Now there was some uptick in e-commerce that balanced off a part of that. We are seeing probably, I don't know, Mike, if you want to comment on this, just a little bit less in terms of the fill-in trips may be part of it as some retailers unpacked that. But I think it's still pretty early to figure out exactly what happened.","Michael D. Hsu - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","Yeah, I think when you have this much going on, which is maybe consumer confidence, the e-commerce shift, and then these theories around the tax. I know that perhaps a lot of \u2013 we had debates internally about how farfetched the tax refund timing affect is, but certainly in conversations with retailers, I think many of them believed that with strong conviction.","And so, I think there's multiple factors that we don't have enough analysis to be able to tease out exactly what happened, but I do think there was some softening that we saw particularly in January and February, and we came out in March a little bit better.","Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. Thanks so much.","Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","Thanks, Nik.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you. Good morning.","Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","Good morning, Bonnie.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","I just have a couple of quick questions on two of your key markets, China and Brazil. So, first on China, I guess I was hoping you could drill down a little bit more on the pricing dynamics in the market. In the past, you guys have called out currency dynamics versus some of your peers as a key driver behind lower pricing. But I guess it now feels that some of this is also due to general competitiveness in the market. So could you help us better understand the dynamics there?","And then on Brazil, could you comment on some of the volume strength you saw during the quarter, which seems to be an improvement versus last quarter? So, curious to hear if you're seeing any improvements in the underlying consumer in Brazil or is this more a reflection of you guys lapping easier compares? Thanks.","Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","Yeah, I think on China, a lot of the pricing was really led by some of our other international competitors over the last couple of years almost, and some of that was probably funded by a weaker yen. But I think that seems to have normalized.","In the meantime, this is one of the fastest growing markets in the world, and it's not surprising to see everybody chasing after that consumer growth. And so right now, you've got two big U.S.-based players and two big Japanese-based players all chasing growth in the Chinese market. And I think the good news is that pricing seemed to have stabilized in the quarter, although it was down year-on-year, reflecting some of the things that happened in the first quarter last year.","On the Brazil front, part of it was we had a lousy start last year in the first quarter, so our comp was easier in that market, and that was why our volume uptick was there. I'd say the shares we've seen in that market are just Jan, Feb, and we had a stronger March, so you could've had a situation there, where maybe shipments were even a little bit ahead of category consumption. But we'll see when we get the next share data.","I don't know, Mike, if there's anything else you want to add on either of those markets?","Michael D. Hsu - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","Well, in Brazil, I think the Q1 Personal Care sales were up high-single digit. And as Tom was saying, we were cycling on a 5% decline in the base period. So volume up, and the net sales price is down slightly. FX obviously contributed a little bit. But the team has really done a nice job, I think, fine-tuning their price pack, competitiveness and getting the right price points on shelf. And I think that's making a difference.","The macro factors, I think they are improving slightly, but the environment is still tough. And GDP is still contracting, but maybe at a slower rate. Inflation's a little bit lower than it was this time a year ago, but the consumer, I think, is still pretty well under stress.","And then back to China, I think, we are encouraged by I think the performance Q1 on China. I think organic was up low-single digit, but volume was up strong double digits, somewhat offset by lower net selling prices. Pricing environment, as Tom says, has stabilized, but it's consistent with what we've been planning. So we think we still have \u2013 we're encouraged about what's happening this year, and think our performance will be good this year in China.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And then just one final question, if I may, on the promotional environment; a lot of discussion this morning about it, but just wanted to touch on something or hear from you how you think that's going to evolve throughout the remainder of the year or into next, if you think about what's going on with some of the channel shift going to e-commerce. And as these brick and mortar retail partners of yours are feeling increased pressure, how much more pressure ultimately will there be on retail pricing and greater promotions?","Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","So if you have slower growth and you've got lots of competitors facing it that sometimes results in higher promotional environment. And so you're also seeing retailers get creative across the space in terms of do more with click and collect and there's a lot of innovation happening, not just around price, but also around service and how shoppable the categories are in different environments. And so I will expect that that will continue as we roll forward.","I don't know, Mike, if there's any other color you've got on that?","Michael D. Hsu - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","No, we've seen this shift occur in other markets, China and Korea particularly, and we've adapted pretty well, in some cases, led that change. And so we need to be as nimble and responsive to the market conditions that we plan to be.","Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","Yeah, and e-commerce does cause great price transparency. On the other hand, retailers have been comp shopping each other's stores in bricks and mortar for 100 years. So it's not a new phenomenon.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jonathan Feeney with Consumer Edge Research.","Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Good morning. Thanks very much. So just two questions and one detail. Tom mentioned lower promo shipment in North America Personal Care and Tissue. And I know you talked a whole bunch about execution. Just what specifically \u2013 a lot of it seems like it's category and competitive landscape. So if you can give us like an anecdote or two of what the kinds of decisions you made in Q1 in North America that you'd like to change over the course of the year, independent of and maybe where some of those types of decisions have worked.","Second question is, nice volume improvement in China diapers, and do you think maybe some of these lower prices in your clearly premium diaper business are maybe enabling more trade up? And if you could comment on price gaps with mid-lower tier products there and just the details. Tax rate was better this quarter. I didn't see any real change to guidance for the full year. Comment around that. Can you tell us a little bit how that flows over the course of the year? Thanks so much.","Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","It's a pretty comprehensive list there so, on the promo front, maybe Mike can comment a little bit on that.","Michael D. Hsu - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","Yeah. I think, with regard to North America, I think the promo timing, we had a few major events with large customer shift out of our quarter that we knew going into the year, and so we had assumed that. So that explains a bit of the shift. Probably, what was new news to us was probably the more aggressiveness in promotion activity and promotional price points, and that's the one that we're adapting to right now. And again, we're going to manage our business with discipline, but we want to be price competitive in the marketplace.","With regard to China, the \u2013 oh, sorry.","Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","On China, I think the question was, have you seen any kind of trade up in e-com and I think, broadly, that is the case. We've just launched a super-premium diaper pant in China that we're really excited about. And moms that tend to shop in e-com tend to skew a little bit higher income and so that should be a positive for us. And then the last question...","Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Thanks. And just tax rate?","Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","...was tax rate, which Maria can comment on.","Maria G. Henry - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","Yeah. Our tax rate, as we mentioned coming into the year, will be variable by quarter because of the various tax planning initiatives that we do. Our tax rate this quarter was slightly below what we had last quarter before the \u2013 I'm sorry \u2013 last year first quarter. The full year though we still expect the tax rate to be similar to the full year that we delivered in 2016.","Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Thank you very much. Comprehensive answers.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ali Dibadj with Bernstein.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hi, guys. Thanks for the follow-up.","Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","Hey, Ali.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Just wanted to follow-up specifically on the free cash flow on the quarter being much lower and then you mentioned tax (55:55) to understand a little bit more, but also each element of working capital looks worse too. Can you just talk a little bit more about that and whether even on the inventory being so high, whether we should expect some idling or anything and whether we're that level? So taxes and then working capital. Thanks.","Maria G. Henry - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","Sure. We expected that our tax payments would be higher this year versus last year not only in the first quarter but for the total year. The driver of that was actually tax benefits that we had last year, which lowered our overall cash tax expense. This year, in terms of cash taxes it's a much more normalized level, so we'll be impacted by that year-on-year.","On working capital, working capital was actually good for the quarter; our cash conversion days for 2018 (56:50), which is down four days from the average of last year. The primary benefit there is in payables. In terms of inventory, we clearly have room to continue to optimize our inventory. And both our supply chain teams and our finance teams are very focused on this. We made really good progress on that last year. There'll be some timing effects as we go through the year, but that's an area where we're very focused on it to drive down inventory as part of our overall working capital program.","Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","One difference though. You might be looking just that fourth quarter only working capital number. We tend to compare to the full year average, because there is a bit of cyclicality as the year rolls through.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Yeah, I was looking at Q4, so I didn't quite get that answer, but okay. Okay. Thanks.","Maria G. Henry - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","Yeah. We were very, very low in the fourth quarter last year.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jason English with Goldman Sachs.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey, guys. Thanks for letting me on.","Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","Hey, Jason.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","We obviously cover a lot ground so I just got a couple of quick questions I'll try pound through quickly. First, Mike, I think you mentioned that some promotion shifted out of this quarter. Was that a shift into the fourth quarter of last year or is that a shift into second quarter?","Michael D. Hsu - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","Well, one, I think part of the shift was out of our plan entirely for the year, and then part of it was shifting into the second and third quarters of this year.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. So it's a little more programming, as you mentioned, kind of in the second quarter and back of the year, but a lot of comments also in terms of cadence and comparisons. As we look forward through the remainder of the year, as you've highlighted, second half comps get easy. The second quarter comps get really tough, particularly in North America Tissue and Personal Care. And it sounds like the environment's pretty darn challenged. Is it fair to expect the second quarter to look sort of comparable if not a little more challenged than what was seen in the first quarter?","Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","Jason, we don't give quarterly guidance as you know, so I think you can do the math as easy as we can and you're correct in assessing that the comps get tougher in the second quarter. But, beyond that, I'm probably not going to give you any more color on quarterly guidance.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Fair enough. And in China, encouraging to hear that sequentially prices are sort of holding pretty consistent with what we're seeing in admittedly limited scope Nielsen got out of that market. As we go into the back half and we comp the price decrease assuming we hold, obviously, year-on-year pricing looks better from there. Should we expect year-on-year volume to decelerate at the same time? In other words, are you seeing the volume lift because of this year-on-year price degradation that's going to abate once the price degradation is no longer there?","Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","No, not at all. The volume actually has been pretty strong throughout and so is it's been more of a function of innovation and category growth and consumer spending power and that we expect those stronger results to come through more clearly in the back half of the year.","Michael D. Hsu - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","Yeah, I'll give you, Jason, a couple of factors why we believe that. One, we do have news, as Tom mentioned, great new innovation in super premium tier 6. Second, the birthrate is increasing. Two years ago, I think the birthrate was about 16 million live births. Last year, we estimated around 17.5 million. And this year, it could be as high as 20 million. And so that's kind of in our favor. And then we're also are expanding our penetration of cities, and we'll continue to add cities in distribution this year.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Good stuff. All right. Thanks, guys. I'll pass it on. I know we're out of time.","Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","Thanks, Jason.","Operator","At this time, we have no further questions in the queue. Thank you.","Paul J.

At the conclusion of this morning\u2019s presentation, we will open the lines for your questions. At that time, instructions will be given as to the procedure to follow, if you\u2019d like to ask a question.","It is now my pleasure to introduce today\u2019s first presenter, Mr. Paul Alexander.","","Paul Alexander","Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Kimberly-Clark\u2019s year-end earnings conference call. Here in Dallas with me today are Tom Falk, Chairman and CEO; Mark Buthman, Senior VP and CFO; and Mike Azbell, Vice President and Controller.","Here is the agenda for our call. Mark will begin with a review of our 2013 results focusing mostly on the full year. Tom will then provide his perspectives on our results and also the outlook for 2014. We\u2019ll finish with Q&A. We have a presentation of today\u2019s materials in the Investors section of our website. That presentation in this morning\u2019s earnings news release, both include our detailed planning assumptions for 2014.","As a reminder, we will be making forward-looking statements today. Please see the Risk Factors section of our last Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of forward-looking statements. We will also be referring to adjusted results and outlook, both excludes certain items described in this morning\u2019s news release. The release has further information on these adjustments and reconciliations to comparable GAAP financial measures.","And now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Mark.","","Mark Buthman","Thanks Paul and good morning. Let\u2019s start with some headlines for the full year. First, we achieved organic sales growth of 4% and was highlighted by strength in K-C International. Second, we increased adjusted earnings per share of 10% driven by organic sales growth and strong cost savings. And third, we delivered a strong year of overall capital management.","Now, let\u2019s cover the details of our results. Fourth quarter sales were $5.3 billion that was even with the prior year, that brought full year sales to $21.2 billion also even with year ago. If you exclude currency and restructuring impacts, our organic sales were up 5% in the quarter and 4% for the full year. Our momentum in K-C International continues to be strong as organic sales were up 11% in the fourth quarter and 9% for the full year. Fourth quarter adjusted gross margin was 34.4% with the full year at 34.5%. It\u2019s up 70 basis points year-on-year. Adjusted operating margin was 15.8% in the fourth quarter and 15.7% for the full year, that\u2019s up 90 basis points compared to prior year.","We delivered $310 million of FORCE cost savings in 2013, the second highest amount we have ever achieved. We expect to continue our momentum going forward and are targeting to deliver at least $300 million of cost savings in 2014. We absorbed $205 million of input cost inflation in 2013 that was right in line with our expectations. Currencies were also a drag on earnings. Translation was a $70 million negative and transaction effects were also unfavorable. Fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share were $1.44 bringing our full year to $5.77, that\u2019s up 10% year-on-year slightly above the top end of our long-term target and well above our original guidance range for the year.","Our balance sheet and cash generation were healthy and we continue to allocate capital in shareholder friendly ways. Cash from operations was more than $3 billion, now that\u2019s down somewhat year-on-year as we expected with higher tax payments and then cash cost especially with the strategic changes that we have implemented in Europe. We had a great year driving down primary working capital. Cash conversion cycle improved six days in 2013. We expect a further one to two day improvement in 2014.","Return on invested capital also improved significantly climbing 150 basis points to 17.5% for the year. We are targeting a further 20 to 40 basis point improvement in 2014. We returned $2.4 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. For 2014, we expect to repurchase $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion of KMB stock. Regarding the dividends, we expect an increase of 2% to 4% in 2014 that will allow us to maintain an appropriate payout ratio following the expected spin-off of our healthcare business later this year. In the future after this year we would expect our dividend increases to return to being broadly in line with growth in our adjusted earnings per share.","Our credit metrics and financial position are strong, we\u2019re confident in our outlook. As a result we\u2019re planning for a modest increase in leverage in 2014. Now I will briefly recap segment results for the year. In Personal Care organic sales rose 5%; performance was led by K-C International with organic sales up 9%. Full year Personal Care operating margins were solid at 17.8% to an increase of 50 basis points year-on-year.","Moving to Consumer Tissue, organic sales were up 5% that was driven by a 9% increase in K-C International and a 3% improvement in North America. Consumer Tissue operating margins of 14.9% were up a 130 basis points building further on our progress over the last two years.","Turning to K-C Professional, organic sales increased 3%. Organic sales improved 9% in K-C International and were up slightly in North America and Europe. Our KCP team continues to deliver strong margin improvement despite relatively modest demands in our developed markets. For the year margins were 18.3% it's up a 170 basis points year-on-year and lastly healthcare organic sales rose 1% for the year driven by higher volumes at our Medical Device business.","Healthcare operating margins were 14.2% were up 10 basis points year-over-year. Now speaking to healthcare let me touch briefly on the potential spin-off of that business. We\u2019re making good progress analyzing the implications of the spin. We\u2019re preparing (indiscernible) our financial statements and plans for separation.","We expect to seek approval from our Board in the second quarter to proceed with the execution and the spin-off and we continue to expect the spin-off to be completed by the end of the third quarter of 2014 of course subject to market regulatory and other conditions.","So that wraps up my comments. To recap we achieved solid organic sales growth in 2013. We delivered strong bottom-line growth and we allocated capital and shareholder friendly ways. Now I will turn it over to Tom.","","Tom Falk","Thanks Mark and good morning everyone. I will share my perspectives on our full year results first and then I will address our outlook for 2014. So starting with 2013 overall I\u2019m very happy with the results that we delivered last year in a challenging environment.","As Mark just mentioned we delivered organic sales growth of 4% and that\u2019s right in line with our long term target of 3% to 5%. K-C International had another great year at 9% organic sales growth that made excellent progress on the targeted growth initiatives. For example in diapers our organic sales were up more than 35% last year in China and about 20% in both Brazil and Russia and results in all three countries benefited from products innovation.","In China our Huggies diapers are now being sold in about 90 cities and we\u2019re targeting to be in more than a 100 cities by the end of 2014. Couple of our growth initiatives in KCI were adult care and baby wipes and in both of those areas organic sales grew at double digit rates in KCI this year. In feminine care our organic sales rose high single digits in KCI. We had a very strong year in fem care in Latin America and we continue to benefit from the roll-out of some of our premium product variations similar to U by Kotex in the U.S.","K-C Professional organic sales were up high single digits in K-C International and we\u2019re growing there as industrialization and economic development roll-out across those regions. So overall I\u2019m very encouraged by the progress we\u2019re making in K-C International and that part of the business now makes up 39% of our total company sales. In North America we drove solid sales growth and we launched innovations on several brands including the Depend, Poise, U by Kotex and Cottonelle. On Huggies diapers our innovation, marketing and promotion strategies led to some improved performance in the back half of the year and slightly higher volumes for the year in total.","Our North American brands are healthy overall. We had market shares that were up or even with the prior year in 7 of our 8 major categories. In terms of profitability and bottom-line growth in 2013, we had margins improve in North America and Europe in K-C International and they also increased in all four business segments. This broad-based improvement is a sign of a healthy business. I\u2019m pleased that we delivered 10% growth and adjusted earnings per share. That\u2019s our best performance since we launched the global business plan more than 10 years ago.","Finally as Mark has already highlighted, we continue to operate with financial discipline. We delivered significant FORCE cost savings last year. We improved our working capital and ROIC. And we returned substantial cash to our shareholders. So overall, we delivered on our commitments in 2013 and we have got good momentum going forward.","So let\u2019s move to our outlook for 2014. We will continue to focus on delivering a healthy growth model and leveraging our financial discipline. That means we plan to drive the top line with growth initiatives and innovations to increase margins behind strong cost savings to continue to invest in our brands, to improve our return on invested capital and to improve our cash flow.","And now, in terms of our specific targets, on the top line, we expect organic sales to grow by 3% to 5%, including another year of high single-digit growth, organic growth in K-C International. We will launch a number of new innovations in KCI, including diaper and feminine care upgrades in Brazil, China and Russia. We also expect to make further progress expanding our adult care, baby wipes in K-C Professional businesses internationally. We have got a strong innovation pipeline coming in North America. In a near-term that includes activity on Huggies diapers and baby wipes, our GoodNites youth pants, Depend briefs and Viva towels. To support our brands and growth initiatives, we will increase advertising and research and development spending faster than sales.","On the bottom line, we are targeting adjusted earnings per share in the range of $6 to $6.20, that\u2019s up 4% to 7% year-on-year. Our plan includes a 3 to 4 point drag from negative currency translation as a result of the stronger U.S. dollar. So taking that into account, our underlying growth is solidly in line with or even slightly ahead of our long-term objective. As usual, our plan is based on forward currency exchange rates. We have also assumed some bottom line negative impact in Venezuela from either a currency devaluation or ongoing market volatility.","We have assumed the commodity cost inflation this year will be similar to last year in the range of $150 million to $250 million. We expected adjusted earnings per share will be higher in the second half of 2014 as compared to the first half. Recent spot currency exchange rates are already broadly consistent with what we expect for the full year and the benefits of price increases, our growth initiatives and our cost savings program will layer in as the year progresses. Finally, we will continue to focus on cash generation and capital allocation in 2014. Cash provided by operations should increase nicely year-on-year driven by earnings growth and lower restructuring payments and we\u2019ll allocate about $2.5 billion to dividends and share repurchases, which represents a cash return of about 6% based on our current market capitalization.","So to summarize, our financial performance was excellent in 2013. Our business fundamentals are healthy and improving and we are optimistic about our plans for 2014 and the opportunities that we have to deliver attractive returns to our shareholders.","So that wraps up our prepared remarks. And now we will begin to take your questions.","","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, at this time the floor is now open for your questions. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Ali Dibadj with Sanford Bernstein.","","Ali Dibadj - Sanford Bernstein","Hi guys.","","Tom Falk","Good morning Ali.","","Ali Dibadj - Sanford Bernstein","Hey, a few things to think about. One is in terms of competition, we heard for example from K-C de Mexico yesterday and actually (indiscernible) again we have had increased competition in Mexico. We are hearing hopefully hang on re-launch more directly with (indiscernible) on the horizon. Can you give us a sense of the competitive situation right now and what you anticipate both in personal care and consumer tissue and if there are any particular hotspots to think about what it was?","","Tom Falk","That\u2019s a fair question. Yes, I think that there is everyday somebody gets up and wants to eat our launch, Ali. So we know we have to be moving pretty fast on innovation and cost savings and other things to continue to deliver the kind of results that we posted this year. And Mark and I were just in Mexico on Tuesday and spent some time with Pablo and the team down there. And it was a tough competitive quarter, lot of price investment that didn\u2019t yield a lot of volume improvement for anybody. And so I think they will have a challenging start to 2014, but they have got a lot of innovation coming. And then in the end, that\u2019s what usually drives on that front. Globally, from the competitive standpoint in personal care, we probably look at Unicharm as one that\u2019s more aggressive in moving outside of Japan into other markets. We know that they are going to be launching some new products in Brazil. We believe they are and we\u2019re preparing for that with a lot of innovation and a lot of improvement in our business there to be ready for their launch. So that\u2019s one that we watch as probably Unicharm and lots of places and they tend to play more in the premium end of the category where we tend to play as well.","China has gotten more competitive broadly it's not just hang on; I mean I would say in the Personal Care space. Procter is aggressive, Unicharm is aggressive, Kao is in there through ecomm [ph]. So it's a relatively growing market and we\u2019re doing pretty well over there but we know we got to continue to drive innovating in China to make sure we keep the momentum that we have got on that front.","Broadly in the U.S. that would be the typical player so Procter would be one that we would see but on the other hand you got Energizer just bought J&J\u2019s Fem Care business and so we\u2019re watching to see what happens as they observe that and do some things to change the trajectory if that does. So lots of competition in Personal Care and I would say we feel like we have got good innovation coming to weather the storm. On the tissue front we have a lot of regional competitors as well. The FCA Vinda deal in China we\u2019re not a big tissue player in China so that one is really not one that I worry too much about. CMPC, a Chilean Company is big in tissue in Chile in the Southern Cone but they are growing out of the Southern Cone and doing some things in Brazil. They are part of the challenge that we see in Mexico and we watch those guys pretty closely as well.","In North America you know it's us, Procter and GP and private label and private label is probably the most aggressive competitor. Last GP had some challenges early in the year which clearly benefited our start to 2013 in the North American tissue category and they are now back in normal supply and so we won't have that tailwind and they will be a tougher competitor going into the year but we have gotten, again got a lot of good things happening with improvements on Cottonelle. Some big news on Viva on a stronger Kleenex line-up again. So maybe more than you\u2019re looking for Ali but lots going on competitively around the world.","","Ali Dibadj - Sanford Bernstein","No some more is good and if you bring it all together and can you elaborate [ph] on the stuff that we\u2019ve been hearing. It doesn\u2019t like that things are getting easier for competitor perspective and if you would kind of say yes or no to that and how do you, are you modeling that in terms of how you think about 2014 that things aren\u2019t going necessarily get easier or you\u2019re in fact modeling some anticipation of competitive fervor.","","Tom Falk","No I mean like I said two things one is we have a really strong innovation lineup coming so that makes me feel pretty good about how we will fair versus competition. We\u2019re actually seeing some of the currency movement in some places, some competitors taking price up in some markets which that\u2019s also things that typically happen on a normal competitive cycle. So that would be a positive. On the other hand we know we have got lots of good companies that would like to take some of our market share and so we\u2019re not going to give that up easily and we\u2019re going to be competitive and make sure we get at least our fair share of the growth on these markets and to answer your question directly I mean I would say this is not that different from what you normally see in the competitive environment, maybe a little bit more intense with a few more global players coming at you but I would say I\u2019ve also seen more aggressive periods in my career. So it's not out of the line of reason here.","","Ali Dibadj - Sanford Bernstein","So one thing that is different and you guys reported and gave your commodity guidance and swift [ph] from NBSK to eucalyptus in your explicit guidance and can you help us think through that. Is that something you guys are equally capable of doing, is the range given on eucalyptus taking into account some of the increases we have seen in Latin America and Spain in December and January and where do you think that trajectory is? So just a little bit more about that particular commodity, does it change things competitive with you?","","Tom Falk","We have been doing this internally for a while because Northern Softwood has not been, has been a shrinking part of our fiber mix for many years and now eucalyptus is the largest single grade that we buy and so we actually thought it will be better disclose before investors and now that that information is a little bit more readily available or Northern Softwood was kind of the benchmark that everyone tracked and so we track both internally obviously but eucalyptus is probably the one that\u2019s a bigger driver and it's going to have more of an impact as you try to model our cost going forward and so we\u2019re calling it in the 800 to 830 range. It's that 860 right now so we would say yeah we\u2019re going to have a little bit of headwind in the start of the year but our guys look at the Reese [ph] forecast and think they have got it right, but you will see weaken a little bit later in the year and we will see what happens. Obviously, currency can have a role to play there if the Brazilian real goes south in a hurry, you may not see as much downside there, but we will see what happens.","","Ali Dibadj - Sanford Bernstein","Thanks very much.","","Operator","Our next question comes from Gail Glazerman with UBS.","","Gail Glazerman - UBS","Hi, good morning.","","Tom Falk","Good morning Gail.","","Gail Glazerman - UBS","Maybe just sticking on pulp for a minute, do you have opportunities if the new capacity really pressures hardwood a lot to increase the share of eucalyptus that you are using or you view it pretty much there like what you can?","","Tom Falk","We have been slowly increasing them. And this is probably more a detail than you want, but two grades of fiber perform a different role in the make the tissue. So northern softwood actually provides strength and eucalyptus provides softness. And so we have been trying to do a better job of making tissue strong while using more eucalyptus to make it even softer. And so that\u2019s more of the reason why we shifted. It\u2019s been of a price fiber driven grade. It\u2019s more \u2013 we are trying to deliver soft tissue and still deliver enough strength, so that it performs well. And so that\u2019s more of the function than anything else. We keep driving it that way. And there is a limit as to how far you can go at some point. You will have to have some string fiber in the mix.","","Gail Glazerman - UBS","Okay. And I appreciate the comments on the competitive environment that maybe just taking a step up, could you give some comments in terms of what you are seeing and in terms of just underlying demand in some of your core markets? Are you any more optimistic about changes in China? And are you finally seeing signs of the churn in birth rates in the U.S.?","","Tom Falk","I\u2019d say, in China, we have the drag in year babies that all were born. And that probably boosted the category, the last 12 to 18 months or so, that because trainees train their babies quicker than they do in the U.S. that will roll off. So the category growth in \u201814 probably won\u2019t be as robust, but we got a lot of innovation coming. We still got a lot of category penetration opportunity and we will be expanding our geography. And so as a 35% growth that we had on average last year in China and we slowed down in the fourth quarter, I think it was low 20s. And so you will probably model a slightly lower growth rate in China, but still pretty healthy relative to everywhere else in the world. In the U.S., the birth rate has been pretty stable, I mean, it\u2019s not getting worse, it\u2019s not getting usually better. So we are still right around 1.7, 1.8ish kind of a rate and we are not seeing much on the consumer confidence front that\u2019s pushing it hard. I think we talked in the past, it\u2019s a bit related to consumer confidence and employment levels and those are getting slightly more positive, but not enough that we are seeing it drive the growth rate significantly.","","Gail Glazerman - UBS","Okay. And can you just, I guess, you mentioned negative pricing in the personal care segment in the U.S., can you just talk a little bit about what was driving that?","","Tom Falk","Yes, we did kind of a switch in the marketing mix a bit in the quarter. We started this really in the second half, where we essentially shifted some money from couponing the trade. We wanted to be bit more competitive on shelf every day. And so you saw a negative price, but then you also saw positives in between the lines on strategic marketing and so really that\u2019s more couponing related. We spent about the same level of advertising broadly across the company for the year. I think advertising spend as a percent of sales was down 10 basis points, some of that was productivity related, where we did better on immediate buying. But in the fourth quarter on baby child care, it was more of a switch from consumer promotion to trade and we saw that in kind of mid-single digit volume growth for Huggies.","","Gail Glazerman - UBS","Okay. And just last question, consumer tissue has pretty robust earnings in the quarter, and I am just wondering what you attribute that to as there was some reference to lower spending in that category, was that the big driver, was it the price benefit from the de-sheeting?","","Tom Falk","So I mean it was pretty good de-sheeting benefits that flowed through. And so that way we show that it shows a negative volume and positive price and that was part of it, but good cost savings broadly. And so I think that was solid quarter. And again, we are encourage by the progress we have made in consumer tissue over the last several years of consistent margin improvement to get it back to kind of the mid-teens levels.","","Gail Glazerman - UBS","Okay, thank you.","","Tom Falk","Thanks Gail.","","Operator","Our next question comes from Javier Escalante with Consumer Edge Research.","","Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research","Hi good morning everyone. I have a question actually you alluded earlier with Ali, but will like to have kind of like a little bit more color on the U.S. When you look at\u2026","","Tom Falk","I gave Ali all the color I have.","","Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research","Yeah let\u2019s see if you can give me a little bit of more contrast. Is it specific with the private label growth the volume growth that at least we see in the mid-teens in track channels, right? And to what extend given that each part of you and Procter and Georgia-Pacific and private label pretty much have the same market share. Is it a concern or not that the growth of the private label would may undermine the pricing architecture of the tissue category to the extent that people are going into private label, into the teens in terms of volume.","","Tom Falk","Yeah I would say private label growth of that level is always a concern. You saw when GP had some of their problems early in the year they actually ceded shelf space to private label and some retailers and so when you get more distribution in a lot of these accounts that directly drives volume and velocity in share and so the good news is that our shares were pretty stable in this environment and but it's also one that you worry about from a category dynamic standpoint and we got to make sure that we\u2019re doing the right job of delivering value with our brands across Cottonelle, and Scott and Viva and Kleenex to make sure that consumers know that we\u2019re going to take good care of them and their family. So we feel pretty good about the momentum that we have got overall with tissue and a lot of good things coming but we\u2019re watching the private label situation carefully.","","Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research","Tom the other question has to do with the change in packaging that my understanding they want to be implementing in diapers in the U.S. My understanding is, is it not that you\u2019re going to be reducing the number of diapers this quarter or have you already done that? What is the initial reaction from the consumer standpoint if you can give us an update on that?","","Tom Falk","Yeah I mean our primary competitor as you probably know did that change in the fourth quarter and it takes a little while to convert your lines over to the new counts and so we will be following that in the first quarter. I think we start shipping those in February and again not much consumer reaction that we can tell in the fourth quarter. Unusually what happens in this kind of process where you do a count reduction you wind up with a small household inventory decline because on average you\u2019re buying fewer diapers and so you typically see a little bit of a category dip for a while but we didn\u2019t actually see that in the fourth quarter. Overall the category was up a little bit more than normal so that\u2019s one thing we will watch as we roll through that in the first quarter.","","Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research","And finally on China, I don\u2019t know whether I missed it or not but it seems like you didn\u2019t mention or at least I didn\u2019t hear it further expansion in Chinese cities, I think that you mentioned the support [ph] that you now have but are you continued taking expansion further into this less developed cities or that is something that is behind you?","","Tom Falk","We\u2019re at about 90 cities now we will be in more than 100 by the end of 2014 and again these are all pretty big cities too. They are all over a million people. So it's a pretty amazing place as I\u2019m sure you know and so there is great expansion coming on these deal so had a big fem care launch in China in the fourth quarter that\u2019s going well and so we will be expanding not just our geographic representation but also building our portfolio beyond the huge healthcare as we have got lots of things we can do in feminine care and ultimately adult care in China.","","Operator","Our next question comes from Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank.","","Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank","Did I hear you say that you reflected some Venezuela impact in guidance? Can you just talk about kind of what you were assumptions were and maybe there is any Argentina impact in there as well?","","Tom Falk","We did reflect some Venezuela income statement impact in guidance. We did not try to predict of what it's deval would be or what happened. We essentially said that something is probably going to happen in Venezuela whether we can\u2019t exchange at the level we got in 2013. If they don\u2019t devalue or if they do devalue we will have a translation hit and it also depends on what happens with price control. So there is a number of different variables and so we assumed we would make less money in Venezuela in 2014 than we did in 2013. We made a little less in 2013 than we did in 2012. So that\u2019s we probably took a little bit of an adjustment for that. And in Argentina, we look at forward exchange rates at the time we have rolled the guidance together and make a guess on where that\u2019s going to go. So we have a prediction of some currency weakening in Argentina. If you look at current spot rates, I don\u2019t know, where they are this morning, but as of yesterday that would be worse than what we have in our guidance, but that\u2019s again a low single-digit percentage of our overall business. And I don\u2019t think we would have any adjustment for that in our outlook at this point in time.","","Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank","Great, thank you so much. And do you think you should have a price down there, because last time we all kind of got hand rung about what\u2019s going to go on in Argentina, Venezuela, it seemed like everybody is kind of priced through it? Is that still an option now or is that kind off the table?","","Tom Falk","Yes. We have an excellent team in Argentina. And if you are able to launch innovation, you are often able to couple pricing with that and that team has been able to pull forward innovation and get some pricing to offset the impact of inflation in that market at least partially and they have also been terrific about making sure their existing tax sizes and then having a relevant offer for the consumer that is a little squeezed on what they are able to spend. So we actually had a pretty good year overall in Argentina and we would obviously like even better margins and like to continue to grow even faster, but in the environment that they are in, they executed at a pretty high level.","","Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank","Great, thanks. And then just to sort of follow-up on the personal care stuff, I mean, the 16.5% operating margin in the quarter, I mean, sort of both neutral, is that kind of the new level of operating margin to the business, because I always thought that personal care should always sort of be structurally higher than personal care, all things being equal on the sort of commodity neutral basis and just tell me if I am wrong there?","","Tom Falk","Yes. I would look more at the full year margins for all of the segments. That was a better precursor. Fourth quarter, you have passive write-offs and other things that you do, trade promotion accrual. So there is couple of things that probably pushed personal care a little lower than the normal average and probably pushed tissue a little higher than the normal average, but that\u2019s why I think the full year number is more representative and then we would look to build from there. I still believe that if you look at 2014, we will have a full year of our exit from Europe, which will be a margin improvement. We have got some price coming in the first quarter in North America, which will help. And so there is a lot of things that would indicate that we should get some margin improvement in personal care off the 2013 average in 2014.","","Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank","Okay. And then just one last quick one from Mark, I mean, how do we think about the spin off now in terms of the dividend that\u2019s coming back to Kimberly, because I know you are only growing the dividend 2% to 4% because of some of the loss cash flow from the healthcare spend, but it was my understanding that there is an option there to put some extra debt on the businesses it\u2019s been, I mean, that might come back in, you could just buyback stock or payout a special dividend. Is that still within your consideration?","","Mark Buthman","Yes, I mean that\u2019s all part of planning, I mean, typically on a spend I think the way we framed our dividend is pretty typical you kind of reorient the new size of your expected balance sheet. And I would expect to capitalize the new company in a way that\u2019s appropriate for its business and it\u2019s not unlikely that you would have a one-time dividend to come back. You think about the way we think about cash flow.","","Tom Falk","That maybe more of accelerated share repurchase.","","Mark Buthman","Yes, yes.","","Tom Falk","I don\u2019t think we are going to do a special dividend, Bill.","","Mark Buthman","No.","","Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank","Okay, got you. But you are going to use the money to give it back to shareholders when it comes back in, because it seemed like there is a capital requirements or anything?","","Mark Buthman","Yes, absolutely.","","Tom Falk","We don\u2019t keep extra cash on the balance sheet. So we will pay it as we always.","","Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank","Perfect, thanks for your time.","","Tom Falk","Thanks.","","Mark Buthman","Thanks Bill.","","Operator","Your next question comes from Olivia Tong with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to what \u2013 within your 3% to 5% total growth rate for the company that\u2019s planned for 2014, what are your \u2013 what are you expecting for developed versus developing market growth?","","Mark Buthman","It\u2019s similar to where we were this year kind of high single-digit organic growth for K-C International and low single-digit organic growth in North America as you look at what\u2019s going on in that front. So and Europe would be relatively flat, maybe a little bit \u2013 maybe similar to North America.","","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. And then on gross margin, you posted solid gross margin improvement this year despite obviously some raw material and FX headwinds, so with that backdrop, can you give some color on where you think the opportunity is for gross margin, not just for 2014, but also long-term and how does it breakout between savings and leverage versus mix from both the category and geographic perspective?","","Tom Falk","Yes, I mean I think lot of levers that we are looking at for gross margin. Innovation and mix are two at the top-line level that are really rich opportunities for us as we continue to grow personal care, as we continue to grow into higher margin segments things like in the adult care space, baby wipes et cetera. Those can provide a nice uplift to gross margin. On the cost savings front and again next year it will be a second year in a row that we\u2019re in the 300 million plus range and ahead of inflation so that\u2019s another boast from a gross margin standpoint. We\u2019re still getting very good productivity growth, we\u2019re still rolling at our global procurement capability. We\u2019re still working on specification changes to make sure we\u2019re getting good value for all the components that go into the product and all those things should drive a robust cost savings culture going forward and so we\u2019re pretty encouraged that we can continue to deliver that. There is a little bit of a drag from geographic mix as K-C International\u2019s gross margins are on average lower than North America but if you look last year overall I think on the operating margin standpoint the K-C International is probably less than a 10 basis point drag. So that really wasn\u2019t the big negative force for us overall.","","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And just lastly appreciate the color on first half very second half and fully understand that you don\u2019t provide quarterly guidance but given that you\u2019ve got a pretty tough comp in Q1 with the (indiscernible) comp and then just also disruptions at GP last year that helped you, can you talk a little bit more about the changes [ph] of quarterly earnings for 2014 and do you expect Q1 to post year-over-year EPS growth?","","Tom Falk","Yeah we\u2019re not going to give quarterly earnings guidance as we said so I guess I think from what we told you going in the first quarter we\u2019re going to have some headwinds and some tailwinds. So clearly currency will be a headwind versus last year, pulp cost would be higher in fact higher than our full year average. On the other hand we\u2019re going to get some price in some categories. So we had a very strong start last year and we know it's a tough comp to lap so I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if we were down a little bit in the first quarter but we expect to see again we\u2019re comfortable with the overall guidance for the year and the second half will probably be a little bit better than the first half.","","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Ferrara with Wells Fargo.","","Chris Ferrara - Wells Fargo","Can you help I guess reconcile some of the personal care emerging markets growth numbers that you\u2019re seeing with I guess what are the most readily available data points on what market growth rate and Kimberly growth rates. I guess you guys are putting up faster growth numbers in diverse in China and everywhere else and yields since then [ph] and totally appreciating their differences. Can you just kind of help us reconcile that a little bit to sort of you will elevate the concern that there are warehouse is full of diapers back somewhere in China. Can you just kind of address that?","","Tom Falk","Yeah I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s not the case. I\u2019m pretty sure that people don\u2019t want to take positions in high cube items like this but couple of things first of all the international market share data is not as well developed as North America. In North America you have much more coverage and much more scanned outlets and it's still a good part of the emerging markets that is in the traditional trade which is not well covered as really a sample at best. And so we have even seen some disconnect since some markets were, you know Russia we\u2019re up 20% in diapers this year if you looked at it I think the Nielsen surely would say we lost share and yet the category didn\u2019t grow 20%. Category in Russia was probably up 12% and so but they only cover maybe three quarters of the outlets at best and so emerging market it is a little tough to get benchmarks on what\u2019s going on but generally I would say in markets like Russia, China, Brazil we\u2019re growing faster than the category and in China and forget it's a geographic expansion. We continue to drive innovation and grow in multiple tiers. It is a good part of it, but we\u2019re also driving a lot in some of untrack channels. So ecomm [ph] in China for example is a big driver of that category.","In Argentina we are very big in the (indiscernible) which are the small diaper stores and those aren\u2019t really attract Nielsen channel and if you go to Brazil we\u2019re doing well in (indiscernible) and that\u2019s not a channel that\u2019s tracked as readily as some of the modern trade would be and so I don\u2019t worry too much about that but it does making it a little tougher for outsiders to get a good benchmark on that?","Chris Ferrara - Wells Fargo","That\u2019s really helpful. I appreciate it. And I guess just one other on a totally different note, I mean, look you endured years and years of pretty nasty part of the inflation and if we all really moving into a period where that sort of inflation is going to be more benign, I guess one, how does it affect if at all, how you think about managing your business and managing innovation for that matter? And then I guess when you sight innovation and new product development as a way to drive gross margin, because it sounds sort of like structurally from a benchmarking perspective you don\u2019t view your gross margin that is too low for the type of businesses you are in? Is that right? And do you see an opportunity for Kimberly to be significantly higher in gross margin over time, maybe even getting to 40% at some point?","","Tom Falk","Yes. No, I think that Mark and I still have scarred from those commodity battles. So I wouldn\u2019t say that we have totally forgotten what that felt like, but the good news is in past years if you had $250 million of commodity inflation, we were a $100 million to $150 million cost savings kind of company that you wound up with a big problem. Now that we are delivering more consistently on the cost savings front, we are probably feeling a little bit more confident that we can handle some of the swings in commodity costs a bit easier. We are also seeing as you get better innovation, you got more opportunity for pricing power in many of these markets as well. And so that is another lever that we can pull in some markets to be able to offset that. And so given your question on gross margin, absolutely we would love to continue to build gross margin and we do think that gives you the franchise value that drives multiple over time. And it is a metric that we are focused on internally as well as operating margin.","","Chris Ferrara - Wells Fargo","Thank you.","","Tom Falk","Thanks.","","Operator","Our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.","","Lauren Lieberman - Barclays","Thanks. Actually I had wanted to ask about FORCE, that kind of asked question with a perfect lead-in, the acceleration that you are delivering on FORCE savings overall and another big year expected from \u201814, it will be great if you could tell us a little bit about what kinds of new programs or areas you have been kind of driving into to drive these incremental savings and how the numbers are getting bigger and bigger when \u2013 for companies it\u2019s been added for so long if anything you start to \u2013 one would start to worry that it gets tougher to find savings not easier? Thanks.","","Tom Falk","That\u2019s a great question, Lauren. And I think that\u2019s probably a traditional way of thinking about it and we have actually tried to turn that around and really look for all the opportunities or areas we would have and we have still have big gaps within our best performing operations and our weakest performing operations. And that\u2019s goal that we can go turn in the value. We are doing a lot to build capability for around lean continuous improvement across the company. We are doing a much better job of benchmarking and understanding what the drivers are of performance at our best performing units and then transferring those best practices at a faster pace. We talked about global procurement. We are just getting better purchasing capability in market and leveraging the scale of Kimberly-Clark better across the organization. We are doing better in design for values that we are putting the components in the product that the consumer cares about and that drives the performance, but those ones that don\u2019t move the needle there is a way to substitute or use less. So we are getting better at that. And I think the vision that our operators have now is much bigger than it ever was. They have a got a robust pipeline of areas to go look and they are even more confident that we can bring that value to the bottom line. And that\u2019s exciting for us and we also look at other companies out there like Colgate who has been a phenomenal company at this and they are a smaller company than we are. And I think they are delivering $400 million on a smaller cost base than we are. And so while we had ourselves in the back for getting the $300 million, we also know that there is other better benchmarks out there and we shouldn\u2019t be satisfied and that\u2019s the healthy way for us to approach it.","","Lauren Lieberman - Barclays","That\u2019s great. Thank you. And then also the commentary on increasing advertising spending next year granted we would all prefer to see advertising go up than down, but I think that was interesting that, that was, I mean, you specifically mentioned in the release even when this year with advertising dollars flatter, I guess, it was down as a percentage of sales, your sales were so strong. So why the decision to put more money back in? Do you think you really get an incremental lift? Is it just a rising competitive environment or was it a \u2013 we have pretty good visibility on cost savings and like what else should we do with the money?","","Tom Falk","No, really \u2013 it really is more built up from the business unit innovation plans and in terms of looking at what they need to spend. Also looking at that outlook for competitive activity. So we talked a little bit about, we know we got Unicharm coming in Brazil so we have got additional investment there. We\u2019re launching fem care in China so we have got additional investment there and so we really do look at it more strategically around what are our innovation plans, what are our competitive activity that\u2019s planned and build the plan that way. I would say this year we got a little bit more cost savings in the marketing area than we have got in the past. So we did, we turned our purchasing team loose on media buying and we have freed up a lot more money than we had in the plan and that helped our overall cost savings number but it actually instead of showing up in cost of sales and gross margin it showed, some of it showed up in the strategic A&P line and so that helped us basically give more coverage for the same dollars this year.","","Lauren Lieberman - Barclays","And then just finally following up the fem care launch in China. How many cities were you targeting initially? Is the strategic there to do as you have done with diapers like come in at the super premium and then move down market? If you can just tell us a little bit more that would be great.","","Tom Falk","Yeah we have been in China in fem care for a long, long time. It's really a relaunch, we have had some different brands that we got with acquisition and so it's really relaunching around the kind of the U by Kotex portfolio aimed at more up market, young at least that we call her and so it was really a major relaunch in the fourth quarter and yes it will be very similar to diapers where we start in a smaller geographic region that we can support, build momentum and then begin to roll it across the markets. Obviously we\u2019re having the success we have had in diapers you create great credibility for our sales team on the street as they come in with a new item in China.","","Operator","Our next question comes from Caroline Levy with CLSA.","","Caroline Levy \u2013 CLSA","Couple of short term ones and then a longer term one. In December P&G called up that their business had strengthened across categories and across geographies in December relative to October, November, did you see that?","","Tom Falk","Yeah I mean I probably would say we saw that in some markets. Are you talking about in the U.S. or anywhere else particularly?","","Caroline Levy - CLSA","I thought, assuming it was a global comment.","","Tom Falk","Yeah I don\u2019t, I was listening to their call this morning. I was getting ready for this one. I will read their transcript a little later but I looked in our categories, our organic was probably a bit stronger than theirs but again I probably would tell I didn\u2019t dive into their numbers as deeply yet as you may have.","","Mark Buthman","I would say Caroline that our December we typically finished the year strong. I would say this year was similar.","","Caroline Levy - CLSA","Okay. And then if you could just tell us a little bit about why Mexico was weak? I didn\u2019t get a chance to listen to the generally the Mexico call yet.","","Tom Falk","There was a lot of competitive price investment in Mexico in the fourth quarter including by us and it did not move incremental volume as much as hoped for and so that led to basically I think sales were down 7% in the quarter, 6% organic something like that. Most of that was price loss and so that was a tougher comparison. Overall Mexico had a pretty good year but they had a weaker finish to the year and they will probably have a tough start in the first quarter but as I said Mark and I were just down, they have got an aggressive plan for 2014 and that\u2019s been a high performing team and a great operation for several years and I\u2019m sure they will get it sorted.","","Caroline Levy - CLSA","All right and then moving to China if you\u2019ve the fem care launch and yet your volume growth slowed to about 20% in the quarter. You have been, I don\u2019t know maybe that was just the diaper growth slowed to 20% in the quarter but do you think the base is such now that we should be looking more at low double digit growth going forward? I mean do you sense the competition really coming at you more aggressively in the Mummy [ph] stores and online where you used to have some big wins.","","Tom Falk","The question on diaper growth, my comments for about growth in the quarter so we averaged 35% for the year. We have been in the 40s for the first three quarters. We were at 22 in the fourth quarter and so fem care was in launch for part of the fourth quarter. So I think we had a double-digit growth in fem care, but it was lower than that number. And we would expect that to kind of build in the first quarter. It\u2019s a little smaller business than the diaper business. So it won\u2019t have as big of an impact. China overall is a competitive market, it\u2019s been a competitive market for a long time. And so there is a lot of every CPG in the world is over there trying to build with our brand for the future. And so we feel like we are holding our own and we are definitely in the game, but we know Unicharm and Procter and Kao and Hengan and SCA and everybody else wants to play over there. So we have got to deliver good innovation and good value to the consumer to make \u2013 to be able to win there long-term.","","Caroline Levy \u2013 CLSA","Thank you. And then just follow-on from that is really if you were to try to size up the 2020 opportunity of China, Brazil, Russia, if you think about the upside from per cap consumption growth and\/or wealth creation or how do you look at it? Which do you think will be the best growth market through 2020 for you?","","Tom Falk","China. We are already more developed in Brazil and we have consumers probably a bit more developed support a middle class, but there is so much opportunity in China just because of population that I would say of those three choices that China will be the biggest growth driver. I would expect the others to also be significant growers, but if you would force me to pick one I would say China is going to be the biggest business of the three by 2020.","","Caroline Levy \u2013 CLSA","Right. And it seems to me that some of the increased competition will help drive usage, because that the usage is still quite low in China right?","","Tom Falk","Yes, absolutely. I mean, one of the \u2013 you never like to have more competition, I guess, but it does to help penetrate categories if you got a lot of people making noise about the product.","","Caroline Levy \u2013 CLSA","Right, thank you very much.","","Tom Falk","Thanks, Caroline.","","Operator","Your next question comes from Chip Dillon with Vertical Research Partners.","","Tom Falk","Hi Chip.","","Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners","Good morning. Can you hear me?","","Tom Falk","Yes, I can hear you now.","","Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners","Great, terrific. Thank you. The first question is just if you could update us with the moving parts with the tissue moves in Europe, where do you stand in terms of your sort of pulp purchases if you could split it in the three buckets, the hardwood which I assume is almost all eucalyptus and then softwood for tissue and fluff?","","Tom Falk","In Europe, we are not buying a ton of fluff. We are buying a little bit, because we still are making some pant type products. So the biggest grade by far that we buy in Europe would be eucalyptus for the consumer tissue business.","","Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners","And I am sorry, Tom, I was looking more for the global overall given that change over the year what is your overall purchases as a company?","","Tom Falk","Yes, Paul can give you the details.","","Paul Alexander","Sure. We still consume about 2.4 million metric tons of virgin fiber about half would be eucalyptus\/hardwood and the other half would be split pretty evenly between fluff pulp and northern softwood.","","Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners","Got you, got you. Okay, thank you. And Tom looking I know you have \u2013 a couple of questions have been asked, but I just was noticing last year on the FORCE savings, I think you guys were looking for 250 to 300 and on my numbers you were like 320, so I mean you have beaten your midpoint by almost $50 million and I don\u2019t know if there is \u2013 if there are one or two specific areas you can point to and then will those areas be different in 2014 where you expect to get the bulk of your savings?","","Tom Falk","Yes, I mean if you are adding in some of the tissue restructuring settings, just you might have gotten up to a number that high, but we try to break those out separately and not that will come in, but the three buckets that we focus on are negotiated material or negotiated purchases savings or procurement group productivity, so how do we drive lean and lower ways higher uptime and so all of our operations have clear metrics on those. And then material specification changes, so how do we do a better job of designing for value and all three of those buckets contributed pretty evenly. I mean I think negotiated material savings was probably $90 million of the $300 million and change and so and the other two were over $100 million each and so we would expect those to continue to be strong in 2014.","","Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners","Got you. And then I guess the last question is on when you look at the \u2013 your forecast for \u201814 and some of the components, it looks like at least on the numbers we saw a couple of weeks ago that your expectation for eucalyptus in the U.S. is about $50 a ton less than where it was at least it is this month and so that\u2019s pretty healthy decline. Are you looking for similar declines in, a similar decline in either fluff and\/or softwood?","","Tom Falk","Northern Softwood, we\u2019re basically using the risky forecast so I think we\u2019re in the 9.50 to 9.75 range and it should be not as big of a drop as EUC [ph] and that\u2019s driven by more the capacity the capacity that\u2019s expected to come from a EUC [ph] standpoint but I think fluff would be similar to Northern Softwood but that grade isn't going to be as affected by capacity additions.","","Operator","Our next question comes from Connie Maneaty with BMO Capital.","","Connie Maneaty - BMO Capital","I was just wondering when you might have the spin-off financials ready. I think you talked about that on the last call and secondly what was the order of magnitude impact on EPS from your Venezuela assumptions? Thanks.","","Tom Falk","In the spin financials we will probably file the Form 10 Mark in early April I think, is that the plan? On Venezuela we essentially it's similar to our guidance last year, we gave a cut from what we earned this year. I don\u2019t know Mark if you\u2019ve got rough ball park? It's probably about a point of earnings growth adjusted in a ball park.","","Mark Buthman","That\u2019s in the ball park in that overall term.","","Operator","At this time we have no other further questioners in the conference.","","Paul Alexander","Great. Well we appreciate everybody\u2019s questions today and we will wrap up with a quick comment from Tom.","","Tom Falk","So once again we appreciate your support to Kimberly-Clark.

Alexander - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Kimberly-Clark's Second Quarter Earnings Conference call. Here with us today are Tom Falk, Chairman and CEO; Maria Henry, CFO; and Mike Azbell, VP and Controller.","Now here's the agenda for the call. Maria will begin with a review of second quarter results. Tom will then provide his perspectives on our results and the outlook for the full year. We'll finish with Q&A. As usual, we have a presentation of today's materials in the Investors section of our website. As a reminder, we will be making forward-looking statements today.","Please see the Risk Factors section of our latest Annual Report on Form 10-K for a further discussion of forward-looking statements. We'll also be referring to adjusted results and outlook, both exclude certain items described in this morning's news release. The release has further information about these adjustments and reconciliations to comparable GAAP financial measures.","And now, I'll turn it over to Maria.","Maria Henry - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thanks, Paul. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining our call today. Let me start off with the headlines for the quarter. Organic sales were up 3% with volume growth of 4%. We achieved significant cost savings, improved our margins and grew adjusted earnings per share. And we also increased cash flow, improved our capital efficiency and return cash to shareholders.","Now let's cover the details starting with sales. Our second quarter net sales were $4.6 billion. That's down 1% with a 4-point drag from currency rates. Organic sales rose 3% in the quarter. That included a 7% volume increase in North American consumer products and 5% organic growth in developing and emerging markets. Tom is going to provide some more color on our top line in just a few moments.","On profitability, second quarter adjusted gross margin was 36.3%, up 50 basis points compared to the prior year. Adjusted operating margin was 18%. That's up 100 basis points. Our teams continue to deliver significant cost savings in order to improve profitability and fund growth investments on our brands. Second quarter FORCE cost savings were $95 million. We have had strong performance on cost savings in the first half and we're now targeting $350 million to $400 million in FORCE cost savings for the full year.","In addition, our organization restructuring remains on track and generated $15 million of savings in the quarter. Commodities continued to be favorable, delivering $20 million of benefit, mostly from lower fiber costs. We expect full year deflation of $25 million to $125 million, which is broadly in line with our previous assumption.","While currencies have improved since January, they remain a significant headwind year-over-year. The total earnings drag from currency was more than $0.15 per share in the second quarter, and we now expect the full-year drag on EPS to be at least 10%.","On the bottom line, second quarter adjusted earnings per share were $1.53, up 9% year-on-year. A lower adjusted effective tax rate contributed about 5 points of that earnings growth. We expect the tax rate will be significantly higher in the second half of the year compared to the first half of the year.","Moving on to cash flow and capital efficiency. Cash provided by operations in the second quarter was strong at $860 million. That's up 11% year-on-year. On adjusted return on invested capital halfway through the year, we're up 100 basis points. So, we're on track to easily exceed our long-term goal of 20 basis points to 40 basis points of annual improvement. On capital allocation, second quarter dividend payments and share repurchases totaled nearly $0.5 billion. The full-year amount should be between $2 billion and $2.1 billion. This will be the sixth consecutive year that dividends and share repurchases will total at least $2 billion.","Looking at the segment results. In Personal Care, organic sales rose 5%. That included 6% growth in developing and emerging markets and 4% improvement in North America. Overall, Personal Care operating margins were healthy at 20%, although off 50 basis points year-on-year including significant currency headwinds.","Moving on to Consumer Tissue. Organic sales were up 2%, led by 4% growth in North America. Consumer Tissue operating margins of 18.4% were up 110 basis points with the benefit of organic sales growth, cost savings and lower input costs.","In our third segment, K-C Professional, organic sales were up slightly, including 6% growth in developing and emerging markets. Lower sales of nonwovens to Halyard Health reduced the segment top line by more than 1-point. K-C Professional operating margins were 18.6%. That's up 100 basis points year-on-year driven by cost savings.","Before wrapping up, let me recap. We achieved growth in organic sales and adjusted earnings per share, we delivered significant cost savings, margin improvements and cash flow. And we continued to improve our balance sheet efficiency and allocate capital in shareholder-friendly ways.","I'll now turn the call over to Tom.","Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Maria, good morning, everyone. I'll share my perspectives on our second quarter results and then I'll comment on our full-year outlook.","So overall, we continue to deliver good financial results and we're executing well in a challenging environment. Starting with the second quarter, as Maria mentioned, our organic sales increased by 3%. We made progress on targeted growth initiatives and product innovations, and that helped us achieve volume growth of 4%. In our developing and emerging markets, organic sales were up 5%.","Let me comment specifically on some of our key growth markets. In Brazil, organic sales in Personal Care rose about 10% with both selling prices and volumes up year-on-year. While underlying category demand remains down in a tough economic environment, I'm encouraged by our second quarter results following a soft start to the year in the first quarter.","Moving to China, our diaper volumes there continue to grow at strong double-digit rates in the quarter and our market positions remained healthy. Nonetheless, because of increased price competition, our organic sales fell high single-digits and that compared to a 30% growth comp last year. Competitive activity picked up during the quarter in China and we responded to protect our market share position and maintain our volume momentum. So I'm very bullish about our business in China. While the current pricing environment is dynamic, we have plans to continue to deliver strong volume growth with benefits from innovation, city expansion and category growth.","Moving to Eastern Europe, organic sales in diapers there rose more than 15%. Volumes were up at a double-digit rate led by Huggies in Russia. Selling prices were also up modestly as we've now lapped most of the increases that we took last year. Elsewhere in developing and emerging markets, our feminine care organic sales were up double-digits in the quarter, including strong performances in Latin America, and adult care organic sales were up high single-digits. For the full year, we're now targeting mid-single digit organic sales growth for our developing and emerging markets business. We've lowered our expectations for selling price increases, primarily due to an improved currency outlook in Latin America and Eastern Europe. We have also taken into account the dynamics in China and slowing economies in some parts of the world.","I continue to be optimistic about our business in developing and emerging markets. Our market positions are generally improving, or holding steady in most of the key markets we compete in, and we've got lots of innovation coming to help drive our future growth.","Now let's turn to our North American consumer businesses. Our teams there delivered another strong quarter with 7% volume growth and healthy market shares. Product innovations, great marketing programs and good retail execution continues to drive results across our portfolio. Promotion activity was also a little higher than average in the second quarter.","Our adult care, child care and feminine care volumes each increased by about 10% including benefits from innovations on Poise and Depend, Pull-Ups and U by Kotex. Our Huggies diaper volumes rose mid-single digits and market shares improved by about a point as we continue to make progress following last year's Snug & Dry relaunch. Consumer Tissue volumes improved 6% with mid-to-high single-digit growth in the all categories led by Kleenex facial tissue.","So overall, our brand positions are very healthy in North America. Through the first half of the year, market shares improved or were even with prior-year levels in seven of the eight consumer products categories in which we compete. So our volume comparisons will be more difficult in the back half of the year, but I'm encouraged by our execution and our momentum in North America.","Moving beyond sales, I'm also encouraged that our teams around the world continue to manage our company with financial discipline. At this point in the year, our FORCE cost savings are tracking to an all-time high. Our adjusted operating margins and return on invested capital are both up 100 basis points, and cash flow has picked up significantly. And Maria has already highlighted our shareholder-friendly capital allocation. So these results demonstrate to me the continued strength of our business. So all-in-all, we've made progress in several areas in the first half of the year. While we've got opportunities to improve further, we're broadly on track with our plans for 2016.","Now let's move to our outlook for the full year. On the top line, we expect that currencies will reduce sales by 4% to 5%. Our prior assumption was for a negative impact toward the low end of the 5% to 6% range. In terms of organic sales, we expect growth will be at the low end of our 3% to 5% target range. This assumes less benefits from selling price increases, primarily due to the improved currency outlook. Volume growth, which was 3% in the first half of the year, should drive the vast majority of our organic sales growth for the full year.","On the bottom line, we continue to target adjusted earnings per share in a range of $5.95 to $6.15. That's up 3% to 7% year-on-year despite an expected high-single digit drag from the combined impact of changes in currencies, commodities and selling prices. Through six months we're on track relative to our full year earnings impact. That said, as Maria mentioned, the tax rate should be higher sequentially in the back half. We also continue to closely watch currency and commodity markets, competitive activity and economic conditions.","So in summary, we continue to execute our global business plan strategies well. We expect to deliver on our financial targets again this year, and we're optimistic about our prospects to continue to generate attractive long-term shareholder returns.","That wraps up our prepared remarks, and now we'll begin to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from Ali Dibadj with Bernstein.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hey, guys.","Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Ali.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hey. I wanted to spend a little bit of time just on your top line and the guidance. You decided not to change the guidance. You just kind of pushed people to the lower end, but even to get to the lower end, one would have to expect a little bit of an acceleration going forward, especially because the comp gets a little bit tougher with the 5% organic sales growth. So I'm struggling again to figure out what exactly is going to get better that you anticipate to get to even the low end. I guess you could round there, but just really to get to the low end, feels like a little bit of a stretch given the comps that you have. So a little bit more detail there would be helpful to start.","Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I think, to your point, the volume comps get tougher, but some of the pricing comps get easier in the back half. So some of the Chinese activity that we talked about, that started to accelerate in the back half of last year. And so we'll see that sort of bleed-off. And we've got a lot of innovation coming in the back half and we feel pretty good about the volume momentum in a lot of places, including North America.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","So just go back to China in particular, recently you've been saying Brazil you expect a little bit of a bounce back, China still kind of being tough. Can you update us on those two markets in particular, because those seem to be a little bit of a fulcrum for your top line guidance going forward?","Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I mean, I think Brazil, if you look at it how the year has played out, it was a pretty start tough to the year with negative volume trends as we pushed pricing into the market. Second quarter the volume was positive in diapers and then a significant amount of price. We'd expect to see more volume in the back half, and so I'd say on \u2013 if you look at share positions in Brazil, we're up a couple points in fem care and have a good momentum there, and are down about 0.5 point in diapers and would be looking to close that gap in the back half of the year.","In China, we're really expecting the birth rate to pick up as we'd expect to see a little bit more volume come there in the back half. Pricing has been more competitive than we'd anticipated, and we're expecting it's going to continue to be competitive in the back half of the year. And that's probably one of the shifts in our thinking from the first quarter when we talked last.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","So on that, I mean, there's kind of a recurring theme throughout the release in your commentary about product mix being tough. I think it's the first time in many quarters that we've seen that promo being somewhat unfavorable in lots of regions. How much of that is centralized on China? It certainly doesn't seem that way. It feels like it's across the board. And how much of that I guess is consumers trading down versus competitive situation? And why do you think that gets better? Thanks.","Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I mean, a lot of the negative mix in the quarter was actually in North America and it has a lot to do with large-count packs. And timing of promotional activity in some of the larger format retail was probably the biggest single driver of that, and that had more to do with, did we promote in the second quarter versus the first quarter or the third quarter last year, and we had a little heavier activity this year in the second quarter, and that's probably a part of it.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks very much.","Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Ali.","Paul J. Alexander - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, Ali.","Operator","Our next question comes from Wendy Nicholson with Citigroup.","Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Wendy.","Wendy C. Nicholson - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hi. Good morning. Can you talk a little bit more about China? And I guess my question is maybe bigger picture. It seems like in baby care, there's been tremendous downward pressure on pricing and lower price competition. But from other companies, we hear the opposite; that consumers are appealing to more premium-priced products. What's the difference with baby care? Do you think it lasts? Do you think there's something just structurally about the economics of the category that will keep it a category that's subject to consumers trading down as opposed to up?","Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I mean, actually the consumers are trading up in terms of product format. So if you look at the Tier-5 super-premium type products, those segments are still growing. And so the issue is you've got \u2013 it's one of the largest diaper markets in the world. It's probably one of the fastest-growing diaper markets in the world on unit volume, and so you've got us and a couple of big Japanese players and P&G all competing in that same space. And I know everybody thinks the other guy started the fight, but it's gotten more price competitive. And there's also a channel issue whereas we're \u2013 e-commerce is growing dramatically in that space and retailers are also trying to make sure they don't lose their share of that young family's market basket. And so there's a lot of competition and promotional activity and the manufacturers like us are certainly fully participating.","Wendy C. Nicholson - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","But I'm trying to think of in the past in any other market where you've had so many players all trying to eke out their share of the market, and granted, the market is growing and that's great, but I'm just struggling to say why is it ever going to get any better from a pricing perspective now that you've had a whole bunch of companies invest in the market, et cetera, et cetera. I don't see what breaks the logjam, if you will.","Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, we say in the short-term, we're not projecting it's going to get better. I mean, our comps get easier because some of this started in the fourth quarter of last year. You can also see some of the \u2013 as the yen has strengthened, you would think that there's more pressure being put on some of the other international competitors that import. But I'd say in the short-term, we'd expect that China is going to be a pretty competitive market. It's more competitive than we anticipated. On the other hand, we've generated innovation and cost savings and our gross margins there are still attractive, and we think the growth is still a place that is worth investing in.","Wendy C. Nicholson - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Got it. And then just a quick follow up. I noticed, I think that you bought in your joint venture, the 50% you didn't own that Hindustan owned in India. And I know it's a tiny business but I was just curious what drove that decision? Was that them putting their interest to you or did you want to consolidate that interest, and how is that business for you? Thanks.","Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, sure. It's a small deal. And so the deal hasn't happened yet. I think Hindustan was required under local Indian law to announce that they were considering a transaction. It's a business that we like and like most JVs over time eventually one partner buys it up and takes full control of it. I'd expect that's what will happen here. We're bullish on India long-term, and we'll expect that to happen at some point. But it won't have any significant impact on our financials this year for sure.","Wendy C. Nicholson - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Got it. Thanks so much.","Paul J. Alexander - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, Wendy.","Operator","Our next question comes from Keith Powers with UBS.","Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC","Steve Powers, but okay. Thanks.","Operator","Sorry.","Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC","So given that the lower organic growth you now expect is attributable to lower pricing given the less adverse FX, does that mean you're now reversing some pricing that you already had in place? Are you adding promo, for example, in China, as you called out? Or is it more you not taking additional planned increases as the year progresses?","Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","It's probably \u2013 is there a D, all of the above, that I could choose on that one? So it really depends on the market. So there'll be place like Russia and Eastern Europe where we put price in place, it's in the first quarter. Some competitors didn't follow, so you spend some of it back competitively on trade. We have rolled back in a couple of markets those price increases, but then you also don't fund your trade temporary price reductions at the same level. So it doesn't have that much sequential \u2013 as much sequential impact on your net price realization. There are other markets where we had more increases planned for the back half of the year that we probably won't go forward with them given that currencies have eased and there's really no economic justification for it, and we don't think it would be likely to be accepted in the marketplace.","Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. That helps. And then I guess in order for things to get better in the back half, given the more adverse volume comparisons you called out, it seems like you're betting a lot on new innovation benefits to carry you through and push that acceleration. Can you help us with where you expect to see the biggest impacts of H2 innovation, whether by geography or category? I'm sure it's broad-based, but just some directional help would be useful.","Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, sure. I mean we've got a lot happening in diaper pants and open diapering in a number of our key markets and that will roll market-by-market in the back half. We've got a pretty good lineup of feminine care product innovation coming across the globe, as well. And so you're seeing that fem care, I think we've had, what, Paul, four, five quarters in a row of double-digit emerging market growth and expect that continue to go. Diaper pants was a strong double-digit growth again in a lot of our key markets and expect that to continue. So good pipeline of activity which is essentially what we've been doing. Expect it to continue going forward","Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And in North America, was the bigger push in Q2 versus H2?","Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, North America had a little easier comps versus last year. I think we were only up 2% in volume last year. We were up 5% in the back half, partly because of the Huggies Snug & Dry relaunch. But we've got really good momentum across the business. Tissue volumes were up 6% and expect to see good momentum as we roll through the back-to-school season with Kleenex and have some good things coming there, as well. In Pull-Ups with a double-digit volume growth was the first time we've seen that in a while, saw a little healthier category dynamics, as well, which is probably good innovation on our front, probably a little healthier consumer on the front, as well, and so we'd like to keep that going","Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC","Yeah, and I'll pass it on after this, but just to clarify. Will it cost you as much in the back half to keep that momentum going? Because the promotion investment in Q2 to get that volume growth was pretty steep","Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","It's a pretty good spend. I would say in a couple of places, it wasn't as much trade funding as it was either FSI coupons or digital coupons in a couple of categories. We also did a few more bonus pack promotions which affect \u2013 that gets shown as a reduction of sales. So you'd see our \u2013 more of that I would say was strategic, designed at driving innovation in specific categories as opposed to broad-scale trade funding that would tend to be viewed as negative price.","Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks so much.","Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","All right. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Iain Simpson with Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale.","Iain E. Simpson - Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale SA (Broker)","Thanks very much, guys. And just a couple of questions from me, just to go back to China. I mean I might have missed something here, but you're saying you've got good double-digit volume growth, but that overall, organic sales growth was kind of down a fair bit in the second quarter. I mean just mathematically, that suggests that you're saying pricing in China that's kind of negative to the order of mid-teens best and potentially worse than that. If you could comment at all on the kind of impact that's having on your gross margin position there, as kind of everyone's got different cost structures, I guess? And then in terms of Brazil, it's \u2013 clearly, you're gaining a lot of share in fem care there. But are you seeing underlying consumer recovery there as well? And should we sort of project that as the run rate for the rest of the year? Any insights would be very welcome. Thank you.","Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. Yeah, on China gross margin, I'd say the team there has done a great job of driving premium mix where we can and taking cost out as well. So our overall K-C International team did a phenomenal job of delivering on their FORCE cost savings, and China certainly was a part of that. And so our Chinese gross margins were down a bit, but nowhere near the level of price change in the market. And so, again, we'd be pretty happy that China's an investable business and with strong gross margin and OP margin potential.","On the Brazilian consumer, you're still seeing some negative category trends, and the economic outlook is still not terrific. Although I was on the phone with our guy who runs Brazil last week, and I think there are some early signs of optimism perhaps there that they're things \u2013 expecting things to be a little bit better in 2017. And so we'll see. I think the economy's run on expectations and, hopefully, the Brazilian consumer will start to be a little bit more optimistic. And we'll see that translate into category growth. But I would expect for 2016, it's still going to be a challenging category story.","Iain E. Simpson - Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale SA (Broker)","Thank you very much.","Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Iain.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jonathan Feeney with Consumer Edge Research.","Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Good morning. Thanks for the question.","Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC","You showed in Q2 your comfortable weighting volume growth over pricing broadly and that's true in China, but as a result for the whole business. And yeah, it starts \u2013 maybe this is hugely counter cultural versus some of your U.S. based peers. So I guess I'm wondering, do you see loyalty and repeat as bigger opportunities in your categories and especially some of those strategic areas you just identified versus what your peers are seeing? Or is there something \u2013 and as going forward, if commodities continue to go from being a tailwind to flat, maybe if they became a little bit more of a headwind, how would you sort of look at that commitment to building loyalty and repeat through maintaining the volume momentum? Thanks very much.","Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, Jonathan, it's kind of a deep philosophical question this morning. But my general approach to this and our general approach to it over the years is to say, you're really trying to develop loyal consumers that have a strong habit of using your brands to care for their families. And so you typically want to drive volume growth at least ahead of or tracking with your category that you're in, so that you're improving your volume market share and the percentage of time she's going to use your product to care for her family.","And many of our products, particularly as you think about things like feminine care or bath tissue or facial tissue, you start using a product and you use it for your entire life if you find a solution that works for you. And so we typically generate price when there's big commodity swings or when there's big currency swings. Other than that, we tend to plan for core volume growth as the lever to drive our business forward. And I don't know enough about my competitors' strategies in-depth to know if that's that different from the way that I think about it, but \u2013 where you can mix through premiumization and through up \u2013 driving the consumer into a better performing product.","That's also an important element of our strategy, but that's really about giving them good value for a product that works better in the end. So, again, I think where we can drive volume, that's I think the healthiest form of organic growth for us and our business model.","Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC","That's real helpful. Thank you.","Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks Jonathan.","Operator","Our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thanks. Good morning.","Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Morning, Lauren.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","I wanted to ask you again about mix in Personal Care emerging markets, because I believe you guys reported that as being negative just 1%, but it's the first time I can recall seeing mix as being a drag. And I mean \u2013 I just scrolled back, it's at least two years, probably longer. So if you could just talk a little bit about what happened there? Is it a timing issue? Something with innovation? But are you seeing any kind of less interest in the more premium end of the categories or is it necessarily trade down?","Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. There's nothing I would call out, but I'll let Paul give you a little bit more color if there's anything else you'd highlight there.","Paul J. Alexander - Vice President-Investor Relations","Yeah. Not real big swings, Lauren, as you mentioned, only down 1%. In a few markets, we actually had really strong growth in diapers in some of our smaller sizes. So, Newborn and then Size 1 and Size 2, which is actually good because we're getting the consumer into the category early on. But those, on average, are a little bit lower price points. So, that's probably the only thing to comment on that really moved the number.","Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. You got more diapers in the bag, and we sell it at the same price so you get negative mix. It's not necessarily trading down.","Paul J. Alexander - Vice President-Investor Relations","Right.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. All right. That's great. Thank you. And then maybe for Maria, sneak attack with a question for Maria, but I wanted to talk a little bit about cost savings that...","Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Maria loves questions, Lauren. Ask her all the questions you want.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","But going back a couple months now, maybe almost a year, Maria, you started talking about opportunities for kind of raising the company's game in terms of annual productivity. So, could you talk about any update to that line of thinking? I know you raised the targets for this year a bit, but just bigger picture, can those annual numbers go higher? And where are you on the process of identifying and starting to institutionalize that thought process?","Maria Henry - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Sure. Our global supply chain team is up and running, and already having an impact on the organization. You see that in our year-to-date performance on FORCE cost savings. If you remember coming into the year, we set a strong expectation for ourselves for 2016. And given the strong performance there, we did raise our outlook for that to $350 million to $400 million. So, we're pleased with that. The add-on benefit that we're getting from the efforts in the global supply chain area are that we're also seeing improvements in inventory, and so we had a very strong cash flow quarter. Our inventory's improved and so, we're seeing good performance across the board.","I continue to be optimistic about what we can do in this area. I think that the numbers that we had talked about are, over the long-term, to get to best-in-class, we'd be at a 4% to 5% cost of sales productivity number on an annual basis, and my outlook there hasn't changed. Now again, that's over the long-term, so I'm still bullish on the long-term and very pleased with the performance this year.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Great. And then just one final thing, sorry, was on advertising spending, just brand investment in the quarter, kind of up, down, flat. Any change to the outlook on spending for the year?","Maria Henry - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. There's really no change in advertising spend on a percent of net sales. What we do see is we do see a shift in some of our categories where we're doing more digital couponing versus advertising. And we're also seeing a stronger shift overall to digital advertising. On certain forms of digital couponing and promotions, they actually are a reduction to net sales. So, there's a little bit of a shift from advertising up to net sales, but in general, we would expect to see our advertising percent to sales be relatively consistent to what you saw last year.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Olivia Tong with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thanks. Just trying...","Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Olivia.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Good morning. How are you?","Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Pretty good.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Good. In terms of the dynamics in D&E in Personal Care, just trying to understand your take, because the mix is down but you attributed to entry earlier into the category, Newborn, Size 1, Size 2, et cetera, which would suggest a positive feeling on the macros, but then also you're saying that the macros are challenging. So, can you just help us understand that a little bit better?","And then in terms of pricing, specifically to North America in Personal Care, how much of this is promotion to support some of the new products that you have versus just normal defense against competition? How long do you expect that promotional activity to stay elevated at those levels?","Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. On the D&E mix question, I'd just say, some of the category fundamentals, things like Brazil, we've talked a little bit about where you're actually seeing category unit volumes decline by a couple of percent. That's probably been worse and stayed worse longer than we would have anticipated in our model for the year. And then you're seeing some other economies that are moving a little slower than would have been expected across Latin America, some parts of Eastern Europe as well are probably not quite as robust as they were in our plan at least going into the year.","Having said that, in markets like China where you're expecting a little strong birth rate this year, a little uptick in the birth rate, we are investing in newborn and early category entrants to make sure we get more than our fair share of the new babies born in some of those key markets. And so you can see a little mix drag from that. It wasn't a big \u2013 a super big impact, but it was big enough to talk about, I guess.","As it shifts to the U.S., we had a lot of good stuff happening with the Pull-Ups relaunch continuing through the second quarter, and had strong double digit growth there. Fem care really had a lot of good execution at retail happening, and that was a little bit more promotionally intense, on the other hand, we saw double digit volume growth, which was the first time we've seen that in our fem care business in a while.","Adult care, we haven't lapped the Poise Impressa launch, so some of that was lapping that from last year, but we still had high single digit growth in our adult care business ex-Impressa. And have got more good innovation coming. The comps get a little tougher in the back half, but again a lot of it was some of the bonus pack activity, some of the digital coupon activity, as opposed to more trade funding. If anything, I'd say the trade funding levels were pretty consistent year on year. It was maybe more the other strategic marketing investment that was probably a little elevated this quarter.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","All right. Thanks. That's very helpful. I hate to ask the question, but just given the divergence in trends in Brazil between fem care and diapers, do you think that Zika is playing any part in terms of the diaper demand?","And then just the last question I have is on K-C Pro with volume down in North America, flattish in D&E. Can you talk about your view on these trends because I thought you picked up some share there last quarter, I know part of this reflects the Halyard comp issue, so can you just remind us when that anniversaries, and then your overall thoughts in K-C Pro? Thanks so much.","Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, sure. On the Zika question, we don't really have a good read on that. Again, it's \u2013 we're still in the kind of nine-month gestation period where before you would really I think see any impact from that on the birthrate. And so I don't know if some of the negative category trends we're seeing in Brazil have something to do with the source of the data, our consumers shifting into some less-measured outlets doing more in the down the trade, lower quality products, are some middle class becoming poorer, and not able to afford even the basics. And so I think we're still trying to figure out what's happening with the category. I wouldn't blame much of it on Zika at this stage at least from what we can tell on the data.","On the K-C P question, I would say we were happy with some of the emerging market growth on K-C P kind of mid-single-digit and probably a little slower in some of the developed markets in Europe and North America. The Halyard stuff is kind of burning off. The supply agreement, I think, officially wraps up at the end of this year, and we may continue to supply each other after that at some level, but we'd expected that there was going to be a spike last year and it would probably burn off this year and that's kind of playing out.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks.","Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Olivia.","Operator","Our next question comes from Caroline Levy with CLSA.","Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hello, Caroline.","Caroline Levy - CLSA Americas LLC","Good morning. Hi. It's Caroline Levy with CLSA. But thank you. I just wanted to ask to clarify, in China when you're talking about pricing being down \u2013 high \u2013 call it 15%, whatever it is, roughly around there. That does not include the impact of exchange rates, that's not the dollar number; right?","Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","That's correct. That's correct","Caroline Levy - CLSA Americas LLC","Yeah, I thought so. Thank you. I'm wondering if we could just talk a little bit about Mexico because I think the underlying business in that JV was very strong. What would the equity income have been without the currency translation?","Paul J. Alexander - Vice President-Investor Relations","It would have been up pretty nicely. The peso is down something like 15% year-on-year, so they certainly would have been up.","Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","15%. And they would have had some transactional impact as well, because they buy a lot of their raw materials in dollars, as well. So, no, they had a very solid quarter and good performance in local currency. And given the currency impact didn't translate into as many dollars, but they're still executing well on the local market.","Caroline Levy - CLSA Americas LLC","Got it. Thank you. And then could we talk a little longer term about the adult diaper opportunity and Impressa. What you've learned so far with Impressa? And I think adults is still a relatively small percentage of your volume globally. If we could just talk about that for a few minutes it would be helpful.","Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, sure. The adult care category is probably what, about a billion-dollar category in the U.S., and for us it's a much smaller business outside the U.S. So there's a huge growth opportunity, and there's some international markets where it is, if you looked at Japan for example today, which we don't participate in to any great extent that the adult care category is larger than the diaper category there. And so there's a huge opportunity as the population ages in many parts of the world, and we've got, our adult care business grew high single digits in developing and emerging markets. We also had pretty good performance in Korea. We've got a good adult care business in Australia. So there's pockets where we've seen this start to play out. But we've still got a long way to go to really fully take advantage of the opportunity, I think, and so our teams are focused on getting there as quickly as we can.","In terms of Impressa. Again, I would say, so far so good. It's probably maybe a little slower than expected, but it's also one in a new product form. It's sometimes hard to predict how quickly consumers will change habits. So, so far retailers are happy with the movement and we're continuing to look at generating trial. Our repeat rates are where we would hope for. So now it's really focusing on how do we make sure we're getting trial rates up where we'd like them to be and some of that's retail execution, some of that's making sure we're getting the marketing messaging out. And so our teams are continuing to check and adjust, and continue to drive this exciting opportunity for us.","Caroline Levy - CLSA Americas LLC","Great. Thank you. I have one last question, which is more technical. Just given the strong volume in Personal Care in the second quarter, is some of that going to take away from the third quarter? I know you've said you've got a lot of activity, but should we assume, though, that some of it did shift out of the third quarter?","Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","It shouldn't. I mean, we typically don't load customers, and so our stuff is kind of bulky and expensive to ship and store, and so customers typically want it to flow right to the selling floor. And so we should continue to expect consistent results as we move from quarter to quarter.","Caroline Levy - CLSA Americas LLC","Thank you so much. That's great.","Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Caroline.","Operator","Our next question comes from Erin Lash with Morningstar.","Erin Lash - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","Hi. Thank you for taking my question.","Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","You're welcome.","Erin Lash - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","I just wanted to follow up on the emerging market diaper business, in particular. There's been a lot of discussion this morning in terms of the mix impact and the smaller sized diapers selling better. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about usage trends among those consumers and the extent to which they've maybe increased their usage of daily diaper use and that sort of \u2013 in that context.","Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I would say overall as a general statement, as GDP per capita increases, a consumer's ability to participate in a category increases. So we see diaper rate usage per day go up as they get more income. And so in a market like China, in the higher income households, you'd see diaper usage per day very similar to any other developed market. And in the more rural markets in China where you have very low GDP, you might see consumers that either use no diapers at all or maybe use one a day just for overnight. And so I think that's when you \u2013 as you think about like a market like Brazil, if you've got a middle class consumer who became poor, she may still use diapers for overnight, but she may not use them as frequently during the day. And so I think that's the \u2013 in terms of how the economics of the category play out, that's \u2013 I think that's true across a number of consumer staple spaces.","Erin Lash - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","Thank you. That's very helpful. And then just one last question. In terms of \u2013 I know there's been discussion about the lower or I guess a reduced need to take pricing in emerging markets given what we've seen with FX rates. But I was just wondering if you could kind of talk about the retail reception to some of the price increases that you've already put through, and the extent to which you've maybe received pushback or whether that continues to be more of a seamless endeavor?","Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, Erin, it depends on the geography. I'd say in markets where they have \u2013 where it's pretty common to have big currency swings, if you looked at most \u2013 a number of Latin American markets or Eastern European markets, the retailers are quite understanding of the need for their imported products to \u2013 or products with imported raw materials to take price. I mean, that's kind of the way the market works. And in probably more established markets, if you looked at like Australia and the U.K. and maybe even China, the currencies have been pretty stable and they've had a history of being pretty stable and you don't typically get a big price-driven impact from currency.","For example, the sterling has weakened a bit since the Brexit announcement. I don't think you're going to see a lot of suppliers taking price in the U.K. because A, it wasn't that big of a swing, and B, it's a challenge to push price through with a U.K. retailer, if that color gives you some context for the way you think about it.","Erin Lash - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","Yes. That's very helpful. Thank you so much.","Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Erin.","Paul J. Alexander - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Iain Simpson with Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale.","Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Iain.","Iain E. Simpson - Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale SA (Broker)","Thanks very much for allowing me a follow-up. Hey, I just wondered if we could talk...","Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","We're here all morning, so we just keep taking questions until you guys get done asking them so...","Iain E. Simpson - Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale SA (Broker)","All right. We'll keep going until we get bored. Just on fem care, you guys are doing very well in that category clearly; so is a certain Swedish competitor of yours. I mean, you know, clearly there's got to be some fairly chunky share data that's (46:47) going on in that category. I'm guessing both of your U.S.-based competitors.","I just wondered if you're seeing anything changing in the competitive intensity within fem care markets in which you participate, or if those guys are just kind of happy to sit there and seemingly lose a little bit of share each quarter and not really do much about it? Thanks very much.","Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, fem care is probably one of the more complex competitive sets out there. And so it is a bit more regional. So in the U.S., we would have P&G would be the largest competitor and then the Edgewell spinoff of Energizer, which includes some of the Playtex and former J&J brands would also be a player. And a pretty competitive market, but I'd say pretty normal competitive. And we've been driving innovation. We've been doing a lot with our U by Kotex brand to really make sure we've got the right offer at the right price point and bringing news to the marketplace.","If you go to a market like Brazil, you'll see P&G is there, but you'll also see some other local players. CMPC is there, actually a Chilean player, along with others. And we're the \u2013 we've just recently become the share leader in Brazil and continue to have good momentum there with our Intimus by Kotex brand there.","You go to China, and you've got some of the Japanese players are in that market as well as Hainan, which is a local Chinese company. Hainan is probably the overall share leader in that market, and we're a relatively small player. We're growing nicely, but we're only about a 4% share in China. And so it's really probably one of the most diverse competitive maps. We've got a pretty consistent positioning aimed at a 18- to 24-year-old young woman as she's adopting her brand choice and really trying to drive innovation against that target around the world and have been pretty successful at it. But it \u2013 you do have to adapt it to win in each local market.","Iain E. Simpson - Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale SA (Broker)","Okay. But there's nothing changing in the kind of competitive landscape, and we shouldn't expect any reaction I guess from the kind of pretty impressive share gains that you guys have pumped out for a few quarters now?","Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So far we've got plenty of competition every day. They want to eat our lunch, and we want to get our fair share of the category. And so far we've been holding our own.","Iain E. Simpson - Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale SA (Broker)","Great. Thanks very much, guys.","Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Iain.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ali Dibadj with Bernstein.","Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Ali.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hey, guys. Be careful in offering your time to answer all of our questions. Let me chat about one thing...","Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","At some point you guys will hang up, and it will just be us here.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","So obviously we've been all \u2013 I think with good reason \u2013 asking about this year's 3% to 5% organic sales growth number and can you make the bottom end and kind of what's going to drive that, but I wanted to pull up a little bit and to add to that your view of 3% to 5% target kind of for the long term. We've sort of been started to be accustomed I guess since 2012 with the 4% to 5% type organic sales growth number mostly because of the opening up of the emerging markets for you, but before that it was kind of 3% to 4%, right? And so I think we've all forgotten about that timeframe, and wanted to get a sense from you about whether there's anything that you're seeing that would suggest that we're kind of back about thinking of 3% to 5% as a real range as opposed to it always being at the high end of the range kind of like you're seeing perhaps for his year?","Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, no. That's a really good question, Ali, and I think it's one that we think about a lot. I think we've been at 3% to 5% for a long, long time. If you go back far enough, you're probably right that at various points, we were struggling to get into the low end of the range, and then the last several years with explosion in emerging markets we've been bumping up against the high end of the range.","We've even had some investors suggesting whether we take it up to 4% to 6%, and we said 3% to 5% still feels about the right range long term. You think categories are probably growing 3% to 4% typically if you looked at the kind of long term trend data. So if you deliver that with some innovation and some share growth, you can see your way clear to playing in the full space of that range.","You look at some more recent trends where emerging market economies are under a little bit more pressure like they are today when the categories are going negative in Brazil. That affects that model a little bit, and I still think 3% to 5% is the right range.","And in any given year, we're going to be aiming to be solidly in the middle of that. There will be times where we'll over-deliver either through our good category tailwinds or great execution, and there might be times where we're at the lower end of it because if either one of those things doesn't go the right way.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","And so it's a great \u2013 thank you. The way you're saying category growth 3% to 4% kind of over long term, so you have to gain share to get above that. Obviously given some of the woes of P&G, it feels like it might have been \u2013 and frankly some of the Japanese players being behind the eight ball as well in technology \u2013 it feels like it was recently a relatively \u2013 easy is never the right word, right? But a less contentious time to gain share perhaps?","Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Do we get any credit for good execution, Ali? Or no?","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","No. I want to be careful with that. Absolutely you guys should get full credit on excellent execution, but certainly on a relative basis.","Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Oh, okay. I think I feel better.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","But do you think \u2013 for example P&G is stepping up. Are you seeing any changes there? Do you think the competitive atmosphere gets that much tougher because you do have a big heavyweight who is clearly struggling? And so maybe share gains are tougher going forward? Not that you're executing any worse, but share gains are just tougher going forward. Thanks.","Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I think that's a fair question, and if you looked at China, for example, you'd say we kind of pioneered the super-premium segment five years or six years ago. Lots of other players are piling in there, and they're doing it at maybe narrower premiums than we were initially structuring. And so that's made that segment a little bit more competitive certainly, and the Japanese competitors as well as P&G are playing. We were probably a little bit early at e-commerce and had more than our fair share of that space. Lots of other players are piling in there, and e-commerce is more competitive now than it was several years ago.","So, yeah, it's certainly a competitive environment, especially when categories aren't growing as fast and everybody is still trying to get their volume growth. That makes for a little bit more competitive environment, and so you're probably seeing some of that, I'm sure, in our results.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks very much, guys.","Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","All right. Thanks, Ali.","Operator","Our next question comes from Faiza Alwy with Deutsche Bank.","Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Faiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hello. Good morning. Just had a quick question on North American pricing, because I know you're lapping your pricing, your price cuts. But it looks like P&G is lowering pricing on Luvs now. So just wanted to get your take on how do you see the pricing environment and what your outlook is going forward?","Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I think what we've seen with P&G in the diaper category in North America is, they've probably have been doing a lot of stuff with couponing. They're also spending pretty aggressively on advertising on both Pampers and Luvs. And so it's been a pretty strong competitive response not unanticipated and that may have been why some of our competitive activity was a little higher in the second quarter was making sure we continue to show the value on Huggies. The good news is we still saw mid-single-digit volume gains on Huggies and we're up a share point. So we feel like we're on the right track and anticipate that P&G will continue to be competitive.","Faiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jason English with Goldman Sachs.","Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Jason.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey. Good morning, folks. Thank you for the question. So it sounds like a common theme coming out of the line of questioning and prepared remarks and responses has been that, slower for longer up top is probably the right base case scenario, particularly with the pricing lever out of the equation in the near term. In that context, can we turn into the belly of the P&L and talk a bit more about the cost saves and the inflation\/deflation? This was \u2013 certainly the deflationary benefit has subsided into this quarter following the abatement last quarter, as well. And I think this is the first time in a while that fiber's been the primary driver. So two questions there. First, is it fair to say that the benefits of lower oil derivatives is now behind you? And secondly, what are you seeing in the pulp markets? Because certainly what we're seeing shows a market that's been a bit more stubborn than we would have hoped.","Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, okay. So Maria and I will probably tag team this one. And on the pulp market I'd say our outlook has moderated very modestly quarter to quarter. I think we were looking at $820 to $850 eucalyptus in April, we're $840 to $860 eucalyptus now, so it's slightly worse. Current spot prices are slightly higher than that. We've probably bought a little bit more spot tonnage in some of the Northern softwood area which gives us a little bit more benefit because there has been some good availability at attractive prices there. So, again, I would say not too much change sequentially in our view of the pulp market and we'll see what happens going forward. I don't know, Maria, if you want to comment on any oil-based materials and how you're seeing that.","Maria Henry - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, on the oil-based materials, remember that we're buying oil-based derivatives where, on the polymer front, we were actually seeing inflation versus deflation. So the benefit that you would typically expect for us to get from the lower price of oil isn't as much given the derivatives that we purchased there. I'll follow up just on your line of questioning beyond the commodity situation where we did narrow the range of expectations for the year. I commented on the FORCE cost savings earlier and the fact that we increased our outlook for that in 2016 with good performance there. And then as you go down the P&L, on the cost side we still continue to invest in some areas, particularly selling and research. And we still have some local inflation on our general cost base that you can see come through in the numbers. But overall, we continue to focus aggressively on cost structure and to look to take money out of areas that add less value and to invest in areas that have more value and help us achieve the top line growth.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. That's helpful. One quick follow-up. I'm not trying to push you into any sort of foreshadowing of your guidance for next year, but as you step back and look at your productivity pipeline, how does it look and how are you feeling about cost savings as we go beyond this year?","Maria Henry - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","I don't think we want to get into guidance. As I mentioned, I'm very happy with what the teams are delivering on the FORCE cost savings this year. We are optimistic about what we can achieve in that area over the long-term. We also continue to have a lot of opportunities to invest in our business as well. So we'll have to see how all of that comes together as we close out this year and look at next year.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Very good. Thank you very much.","Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Jason.","Operator","And at this time, we have no other questioners in the queue.","Paul J. Alexander - Vice President-Investor Relations","All right. Well, we will conclude the call. We appreciate all the questions, and we'll let Tom wrap up with a closing comment.","Thomas J.

Alexander - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Kimberly-Clark's Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. With us today are Tom Falk, Chairman and CEO; Maria Henry, CFO; and Mike Azbell, our Controller. Here's the agenda for the call. Maria will begin with a review of third quarter results. Tom will then provide his perspectives on our results and the outlook for the full year. We'll finish as usual with Q&A.","We have a presentation of today's materials in the Investors section of our website. Now, as a reminder, we will be making forward-looking statements this morning. Please see the risk factors section of our latest annual report on Form 10-K for further discussion of forward-looking statements. We'll also be referring to adjusted results and outlook. Both exclude certain items described in this morning's news release. The release has further information about these adjustments and reconciliations to comparable GAAP financial measures.","And now I'll turn it over to Maria.","Maria Henry - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","Thanks, Paul. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining the call today. Let me start with the headlines for the quarter. Organic sales were basically even year-on-year including 3% growth in developing and emerging markets. We achieved significant cost savings and margin improvement, and we increased cash flow, improved capital efficiency and returned cash to shareholders.","Now let's cover the details starting with sales. Our third quarter net sales were $4.6 billion. That's down about 3% including a currency drag of more than 2%. Tom will provide more color on our top line in just a few minutes. On profitability, third quarter adjusted gross margin was 36.4%, up 30 basis points compared to the prior year. Adjusted operating margin was 18.2%. That's up 70 basis points.","I'm encouraged that our teams continue to improve the shape of the P&L even in a tougher environment. Our cost savings initiatives continue to be a key driver of margin improvement. Third quarter FORCE cost savings were $105 million, equal to our previous all-time record. Through nine months, FORCE savings are $295 million. So we're tracking to be toward the high end of our $350 to $400 million full year target.","In addition, our organization restructuring generated $15 million of savings in the quarter. Commodities were favorable by $10 million mostly due to lower fiber costs. Full year deflation should be toward the middle of our previous estimate of $25 million to $125 million.","On the bottom line, third quarter adjusted earnings per share were $1.52, up 1% year-on-year. That's despite a currency drag of more than $0.10 per share, mostly from transaction effects.","Moving on to cash flow and capital efficiency. Cash provided by operations in the third quarter was strong at $948 million. That's up 12% year-on-year driven by improved working capital. On adjusted return on invested capital, through nine months, we're up 100 basis points, nicely ahead of our long-term goal of 20 basis points to 40 basis points of annual improvement.","On capital allocation, third quarter dividend payments and share repurchases totaled more than $550 million. The full year amount should be approximately $2.1 billion.","Moving on to segment results. In Personal Care, organic sales rose more than 1%. That includes 4% growth in developing and emerging markets. Overall Personal Care operating margins were healthy at 19.8%, although off 70 basis points year-on-year including significant currency headwinds.","Moving to Consumer Tissue. Organic sales fell 2%, driven by results in North America. Consumer Tissue operating margins of 18.1% were up 110 basis points with benefits from cost savings and lower input costs.","In our third segment, K-C Professional, organic sales were down 1%. That included a 1-point impact from lower sales of nonwovens to Halyard Health. K-C Professional operating margins were 19.6%. That's up 100 basis points year-on-year, driven by higher net selling prices and cost savings.","So, overall, it was a soft quarter on the top line and a tough environment. Nonetheless, we delivered significant cost savings, improved our margins and increased cash flow. We also continue to improve our balance sheet efficiency and allocate capital in shareholder friendly ways.","I'll now turn it over to Tom.","Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","Thanks, Maria, and good morning, everyone. I'll share my perspectives on our third quarter results, and then I'll comment on our full year outlook.","So starting with the third quarter. As Maria mentioned, our organic sales were about even year-on-year and reflected a more challenging economic and competitive environment. Regardless of the reasons, I'm not satisfied with our top line results, and I expect some improvement in the fourth quarter. On the other hand, I am broadly encouraged with our current market share positions, so we are holding up well in a challenging environment.","Let me give you some details about our third quarter sales and market conditions. In developing and emerging markets, organic sales were up 3%. That compares to a 5% growth in the second quarter as performance improved in China but softened in Latin America, particularly in Brazil and Argentina.","In Brazil, organic sales in Personal Care fell about 5% year-on-year due to lower volumes. Results were impacted by competitive promotion activity and an even more difficult economic environment. We'll be launching more innovation in the next few quarters in Brazil while making sure we protect our brands appropriately.","In Argentina, while selling prices were up in the quarter, volumes were down low double-digits in a challenging consumer environment. Category volumes are declining at about the same rate as our volume decline and have worsened over the last three months.","Now looking outside of Latin America. In Eastern Europe, organic sales in diapers increased 10% due to broad-based volume growth on Huggies across the region. In China, organic sales in diapers were up low single-digits as strong volume growth was mostly offset by lower selling prices. Looking ahead in China, we expect our volume momentum will continue with benefits from innovation and healthy category demand. We also expect the promotion environment will remain competitive.","So, overall, while organic growth in developing and emerging markets has moderated this year, that's mostly because of slower economic growth which has resulted in weaker category dynamics. In most of our key businesses, our market positions are generally improving or holding steady.","I'm still very optimistic about our long-term growth prospects in developing and emerging markets because of the inherent category penetration opportunities that exist in this part of the world. Nonetheless, given the volatility in the current environment, it's difficult to predict when growth will pick back up significantly.","Turning to our North American consumer businesses. Consumer Tissue volumes were down about 3%. The comparison included impacts from changes in the timing of promotional shipments and 6% growth in the year ago period. Year-to-date, our volumes were up 2% in this business. That's a good indicator of our ongoing performance. And in addition, our market shares in the third quarter were relatively stable sequentially. So we expect better volume performance going forward compared to the third quarter.","Personal Care volumes in North America were up 1% compared to 10% growth last year. Child care volumes were up double-digits. They benefited from innovation and category growth. Baby wipes volumes were also up double-digits in the quarter. Volumes were off low single-digits in diapers and mid single-digits in adult care. Both businesses had double-digit growth last year with increased promotion shipments and benefits from innovation. Competitive promotion activity has also picked up somewhat recently particularly in adult care.","Our market shares in the third quarter were stable in diapers and down about one point in adult care. In terms of overall market shares in North America, our positions remain healthy. Shares improved or were even with prior year levels in seven of eight consumer categories on a year-to-date basis and in five of eight categories in the third quarter.","Now moving beyond sales. We continue to manage with financial discipline. As Maria highlighted, we delivered another quarter of strong performance on cost savings, margins, return on invested capital and cash generation while we continue to allocate capital in shareholder friendly ways. These results demonstrate the continued strength of our business.","Now moving on to our outlook. We remain optimistic about our long-term future. We'll continue to execute our innovation, marketing and targeted growth initiatives to grow our brands. We'll also continue to focus on improving the profitability and efficiency of our businesses. In terms of our guidance for full year 2016, we expect organic sales growth of 2%. Our previous target was 3%. On the bottom line, we're targeting full year adjusted earnings per share in a range of $5.95 to $6.05.","Compared to our previous guidance, we've lowered the top end of the range by $0.10 per share to reflect our new organic sales estimate. Our earnings outlook represents year-on-year growth of 3% to 5% which I believe is pretty solid performance in this environment. Over the next three months, we'll continue to assess the environment and finalize our detailed operating plans for 2017. And as we always do, we'll provide our guidance for the coming year in January when we announce year end earnings.","So, in summary, while it's been a more difficult environment to generate top line growth this year, we are competing effectively and our market positions are in good shape. We're managing the company with financial discipline, and we continue to execute our global business plan strategies for long-term success and shareholder return.","That wraps up our prepared remarks, and now we'll begin to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you.","Paul J. Alexander - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","David, are you there? We're ready for questions.","Operator","Our first question is going to come from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning. Can you guys hear me? Tom? Paul? Hello?","Operator","Our question comes from Lauren Lieberman.","Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","Hey, Lauren, sorry. We had a little mix up there. Good morning.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","That's okay. No problem. Good morning. Okay. So first I actually wanted to ask about was margin performance. Because you showed really good margin expansion in both Consumer Tissue and K-C Professional even with volumes down. So is that \u2013 is it because those businesses have been where most of the cost savings activity is, or is it more about the deflation? Because I think that's sort of an interesting dynamic to think about as we look into next year.","Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","Yeah, I mean if you looked at the cost savings by segment, I mean it was relatively proportionate. In fact, if anything, Personal Care was probably a little heavier than Consumer Tissue. I think, yeah, you probably had more of the competitive pricing activity particularly in some of the emerging markets like China affecting Personal Care. On the deflation side, it was only $10 million, but again most of it was pulp. So that did benefit Consumer Tissue probably a little bit more than Personal Care.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And when you think about the margin expansion and the productivity work, a couple places in your remarks you mentioned the promotional environment. And I think I'm having a hard time getting my arms around how much of the sort of deceleration that you've seen, not just this year but also with it getting more severe this quarter, would you tie to the competitive environment, the macro environment and whether or not you think there'll be a need or desire to spend back more to kind of continue to protect market share positions or to stimulate category growth?","Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","That's sort of the interesting question I think in this environment. So I'd say there's question that there's less growth out there in lots of places. And so Latin America was certainly the case where categories have gone negative in a big way due to some of the economic impacts in places like Argentina. And there's just as many people chasing that growth, and so that does make it more competitive.","On the other hand, you saw some pretty heavy up activity in some markets in the third quarter that probably won't repeat at the same level. There was some very heavy adult care couponing in North America, for example, by both of our primary competitors, think $14 digital coupons on a $13 item. We don't see that reoccurring. It was probably more of a one-time thing.","We also saw some pretty big easy ups couponing, more like a $5 coupon, which is way above normal in that market as they were launching a new product. And again, don't see that continuing at that level. And we didn't match those offers, but that does affect your short-term volume while that stuff is working its way through the market.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","So is that the expectation because particularly it sounds like in North America Personal Care, some of the promotional activity, you're assuming it doesn't continue and that helps with the \u2013 because you need things to accelerate pretty significantly Q4 versus Q3 to do the 2% for the full year total company.","Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","I think it's not as big a step up as you think. There are a lot of things across the company that should be better sequentially. So, if you looked at KCP, we had about a point drag from Halyard. That rolls off in the fourth quarter. Europe was also very weak in KCP which some of that was Brexit-related. That's gotten a little bit better sequentially. So we'll see how that plays out in the fourth quarter.","If you looked at Consumer Tissue, there was more of a promotion timing 2Q versus 3Q. If you look at our year-to-date volume, we're up a couple percent on Consumer Tissue in North America and expect to have a solid fourth quarter versus the negative trend in the third quarter. So there's a number of things that were probably working against us in the third quarter that will make the comparison a little easier in the fourth quarter.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And so it sounds like particularly KCP and Consumer Tissue \u2013 those are the two? I think the Personal Care comparisons was something a lot of people had their arms around, but the volume seeming shortfall in KCP and Consumer Tissue is what really felt pretty surprising. So it feels like (16:21)","Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","(16:21) the biggest miss versus our plan as well.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. All right. I'll pass it on. Thank you so much.","Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","Thanks, Lauren.","Paul J. Alexander - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","Thanks, Lauren.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jason English with Goldman.","Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","Good morning, Jason.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey. Good morning, folks. Thanks for the question. I guess I want to pick up first on Lauren's line of questioning, maybe from a slightly different angle. As you think about your categories and the growth trajectory in the markets which you operate, do you have a sense of how fast they were growing last year and how fast they're growing now?","Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","Yeah, we don't measure that on a quarterly basis. We would have said last year the global growth rate was somewhere in the 3% to 4% range. We haven't redone the math for this year, but I would say it's going to be at the low end or even slightly lower than the low end if I would have to guess. Just when you see places like Argentina where we were tracking mid single negative category growth through the first half of the year and saw kind of double-digit category dips in the third quarter.","That and Brazil would be the other big market that's had kind of mid single-digit negative category growth comps. Those would be things that would be a bigger drag on that standpoint. Yeah, that and the pricing environment of China's probably the other one that's a big shift this year relative to what it would have been doing last year.","And so we'll take another look at it going into 2017, but I would guess it's certainly lower than the 3% to 4% we had estimated last year","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","That's helpful. And speaking of going into 2017, I know you're not in a position to give guidance, so I wouldn't ask you to at this point in time. But we can't help thinking about the business's trajectory into next year with some of the fading momentum we have right now. It sounds like year-to-date, I think FX all-ins have been about a 12% headwind. Consuming sort of flatlined in the fourth quarter. You're looking at sort of maybe a 9-point drag to EPS this year. Implying constant currency despite the top line decel, you're still posting pretty solid double-digit earnings growth. Assuming rates hold, FX abates next year, what are some of the offsets that would prevent you from kind of getting to that sort of constant currency growth rate whether it be sort of inflation, what you see on that front, clearly slower end markets, et cetera? Any thoughts you can provide on that front would be appreciated.","Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","Yeah, again, you're right. We'll give you a more complete look in January. And I'd say for us, it tends to start with our outlook on category growth and some of that's driven by what's going on economically, and so we're \u2013 every economic forecast it seems like that we look at lately has a lower GDP growth number than the one before it. So we're not expecting a snapback from category growth. In terms of \u2013 as we tend to look at the combination of input price, currency and commodity costs, that probably still net feels like a drag year-on-year going into 2017. On the other hand, we've also seen lots of big swings between now and the end of the year. And so we have a number of other events happening between the presidential election and two more Fed meetings. So we'll see where we're at on that calculus a couple of months from now.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Very good. Thank you, guys. I'll pass it on.","Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","Thanks, Jason.","Operator","Our next question comes from Wendy Nicholson with Citigroup.","Wendy C. Nicholson - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hi. Good morning.","Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","Hi, Wendy.","Wendy C. Nicholson - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","I just had a quick question sort of following up on Brazil specifically. Because when we visited you guys down there, I mean we were struck by just how strong the business was. You specifically chosen to play in the higher tiers, and historically, and even last year when things were tough economically you guys were still doing really, really well. So I'm just wondering if you can just speak a little bit more about Brazil. Is it specifically the diaper business or is it the fem care business more that has deteriorated and is it \u2013 do you really think it is the economic situation? Are people trading down? Are they doing without? Or is it just the competitive environment? If you can speak to the pricing environment specifically that would be great. Thank you.","Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","Yeah, sure. That's an important market. So it's \u2013 I would say if there was all of the above on your \u2013 as an option for your answer, I'd probably \u2013 it's probably a little bit of all of those things but let me go category by category. So fem care for us, doing really well. I think we're up three share points year-to-date. Category leadership, have launched a bunch of innovation, and I'd say that business looks pretty solid overall. Diapers has been more competitive. Category has been weaker. There has been some trade down in the category as well, and you see more tier two growth. It's been more competitive.","And so from a pricing standpoint, promotion standpoint, there's been more activity on that front as well. And I think within that, you've seen some either it's household inventory destocking or it's moms who were using four or five diapers a day now using three or four diapers a day. And so you take one diaper a day out of the equation, and that's a double-digit category decline for that consumer. And so I think it takes a little while to get household panel data to really understand what's driving that. But it's gone on for long enough now, it's probably more than just inventory destocking where you're actually seeing the middle class in some cases in Brazil are getting poorer and having to make tough trade-offs.","You'd certainly see the same kind of phenomenon in Argentina as well as they're moving to more of a market-based economy in some areas that's putting big pressure on consumer wallet. So while we're still well positioned and bullish long-term on Brazil, it's been a tough economic environment. You've had a recession for the second year in a row. Their overall outlook is not that optimistic. And economies run on expectations and until people start to believe it's going to get better, it's not going to snap back probably.","Wendy C. Nicholson - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","And if you see people really trading down or even not leaving the category but just using less, I mean would you contemplate a more aggressive pricing action there to sort of spur consumption? Or are you still happy to play at the relative premium end and you want to preserve that position?","Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","And then in Brazil, we have a very strong tier two business. So we are \u2013 we actually are continuing to drive that and are benefiting in that area. But net-net if the whole category is down, it has been \u2013 it hasn't been enough to stimulate the consumer to use more at this point anyway.","Wendy C. Nicholson - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Got it. And then just ballpark, I know you don't break out advertising as a percentage of sales on a quarterly basis. But of the sort of roughly high 3%s, 4%, I mean this year, are we trending kind of at that same level. Or has there been any change, up or down for you?","Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","No, I think year-to-date, we're almost right on. As a percent of sales, it's 3.8% or 3.9%, something like that. So very little movement. And I think the thing that you don't see is that we're probably doing more digital couponing which shows up as a reduction of net sales, which can factor into our price column of our analysis of change in sales. But there's been more competitive couponing activity as well.","Wendy C. Nicholson - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Fair enough. Okay. Thank you so much.","Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","Thanks, Wendy.","Operator","Our next question comes from Caroline Levy with CLSA.","Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","Hey, Caroline.","Caroline Levy - CLSA Americas LLC","Good morning. Thank you. Hi. I'd like to ask for a little more explanation of what you think is going on in China. Our surveys there are not \u2013 I guess the retailers and distributors are not really talking about price discounting, but you're obviously seeing it. So I'm just wondering if you can talk by channel where the pricing pressure is coming from and maybe even by competitor? Just trying to understand what's going on. And I don't know if you have any more specifics on the volume growth.","Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","Yeah, I mean the volume growth for us was very strong, particularly in newborn, and we're expecting and seeing a stronger birth rate in China that was back end loaded this year. And it's really across all classes of trade. We tend to look at modern retail baby superstores and then e-commerce as our, sites that we have data and insight into, and we're doing well and growing strong double-digits in both \u2013 in all of those categories.","In terms of the pricing, I think, again, that's a place where it's one of the fastest growing markets in the world, and you're seeing lots of competitors chasing it. So the two Japanese competitors as well as P&G are all very aggressive, and it's probably one of those things, Caroline, where everyone thinks the other guy started the price war, but we're all trying to drive our business in that market. And our shares are pretty stable overall, and we've got good innovation in the market and more coming. And so we feel pretty good about our position in that market.","Caroline Levy - CLSA Americas LLC","So, yeah, just on that innovation, do you have different product by channel? So, for example, for online, would you have different innovation? And what's been driving the growth this year?","Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","No, I mean it's a pretty similar product lineup. You may have different pack counts or pack sizes by channel. And for us, as we said, newborn has been a strong driver this year, but our premium lineup is continuing to do well in China overall, tier five, which we would call it. But our top-of-the-line Huggies products are doing well in China.","Caroline Levy - CLSA Americas LLC","Thank you. Just last question, do you see this persisting, this competitive environment?","Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","I don't think it's going to get any easier any time soon because China is one of the best growth opportunities available in the world right now, and I think it's going to be the biggest consumer market at some point in time in just about every category. And everyone's trying to build a position there, and we're certainly among them.","Caroline Levy - CLSA Americas LLC","Thank you so much.","Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","Thanks, Caroline.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ali Dibadj with Bernstein.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hey, guys.","Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","Hey, Ali.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","I'm not sure I'm getting a very clear picture about the split of the slowdown between competition and just the economy around the world. So I know it's tough to tell, but is it 50-50? Is it 60-40? How should we think about splitting that? Because going forward, between competition and economic slowdown, we obviously try to figure out which one of those is going to get better. But maybe start with kind of what's the split here? Is it P&G and the Japanese companies we've heard them before, just like you just said a second ago getting super aggressive in China? Is it economic slowdown? Can you just give us some more quantification of which one is really driving it? Because it sure feels like, in my editorial comment, it sure feels like since basically Q4 last year, we've been hearing, look, China's just a one-time thing. It was single day. And then we heard, oh no, people are getting more aggressive in China, but it's really because it's VAT issue. And then now it doesn't sound like it's that benign. And then similarly, in the U.S. and in Latin America, we kept thinking, look, things are okay, things are okay, and things will slow down quite dramatically. So I'm still trying to unearth this economics versus kind of competition.","Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","Yeah, that's fair, Ali. So, if I were to give it to you regionally, I'd say in Latin America, it's probably more category decline than competitive activity. Although, when the category is declining, you do still have more competitive activity as everyone is trying to hang on to their share of the business. In China, it's more competitive activity. The categories are fine. The birth rate is fine. In China, you're seeing good underlying category growth on a unit volume standpoint.","In North America, honestly, on a year-to-date basis, we're fine. We had a tougher third quarter. We had tougher comps for sure in a lot of areas because of some of the launch activity last year. But if I looked at Consumer Tissue in North America which had a negative comp, it had more to do with we had a little heavier promotional schedule in the second quarter where we had great volume growth than we did in the third quarter where we went backwards. We're expecting to finish with a strong fourth quarter, and that business is on track from a share perspective.","Europe \u2013 Eastern Europe \u2013 I'd say Western Europe and the U.K. was pretty weak overall economically. Some of the reaction to the Brexit vote, you had a lot of people that didn't want to hold inventory for a while and had fairly weak growth in both the consumer and the KCP side. Eastern Europe is essentially fine. It's competitive, about like normal. Categories are performing reasonably well. So it is more of a region-by-region assessment. You do have some of both factors in both places. But I don't know if that helps you understand it better, but that's probably how I would break it down for you.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","No, it certainly helps. And to tie that a little bit to your share position, so healthy shares on average, not \u2013 it sounds like when you're saying not, not losing share. So should we expect your competitors to deliver kind of zeros organic sales growth, or are there things that you think may make the category be growing faster than you're growing, e.g., tough compares or what have you. Because it just \u2013 it feels like a lot of this is \u2013 if you're not losing share, everyone else is going to have to be feeling some pain as well. Is that a fair assessment?","Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","Well, we'll find out I guess this week. So \u2013 but that would be my assessment.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay.","Paul J. Alexander - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","I mean I think, Ali, I would just add it's probably better to look at results through nine months. As Tom said, there was a lot of noise in the third quarter, and I think if you look at through nine months, that's probably a better reflection of how we're doing.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you. And then the last thing I just want to throw in again on this topic is kind of almost what I started with in terms of how should we \u2013 why should we expect this getting better? I mean it feels like competition is not going away yet. I don't know if you guys are seeing anything that suggests the macroeconomic situation in Latin America or whatever is getting better. You hear from Walmart that they're going to have to put in more private label to fight all the (31:50) in the U.S. It just feels like there's more brewing here that may make it tougher before it gets better and wanted to just get your reaction, given you guys see many more things than we do.","Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","Yeah, I mean, I would agree with the statement that it's not going to get better quickly. I don't expect a snapback here. On the other hand, there are some green shoots in some places. I'm encouraged by the volume growth in China, the birth rate in China. We've got lots of good innovation coming in lots of places. I look at our fem care business, for example, where we've seen share growth in the vast majority of the categories that we compete in around the world, and there's consumers still responding to innovation.","We still got good growth opportunities for adult care overall. And it's a little bit more competitive in North America, but we've seen good growth outside North America. And so, while there's \u2013 maybe we're going through a tougher economic period of time. I do think in the long-term, there's still lots of room for category penetration here.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks very much, as usual.","Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","Thanks, Ali.","Operator","Our next question comes from Stephen Powers with UBS.","Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thanks. Yeah, I may have missed a bit. Can you talk a bit more about what drove the Tissue mix \u2013 or sorry, Tissue miss in North America? I know you cited the promotional timing shifts into Q2, but that should have been foreseeable. So I'm just trying \u2013 I'm trying to figure out where the miss versus your own expectations resided?","Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","Yeah, I mean it's one that, again, we didn't give you guys quarterly guidance, but it was one that we expected to do a little bit better in the third quarter than we did. Some of it was our primary competitor in North America probably did a better job of executing against the Olympics promotions, and while we had activity, it didn't compare at the same level. And so we'll have a little stronger program in the fourth quarter. On the other hand, we did have a very strong second quarter. And last year, our comps were tougher. So it made it look worse than maybe it would. If you looked at it on a year-to-date basis, it looks fairly similar.","Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And then if I can drill into Russia, you seem pleased with the Eastern European trends in general. But if I just triangulate it, it seems like Russia is a little bit softer than what I would have expected based on your commentary coming out of Q2. Can you just expand on that a little bit?","Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","I mean, overall, I mean it was up double-digits in the quarter across Russia, Ukraine, CIS which would be what we would all bucket into those categories. And I'd say, Russia and CIS are probably performing the best. Ukraine is maybe less negative than it was in the past, but that's still an economy that is under quite a bit of stress with everything else that's going on in that market. But overall, I'd say our Russian business is on track for the year with our expectations.","Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Okay. And then lastly if I could. I know you don't expect a snapback, but to the questions earlier, the Q4 outlook implied in the full year guidance does feel like somewhat of a snapback to more or less normal. Is all of that Consumer Tissue renormalizing, or should we expect sequential improvement in both Personal Care and Tissue.","Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","Yeah, I mean, it's one that I think to hit our revised full year guidance, we only need, Paul, what, about a point of growth in the fourth quarter...","Paul J. Alexander - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","Yeah.","Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","...versus zero in the third quarter. So it's not a huge uptick to be able to round (35:23) the 2% growth for the year. So it's one that, again, I think that's doable across a number of places. But overall, I would expect the ones that were off the most in the third quarter will have the biggest opportunity to close the gap.","Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you very much.","Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Olivia tong with the Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thank you. Tom, first question is just when you characterize your market shares as sort of broadly healthy and you're broadly encouraged by them, are you talking about dollar share or volume share?","Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","We typically look at dollar share. We look at both. But the one that we probably focus more on is dollar share. So when you hear us talk about it externally, it's typically dollar share.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. Because when you talk about specific categories, you talk a lot about volume. And when I look across Nielsen data it looks like a couple of the categories you are sort of trending downwards particularly in some of the developed markets, U.S., for example. And then a couple of the emerging markets so just wanted to clarify that. And then also, going into Q4 and also into 2017, when you think about what's driving that improvement, is it coming primarily from volume or \u2013 and what do you think about mix in price and roles that they play in terms of driving that organic sales acceleration?","Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","Yeah, I would expect that the sequential improvement will be mostly volume based particularly in North America. I don't expect to see any big pricing improvements. There's no major price increases that are happening in any of the categories.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. And then just can you update us on your view of sort of what the industry is growing at in your categories? More so for the medium-term rather than the very short- or long-term and has there been any change in terms of what you think the industry will grow at.","Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","Yeah, so we had commented on that a little earlier. Typically, our long-term outlook has had the categories growing 3% to 4%. And we haven't remeasured that for what we think actually happened in 2016 or what we think might happen in 2017, and we'll give you another look at that when we give you guidance in January. My guess is that it had slowed down just because of the category declines that we've seen in Latin America as well as the pricing activity that we've seen in China. Those two together would probably \u2013 those are all large markets and would definitely bring down the category growth rates a bit.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. Thank you.","Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","Thanks, Olivia.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jonathan Feeney with Consumer Edge Research.","Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","Good morning.","Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Thank you, guys. Good morning. I just want to ask about the cash flow. The last time, I mean, excellent cash flow performance. And I'm wondering two things. The last time you spent at this rate on CapEx which you lowered for the full year, it was back in 2009 when obviously there were some very different macro dynamics. And I guess with a very strong cash flow performance, is that something we should expect going forward? What are your sort of priorities for allocation with this outperformance? And does that signal anything about your expectations for structural growth? Because I think in prior periods, it probably did. Thank you.","Maria Henry - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","Sure. We did have really strong cash flow in the quarter as you saw, and we had really good performance in working capital particularly in reducing inventories. And that came through to help our cash flow numbers. In terms of CapEx, we do expect that we'll be below our original guidance that we gave coming into the year. But that is driven by a couple of things. First, we have had really strong productivity this year and you see that showing up in our FORCE cost savings as one of the levers that we use to drive that. And we also do have slower volume and sales growth than we expected coming into the year.","And so we're very rigorous on what we spend capital on and making sure that we're matching up the timing of when we're putting assets in the ground with our expectations and with slower volume growth this year, our capital is lower than we expected. This is an area that we continue to drive. You know that we've set up a global supply chain organization last year, and that organization is partnering with the finance organization and the operating teams are continuing to drive added rigor into our capital process. And so we're not changing our long-term expectation there, but we are incredibly rigorous on that. And we'll flex the CapEx spend with the needs of the business. I wouldn't take it as a signal for anything else other than just where we are as a company this year.","Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Erin Lash with Morningstar.","Erin Lash - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","Hi. Thank you for taking the question. I wanted to ask specifically about China and the growth, the organic sales that you cited with regards to diapers, seem to be an improvement. How much maybe was that driven by the just overall category demand as opposed to innovation? And then more broadly with regards to innovations across the categories that you compete in, I guess in light of the tough macro backdrop as well as intense competitive activity, do you see your innovation skewing either more to the premium or the value end or has that not really shifted in light of what's going on? Thank you.","Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","Yeah, those are good questions. And so I mean, if we look at China today, the birth rate is definitely helping. And we expect more live births this year. And it could be as much as 7% more live births in 2016 than there was in 2015. You're still seeing GDP per capita go up in China so more consumers have more money to spend in categories like ours, which helps. We're continuing to drive our city expansion, so we're in now 130 cities where we started the year at 115. And so we've got more geography to cover as well which is fueling our growth. And we continue to launch innovation. And so we've been driving some improved newborn products, and that has really helped drive a lot of our near-term volume growth. But we've also \u2013 we're also driving diaper pants hard across a number of tiers both mainline and premium tiers. And so I think there's a combination of those factors has really helped our volume growth this year.","Erin Lash - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","And then with regards to innovation more broadly I guess across the categories in which you play where that kind of maybe \u2013 if that's skewing one way or the other?","Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","China tends to skew a bit premium. The golden baby phenomena is alive and well in China, and Chinese moms and dads invest a lot in their child and hopefully children as they go to more than a one child policy. And we tend to see the best for baby as a strong pull for our business in China.","Erin Lash - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","Okay. And then in a more competitive or I guess challenging economic environment like Brazil, would that still skew more premium or would that be more balanced or skewed maybe to value?","Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","Yeah, Brazil you are seeing a bit more trade down, more growth in the lower tier products. There still is a segment of the consumer that has money to spend and will pay more for best for baby, so you've got to balance your innovation across those tiers. But you are seeing more emphasis on the value equation in markets like Brazil and Argentina.","Erin Lash - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","Thank you very much. That's helpful.","Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","Thanks, Erin.","Operator","Our next question comes from Iain Simpson with Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale.","Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","Hello, Iain.","Iain E. Simpson - Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale SA (Broker)","Thanks very much. Hi there. Good morning, everyone. Just a couple of questions from me. I wondered if you could just talk a little bit more about the pricing environment in Chinese diaper? I know you have touched on it, but I seem to recall at the second quarter stage you talked about it being down about mid teens year-on-year. I was just wondering if that was a sort of similar level in the third quarter. And also I think in some kind of other infant channels. We've seen some destocking in the C2C channel. I just wondered if there were any signs of that there? And then moving on to Tissue, really high level, but your comp in the Q4 is a couple of points tougher than your comp in the Q3 yet you're talking about an improvement despite that. Any color you can give onto the drivers of this a bit more on whether you think there's a risk that lower input costs from pulp coming down does translate into a tougher pricing environment would be great. Thanks.","Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","Okay. On China pricing and \u2013 broadly, I would say the market got a little bit more competitive in Q3 than in Q2. And so again, you saw lots of innovation, lots of good global competitors trying to drive their business. And the Chinese consumer is the beneficiary of that for sure.","I wouldn't say we've seen any significant destocking impacts in any of our businesses. I mean we have a pretty big e-comm presence in China, and that business tends to be relative for us at least, relatively efficient low inventory. And it flows pretty directly to the consumer. So again, China \u2013 good growing competitive market. We're competing well, and we feel pretty good about our position there.","On the Tissue comps, I mean again, we had a weaker promotional calendar in the third quarter as it turned out than we needed, and we expect to have a stronger quarter going into the fourth quarter. Fourth quarter is also typically a little bit better facial tissue quarter, so we'll see how cold and flu shapes up. And on the pulp question, at the levels of pulp chains that we're seeing, I wouldn't expect that to have much impact on pricing.","Iain E. Simpson - Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale SA (Broker)","Thank you very much.","Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","Thanks, Iain.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank.","Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi, Tom. (46:32). Hey, can you just talk a bit more about the timing of the promotional activity? Because it seems like you probably were planning on some promotions in the back half of the year, and they didn't come through. So how does that happen I guess is the first question. I think it was Cottonelle and Huggies and Diva had like a really good back half last year. And so you have to lap it again, I think this year. And then a couple follow-ups. The fourth quarter year guide to get to 2% is between 1.5% organic and 5% organic. So, if I heard you right, you kind of think it's going to be the low end of that 1.5% to 5%. Is that fair? And then the last one is just on the SG&A leverage which was great. Can you just talk about what's driving the SG&A growing substantially lower than sales and how sustainable that is?","Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","Okay. You've got a pretty eclectic list there, Bill.","Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","I know. I wanted to get them all in.","Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","Yeah, on the Tissue growth, some of it is timing of promotions and when they ship. I think overall we had a pretty good promotional calendar. On the other hand, we probably underestimated the impact of front-of-ad circular Olympic stuff and how much lift that would provide to a primary competitor. So, in some cases, we had the promotion, we just didn't get as much of it as we thought we were going to get. And that obviously has lapped, and we'll expect a little stronger performance going into the fourth quarter.","And so we feel pretty good about the lineup we've got, and again, year-to-date, we feel like the Tissue business in North America is at or ahead of its plan. So we're comfortable with what we're doing on that front.","The fourth quarter comps, essentially I would say is that to get to the low end of our guidance, we only need to deliver one. So to put that in perspective, I wouldn't say I was predicting that, and we'll see what it looks like when we post it in January. As you guys know, I'd rather give you guys annual guidance anyway, and this is the one quarter of the year where I have to give you quarterly guidance, otherwise I'd just rather talk about where we're going from an annual plan and not manage the business quarter-to-quarter.","SG&A growth. We are maybe Maria, you want to comment on that, because we are really trying to make sure we're focused on controlling that element of our P&L that we can control.","Maria Henry - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","Sure. We also have some currency FX when you look on the face of the P&L and SG&A. If you unpack that and look, locally, we actually have SG&A increases in some places, particularly in Personal Care where we continue to invest in our capabilities and building that business out in developing and emerging markets. We also operate in some high inflationary environment. And so again, when you strip the currency, we have increasing SG&A in some places because of inflation. But we balance it out. We continually look at our SG&A spend to make sure that we're directing as much of it toward growth-oriented initiatives and then have extreme rigor on the more discretionary non-growth oriented core SG&A spend.","Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Great. That's very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","And at this time, we have no further questioners in the queue.","Paul J. Alexander - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","All right. Well, we appreciate all the questions, everyone, and we'll wrap up with a comment from Tom.","Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","Well, once again, thank you all for spending some time with us this morning. We hope to deliver a little stronger performance in the fourth quarter, and thank you again for your support of Kimberly-Clark.","Paul J.

We now have your presenters in conference. Please be aware that each of your lines is in a listen-only mode. At the conclusion of today's presentation, we will open the floor for questions. At that time, instructions will be given as to the procedure to follow if you would like to ask a question.","It is now my pleasure to introduce today's first presenter, Mr. Paul Alexander.","Paul Alexander","Thank you and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Kimberly-Clark's First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. With us today are Mike Hsu, our Chief Executive Officer; and Maria Henry, our CFO.","Here\u2019s the agenda for our call. Maria will start with a review of first quarter results. After that, Mike will provide his perspectives on our results and the outlook for the full year. We'll finish as usual with Q&A. We have a presentation of today\u2019s materials in the Investors section of our Web site.","As a reminder, we will be making forward-looking statements today. Please see the Risk Factors section of our latest Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of forward-looking statements. Finally, we'll be referring to adjusted results and outlook; both exclude certain items described in this morning's news release. That release has further information about these adjustments and reconciliations to comparable GAAP financial measures.","And now, I'll turn the call over to Maria.","Maria Henry","Thanks, Paul, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining the call. Let me start with the headlines for the quarter. Organic sales increased 3% driven by higher net selling prices. Adjusted operating profit and earnings per share were down low-single digits year-on-year. That said, we made solid progress with our margins compared to full year 2018 performance. Additionally, we\u2019re on track with our overall capital plan and we continue to return cash to shareholders.","Now let\u2019s cover the details of our results starting with sales. Our first quarter net sales were $4.6 billion. That\u2019s down 2% year-on-year with a 5 point drag from currency rates. Organic sales were up 3% which is a good start relative to our full-year target for 2% growth. Net selling prices increased 4% and product mix improved 1% while volumes fell 2%. Mike will provide more color on our top line in just a few minutes.","Moving on to profitability. First quarter adjusted gross margin was 33.5%, down 30 basis points year-on-year. First quarter adjusted operating margin was 17.4%, even with the year ago. I\u2019m encouraged that gross and operating margins were up 30 and 40 basis points, respectively, compared to full year 2018 levels.","Commodities were a year-on-year drag of $135 million in the quarter. While that is still a meaningful amount, I was pleased to see market prices in North America for pulp, recycled fiber, and polymer fall a bit sequentially.","Foreign currencies were also a headwind reducing operating profit by a low double-digit rate. Our focus on achieving higher net selling prices offset much of the commodity and currency headwinds we faced in the quarter.","We also generated solid cost savings of $115 million. That includes $55 million of FORCE savings which was consistent with our plan, and $60 million of restructuring savings. On that, we continue to make good progress with our restructuring program. So far this year, we\u2019ve announced the planned closure of two personal care facilities outside North America. We\u2019ve now announced 6 of the approximate 10 facilities that we intend to close or sell.","Advertising spending was up in the quarter as we continue to support our brand. Even with that investment, total between-the-line spending was down 50 basis points to 16% of sales. The reduction was driven by our restructuring savings. Compared to the first quarter, I expect between-the-lines spending as a percent of sales to move up a bit for the full year. So all-in-all, adjusted operating profit was down 2%.","On the bottom line, adjusted earnings per share were $1.66, down 3% year-on-year. That included an approximate 2% drag from a higher tax rate essentially offset by a lower share count.","Let\u2019s turn to cash flow and capital efficiency. Cash provided by operations in the quarter was $317 million compared to $542 million in the year-ago quarter. The decrease was generally in line with our expectations and driven by higher working capital and restructuring payments.","Capital spending was $316 million in the quarter. As expected, that\u2019s up from $189 million in the year-ago period and is driven by supply chain restructuring projects. We continue to allocate capital in shareholder friendly ways. First quarter dividends and share repurchases totaled $510 million, and we continue to expect the full year amount will be between $2 billion and $2.3 billion.","Turning to our segments. In Personal Care, organic sales were up 5%. Net selling prices increased 2%, and volumes and product mix were each up more than a point. Personal Care operating margins were 21.3%, up 90 basis points year-on-year. The improvement was driven by organic sales growth and cost savings.","In Consumer Tissue, organic sales were even with the year-ago period. Net selling prices increased 6% which was offset by lower volume. Consumer Tissue operating margins of 15.8% were even year-on-year.","In K-C Professional, organic sales grew 3%. Selling prices rose 3% while a 1-point improvement in mix was offset by lower volumes. K-C Professional operating margins of 18.4% were down 60 basis points. Results were impacted by commodity inflation and currency headwinds, partially offset by higher pricing and cost savings. So all-in-all, we\u2019re off to a solid start relative to our full year plan, and I\u2019m encouraged by our progress.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Mike for his perspective on our results and outlook.","Michael Hsu","Thanks, Maria. Good morning, everyone. I\u2019m going to focus my comments on organic sales and our full year outlook and let me start by saying I\u2019m encouraged by our first quarter results. We\u2019re making strong progress realizing higher selling prices. We\u2019re launching innovations, investing in our brands and pursuing our growth priorities and we\u2019re leveraging our strong financial discipline.","As Maria just mentioned, we grew organic sales 3% in the first quarter which is a good start to the year. Overall, our pricing initiatives are on track and to date the impact on our volumes has been reasonable.","Let me share some of the top line highlights for the quarter, starting with developed markets. Organic sales increased 1% in North American consumer products. In North American Personal Care, organic sales grew 3%.","Volumes increased high-single digits in adult care with benefits from innovations, increased brand investment, and category growth. Volumes were up low-single digits across our baby and child care portfolio.","In the first quarter, we increased selling prices on Pull-Ups training pants and premium Huggies diapers. Looking ahead, we have innovation on Poise pads coming this quarter and premium innovation on Huggies diapers that are going to hit the market this summer.","In North American Consumer Tissue, organic sales were down 2% compared to a 5% increase last year that was driven by strong promotion activity. Net selling prices rose 7%. Our pricing plans are overall on track. We\u2019ll continue to monitor the impact on our volumes and competitive activity, but we remain focused and confident on realizing the benefits of the price increases. In North American K-C Professional, organic sales increased 1% driven by solid price realization.","Turning to developed markets outside North America, organic sales were up 1%. In South Korea, while our diaper business continues to be impacted by a lower birth rate, our other businesses are growing and offsetting that diaper category\u2019s softness. We also had solid performance in Western and Central Europe in K-C Professional.","In developing and emerging markets, organic sales rose 7% overall and that included nearly 3 points of growth from Argentina, which is consistent with our 2019 plan. In terms of our key Personal Care businesses, in Brazil, organic sales rose about 15% compared to a mid-single-digit increase in the base period. Growth was driven by higher selling prices while category volume remained sluggish.","In China, organic sales were down high-single digits. Huggies diapers continues to be impacted by competitor price reductions that started last year. Nonetheless, volumes on our premium-tier Huggies were up driven by strong product innovation. In feminine care, we continue to grow at double-digit rates driven by our innovation, trade-up strategies and supported by strong digital marketing.","In ASEAN, organic sales rose about 10% with the strength on Huggies diapers in Vietnam. We\u2019re rolling out improved Huggies in most ASEAN markets this year. In Eastern Europe, organic sales increased about 20% with volumes and selling prices both up nicely. Our momentum in this region reflects the combination of excellent sales execution, winning product innovation backed by great marketing. We\u2019re launching further innovations on Huggies and Kotex this year.","While diapers remain our biggest business in D&E, I\u2019m pleased that in the first quarter we grew organic sales double digits in fem care, adult care and baby wipes. These businesses have strong growth opportunity and we\u2019re making progress.","Now in terms of digital marketing, we\u2019re using digital on many of our brands to help us build one-to-one consumer relationships. Digital is improving our marketing ROI and helping us grow in markets like fem care in China and South Korea, diapers in Vietnam and adult care in North America.","To summarize our top line, I\u2019m optimistic about our start to the year. We have more work to do and we continue to operate in a competitive environment. However, that said, I\u2019m encouraged with our progress thus far.","Now moving beyond sales, I\u2019ll just build briefly on Maria\u2019s comments about margins. While we need to make more progress, I\u2019m encouraged that first quarter performance was above our full year 2018 levels.","Turning to the outlook. As we mentioned in this morning\u2019s new release, we\u2019re confirming our previous outlook for 2019 which calls for 2% organic sales growth and adjusted earnings per share of $6.50 to $6.70.","We\u2019re also maintaining the key planning assumptions we outlined in January. Our first quarter results has improved our earnings profile somewhat compared to our initial view of the year. That said, we still believe it\u2019s more likely the earnings are going to be somewhat higher in the second half of the year compared to the first half.","Our teams have a lot to execute over the next nine months and we\u2019re going to continue to closely watch the overall environment. While we work to achieve our 2019 targets, we\u2019ll continue to pursue the longer-term balanced and sustainable growth opportunities that are all part of our K-C Strategy 2022.","So in summary, we\u2019re off to a solid start for the year, we\u2019re confirming our full year outlook and we\u2019re confident in our ability to create shareholder value.","That concludes our prepared remarks. And now we\u2019d be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Jason English with Goldman Sachs.","Michael Hsu","Hi, Jason.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi. This is actually Cody [ph] on for Jason today. How are you guys?","Michael Hsu","Hi, Cody. Good morning.","Unidentified Analyst","Can you provide us an update on your commodity outlook? Previously you stated 300 million to 400 million of inflation. Does that still hold? And can you also provide details by each commodity like you did last quarter?","Maria Henry","Sure. Cody, it\u2019s Maria. On commodities, we had $135 million of headwinds in the quarter driven by pulp and other materials. That was slightly better than our expectations for the quarter with some relief on resin-based materials and recycled fibers. Distribution also remains inflationary in the quarter. We are holding our outlook at this point to $300 million to $400 million of inflation for the year. It\u2019s early in the year. We\u2019re just through the first quarter and while we\u2019re encouraged by the North America market prices that have started to come down sequentially in areas like polymer, resin, eucalyptus, and recycled, it remains volatile and we\u2019ll have to see how this plays out. And as we think about the P&L impact of the commodity changes, we have to think about commodity inflation in relationship to price when we look at the P&L holistically. If I cover them kind of piece by piece, if we look at fiber with eucalyptus, it was down 1% year-on-year and down 4% sequentially. And we\u2019re maintaining our outlook on eucalyptus for the year of 11.25 to 11.75 per metric ton for the full year average. On NBSK, we were up low teens year-on-year and we were down low-single digits sequentially. And when I\u2019m quoting these, I\u2019m quoting the market prices in North America for these commodities. And then on fluff, we were up or the market was up high-single digits year-on-year and down low-single digits sequentially. And on recycled fiber, those prices remained elevated. North America market was up more than 20%. However, it has fallen sequentially. It was down about 10% on recycled. In terms of the oil-based commodities that we have on polymer, the first quarter average price was down mid-teens versus a year ago. We\u2019re expecting a modest increase in price in the back half of the year for polymer, so we\u2019ll have to see what happens there. On super absorbent, we were or the market was up high-single digits versus year ago and relatively flat on a sequential basis. And finally, I\u2019ll point out that outside of North America, inflation continues to run at moderate levels particularly coming out of Latin America. So, we\u2019re seeing some easing for the North America market prices. We still got inflation when you look at it outside of U.S. It\u2019s a very long answer. Hopefully that covers all the details you were looking for on what we think about what the markets are doing.","Unidentified Analyst","Yes, that\u2019s very helpful. If I can sneak in one more question related to your commodity costs. Your initial FY '19 outlook assumed 400 million to 450 million cost savings with about 300 million to 325 million in FORCE. Does that still hold today? I assume it does based on your reiterated outlook. But if inflation proves to be less onerous than you initially thought, how should we think about your potential savings for FY '19 as the year progresses? Do you still expect to deliver at least 400 million in savings? Thank you and I\u2019ll pass it on.","Maria Henry","Yes, we do expect to continue to hold \u2013 to continue to deliver savings and we are holding our estimate in terms of the savings outlook for the year. I think that as you watch commodities and commodity inflation, the three to watch together are what\u2019s happening with currencies, commodities, and price when you think about the P&L, but the cost savings estimate remains unchanged.","Unidentified Analyst","And I just want to make sure that\u2019s unchanged even if commodities do roll over in greater force than we thought.","Maria Henry","Yes.","Unidentified Analyst","Got it. Thank you very much.","Maria Henry","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.","Lauren Lieberman","Great. Thanks. Good morning. I want to talk to something, actually a little bit bigger picture was around innovation and news flow in the Personal Care categories, particularly in the U.S. I know Mike you mentioned that you\u2019ve got innovation coming on Poise this quarter and something on Huggies over this summer. But I was just \u2013 I feel like the pace of activity in these categories has dramatically stepped up both from largest competitor, from Procter, but even from retailers and also all the upstart brands that seem to be gaining some traction. So could you just talk a little bit about how you\u2019re thinking about the right level of news flow and activity, your interest in kind of smaller brands in sort of natural organic, and any detail that you can offer on the Huggies innovation this summer would really be helpful? Thanks.","Michael Hsu","Okay. Thanks, Lauren. Maybe I\u2019ll start with the last one. I probably \u2013 I\u2019m not ready to share details on the launch this year. I will tell you it\u2019s a premium Huggies diaper and that\u2019s kind of the general space, and it\u2019s consistent with our overall strategy in Personal Care overall but especially in diapers which is we think there are opportunities for us to deliver improved benefits, especially on the dimensions of comfort, fit, protection, and all the things that you would expect. I think in terms of \u2013 the overall strategy really does highlight the need for more impactful innovation and we are ramping up our efforts. And I know we just kicked off our K-C Strategy 2022 approach with our team earlier this last quarter, rolled that out with our top executives, and then we\u2019re now deploying regional teams and cross-functional teams around the world to kind of get after it. I would tell you though that while we\u2019re just launching it now, we\u2019ve been kind of working it for probably the past year or so, and so some of the things that you\u2019re seeing in market like some of the product launches or the launch we\u2019re talking about in North America this summer are a product of some of the teams working over the past year to accelerate some of this opportunity.","So overall, a big opportunity on innovation. I think with your question on natural and organic, it is \u2013 I\u2019d say North America right now it\u2019s still probably a niche opportunity or a smaller one to two, three share type opportunity and something that we\u2019re going to continue to look at. I think the question around small brands and big markets like North America is a really relevant question because we still keep tabs \u2013 Maria and I still keep tabs on the food side and we know what some of the smaller brands have done there. And so I think for us there is a question about whether there\u2019s an opportunity for us there and there may be. But we\u2019re not ready to share details on that yet. We are doing a pretty good job on pursuing natural organic in our Korean business which that\u2019s a market where I think is one of the most sensitive about chemicals and contaminants of any market in the world and we\u2019ve gotten a number of brands and they\u2019re doing very, very well and more than just a couple share points.","Lauren Lieberman","Mike, is there a reason why you wouldn\u2019t have already done a sort of lift and shift them with some of the things you\u2019re pointing out with Korea, South Korea having long been a lead market for you guys in terms of innovation, in terms of market share to move quicker with taking kind of what\u2019s working there with a very, very discerning group of consumers and moving quicker to bring it to other markets to bring it to the U.S., for example?","Michael Hsu","Yes, great question. Definitely and I think that\u2019s the focus going forward was \u2013 I like your term faster lift and shift or we\u2019ll say adopt and apply, but that\u2019s part of it. And I think you will see some of that natural product flow into the U.S. perhaps in fem care later this \u2013 at some point. And then also I think this diaper that we \u2013 that I talked about that\u2019s coming out this summer in North America really is a joint Asia-Pac North America development and a feature kind of the new way we\u2019re trying to work which is more collaboratively around the world.","Lauren Lieberman","Have you started to sell that into retail yet, because also it\u2019s funny to see, right, there\u2019s news flow from Target, there\u2019s Walmart with Hello Bello, right. There\u2019s just \u2013 the retailer \u2013 even Target today with not so much in diapers but I think it went into paper products, this new product launch that they\u2019ve announced today. They seem to be charting their own course in what may well be a niche opportunity, maybe it\u2019s big but just curious of those conversations, how much they want to sort of go their own way versus opening up shelf space for you guys to be bringing some of this news flow in maybe a little bit again behind where they\u2019ve been themselves?","Michael Hsu","Yes, so on your first point we haven\u2019t started selling this product in yet with customers which is why I\u2019m not sharing that many details on it right now. I will tell you though we do have the collaborative discussions with most of our major retailers or all of our major retailers and they\u2019re still very receptive to big brands and big innovation. They are pursuing some other opportunities. But I think we\u2019ll work with them as partners kind of leading these categories.","Lauren Lieberman","Okay. I\u2019ll pass it on and come back if I\u2019ve got the time. Thank you.","Michael Hsu","Thanks, Lauren.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Nik Modi with RBC.","Michael Hsu","Hi, Nik.","Operator","One second, it looks like his line dropped. Give me just a moment.","Nik Modi","Hello.","Operator","All right. Nik, you\u2019re line\u2019s open.","Michael Hsu","Hi, Nik.","Nik Modi","Okay. Thank you. Hi. How are you? Sorry about that. I guess there was a nice over delivery at least relative to consensus this quarter and Mike I guess it\u2019s a philosophical question as you think about your first year as CEO and when you think about the priorities, clearly given the level of disruption in the marketplace just generally across the CPG landscape, there\u2019s all this stuff to spend money on, right, capabilities, innovation, et cetera, et cetera. So I\u2019m just curious like on your thoughts on how you think about the goals for the year in terms of, hey, we can hit the high end of guidance, make commodity costs coming down or hey, look, there\u2019s a lot to spend. This is the first year. Let\u2019s go get it. I just was hoping you can give some guidance around how you think about that.","Michael Hsu","Well, I guess maybe my near-term focus is on delivering the midterm objectives we outlined in January, right. And I do think maybe \u2013 and this is maybe the company culture which is we want to deliver consistent, predictable and positive earnings growth and sales growth. So I think this quarter was a solid quarter for us and we\u2019re encouraged by it, especially encouraged by the price realization and the margin improvement, but it\u2019s a step along the way. I will point out, Nik, though I think a couple of bright spots for us on the quarter were we saw broad improvement across a broad range of markets all improving; the U.S., Brazil, Central\/Eastern Europe, ASEAN, UK, Western Europe, India. So I think we got a lot of markets heading in the right direction, so that\u2019s a good thing. And then obviously with the pricing being on track, that\u2019s obviously helping the shape of our P&L.","Nik Modi","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ali Dibadj with Bernstein.","Ali Dibadj","Hi, guys. So I have two questions on top line and then one on free cash flow. First from a Personal Care top line perspective, if you think about PCNA and then the Personal Care outside North America, so the developed markets together, it looks like the price mix flattish for NA and then down 3 for outside North America developed markets, so it\u2019s negative on average. Volumes were good so I\u2019m not denying that and that\u2019s excellent. But I just was scratching my head a little bit in terms of price mix element there given what\u2019s happened to commodities obviously going up, given that you\u2019re spending on advertising, given that we hear everything about the competitive situation being more benign yet unable to take price in the Personal Care area in developed markets, but just wanted your perspective on that. Is that diagnostic fair, maybe comment about market share along the way? It just struck me as why not take more pricing in that area in particular?","Michael Hsu","Yes, probably Ali the biggest thing is maybe a bit of a lag on Personal Care in North America, that\u2019s probably the biggest mover and driver that we have which is we\u2019re doing most of our pricing on diapers through a pack count change and that started rolling through at the end of the first quarter and it\u2019s still rolling through now. And so we had a big rollover. It took a little time for us to get that lined up and so that\u2019s probably why you\u2019re not seeing as much price now. But that we expect will continue to improve as the year goes on.","Paul Alexander","And Ali, this is Paul and in developed markets outside North America, broadly speaking I\u2019d say there hasn\u2019t been a lot of pricing in the marketplace in Personal Care so this is Western and Central Europe, Australia and South Korea. The price declined in Q1, came primarily in South Korea where given the decline in the birth rate, there has been a bit of a pickup in everyone competing to pursue growth in a pie that\u2019s getting a little bit smaller over time. In terms of shares, you asked about in North America across diapers and pants combined or the mega category, if you will, our shares on an outlook basis are even year-on-year and that might be a little bit better than you\u2019re seeing in the tracked data because we continue to do strong in non-measured channels, including club and e-commerce.","Ali Dibadj","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you. And then on Consumer Tissue both North America and developed markets, almost the opposite question, right, where you\u2019re seeing very significant pricing, I get it because of the commodity costs but the elasticity looks a little bit tougher particularly North America, so the downtown and CT as we call it ONA or outside North America down about 3. Can you talk a little bit about how that\u2019s going to continue throughout the year? Is that kind of the right balance or do you think they\u2019ll be a better balance going forward?","Michael Hsu","Yes, I think maybe the first point is that with regard to Q1 we are cycling a pretty big set of events that we had in the plans last year. For reference I think our volume was up almost 10% in Tissue in North America first quarter last year and overall organic was up I think over 5%. And so we are cycling that. We took those promotions out of the plan this year. So it\u2019s not that it\u2019s a timing difference, it\u2019s just out of the plan. And so I think the Q1 this year therefore in that effect, I would say right now the elasticity effect is probably as we predicted. We had a separate promo change that is as predicted and so overall we\u2019re on. I think the one thing for us to watch out is overall I think the pricing is on track and the volume is in line with our expectations to date. The one thing we are keeping our eye on is I think some of the other private labels or some of the smaller brands have not \u2013 we haven\u2019t seen the price move up yet and so it\u2019s a little sticky on the upswing, so we\u2019re keeping our eye on that. We\u2019ll be ready to adjust our plans as necessary to make sure that we protect our share long term.","Ali Dibadj","Okay. And just my last question on the free cash flow point, you said in expectations that working capital was up. But I want to get a better sense of your free cash flow conversion here. It looked a little bit tougher what we should expect going forward for the year and kind of what\u2019s going to make that change? Thank you.","Maria Henry","Sure. On cash flow, it was down year-on-year for the first quarter. It was in line with what we expected. We had higher working capital and we had an increase in restructuring cash payments. In working capital that\u2019s really the big driver when you look at the numbers in the first quarter and there were a number of factors that went into that. On the payable side we had a stronger than expected finish to 2018 and those entire payables got paid out in the first quarter. On the receivable side we had a number of factors including the timing of the sales and also the higher level of sales and we ended the quarter on a Sunday, so we lose two days on collections which causes a run up in that balance. And then finally on inventories, as we expected, as we get into the supply chain portion of the restructuring program there are inventory build in advance of moving equipment or basically taking equipment offline. So we expected that to happen and we saw all of those factors play out in the first quarter. And for the year as we said in January we would expect cash from operations to be down slightly year-on-year.","Ali Dibadj","Okay. Thanks very much, guys.","Maria Henry","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo.","Bonnie Herzog","All right. Thank you. Good morning. I had a question on your full year organic sales growth guidance of 2% which actually implies a bit of a deceleration on the top line through the balance of the year but your comps do get easier in the next couple of quarters. So I guess I want to understand if we should interpret your guidance as maybe conservative or if there\u2019s something else that we should be aware of that could cause growth to moderate? And then I\u2019m just thinking about this in the context of you guys maybe lapping some of the higher promos you had last year.","Michael Hsu","Bonnie, maybe I\u2019ll start and maybe Maria can chime in. But we\u2019re making solid progress but we still have plenty of work to do to make sure that we have a strong 2019. So while we\u2019re encouraged with the start there\u2019s a lot we have ahead of us. I just said to Nik we have broad improvement across a lot of markets, we\u2019re still in the early days of price and as I mentioned to Ali just now we are watching elasticity and alignment effects are kind of in line with our expectations, maybe even actually slightly better in D&E especially. The thing that we are watching now is competitive pricing, it does seem to be a little sticky on the way up and so we\u2019re keeping our eye on that. So I wouldn\u2019t know \u2013 I think we\u2019re calling it down the middle which is what we believe and 2% for us is a reasonable number. We\u2019ve got nine months to go. There\u2019s a lot of work ahead for all of our teams.","Bonnie Herzog","Okay. And then if I could I just wanted to circle back on innovation with a couple of quick questions. First, your full innovation pipeline this year, would you characterize it as more back half weighted or do you think pretty evenly spread throughout the year as you roll out new products? And then second, curious how margin accretive some of the new innovation is and was that possibly a key driver behind the sequential improvement you saw in your margins during the quarter? And then what could we expect in the future? Thanks.","Michael Hsu","Yes, I think maybe a touch tilted to the back half but I would say overall fairly balanced, although I think the impact that we\u2019re getting now is still from some of the benefits in innovation we launched last year. So we have an uptick, for example, in North American adult care where I think we\u2019re up high single digits in the quarter organically. That was on the backs of innovation that we launched last year with this discrete sizing which has taken a little while to get traction in the marketplace but it\u2019s getting that traction now. So I think we have a pretty robust innovation plan. It\u2019s balanced across quarters. In terms of the accretiveness, I don\u2019t have the exact number but I think the strategy is to elevate our categories where that means premiumizing our categories by making it worth it, so with premium innovation in general we\u2019re aiming to move to a higher price point hopefully accretive.","Paul Alexander","And I think Bonnie that bares out if you look at the sales changes in the quarter, mix was up as a company one point and it was up essentially between half a point and a point in all three segments. So to Mike\u2019s strategy comment I think we\u2019re making good early progress.","Bonnie Herzog","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Olivia Tong with Bank of America.","Olivia Tong","Great. Thanks. Good morning. I want to talk a little bit about marketing spend. You talked a lot about that last quarter and when we met in February and obviously you mentioned that it was up this quarter. So can you discuss some of the things that you did this quarter whether it\u2019s tradition or digital, where is the lion share of the dollar spend going and then just a little bit of order of magnitude of the increase and from this point forward are you expecting it? Was Q1 sort of a high watermark and then it sort of normalizes from here or is it just a start and we should actually expect it to continue to increase as the year progresses? Thank you.","Maria Henry","Sure, Olivia, I\u2019ll start and then Mike can jump in. In terms of our advertising spend, on the P&L it was up in the first quarter and we have an expectation that for the full year it will also be up year-on-year. And that is encouraging because not only is it up but as we shift more of it to digital and as we continue our work to drive down the non-working portion of the advertising expense, the actual consumer impressions that we\u2019re getting from that spend is up as well. And so good support behind the brands and the innovations. Mike, I don\u2019t know if you want to talk more about what we\u2019re doing in advertising.","Michael Hsu","Yes. Olivia, I think maybe a couple of things which is one, overall I\u2019d say with a couple of key brands most notably in North American adult care and in diapers I think increased levels of brand investment overall and brand support. And then most specifically it is weighted to digital. And so some of the stuff that we\u2019re seeing and the reasons why we\u2019re growing faster perhaps in non-measured channels is the strong digital investments that we\u2019re making in search and that\u2019s paying strong returns for us and doing very well. We also have pretty good content now that we feel good about in terms of the messaging we\u2019re putting out there and we\u2019re rolling out some new advertising on Cottonelle which I think is being right now very, very effective. So overall I think we feel good about kind of where we are. We know we can do better still, but looking forward to the progress.","Olivia Tong","And should we expect this to increase this year as you talked about the upcoming innovation both in adult care and Huggies?","Maria Henry","The benefit of innovations this year, is that the question? You\u2019re kind of breaking up.","Olivia Tong","I\u2019m sorry. In terms of the increase in advertising, should we expect that to \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, within advertising, are we expecting to increase advertising as the year progresses especially as you fund or as you support innovation that\u2019s coming?","Maria Henry","Okay. As you know we only disclose the advertising number I think once a year and I don\u2019t want to get into how the quarters are going to flow. So suffice it to say that it was up on the P&L in the first quarter and we would expect for the whole year that it will be up also.","Olivia Tong","Got it. And then just lastly on pricing, can you talk about how much of the pricing benefit you would attribute to just straight list price increases related to commodities versus some of the things that you\u2019re working on with respect to trade efficiency and innovation?","Michael Hsu","Yes, I think that\u2019s an overall mix. I think in Q1 maybe \u2013 and I don\u2019t have an exact number but I would say the vast majority of it is some form of straight pricing whether it\u2019s list or pack count changes. But I think those are probably the big buckets for us right now. We\u2019re making progress especially in North America on trade efficiency and we have some programs there. I don\u2019t know how much would show up in the P&L right now, but I know it\u2019s a big priority for the organization and they\u2019re doing a good job with it.","Olivia Tong","Great. Thank you.","Michael Hsu","Thanks, Olivia.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan.","Michael Hsu","Hi, Andrea.","Andrea Teixeira","Hi. Good morning. So can you comment a little bit on the 15% organic growth in Brazil? I appreciate the detail. And it was driven by pricing and I believe you were lapping this price increase in the third quarter, just want to check that. So one of these competitors are now finally following or they are retrenching given the commodity pressures are finally easing now? And also a follow-up question for Maria on the cash flow. I appreciate the detail on the cash conversion side and the working capital. I was wondering if she can explain a little bit more of the CapEx and the timing aspects of it. Thank you.","Michael Hsu","Okay, Andrea, maybe I\u2019ll start with Brazil. First of all, the team\u2019s doing a great job down there and we\u2019re experiencing strong growth in what I would characterize is a very challenging consumer environment. Our Personal Care organic volume was up as we said about 15%. Net selling prices were up double digits and volume was up low single digits, Andrea. So I think we\u2019re not defying the laws of gravity there or elasticity there. I think the market pricing overall is generally moving in the right direction. But I would say there\u2019s a handful of local competitors that are lagging a little bit. The better than expected volume performance, however, is really a result of maybe great commercial execution which is strong sales execution, a great brand value proposition and good advertising I would say overall working together and that\u2019s what the team is doing. It\u2019s why building out commercial capability in our K-C Strategy 2022 is so important. There\u2019s a number of markets that look like they\u2019re defying the laws of elasticity but really it comes down to strong commercial execution and this was one of them.","Andrea Teixeira","I appreciate it.","Maria Henry","Go ahead, Andrea.","Andrea Teixeira","Thank you, Maria. So I appreciate Mike when you said \u2013 in the initial comments I think you said sluggish, so I wasn\u2019t sure if it was negative. So you\u2019re saying volumes are still up in the low single digits in Brazil which is encouraging. Okay, perfect.","Michael Hsu","Andrea, the volume was down low single digit.","Andrea Teixeira","Down, okay.","Michael Hsu","Pricing was up double digits, pretty strong double digits and volume was down low single digits, but I would say way better than what the elasticity model would have said.","Andrea Teixeira","Okay, perfect. Thank you.","Maria Henry","And then on CapEx at 316 million in the quarter, that\u2019s in line with our expectations and it reflects the supply chain portion of the restructuring program really kicking into gear this year. So we continue to expect 1.1 billion to 1.3 billion on CapEx for the year and you started seeing some of that come through in the first quarter.","Andrea Teixeira","Thank you, Maria.","Maria Henry","Thank you.","Michael Hsu","Thanks, Andrea.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank.","Steve Powers","Thanks. I guess I wanted to start on U.S. Personal Care where the strength was really notable relative to at least what we\u2019ve seen in scan data. So just maybe some comments on that and whether that\u2019s strengthen on track channels or whether that\u2019s an element of shipments running ahead of consumption, just how you saw the growth this quarter and how we should kind of think about that momentum going forward?","Michael Hsu","Steve, thanks for that question. Definitely I think strengthen in non-measured channels, overall the mega category was up about 2 points in the quarter. Our share overall as Paul mentioned was about flat. Huggies was up low single digits and I think that\u2019s really been driven by strong product performance and as we were just talking about increased brand investment and brand support. Growth was especially strong in non-measured channels and that for us is club and primarily e-comm and club. And it\u2019s worth mentioning we got a very strong digital program in e-commerce across all our customers and I think that\u2019s really working a good effect right now. So we\u2019re encouraged by the progress in Personal Care. Pull-Ups is up high single digits as well. Our adult care business is up high single digits and so it\u2019s moving in the right direction.","Steve Powers","Okay, great. And then I guess my broader question was just to get you maybe Mike to expand a little bit more on how you\u2019re thinking about the medium term, the duration of K-C Strategy 2022, because building out this quarter as you say it sounds like \u2013 it looks like you\u2019re ahead of schedule. The tone today is deservedly very confident as a result. But on the other hand you called out you still have a lot of improvement initiatives underway, macro competitive conditions remain hard to call and stepping back year-over-year operating profits in dollar terms have yet to inflect positive. They should I agree as you move forward, but it just seems like the pricing which was great this quarter is tied to FX and cost inflation and if those come in lighter. How do you assess your ability to hold on to today\u2019s pricing and bank some of the productivity that you have underway in order to flow through better dollar-based bottom line results versus having to reinvest to sustain volume share versus competition? And I\u2019m not really so focused on next quarter, even this year but thinking really about what the evergreen model is over the course of that medium-term strategy?","Michael Hsu","I think Steve as I mentioned when we were together, I\u2019m really excited about the growth opportunities the company has ahead of it. And really for me the three big strategies of what I call elevate the core which is premiumizing our categories with value-added innovation or capturing the growth or leading the development of developing and emerging markets and then building this consumer digital relationship I think are really kind of robust growth opportunities that are really, really good for us. I think to accelerate our progress we\u2019ve outlined a handful of capability areas that have to do with innovation or doing a better job on innovation, sales execution, our digital execution and also revenue growth management or pricing management. So those are four big planks. I would say one of the reasons why we\u2019re encouraged with our progress in Q1 is we\u2019re starting to build and improving in these four areas that I just outlined on the commercial capability and it\u2019s starting to play through. I mentioned Brazil where our 15% organic is driven by pricing but it\u2019s also driven by strong execution. We\u2019re seeing the same across ASEAN where we\u2019ve got good double digit growth, price increasing but volume also going up. Central and Eastern Europe is doing the same thing. So I think overall it\u2019s putting all these pieces together for us which is the core of the strategy and we\u2019re going to stay focused on delivering consistent growth.","Steve Powers","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies.","Herb Eppich","Hi. Good morning, guys. This is Herb Eppich on for Kevin. One quick one just on restructuring, so specifically 60 million in savings for the quarter and your outlook for 100 million to 125 million for the year. So savings has been building sequentially for the last couple of quarters but outlook assumes that this should slow. So is there anything we should be aware of, maybe any phasing or shifting into the first quarter? Any commentary there would be helpful. Thank you.","Maria Henry","Yes, we had 60 million in the quarter which is a good savings number for us. But you\u2019ll recall that we had no savings in the first quarter of last year as the restructuring program was announced in January of last year and then it took some time to ramp up. If you look at the 60 in relationship to the expectation for the year of 100 million to 125 million, when we start to get into the second quarter we will be lapping quarters where we were building savings through 2018. And so that\u2019s really the driver.","Herb Eppich","Okay. That\u2019s all. Thank you.","Michael Hsu","Thank you.","Paul Alexander","Okay. Thanks, Herb.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Strycula with UBS.","Steve Strycula","Hi. Good morning and congratulations on a good quarter.","Michael Hsu","Hi, Steve.","Steve Strycula","So I had a question, the last quarter you mentioned that there might be some lumpiness on the quarter-to-quarter trend and first quarter clearly came in well ahead of what a lot of the investment community was expecting. So is there any lumpiness you would be mindful of for like Q2 or like the balance of the year in terms of sell-in versus sell-out particularly as you start lapping some of the price increases that you phased in towards end of last year?","Maria Henry","Yes, I\u2019ll make a comment and then Mike can jump in. We don\u2019t give quarterly guidance but a few things that I\u2019d say keep in mind. We have some benefits in the first quarter with the Lunar New Year happening and we typically have a strong first quarter around that. As we move into the second quarter, Kleenex will be kind of out of season in terms of cold and flu. And then the final thing as Mike mentioned earlier, the pricing just went in on diapers here in the first quarter. So I think we haven\u2019t seen how all of this is going to play out in our numbers and we commented that we expect the second half to be somewhat in relationship to the first half. So that kind of gives you a lot of different things to think about as you think about how you\u2019re going to layout your expectations on the quarters.","Steve Strycula","Okay, great. Mike a follow up for you. How should we think about \u2013 it seems like volume trends were generally better than what you were expecting. Did you guys have success in winning some planograms that were some key callouts you\u2019d want to shed light on? And then what key emerging markets if any would you say were sequentially the end market demand just improved quarter-on-quarter? Thank you.","Michael Hsu","Steve, I think maybe the second part first. I would say broadly across most markets demand improved versus where it was maybe last quarter. And so if you go through the markets, CE was up about strong double digits for us; ASEAN was up double digits; obviously Brazil we already mentioned; Argentina obviously a big number; India were up double digits as well; China fem care up another strong robust double digit quarter; China diapers obviously still down but I think improving sequentially behind our new product improvements. So I think across the broad array of markets improving. And I think in North America again improved commercial execution. There probably are some distribution changes here and there and I think we made some progress in some areas. But the other part of it is better product performance. And we have made improvements broadly across diapers, across adult care both on Depend and Poise. Poise is just shipping this quarter. Our Cottonelle bath tissue, Scott Comfort Plus is all gaining increased consumer traction. So we\u2019re feeling good about kind of the innovation piece of the puzzle.","Steve Strycula","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jonathan Feeney with Consumer Edge Research.","Jonathan Feeney","Good morning. Thanks very much.","Michael Hsu","Hi, Jonathan.","Jonathan Feeney","You had a little drop in developing and emerging market volume in both Personal Care and Tissue, just the volume piece and I know there was a ton of pricing in there driven by commodities. But can you update us on the market level volume growth roughly in your developing and emerging market portfolio overall and was that a gain \u2013 a loss of volume share and who would pick up that volume share? I\u2019m looking at the demographics. It would seem to me there would be ongoing volume growth in those markets. Thanks.","Paul Alexander","Yes, Jonathan, maybe I\u2019ll start just to put the volume decline and a little bit of context and then Mike can give obviously more color. If you looked at across our total D&E line up and set aside China and Argentina, our volumes would have been up a little bit in the quarter which given the inflationary pricing environment we are all facing and consumers are facing, that was a pretty solid outcome.","Michael Hsu","Yes, so overall I think we feel good about where the markets are heading. We feel good about our commercial execution broadly across D&E and I think most of the volume declines were related to price changes.","Jonathan Feeney","So did others not \u2013 am I right that there\u2019s a little bit of share loss there and did others not take that pricing? I\u2019m just curious like what the competitive dynamics are in the wake of it.","Michael Hsu","Yes, I think it\u2019s market by market but I would say as a general rule of thumb I would say the major branded competitors moved in line with us or some ahead of us and then you have some stickiness in local competitors or some of the smaller players. And so we\u2019re keeping a sharp eye on that.","Jonathan Feeney","Very helpful. Thank you very much.","Michael Hsu","Okay.","Paul Alexander","Thanks, Jonathan.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ali Dibadj with Bernstein.","Michael Hsu","Hi, Ali.","Ali Dibadj","Hi. Thanks for the follow up. I just want to touch base on China in a little bit more detail. I know you put it in the prepared remarks and the PowerPoint, but can you give us just some more color about what\u2019s going on there from a pricing perspective? We clearly see the volumes as well. But that\u2019s been a hotspot recently. Just want to get an update please. Thank you.","Michael Hsu","Yes. Thanks, Ali. I would say in diapers pricing is kind of about where it was last quarter. So overall for us our premium Huggies is gaining traction behind the innovation that we talked about last quarter and our fem care continues the really strong momentum. We\u2019re really not satisfied with our performance yet but we\u2019re making progress. Our Personal Care organic sales were down high single digit which is improvement versus the prior quarter. The competitive activity on price remains elevated. It remains kind of where pricing has been. But I think specifically in our team\u2019s view and my view is the consumers in that market are still looking for better solutions and our improved tier 5 and 6 diapers are gaining traction. They were up significantly in volume and up in value as well. And we\u2019ll be rolling out that technology that we put into that across other tiers and other channels this year. So we\u2019re building for the long term and I\u2019m really feeling good about what the team is doing there.","Ali Dibadj","Thank you. But what do you think the competitive situation is looking like whether it be from the regional players there, Japanese in particular or from P&G?","Michael Hsu","Well, we\u2019re still seeing pricing suppressed and then we are getting wind of some additional product introductions. We don\u2019t have visibility on everything yet. But obviously I think products and technology still matters a lot in China and that\u2019s what the consumers are looking for and that\u2019s why you\u2019re seeing the response in this in the premium tiers.","Ali Dibadj","Okay. Thanks very much.","Michael Hsu","Thanks, Ali.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Caroline Levy with Macquarie.","Caroline Levy","Thank you so much. A couple of things. How important is the roll price of oil which is up so much to the outlook for polymers?","Maria Henry","Yes, the price on oil has gone up and so when we think about our outlook on commodities, overall as I went through in the beginning of the call, 10 of our puts and takes on the fiber-based commodities and other material commodities, the oil prices definitely have us watching the market. The relationship between oil prices and the exact commodities that we buy has not been as correlated as of late as it had been historically, but it certainly does have us remaining cautious on the full year outlook for the oil-based derivative materials that we\u2019re using. So it\u2019s kind of mixed with the sequential improvements that we\u2019re seeing in some areas, but with the oil run up we\u2019re just keeping an eye on it.","Caroline Levy","Right. Thank you, Maria. And could you elaborate a little bit on the outlook for transport?","Maria Henry","Sure. Distribution costs were up. They continue to be inflationary for us. They were higher a year ago and distribution costs are a meaningful portion of our overall cost of sales and the outlook for the year assumes that we will have distribution inflation for the full year. But it hasn\u2019t changed from what our position was when we talked to you in January. And I should note the increases on distribution costs are global.","Michael Hsu","Yes. And the other note I\u2019ll make, Caroline, is that last quarter or at the end of fourth quarter of '18, we did have some additional expenses because of some distribution challenges. I think our team is making progress there and we are improving.","Caroline Levy","That\u2019s great. Thank you. If I might, just a couple more. Could you comment on Mexico? It doesn\u2019t look like things have improved there in the way they have in Brazil, but maybe I\u2019m missing something. And then the last one would be to discuss your overall \u2013 how you think about development of private label, just whether you see it as a significant longer-term or medium-term threat and whether you would consider participating in it in any way?","Michael Hsu","Maybe the last one first, Caroline. We do do a bit of private label right now. It\u2019s not a strategic part of our business but it is in certain instances we will produce some private label. We generally don\u2019t have the capacity of taking on as a big strategic bet especially given the amounts of capital we got to put in generally I think is not necessarily a great return on our capital to invest in on that type of capacity. However, I will say we\u2019re moderating it closely because especially in North America right now in bath tissue I\u2019d note that private label is up a bit and pricing has not moved upwards yet on a lot of private label, so we\u2019re keeping a sharp eye on that. We\u2019ll be able to adjust our plans if necessary.","Maria Henry","And then on Mexico we\u2019re not going to comment because they haven\u2019t released yet. But what I would say is if you look at equity company contributions it\u2019s relatively flat year-on-year.","Caroline Levy","Yes, I saw that. Then if I might just sneak in one more on China.

At the conclusion of today's presentation, we will open the floor for your questions. At that time, instructions will be given as to the procedure to follow if you'd like to ask a question.","It is now my pleasure to introduce today's first speaker, Mr. Paul Alexander.","Paul Alexander","Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our Year End Earnings Conference Call. Here with us today are, Tom Falk, Chairman and CEO; Mark Buthman, Senior VP and CFO; and Mike Azbell, Vice President and Controller.","Here is the agenda for our call. Mark will begin with the review of fourth quarter results. Tom will then provide his perspectives on our full year results and also our 2013 outlook. We will finish with Q&A. There is a presentation of today's materials including our key planning assumptions for 2013 in the Investor section of our website.","As a reminder, we will be making forward-looking statements today. Please see the risk factors section of our latest annual report on Form 10-K for further discussion of forward-looking statements. We will also be referring to adjusted results and outlook today. Both exclude certain items described in this morning's news release. The news release has further information on these adjustments and also reconciliations to comparable GAAP financial measures.","Now, I will turn it over to Mark.","Mark Buthman","Thanks, Paul, and good morning. Let's start with the headlines. First, we achieved organic sales growth of 5%, highlighted by 9% growth in K-C International. Second, we delivered adjusted earnings per share of the $1.37, that\u2019s a 7% increase compared to the prior year. Third, we generated an all-time quarterly record of $1.1 billion in cash from operations.","Now, let's cover the details of the quarter. Fourth quarter sales were $5.3 billion, up 3% versus last year, underlying organic sales rose 5%, driven by increased volumes of 3% and higher net selling prices of 2%, unfavorable currency rates and lost sales in conjunction with our pulp and tissue restructuring further reduced sales by 1% each. Fourth quarter adjusted gross margin was 34.3%, that\u2019s up 170 basis points from last year. The increase was driven by organic sales growth and $80 million of FORCE cost savings.","For the full-year, FORCE savings were $295 million. That\u2019s well above our original target for savings of $150 million to $200 million for the year. We also surpassed our three-year savings target of $400 million to $500 million after just two years. We are making great progress leveraging our global procurement organization and deploying lean continuous improvement throughout our company and I expect that momentum to continue in 2013.","So moving now to P&L. Adjusted operating profit rose 5% with an operating margin of 15%. That\u2019s up 30 basis points compared to last year. We continued investment between the lines including higher administrative and research spending to build capabilities and support future growth, particularly in K-C International. In addition, strategic marketing rose $10 million in the quarter. The fourth quarter adjusted effective tax rate was 30.6%, in line with our full year target of 30% to 32%. All in all, fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share were at $1.37. That\u2019s up 7% versus last year.","As I said before, cash provided by operations in the fourth quarter was an all-time quarterly record of $1.1 billion. That is more than double our year-ago performance driven by improved working capital and lower pension contributions. Cash provided by operations for the full year was $3.3 billion. That is up $1 billion compared to the prior year. Our working capital cash conversion cycle improved two days in 2012 to a record low of 45 days for the year. We expect to make further progress in 2013.","During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 3.8 million shares of KMB stock at a cost of $320 million. For the year, we repurchased 16.4 million shares at a cost of $1.3 billion. Altogether, we allocated $2.5 billion dollars of cash to share repurchases and dividends in 2012.","Now, I will highlight a few areas from our segment results for the quarter. In personal care, organic sales rose 9% with volume growth of 6% and net selling prices up 3%. K-C International had another strong quarter with organic sales up 12%. Our key growth initiatives continue to perform very well. In fact, in the diaper, volumes in China grew 50%, volumes in Russia rose 15%, and volumes in Brazil were up 10%. Elsewhere, in personal care, volumes were up mid-single digits in Europe and low single digits in North America. Fourth quarter personal care operating margins of 17.6% rose 220 basis points driven by the organic sales growth and cost savings.","Now moving to consumer tissue. Organic sales were up 1%, driven by higher net selling prices and volumes. Volume gains in North America were mostly offset by modest declines in Europe and in K-C International. Consumer tissue operating margins were down 30 basis points compared to a strong year ago, although they were up 50 basis points sequentially versus the third quarter.","During the quarter, we also completed our pulp and tissue restructuring charges on schedule and in line with our expectations. Our consumer tissue team did a terrific job executing a multiyear plan. I am pleased to the operating profit margin benefits we have generated so far from these restructuring actions and I expect benefits will continue to build over the next two years.","Turning to K-C Professional, organic sales were up 3%, driven by improved volumes and pricing. Organic volumes were up high single digits in K-C International, down slightly, elsewhere. Operating margins of 16.7% were up 120 basis points driven by organic sales growth, cost savings and input cost deflation. Lastly, health care organic sales were down 2%, driven by slightly lower volumes and pricing. Operating margins of 14.9% were up 60 basis points driven by lower input costs in between the line spending.","So that wraps up my comments on the quarter. To recap, we achieved excellent organic sales growth led by K-C International. We delivered improved margins and earnings per share. We generated terrific cash flow.","Now, I will turn it over to Tom.","Tom Falk","Thanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Since Mark has reviewed our fourth quarter results, I'll focus my comments on the full year and then I'll talk about our Outlook for 2013.","So, starting with 2012, overall results were very strong. We had a great year. On the top line, we delivered organic sales growth of 5%, so to put that in perspective, that's our best top line performance since 2008, and it was driven by targeted growth initiatives, innovation and improved net realized revenue.","In terms of targeted growth initiatives, our K-C International team had an excellent year. They had organic sales growth of 10% and a double-digit increase in operating profit. KCI delivered strong Personal Care volume gains in key growth markets. For example, our diaper volumes increased 45% in China, 20% in Russia and 15% in Brazil. Results in all three countries benefited from product innovation. In addition, our Huggies business in China has now expanded into 80 cities. That's up from about 70 at the end of 2011 and we are targeting it to be in at least 90 cities by the end of this year.","We also made good progress making our adult care and baby wipes businesses truly global. For the year, K-C International grew volumes in both of these categories at double-digit rate. Elsewhere in KCI, our K-C Professional business grew organic sales high single digits in 2012 as we've been making strategic investments for industrialization and economic development are recurring.","In total across all our businesses K-C International now represents about 37% of our total company sales and we continue to be very optimistic about KCI's plans to deliver strong growth going forward. Product innovation around the world was also a key contributor to our organic growth in 2012. We produced several innovations in North America including Super Premium Depend Briefs, new U by Kotex tampons and pads and a number of new products in K-C Professional.","We also launched a number of innovations in K-C International. That included introduction of diaper pants, premium feminine care products and adult care offerings in several markets. We supported our innovation and growth initiatives with $115 million increase in strategic marketing. Our spending there rose at a double-digit rate. We also increased research and development spending double digits as we continue to make investments for future growth.","Our success with targeted growth initiatives and innovation helped mitigate the impact of soft category demand in infant childcare in the U.S. and in Europe overall. Nonetheless, our European team executed well and delivered a solid increase in operating profit and margin in 2012. We also initiated and are moving quickly to implement the strategic changes we announced last quarter.","Our market positions remain solid overall. In the U.S., we improved or maintained market share in six of our eight consumer categories and in K-C International, we are growing faster than the category in a number of markets.","In terms of profitability, we increased gross margin by 230 basis points and we increased our operating margin by 90 basis points. Our FORCE cost savings program was a big reason for these improvements. I am also pleased that all four of our business segments delivered operating profit growth and improve their margins in 2012.","On the bottom line, earnings per share for the year were $5.25. That's up 9% year-on-year, the high end of our long-term objective. It was also nicely above our original 2012 guidance for the year of $5 to $5.15. Finally, as you heard from Mark, our balance sheet and cash generation remained strong. We continue to allocate capital in shareholder-friendly ways as we returned $2.5 billion to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.","So, overall we had very good financial performance and I am encouraged by the progress we made in 2012","Now, let me turn to the outlook. In 2013, we'll continue to pursue targeted growth initiatives. We'll introduce new and improved products and will support our brands with increased levels of strategic marketing. We had several innovations launching in K-C International, particularly in the infant care, feminine care and adult care categories. We have also got a number of new innovations coming in North America, including new Depend products for men, the best ever Pull-Ups training pant and improved Scott extra soft bath tissue. As the year progresses, we will have more product news in many of our other brands.","We also expect to deliver strong cost savings again this year of $250 million to $300 million. That will help us fund our brand investments and overcome moderate cost inflation, which we currently expect to be in the range of $150 million to $250 million. Overall, we are targeting to grow organic sales by 3% to 5% and to increase adjusted earnings per share by 5% to 8%. This latter earnings guidance assumes an approximate one point drag from Venezuela. Though we are not sure exactly what the operating margin will be in Venezuela in 2013, so we thought it made sense to build some of that potential impact into our plan.","Finally we will continue to focus on generating strong cash flow and allocating capital in shareholder friendly ways. We expect to raise the dividend at a high single-digit rate and that will be our 41st consecutive annual increase in the dividend. We also plan to repurchase about $1 billion to $1.2 billion worth of Kimberly-Clark stock. Together dividends and share repurchases should total more than $2 billion for the third consecutive year.","So to summarize, we are encouraged by our performance in 2012. We are optimistic about our plans for 2013 and beyond and we remain convinced that our global business plan will continue to deliver value for our shareholders. That wraps up our prepared remarks and we will now begin to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Ali Dibadj with Sanford Bernstein.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford Bernstein","Hi, guys, a couple of questions. One is really around the very strong KCI growth this year at 10% organic, as you mentioned. But doing some algebra, the rest of the business seemed a little more subdued. So if you think about the 3% to 5% organic sales growth target for this year, for 2013, can you help us with the composition of that by geography and by segment? And maybe in answering that, can you give us some sense about the distribution gain that you might continue to get? You mentioned one example of that in your prepared remarks but any distribution gain you might be able to get on a continuous fashion? How much of a runway there is for that? Do you need that to get your extra KCI current numbers? That\u2019s the first question.","Mark Buthman","Yes, I would say, Ali, the growth is, again, going to be heavily focused on K-C International and then within that, more focused on personal care as it was this year, where you saw in KCI, personal care organic volume was up 9% for the year. A part of that was distribution gain in China, certainly that\u2019s also increasing our participation in the category as we moved into the midtier segment of the category. But in markets like Brazil, we are moving more aggressively in to the Northeastern part of Brazil. So that\u2019s a big opportunity for us. We are there but we were not really fully represented. So we have got additional capacity starting up there.","In Russia and in Eastern Europe we have got good presence in Moscow. We are moving out into broader distribution reach across Russia and some of the other Eastern European countries. So that\u2019s an opportunity for us. So is going to be combination of innovation and a little bit of distribution gain and good execution to make that happen.","In North America, I would say, the diaper category flattened out. So the birth rates were low. We expect diapers to be down about a point year-on-year. Child care, which was down 5 % this year, may only be down 1% next year from a category standpoint. We have got a lot of innovation coming. So I think we will have less of a drag from North America in 2013 than we had in 2012. We still have good momentum in adult care and fem care in North America that should carryover in to 2013.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford Bernstein","Okay, let me ask the KCI question slightly differently, specifically on the 10% organic sales growth. Can you help us figure out how much of that is comp store growth versus how much of it is distribution growth?","Mark Buthman","I would say the analytics are probably not as precise there as you would like to think. As you know, because some of the Nielsen data doesn\u2019t get you that. I would say the bigger factor is broader participation in the category. So, in China, for example going into the midtier, the diaper segment across the geography that we are already in. But going from 70 to 80 cities, we can do the math. Now they don\u2019t all start up and contribute at the full level of your existing base and you are in the big cities to start and you are going to go that the next year down so each incremental city is not as big of a pop as what you originally got. So I would say the more of it is from the expansion of our participation in the category and the innovation that we are driving and that the additional geography is a relatively smaller part of the boost.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford Bernstein","Okay. So, second thing is just about the incremental strategic spending $10 million, which seems lower than it's been all year. Can you comment a little bit about that? Is it launch timing? Seasonality? How should we expect that to trend going forward for the rest of the year?","Tom Falk","It's probably launch time. We would also say if you look back, we are ramping it up and so we have kind of hit more of a stable stage, so you will see it go up faster than sales in 2013, but it won't go up as much we were probably up more than double our rate organic sales growth this year. It won't be as big of a delta in 2013.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford Bernstein","Okay, and my last question is just around competition broadly, so what are you seeing and maybe make more specific U.S. And in the U.S. have you for example the consumer tissue business try to in your guidance take into account a new entrants in the U.S. with TAD technology and private label.","Then in China, we keep hearing from local competitors there that they are going to get more aggressive. They are not just going to give their turf since the folks like you are coming into their cities. Can you comment on that as well? Thank you.","Tom Falk","Yes. Sure. We have lots of tough competition everywhere, and so in the personal care spaces, obviously we got P&G most places, but we are seeing UNICHARM increasingly show up in markets around the world. They are obviously stronger in Asian. They are now talking about expansion in Brazil and Mexico. So they make very good product and we ran into them in large markets around the world.","Some of the local Chinese players, they hang out and those folks tend to be at the lower end of the product spectrum, but they are trying to move their mix up and so you got to execute well and have great innovation and great marketing to be successful in these markets and so that's what we are aiming at.","In the U.S. the private label, if you look at private label shares in tissue in bath, it was up a point or two year-over-year and towels was up about point, but our shares were pretty stable and actually we've got a pretty good innovation agenda for Cottonelle and Kleenex, and so I think we feel are cautiously optimistic about our tissue business going into 2013, particularly in North America.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford Bernstein","And the TAD technology entering in private label doesn't concerning you?","Tom Falk","Not at this stage. I mean, I think there is good quality private label around, but we think that the branded products still are differentiated and offer consumers an attractive value and our Cottonelle business is showing that. I mean, we had pretty strong share results in the fourth quarter and we are feeling good about that business going in 2013.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Ferrara with Bank of America.","Chris Ferrara - Bank of America","Good morning, guys. I wanted to try to better understand, now that I guess you probably have better look at it. The P&L impact of stranded overhead on the European exit, right? So, I understand you are committed to clearing that out, right, and still delivering obviously now 5% to 8% growth, but I guess can you talk about what you think the gross drag will be from that stranded overhead. I mean, you have to be finding offset, right, it's not that you are going to be able to clear all those expenses out at the same rate that the sales are going away, right? So, just kind of want to understand the gross impact if possible.","Tom Falk","No. I mean, Chris, we are aiming to cut our overhead in Europe by at least as much of the sales, right? And, so it hit Kim Underhill and her team and Robert Abernathy, but we are working on this for a good part of last year. Mark Buthman's team is leading on it as well in the in terms of the back-office things and maybe Mark can chime in on that, but we are aggressively going after the European structure, and so we had probably overbuilt that a bit to expecting Europe to grow and to be a bigger business, and so we have gone and stripped a lot of the overhead out.","They have gone through the consultation process with most of the countries and most of our team in Europe now knows whether they have a permanent role. They have a temporary role or there are going to be other roles been eliminated. And so, I don't know, Mark you have said on analyst calls lately, so I'll let you add some color to that.","Mark Buthman","Chris, if you think about it as an enterprise, it's a great opportunity for us to kind of paint a picture of what our overhead structure might look even more broadly across the world and they have got a real compelling business case to do it. So, it's on the top of our management agenda and we are watching it closely at high degree of difficulty, but high degree of confidence in the plans they put together.","Tom Falk","So, we know we have to execute it, and we'll be transparent about how we are doing on that as the quarters progress in 2013.","Chris Ferrara - Bank of America","Thanks. That's helpful. And I guess, moving over to KCI, obviously the growth has been there. Can you try to dimensionalize where you think sort of long-term margin improvement comes from? Like do you think the KCI margins will progression at a rate faster than the overall company margins?","Tom Falk","Well, the KCI team is aiming at being the most attractive investment opportunity for Kimberly-Clark. So they know they have got to grow topline and they have got to grow bottomline. So one of the things that was really pleasing about their results in 2012, is that they had double digit topline, but they also had strong double-digit operating profit growth too. And as you see, cities and markets get to scale, the gross margin structure is pretty attractive and we still have got work to do and we can do better in lots of places.","But they have got an aggressive program to continue to take out cost, to get more effective with our marketing investment and our trade spend investments and as we do that that should help our margins improve. And we have individual markets in KCI that have got the gross margins that are strongly accretive to the corporation. So we know it is possible.","Chris Ferrara - Bank of America","Great, and just one last follow-up on margins. When you benchmark yourself versus peers, and I guess normalizing for product mix and you look at that 34% gross margin that you guys are at right now, what do you think the opportunity is there for that gross over the long-term? Because obviously you have accelerated your topline, KCI has accelerated but what's the opportunity on gross margin, when you think longer term?","Mark Buthman","We have been higher in our own history and so if you go back before some of the commodity run-up, we were in high 30s and we were talking about scaling a 40% gross margin. So that\u2019s certainly kind of a near-term goal that we are aiming at. I think we made a strong move toward it in 2012. We will have commodity challenges from time to time that will afford our progress there but we are certainly aiming at improving gross margin, being able to invest more than strategic marketing and then delivering a part of that to the bottomline and operating margin improvement.","Operator","Our next question comes from Caroline Levy with CLSA.","Caroline Levy - CLSA","Hi, good morning. I was wondering if you could help us put some numbers and maybe it\u2019s a longer term question but around the adult diaper opportunity, because again it may not be a huge contributor to earnings right now but as you model out your company, five and ten years, how big do you think this can get and what do you see is your major opportunities, just given the number of older people in China and Japan, for example?","Mark Buthman","Well, it's exciting, even in North America, our adult care business grew volume 6% last year. So we got strong innovation behind the Poise and Depend and saw that even that\u2019s an income consumer that\u2019s maybe more sensitive to price change. They were still willing to invest in a better quality product. So we still got lots of growth in the U.S. and your developed markets. In the emerging markets, the businesses are small but they are growing fast and we are putting more resources against it in many markets. We have had with multiple launches in 2012. We have got more coming in 2013. So we think that Poise and Depend will someday be strong billion dollar businesses for us and each of those has the potential to be a billion-dollar brand. That\u2019s what we are aiming at.","Caroline Levy - CLSA","Is that margin diluted as you grow adult versus other parts of the business?","Mark Buthman","No, our adult care margins within personal care are competitive with the segment average and in some markets, even a little bit better. Obviously, as you launch in a market, you will be investing to build the brand. So in that particular market it will be a little dilutive but the gross margin structure is quite attractive.","Caroline Levy - CLSA","Thank you, and just moving to the growth of your markets. Do you believe that you outgrew the market not just in China, for example, but overall? And what do you think the market growth rate will be in 2013, new markets?","Mark Buthman","Broadly in the emerging markets, we would say you are probably looking at mid single-digit growth and we grew high-single. So we would say we probably took share in a number of places. Obviously some of the Nielsen data is a little tougher to get at because they are so many of points of distribution that aren\u2019t covered really well by Nielsen. It is getting better but we still got some room to grow there.","So, if you look at our global business, we would say the categories are growing three to four, much faster than that, probably mid-singles in emerging markets, slower than that in the developed markets. And so our 3% to 5% topline if we just hold share, we should be in the 3% to 4% range, if we drive some innovation and a little bit more share growth, we can get to the high end of that range as we did in 2012.","Caroline Levy - CLSA","Thank you, and just lastly, is January off to a good start, the year off to a good start?","Mark Buthman","Yes, so far. I have nothing to complain about. Yes, we haven\u2019t closed of the month yet, so want to see the results but nothing unusual that we seeing in the data so far.","Tom Falk","Cold and flu is, we are benefiting both family healthcare and facial tissue. It was pretty flat in December but it has picked up pace in January.","Mark Buthman","Yes, that\u2019s a good point.","Caroline Levy - CLSA","Well, I am sort of sorry, but happy to hear that.","Mark Buthman","Yes, good for us, bad for them.","Tom Falk","We are here for you, if you need us.","Caroline Levy - CLSA","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Connie Maneaty with BMO Capital Markets.","Connie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets","Morning, just two questions. What do you think the impact will be on retail prices in the U.S. from other new other tissue capacity that's coming on and do you think the branded companies would have to rollback prices to maintain an appropriate gap?","Tom Falk","Connie, I am not as worried about the U.S. market from the additional capacities. There's a lot of capacity that's gone out of the U.S. market, and so as we shutdown Everett and Chester there has been some of the capacity that came out of Chester, the U.S. market operating rate is probably in the in high 80% range. And, actually, we're fully loaded and we are our capacity pretty full up in 2012 and heading into 2013.","So, probably more of it is what's going to drive tissue pricing and whatever happens to pulp and we're calling pulp to be up slightly in 2013, so that should put a little bit of a positive spin on pricing. So, we had a little bit softer pricing in the third quarter, came back a little bit in the fourth quarter. That had more to do with timing of promotions year-over-year, so there is nothing big happening on that front, so we will have to wait and see. But overall, again, we feel better about our branded tissue business positioned going into 2013.","I think the place in the world you commented on the tissue capacity expansion was more in China, and we don't have a big the Chinese tissue business. We have a facial tissue business, so we don't do much in roll products in China.","Connie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets","Great. Thanks. My second question is what's included in your Venezuela impact? You said you are starting to build in some of a potential impact, so is it the effect of 50% devaluation or the impact of continued price controls in face of inflation, so what's included in your, what have you already assumed?","Tom Falk","Yes. This has been a tough one to call, because it's difficult to predict from day-to-day what's going to happen, so we have not included any of the balance sheet devaluation that would flow through the income statement, so none of the financial assets translation of the new rate is in our guidance, so that would be a one-time thing that we have to call out.","We really looked at that and said that was very low single-digit percent of sales and operating profit in 2012, but something is probably going to happen. Either there will be a de-val, which will have a translation impact. We didn't model it probably as deep as 50%, but we assume there will be some reduction or you could have a scenario where there is de-val, but it's tough to get foreign exchange and so we wind up constraining our supply, because we can't get dollars to pay our bills, so you wind up with a drop in demand and shrinking the size of the business and so it is very difficult to predict which of those would happened, but we said probably something is going to happen, so let's be a little bit conservative on that number going into the year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jason Gere with RBC Capital.","Jason Gere - RBC Capital","I had just a couple of questions. One as you think about 2013 with all the changes going on with Europe and the tissue restructuring. Is it going to be pretty smooth across the quarters or should we see that maybe back half a little stronger than the front half? I was just wondering if you could provide a little bit of the cadence there.","Tom Falk","Yes, and all the charges for the consumer tissue, the North American tissue restructuring has flown through the P&L amounts, so those are behind us and we took a good chunk of the European restructuring hit in the fourth quarter.","If you look at the sequencing of the year, I would expect actually a pretty consistent growth rate over the quarters year-on-year which would say that the back half is probably going to be a little better than the first half, because that was the way it shaped up in 2012, and so you get something that will help the first quarter and like we might have a little bit lower effective tax rate, because of the way the tax bill that got passed, but I would say the growth rate is going to trend pretty close to a consistent year-on-year across the quarters.","Jason Gere - RBC Capital","Okay. Great. Then just the next question, I think one of the earlier questions broke down the organic sales by geography and I hope you can provide some color in terms of about the segments tissue versus personal care versus kind of the B2B segment and how you are looking at those trends, where you may see any tip of acceleration versus deceleration versus 2012, with getting in within that 3 to 5 range?","Mark Buthman","Yes, if you go through personal care, we had hoped that North America will be a little better year-on-year, because the categories are not going to be down as much. So we should have, I think, for the year, and in infant care we were down 5% and flat on child care, wipes was down a little bit. So those should be better year-on-year.","In fem and adult, we are up high-singles in total for those. I think fem was up 6% and adult was up 10%. So I would say you would expect to see those collectively be in the high-singles in 13. K-C International was 9%. Now that was a terrific result. We probably won't keep that 45% growth rate in China but we still expect to have a strong growth rate in China in 2013. So maybe a little slower in KCI.","In consumer tissue, that\u2019s one that is playing more of a grow margin role for us. So we had relatively light volume growth. In North America it was flat. Overall Europe was down a little. Even KCI with down 1%. So I don\u2019t see huge growth coming in consumer tissue. In K-C professional, washroom business was up a 2%. We think we actually grew a little bit more than the category in washroom in 2012. We got a lot of innovation coming in 2013 and if we get a little bit of economic improvement, you could see a little bit better growth and in KCP. In KCP and in emerging markets, we were up 6% on the organic volume line and we have got actually lots of growth coming there. So I expect to see at least that in 2013.","Health care, our supplies were up 2%. Devices were up 3%. We probably expect supplies to be a little flatter and devices to be a little better in 2013. We have got some more innovation coming to market and a little bit better push in some things in the device front in 2013. So I though that\u2019s helpful for you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.","Lauren Lieberman - Barclays","Thanks, good morning. So, actually, the comment that you just made about consumer tissue playing more of a grow margin role for you guys, is exactly what I want to ask about. Because in this quarter, margins were actually down in that business which is rare to see when there is deflation. Thinking that the majority of your incremental investments and strategic marketing would be more oriented towards personal care than tissue, I just was curious if you could talk a little about margin performance in that business this quarter?","Mark Buthman","We were up 50 basis points sequentially. For the year, we were up 220 basis points in that business. So there are some cost start up issues and a couple of things in the quarter that were a little bit more noise versus fourth quarter last year. I think Europe also had a much stronger fourth quarter in 2011 that didn\u2019t repeat in 2012. So that was a part of it as well. But overall, I would say, the trends in consumer tissue we are happy with. It's back in 13.6% for the year, 14% for the quarter and that\u2019s getting close to where we need it to be from it being an investable business standpoint.","Lauren Lieberman - Barclays","Okay, can you just explain, Tom, some of the startup issues? Is that downtime? What is that?","Tom Falk","Actually, downtime, overall was a little better for the company year-on-year. We had some, broader in the fourth quarter broadly across a number of the segments. We had a little a little bit more startup activity on new assets. When you have a startup, typically you are writing off the old assets. So you had some higher startups and write-offs. So probably more of it was in personal care but consumer tissue had a little bit of it as well.","We also had some higher distribution expense, and particularly, in K-C International. As you are seeing carrier rates are up across the board around the world and consumer tissue probably feels that a little bit more than the other segment because freight's a bigger percent of cost of sales.","Operator","Our next question comes from James Armstrong with Vertical Research.","James Armstrong - Vertical Research","Good morning. First question is on the pulp and tissue restructuring benefits. You said that you are currently on a $60 million run rate in operating profit in the fourth quarter and expect $75 million in 2013 and more than $100 in 2014. Just to make sure, those are not incremental numbers, right? So in 2013, from the Q4 run rate, it will be more like $15 million.","Mark Buthman","That\u2019s correct.","James Armstrong - Vertical Research","Okay.","Mark Buthman","Each of those numbers was cumulative. So I think we had $20 million in '11, we had $40 million in '12, which gets you to $60 million cumulative. It will be another $15 million in 2013, which gives you the $75 million and so forth.","James Armstrong - Vertical Research","Okay. And, how is that weighted in 2012? Should we see a little bit more than that 15 number and in 2012, or maybe in 2013 just because of the timing?","Mark Buthman","No. I mean, we will obviously keep the cumulative 60 that we have already got and the big chunk of that was the shutdown of the Everett mill and that's done and behind us. And so, some of the additional things we decided to do at Chester, Pennsylvania started to benefit late 2012 and will carry forward into and to 2013 and 2014.","James Armstrong - Vertical Research","Perfect. Then switching gears just a bit, with the recent innovation and child care, have you seen any things that have worked? Any products that worked in certain regions that you are really starting to expand into other regions and could you just give us a few examples?","Mark Buthman","Yes. We have been very happy with the Pull-Ups, NightTime launch and that's gone well. We have also got a terrific GoodNites business that's in our Child Care segment and they actually had introduced a line extension of bed mats last year that was a big success in North America.","In terms of the ideas that are working well around the world, our whole diaper pants approach is going very well. We are going aggressive at both the value tier and premium tier in many markets around the world. That's gone well. Our U by Kotex list of feminine care positioning is one that were launching in multiple markets around the world. And then our upgraded Depend products, our adult care offerings, we are offering that in many markets around the world. So, these are things that we are we are focused on and have got great solutions.","I think another example will be baby wipes. You know, we've done baby wipes in North America and Europe. We are really having them fully reflected and penetrated in other markets around the world and now we are trying to figure out what would it take if we could sell one wipe for every diaper we sell around the world. If we could do that, we have $1 billion baby wipe business, so there's a big opportunity there for us.","James Armstrong - Vertical Research","That helps a lot. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank","Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank","You guys want to call a bottom to the baby bust, because it seems you are a little bit more upbeat on.","Tom Falk","That sounds like a quote, Bill, bottom to the baby bust. I like it. No, I think the birthrate has flattened out. We expect it to be basically flat in 2013. The category, albeit, will probably still be down 1% on diapers in North America. And I would say, for us as we have modeled it, the three drivers that are more predictive are male unemployment, or new home purchase or household formation and consumer confidence.","And I think as you see those things stabilize, you would say yes all right. That kind of make sense, but the birth rate would be flattening out. It hasn't turned up yet, but I would say you have not seen any of those three indicators really make a major positive move lately either.","Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank","Got you, and then was there an impact from the flu season, because I know when you talked about the North American consumer tissue business, there's really no mention of facial tissue?","Tom Falk","Yes. There wasn't much in the fourth quarter. We're seeing that more in the start of the year. And we worked pretty good at looking at flu index data almost by zip code, and so are our retail partners and so they are very nimble about getting flu displays up as the flu move into a particular a part of the country, and so both our health care business has been selling a lot of face masks and exam gloves in January, and we've been selling a lot more facial tissue for cold and flu in January, so we will see how that progresses through the quarter.","Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank","Got you. Then are you concerned at all about that if you look at the business segments three to four had declined at sequential margins. I mean, was it that third quarter was kind of anomaly and everything was so good?","Tom Falk","So the point we made earlier on the other cost of sales, we probably had a little bit more start ups in fourth quarter and some asset write outs that affected us versus the third quarter then distribution expense started to pick up in a couple of markets and so we are digging into that, but I would say I am pretty happy with the progress for the year. We are up in all four segments year-on-year and that's really what we are aiming to do consistently over time.","Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank","I mean, is it a way to say that it was like the third quarter the anomaly or was the fourth quarter the anomaly, or is it not that simple.","Tom Falk","I don't think if I could be that precise with you. If I would say you look at personal care and are second end of the year that if we could be flat with 2011, we would be happy and we ended the year 60 basis points higher. So, we probably are a little ahead in third quarter of where we expected and it normalized a bit in the fourth quarter, but it broadly for the year, we're pleased with the progress we are making.","Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank","Great. Thanks and then just one last one. Did you say what the sales impact of the distribution sell for the mid tier in China was? Was it material to the top line?","Tom Falk","No. We didn't spill that out. So I mean the midtier in China is the biggest part of the category. So going into that was a plus. Now we started that in mid-2011. So it wasn\u2019t a full year benefit but that was certainly part of the growth that we saw in China this year. We also picked up a couple of share points in China this year which, in a market that size, is substantial from a sales standpoint.","Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank","Got you, and maybe I missed this, but can you talk about your country penetration in midtier? I am sorry, not retail penetration in China? Is it down or is there, I think you said, still some room there?","Mark Buthman","We were in 70 cities at the beginning of 2012. We were 80 by the end of 2012. We hope to be in 90 by the end of 2013. As you know, there are any more cities with at least a million people and that we are really not present in yet. So we have got ways to go to really be fully penetrated. Then there are other geographies as well.","We are moving more aggressively in the Northeastern part of Brazil. We have been present but not really fully leveraging the opportunity there. So we are putting capacity up there and a little more dedicated sales effort. So that will help.","In Russia, the same kind of thing, where we had a strong presence in the Moscow region but we are moving into some of the other former Soviet republics in the Central Asian countries and other Eastern European countries.","Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank","Got you, and I promise, one last one. Do you think that advertising spend is going to track pulp cost because it seems like that\u2019s the way it played out this year when it went 45 to 35 and then 25 and then 10?","Mark Buthman","No, I think it more track our innovation pipeline. We had more innovation that was frontend loaded this year and we are going spend behind good ideas and saw more of that than trying to drive pulp. A good chunk of the increased A&P is in personal care and in emerging markets where we are driving launch activity.","Operator","Our next question comes from Javier Escalante with Consumer Edge Research.","Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research","Hi, good morning, everyone. I just would to go back to your forecast for the year and the commentary that the diaper category you expect to go down about 1% and that your expectation is that the birth rate may improve. We had done some analysis and we see basically the sales of newborn diapers being down 1% to 2% on top of minus 4% last year. So we thought that that would be a leading indicator of whether newborn were picking up and we don\u2019t see that in the data. The counter part of that is that your business is more exposed to late stage diapering, training pants. So how that plans out in terms of your better outlook in the U.S., is number one? We don\u2019t see that in the data yet. Number two, actually your business depends on later stage diapering.","Mark Buthman","I guess, I would say, Javier, we are looking at from predictive model for the birth rate. So we are looking at the male unemployment and consumer confidence also formation as more of a leading indicator of where it is going. As we backed up that has been the best fit model. So that model would say, has been predicting that the birth rate, we get less negative all year. That is pretty much what's happened. It's predicting for 2013, the birth rate flattens out where it is now.","So when we talked about the diaper category being down about 1%, it is more that affect that as the babies haven\u2019t been born in the last two years are not category now. So they won't be there in 2013 either. Certainly has affected our child care business more significantly this year as you had three or four years of birth rate decline at a total 8% or 9% that\u2019s been showing up in our training pant business. We expect most of that is behind us and expect a little bit better or less negative category environment in 2013 than we had in 2012.","Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research","That is good and my second question also has to do with what is your view what's happening in consumer tissue business and also in the U.S., I mean here bath issue and paper towels. You mentioned that private label picked up one to two points and a lot of it has come in from the competition, from your main competitor which has been innovating in the category, both paper towels and bath tissue and they are losing share. You guys don\u2019t seem to be losing share. Could you help us understand how you see the consumer dynamics and why you are not been as pressured by private label as your competitors has been? Thank you.","Mark Buthman","Yes, we had more innovation. So if you look at the fourth quarter, our Kleenex volumes were 1%, Cottonelle was up 8%, Scott bath was up 1%, our Viva towel business was done a 2% and Scott towels is up 11%. So some of that was promotional timing, some of it we had good innovation on Cottonelle and it's a terrific product. And, so, I think we just continue to try to make sure we get quality promotion, we are doing great marketing, we keep bring innovation to the category and that makes it tougher for the private labels to fight against that, so it's a pretty simple formula.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Faucher with JPMorgan.","John Faucher - JPMorgan","Hi, guys. Just want to follow-up a little bit on Chris's question, but sort of thinking about the margin structure in Europe longer-term, how should we think about where you guys can go as you get through some of the stranded overhead issues? What do you think is a sort of the long-term structural upside to margins there? Thanks.","Tom Falk","Yes. I would say, medium-term, we would say double-digit operating margin is a reasonable goal, which would be a good improvement from where we have been, but then as Kim and the team look at that, they'd say long-term, they would like Europe to be at least equal to the corporate average and so they have got some work to do to get there.","They, don't have all the answers to figure that out, but we've got good businesses in categories that are growing in Europe and the whole point of this restructuring effort is to the free up that team to focus on driving our baby wipes business where we've got good accretive margins and driving our child care and DryNites businesses, where we've got strong margin opportunities and making our Kleenex and Andrex and Scottex businesses successful in Europe and there are already great brands with great market positions, but we've got to put more up innovation and investment behind them to make them produce the kind of returns that we are looking for. So, I think, we got to execute the plan in front of us and get to a stable consistent place and then look how we can grow that from there.","John Faucher - JPMorgan","Okay, so just a follow-up on that. It sound as though you feel like you guys, there is nothing structural to the categories themselves in Europe that would limit that. It's a question you are being able to go out and execute that?","Tom Falk","Well, I think in Europe the big thing you worry about particularly in tissue is private label, so the private label structure in Europe is very different from anywhere else in the world where you are seeing bath tissue in some markets shares North of 70% for private label, so you've got be much probably a little bit more cost conscious and your innovations got to pop a little bit more to break through that.","John Faucher - JPMorgan","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Next question comes from Linda Bolton Weiser with Caris.","Linda Bolton Weiser - Caris","Hi. I was just wondering if on your projections for $150 million to $250 million of input cost inflation, is there any way to split it up roughly between like second half and first half? I would think quite a bit more in the second half.","Mark Buthman","Well, about two thirds of it is pulp and recycled fiber and you probably are right that in the first part of the year, at least the first quarter that doesn't look like there is going to be as much of that showing up so far, so that's probably a fair comment.","Linda Bolton Weiser - Caris","Okay, that's actually all I had. Thanks.","Operator","At this time, we have no other questioners in the queue.","Paul Alexander","All right, thank you, David. We will wrap up with the closing comment from Tom.","Tom Falk","Once again, we had a strong performance in 2012 and we are looking forward to keeping the momentum going in 2013, and thank you for your support of Kimberly-Clark.","Mark Buthman","Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's presentation. You may disconnect your phone lines and a wonderful weekend."],"12598":["Kimberly-Clark Corporation (NYSE:KMB) Q2 2019 Earnings Conference Call July 23, 2019 10:00 AM ET","Company Participants","Paul Alexander - Vice President of Investor Relations","Mike Hsu - Chief Executive Officer","Maria Henry - Chief Financial Officer","Conference Call Participants","Ali Dibadj - Bernstein","Lauren Lieberman - Barclays","Dara Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley","Wendy Nicholson - Citigroup","Bonnie Herzog - Wells Fargo","Cody Ross - Goldman Sachs","Andrea Teixeira - JPMorgan","Olivia Tong - Bank of America","Steve Strycula - UBS","Caroline Levy - Macquarie Capital","Kevin Grundy - Jefferies","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your patience and holding. We now have your presenters in conference. Please be aware that each of your lines is in a listen-only mode. At the conclusion of this morning's presentation, we will open the floor for questions. At that time, instructions will be given as to the procedure to follow if you would like to ask an audio question.","It is now my pleasure to introduce Mr. Paul Alexander.","Paul Alexander","Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Kimberly-Clark's second quarter earnings conference call. With us today are Mike Hsu, our Chief Executive Officer; and Maria Henry, our CFO. Here is the agenda for the call. Maria will begin with a review of second quarter results. After that, Mike will provide his perspectives on our results and the outlook for the full-year. We will finish with Q&A. We have a presentation of today's materials in the Investors section of our website.","As a reminder, we will be making forward-looking statements today. Please see the Risk Factors section of our latest Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of forward-looking statements. Lastly, we will be referring to adjusted results and outlook, which exclude certain items described in this morning's news release. That release has further information about these adjustments and reconciliations to comparable GAAP financial measures.","And now, I will turn the call over to Maria.","Maria Henry","Thanks, Paul, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining the call today. Let me start with the headlines for the quarter. Organic sales increased 5% driven by higher net selling prices. We achieved strong cost savings, margin improvements and growth in adjusted earnings per share. And finally, we are broadly on-track with our overall capital plan and we continue to return cash to shareholders.","Now let's cover the details of our results starting with sales. Our second quarter net sales were $4.6 billion. That is even with a year-ago and includes a five-point drag from currency rates. Organic sales were up 5% compared to flat performance in the base period. Net selling prices increased 5% and product mix improved one point, while volumes fell slightly. Mike will provide some more color in our top-line in just a few minutes.","Moving on to profitability. Second quarter adjusted gross margin was 34.6%, up 120 basis points year-on-year. Adjusted gross profit increased 3% [indiscernible]. We now expect full-year commodity inflation of $150 million to $250 million. On average that is $150 million lower than our previous estimate. The reduction is driven primarily by cost and secondarily other raw materials.","Other manufacturing costs also increased in the quarter compared to a relatively modest level last year. These costs are expected to be a bit higher than we planned for, for the full-year. Moving further down the P&L, between the lines spending was up 90 basis points as a percent of sales. That included higher advertising as we are investing more behind our brands, particularly in digital. G&A expense also increased, driven by higher incentive compensation.","For the full-year, because we have raised our sales and earnings outlook, we have also increased our incentive compensation estimate. The increase versus our original plan is equal to more than 1% of total operating profit. About half of that increase was reflected in our second quarter results.","Foreign currencies were also a headwind in the quarter, reducing operating profit by a high-single digit rate. All in all, adjusted operating profit was up 2%. Second quarter adjusted operating margin was 17.2%, up 40 basis points versus a year-ago. That included broad-based margin improvements in all three business segments.","On the bottom-line, adjusted earnings per share were $1.67, up 5% year-on-year. In addition to the higher operating profit, the bottom-line benefited from a slightly lower adjusted effective tax rate, higher equity income and a lower share count.","Let's turn to cash flow and capital efficiency. Cash provided by operations in the second quarter was $609 million compared to $787 million in the year-ago quarter. The decrease was generally in line with our expectations and driven by higher tax payments and increased working capital. Capital spending was $253 million in the quarter. ","As expected that is up versus last year, driven by supply chain restructuring projects. We continue to allocate capital in shareholder friendly ways. Second quarter dividends and share repurchases totaled $520 million and we continue to expect that full-year amount will be between $2 billion and $2.3 billion.","Looking at our segment results, in Personal Care, organic sales were up 8%. Net selling prices increased 5% and volumes and product mix were each up one point. Personal Care operating margins were 21.2%, up 80 basis points year-on-year. The improvement was driven by organic sales growth and cost savings.","In Consumer Tissue, organic sales were up 4%. Net selling prices increased 5% and product mix improved slightly, while volumes fell 2%. Consumer Tissue operating margins were 15%, up 90 basis points versus year-ago with significant benefits from higher pricing.","In K-C Professional, organic sales grew 1%. Selling prices rose 3% and product mix improved a point [while volumes were down 3%. K-C Professional operating margins of 19.7% were up 50 basis points versus prior year. So all in all, we delivered very good results in the quarter while continuing to invest for future success.","I will now turn the call over to Mike.","Mike Hsu","Okay. Thanks, Maria. Good morning, everyone. Let me start by saying we made excellent progress in the second quarter. We are executing our 2019 plan well with a strong focus on price realization to improve our margins. We are launching innovations investing more in our brands and pursuing growth priorities for longer term success. We are also continuing to return significant cash to shareholders.","As Maria just mentioned, we delivered 5% organic sales growth in the second quarter and while that compares to a soft year-ago, this was our best performance in over three years. Our pricing initiatives are on-track. Our volumes are ahead of expectations both in terms of the impact from price increases and from our growth initiatives. We also continue to improve mix, which was up one point for the second consecutive quarter.","Let me share some of the top-line highlights starting in North America. Organic sales in consumer products increased 5% compared to a 2-point decline last year. Year-to-date, organic sales were up 3%, which is likely a better reflection of our ongoing performance. Growth in the quarter was driven by 4% higher selling prices.","Our pricing plans are on-track. Volumes in North America were up slightly overall. Adult care volumes were up high-single digits and we recently launched innovations on both Poise and Depend to keep that momentum going.","Earlier this month, we launched Huggies Special Delivery, our new super premium diaper. Special Delivery uses the best of our technology from around the world. This is our softest diaper. It's made with plant-based materials and provides ultimate skin comfort. It's also premium priced and a great example of our elevate the core strategy in action. In North American consumer K-C Professional, organic sales increased 2%, driven by disciplined execution of our pricing initiatives.","Turning to developing and emerging markets, organic sales rose 9% and that included 3.5 points of growth from Argentina, which is consistent with our plan. In terms of our key personal care businesses, in Brazil, organic sales were up double digits driven by higher selling prices. While category volumes remain sluggish, we are driving strong growth through disciplined market execution and focused expansion efforts in baby wipes and adult care.","In China, organic sales were up double-digits compared to a soft performance last year. In diapers, our net price realization was helped by reduced and more targeted promotional spending.","While Huggies total volumes were down, the product innovations we have launched are delivering growth in the premium end of our lineup and improving mix significantly. In fem care, we had another strong quarter and we are on-track to achieve 20%-plus organic growth for the third consecutive year.","In ASEAN, organic sales rose about 10% with continued volume strength on Huggies diapers in Vietnam. In Eastern Europe, organic sales increased about 20%, driven by double-digit volume growth and positive pricing. Our momentum on both Huggies and Kotex reflects excellent sales execution, winning product innovation and great marketing.","Finally, in developed markets outside North America, organic sales were up 1% with solid performance in South Korea and Australia. Beyond sales, I'm very encouraged with the margin improvement we have delivered while investing more in our business.","Now turning to the full-year. We are raising our outlook on both the top and bottom-line. On the top-line, we are increasing our organic sales outlook to 3%, and that is one point higher than our original plan and driven by stronger volumes. On the bottom-line. We are now targeting adjusted earnings per share of $6.65 to $6.80, and that compares favorably to our prior outlook of $6.50 to $6.70.","Our updated outlook reflects strong execution, the improving commodity environment and higher reinvestment levels. We are encouraged that the commodity outlook has gotten better, and that is especially true for pulp, which has retreated from all time high levels although costs remain elevated from a longer term perspective.","We aren't expecting a significant increase in market promotion activity despite the improved commodity environment, but we will continue to closely monitor competitive activity. We are increasing growth investments in our brands and commercial capabilities to position us better for the long-term success. Brand investments include more digital advertising, digital continues to improve marketing ROI and help us grow in many parts of our business.","We are also going to invest to improve our commercial capabilities, including revenue management, which is a focus of K-C Strategy 2022. Overall, we expect to bring some of the commodity benefits to the bottom-line while also reinvesting more for top-line growth. That is consistent with our balanced value creation model we outlined in K-C Strategy 2022.","So in summary, we have made excellent progress in the first half. We are raising our full-year outlook and investing more for the long-term, and we are confident in our ability to create shareholder value.","That concludes our prepared remarks. And now, we will be glad to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ali Dibadj with Bernstein.","Ali Dibadj","Hey, guys. A few questions for me actually. One is on free cash flow. Maria, you mentioned that particularly on the working capital side, it was a planned change, but a pretty big reduction in free cash flow this year versus last year even if you try to adjust for some sense of restructuring. So I would love a sense of why that shouldn't worry us at all in terms of that trajectory, and what you think the trajectory looks like going forward on the free cash flow side.","Maria Henry","Sure. We said coming into the year that we were expecting operating cash flow to be down slightly year-on-year, and we still expect that. If you look at the quarter, the cash from operations of 609 was driven by higher cash taxes, and working capital was also a use of funds. So let me talk about both of those.","On cash taxes, it really has to do with timing. You look at the first part of 2018, we were in an overpayment situation, and so we were paying out less cash taxes last year than what would be kind of a normalized level. This year we have the opposite. We have some catch-up payments that we had to make in the first half of this year and in the second quarter, and so that is what is going on with cash taxes. It just has to do with timing. I wouldn't call anything unusual out there.","In terms of working capital, there is a number of factors. Our cash conversion days were 13, which compares to what was a very strong 11 days in 2018. And you'll recall that in the fourth quarter of last year, we had very strong cash flow benefits from working capital. We had very low cash conversion days. Part of that was driven by a higher payables balance, which got paid out in the first part of this year.","In terms of working capital and cash conversion days, we are expecting and we are seeing inventory build around our execution on the restructuring programs. As we close down facilities or prepare to close down facilities and shut down lines and prepare to stand up new lines, we are building inventory so that we can maintain our service levels with customers, and we are seeing that.","On the accounts receivable or DSO side, we have got in the second quarter some timing differences between the sales and collections, particularly with the quarter ending on a Sunday. So I would expect on the receivables side that to correct itself as we go through the remainder of the year.","And finally, on payables, the team is executing some projects to get some benefits there, and that was a positive, helping to offset the drag on inventory and the timing differences on DSO. So it's a long answer, but I would expect for the second half that we will have stronger free cash flow and that, for the year, we will still be down little bit, Ali.","Ali Dibadj","Okay. Okay. A bit of improvement for me. Okay. I appreciate the confidence of answer and will keep watching it. A couple of other things. One is, I guess I was initially encouraged to see the emerging and developed markets growing 9% this quarter, saw China pricing a little bit better and start to ask the question of, oh gosh, are we back to kind of this high-single digit type growth rates sustainably in the emerging markets for Kimberly-Clark?","But then, I saw that you mentioned Argentina with 3.5 points of that 9% growth, Mike. Brazil probably helped you out a little bit as well. China, it seems like you are investing a lot in that marketplace as well, hopefully on the volume side. So just that kind of perked my expectations and my hope to a return of improvement in Kimberly-Clark emerging in developed markets. Could you kind of right size our expectations on that on a sustainable basis, please?","Mike Hsu","Yes, Ali. Good point. I think I would say overall in D&E, we are very encouraged and we are making strong progress. That 9%, it's robust, and I would say it's the fourth consecutive quarter of accelerated performance. If you go back to the third quarter of last year, I think we were up 3%, then 4%, 7% in the first quarter and then 9% this quarter.","And while Argentina is a chunk of that, about a little over 3 points, we are seeing improved performance across many of the markets. Obviously price mix is a big piece of it, but we are seeing certainly less volume impact from pricing from some of the significant pricing we have taken, for example, in Brazil and Argentina, less volume impact than we originally expected.","And then, on the positive front, in other markets, I would say, CE continues to grow at a strong double-digit rate. We are seeing ASEAN growth at double-digits, and then China obviously returning to growth, certainly aided by pricing or maybe, said a different way, some reductions in promotion spending in China. But we are seeing a good volume growth in our premium tiers, and we are very encouraged by that progress.","Ali Dibadj","Okay. And just my last question may be a little bit of a broader question, the discourse around Kimberly-Clark among investors is that I think people generally understand that pricing has been pretty good because of commodity-driven pricing and the SKUs were better because P&G and GP and perhaps some of the competition in China was a little bit more stable. Brazil seems like it's getting a little bit better. Commodity costs were less than what we had anticipated, and all those things in kind of the Kimberly-Clark ecosystem are doing pretty well.","But the challenge often in that discourse is, okay, so what is Kimberly-Clark itself doing? What was company-specific here that Kimberly-Clark is doing that could benefit it differentially besides cost savings in particular? I think we all appreciate that cost savings has been quite good. But it's kind of like the ecosystem's going in Kimberly's favor, but we are not quite sure what company specifics are happening here. So if you could help us, at least enlighten us on that, that'd be helpful. Thank you.","Mike Hsu","Yes, Ali. Great question. It's certainly, I think, one of the big things is the operating environment has improved, right. And I think that is significantly better than when we met maybe toward the end of January. And I think the consumer demand is healthier than it was then, and I would say our performance is better than it was then.","One of the reasons why we are seeing less volume impact is not because elasticities are lower. In fact, as we do the analysis, the elasticities are pretty close to what we modeled. It is really more than market execution. And what we got is, I think, very strong innovation and new products coming out across, let's say, North America, particularly in Personal Care. We have got strong marketing in those markets as well driving an improvement consumption.","I think, the China business I think is, we are in China for the long haul, and I think the team really believes in innovation there and I think the consumers following. And so, we are seeing strong growth in our premium tiers behind, we think, the best diaper in the marketplace right now. And so there is a lot going on there.","And if you look at Latin America, double-digit pricing with almost minimal volume impact, it's not because there is low elasticity. It's because there is really strong innovation marketing and actually terrific sales execution.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.","Lauren Lieberman","Great. Thanks. Good morning. Just following on that, I think it's telling, Mike, how many times you just mentioned kind of terrific sales execution, and it feels like in some of your larger emerging markets, I'm curious to the degree to which I guess what is changed? So you alluded to, of course, better operating environment but the Kimberly-Clark specific piece, let's go back to maybe what was missing or not as strong over the last two to three years from a commercial execution standpoint, because I think that is a piece of the equation I'm still not grabbing onto and then it would be and so many markets at once that the executions driven have been like a step change. So anything further you could offer there would be great.","Mike Hsu","Yes, Lauren. I think it's a combination of factors I just mentioned, which is, I think, the operating environment has improved, in which I think the consumer can see the innovation and the product and the marketing and respond to it. And if you rewind a couple of years ago, it's tough to see innovation and advertising when you are going against a buy one get two free, right. So pouring advertising into a marketplace like that is not effective.","But I think where the teams - and we always believe in elevating our categories or driving better product benefit by making the premium products worth it. And so I think we have got plenty of innovation across markets that I just mentioned that is taken a hold and getting the consumers' attention and we are encouraged by that response.","And then obviously, I think all of us in CPG we all know when you have good innovation, it allows your sales force to execute much more effectively and get the shelf space you need, drive the promotions you need, and all that kind of behavior close with it.","So I don't think there is a magic bullet there, but I would say that I think we all were focused on a disciplined way building our capabilities both in innovation, in digital, which is a big space for us for marketing, sales execution and revenue management. Those are the big capability areas we have been focusing on, and we are making a lot of progress.","Lauren Lieberman","Okay, great. And then now with the commodity environment being more benign and even just with your outlook obviously for this year but even as we look forward to 2020, with that as a backdrop and thinking about the things you laid out as core to your tenure, investing in selling capabilities, marketing, digital, revenue management, there is data needs to get it at those sorts of activities, how are you thinking about the greater flexibility you may well have today versus what you thought six months ago and the reinvestment needs of the business, particularly the new Chief Growth Officer coming on who may have sort of a different perspective on what can be done with your suite of brands?","Mike Hsu","Yes, I mean - Lauren, we are very bullish on our categories both in the near-term and long-term and I think that comes back to kind of two of the core strategies we have, which is in big developed markets, elevating the core or premiumizing our categories by making the categories worth more to our consumers. And then of course we are still in the very early stages of development.","So, I think maybe the commodities have been a little lower than we expected at the beginning of the year, that does give us the flexibility. I think, the - when you add up the operating environment, which I think is more conducive to growth and consumer demand is healthier than we have seen maybe in the past year or so, I think that gives us the confidence to invest.","The other part of it is, we have talked about this back in January, which is I think our - with the innovation and the marketing initiatives and the sales initiatives working, that gives us more confidence to put more money behind that, and we are very excited about that.","Operator","Thank you, our next question comes from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Ms. Mohsenian, your line may be on mute. You may unmute to ask your question.","Dara Mohsenian","\u2026mid-single-digit pricing in the last couple quarters, but that was predicated upon a much higher commodity environment than we are sitting at today. So, curious if you are seeing any initial signs in pickup and promotion from either branded label or branded competitors with the recent commodity pullback? And as you look going forward, you commented that you don't expect to see a significant increase in market promotion. What gives you confidence behind that, and that you won't have to dial back some of this pricing eventually?","Mike Hsu","Hey, Dara, I think we only got the last part of it, so I will try to answer it, but maybe you can push me if I'm not kind of going the direction you were asking for.","But I think it was related to pricing and what the environment looks like. Right now, I would say, overall our pricing initiatives overall across globally are on-track, maybe a little more focused on North America, they are also on-track. Probably the big area for us was in North America Consumer Tissue. I think the pricing was up as we expected. The big difference was private label in general still has not moved, but we are still seeing good volume growth from our brands, and probably a little bit in excess of what we had planned.","I think, at this point, we have not seen an uptick in maybe competitive promotional pricing. Don't expect it, mostly because this is a multi-year issue for us, and we have had commodity inflation at record highs. It's still at a very high level. And so, for us, we are not planning - our plans don't have high promotion intensity. We are really focused on marketing the innovation that we have, and driving the advertising.","I will pause there, and maybe is that what you were looking for or something else?","Dara Mohsenian","Yes. That is helpful. And then, if I could just slip in a second question, the gap between North American reported results and the U.S. scanner data looked like it widened pretty significantly to a few hundred basis points. Was there some inventory build that retail, particularly with the innovations that you mentioned, or is that more just a function of very strong untracked channel growth? And maybe while we are on the subject, can you give us a bit of an update on e-commerce in the club channel, your sales growth and market share performance there? That'd be helpful.","Mike Hsu","Yes, a little different there. I think what we said in our commentary that maybe the plus 3% was probably a better - if you look at year-to-date, we are plus 3%. That is probably the best indication of where we think our business is right now. We did have a few differences, certainly non-measured for us is generally stronger than measured. So that is an ongoing refrain, and a good thing in some ways.","Also we had some spending changes that affected net revenue realization. I recognize we are still - dialing back to your prior question, we are still dialing back our promotion intensity. And so that affected it. And then we did have some minor retail inventory changes, but we had those in a lot of quarters.","Dara Mohsenian","Okay. That is helpful. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Wendy Nicholson with Citigroup.","Wendy Nicholson","Hi. Good morning. There was just a comment in the North America commentary in Personal Care that caught my eye, which was number one, that volumes were up high single digits in adult care. And I was curious what drove that because I know that is been obviously a very high margin area for you, but it's an area that is been under pressure. So is that category growth or is it innovation or more promotion that you doing? And then, similarly, volumes down mid-single digits in fem care in North America. What is the plan there? I know it's been - I mean, your Kotex restates that you did a few years ago was so successful. Are there any plans for a follow-up to that? What are your plans in fem care to get that business growing again? And I'm really focused on volumes, not pricing. Thanks.","Mike Hsu","Yes. We are making progress on adult care, Wendy, up high-single digit. I think the category is up somewhere - probably about mid single-digit in that range, and I think really it's about innovation and category messaging, category-building messaging that is gaining traction for us. Definitely our product enhancements that we launched last year are gaining traction, discrete sizing. We have got Fit-Flex on Depend is going out now, and then Poise Active, and those are all working pretty well for us.","And then, we have got strong brand investment and more messaging that is more category-building. So I think those of the two things that are working in adult care. In fem care, it's a great category. We have got a great global franchise. We know we need to strengthen the performance of the brand in the U.S., and the team is focused on product enhancements and improving our messaging.","Wendy Nicholson","Perfect. Then just going back to your comment on pricing generally, I can't remember the last time companies like you got the benefit of favorable pricing and favorable commodity impact. It's just been a long time. Those usually work opposite. And so, just as you think about the current commodity environment, I know you said you don't expect promotional levels to increase, which, I hope that is the case, but that would strike me as a surprise. But as you look toward calendar '20, the pricing that you have taken, at what point in the cycle do you get to a point where you need to contemplate may be rolling back some of the price increases you have taken, particularly in categories where you still are struggling from a market share perspective. Why not be the aggressor there, if you will? Thanks.","Mike Hsu","Yes, I think, if you sit on this side of the phone, you have a memory like an elephant. So, last year, I think our commodity inflation was $500 million or $600 million more than our plan. And so, this year, it's a little more favorable but not even close to that. And so, again as I said, the commodity impact is a multi-year impact, and I think that is driving our behavior as we work to recover margins.","And right now, I think, we are seeing in the retail environment consumer demand is healthy. I think, in this environment, consumers could be more responsive to innovation and marketing, and I think that is a bit more value-added for us and our competitors to grow the categories versus driving a doom cycle of promotion.","Wendy Nicholson","Fair enough. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo.","Bonnie Herzog","Alright. Thank you. Good morning. I actually had a follow-on question on private-label pricing, which has remained largely unchanged in some of your key track channel category such as diapers. So, just want to hear from you guys how concerned you are with private label choosing not to follow your pricing moves. And then, separately, could you comment on whether you are seeing any stepped-up competitive pressures from some of your online retail partners with their own private label offerings?","Mike Hsu","Yes. We are watching the private label pricing pretty closely. It hasn't moved notably in Consumer Tissue or specifically in the Bath category, or in diapers yet. I do think our brands are performing very well despite that. And I think that speaks to the iconic nature of Scott 1000, our new advertising and our product enhancements with Cottonelle, so we feel good about that direction, but it's something that we have got the keep a sharp eye on. Obviously we are a volume-sensitive business, and so while we may fine-tune our promotional plans to make sure we get the volumes that we need, we are going to manage this category - our role in the category very responsibly.","Bonnie Herzog","Alright. Thanks. And then just a second question for me on China. Could you drill down just a little further on your performance in that market? And it seems like volumes still seem to be under pressure, so just wanted to understand from you when we can see that turn positive or improves further.","Mike Hsu","Yes, OK. China, our biggest short-term opportunity and our biggest long-term opportunity, and I think the team is working in the right direction, which is making the investment in innovation. And we feel like we have the best diaper in the market right now. Organic was up double-digits with big contributions from both Diapers and Fem Care. In Diapers, we launched a breakthrough, what we call, our 5D diaper toward the end of - middle of last year, and we think that is the best in the market, and that is really fueling the gains.","We are up significantly in the premium tiers, still down a bit in the value tiers, but we are managing through that. Some of that is conscious because we have chosen to dial back the promotional price points or raise our promotional price points. And so that drove some of the net price realization that we had in the category. But I would say, we are growing in the tiers that are very important to us, which is premium, and still declining a little bit in the value tiers. Bonnie?","Bonnie Herzog","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason English with Goldman Sachs.","Cody Ross","Good morning, everybody. This is actually Cody on for Jason. Perhaps the biggest surprise to us was the 8% organic sales growth in Personal Care. Developing and emerging markets were led by price, which could be fleeting, but North America had a balanced contribution for the first time in many years. Can you provide more details and tell us what is driving this specifically? What you think your end-market growth is compared to what it was a quarter or two ago? How much market share do you think you are taking? And which categories are you seeing the most share gain in? And how sustainable do you think that is?","Mike Hsu","Yes, good point, Cody. I think we are very pleased with the balanced nature of the growth in North America Personal Care. I think organic was up 6%, and that was balanced between being up 3% in price and 3% in volume for us. And that really reflects, in our mind, strong product innovation and really strong end-market execution.","In Diapers, we just launched - we got great innovation coming out, and we just launched Huggies Special Delivery, which is going to deliver ultimate skin comfort. And it's got a lot of features. And if you'll indulge me, our softest diaper delivers really trusted protection.","It's got plant-based materials, free of parabens and other harsh chemicals, and hypoallergenic for baby's skin. So it's got a great product, great designs and packaging. And it's priced at a significant premium. And Cody, that is been a - it's really a good indicator or a good example of our elevate-the-core strategy in action. So we are excited about that.","In adult care, likewise we have got, as I just mentioned earlier, a number of product enhancements in Depend and Poise, and those are both working - those are all working well in the market.","Cody Ross","Great. Thank you. My other question was your revised guidance calls for higher marketing spend and G&A costs. Can you just provide more details about your spending initiatives? What products is it behind? When should we expect it to hit? And then also, what caused you to increase your spending outlook? Was it just reinvesting the savings that you have from a lower commodity outlook?","Mike Hsu","Yes, Cody, it's a couple things. One, certainly the outlook had a piece of it, but it's also, given the robustness of consumer demand and I think the improving conditions in the operating environment, gives us the confidence to invest. And then, that said, some of the early returns from our innovation and our marketing thus far to date, I think, gives us more confidence to invest further.","So the big areas, I think Maria mentioned - Digital is one big area for us that is working effectively for us in a lot of areas. It has strong ROIs, driving a lot of the parts of our business, what we would call direct digital marketing in North America Personal Care and Tissue. China, Fem, Diapers in Russia, I think we have got multiple markets.","And then, from a capability perspective, we are also investing in people, process and tools to accelerate some of the capabilities that I outlined, including our end-market execution and our revenue growth management initiatives.","Cody Ross","Great. Thank you. And if I can just sneak in one housekeeping item, you guys have had strong cost savings so far year-to-date. Even if commodities should come below your outlook for about $150 million to $250 million, should we still expect you to hit that target range of $400 million to $450 million in savings?","Maria Henry","We are tracking well on our way to delivering the $400 million to $450 million savings this year. What I would say is the composition of that may be a bit different than what we were thinking. Our teams are delivering solid FORCE cost savings as they work to deliver productivity and cost reductions in our manufacturing operations. Our restructuring program is very much on-track. At the end of the day, it's possible that our FORCE savings for the year may come in a bit light, and our restructuring savings may come in a bit better than we had anticipated coming into the year. But in total, on the $400 million to $450 million combined savings, I think we are well on our way to deliver that.","Cody Ross","Great. Thank you very much. I will pass it along.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan.","Andrea Teixeira","Thank you. Good morning. How are you? So I have two questions. First to Maria, on the new guidance, what are you assuming for pulp prices? And should we see commodities, I guess, the spot prices have been rolling over by more than anticipated. So, in your outlook, as we progress for the year and probably as you said in a multi-year effect, should we see the timing of these contracts finally having a bigger impact and the levels like being conservative on this guidance and the revised guidance is because you don't have visibility of how long it's going to linger these lower prices?","And then, the second question is about China. So, you have an impressive quarter. So in the premium segment that is finally more than offset the near tier segment decline, is it sustained more or you are seeing or you are being able to increase the marketing in spite of these marketing spend that you alluded to for the fast-growing channels, including online and baby stores? Thank you.","Maria Henry","Alright. Why don't I start with the commodity outlook. I guess, a good place to start on commodities is just a reminder that commodities were inflationary in the quarter, and still a headwind for us in the second quarter to the tune of about 10% impact on our operating profit. But that said, they did come in a bit better than we expected. And while they were inflationary, it was the lowest level of inflation that we have seen in two years.","So we are pleased with that. Costs on some of the resin-based materials as well as pulp and results of fiber all these versus our plan mostly in North America. We still do see inflation outside of North America, particularly in Latin America. Distribution costs are also continuing to run high. There is no change in our view on that, but they do continue to run high.","On your question around the contracts, the contracts in general are negotiated annually. So I will remind you that we discussed the negotiations that we had coming out of 2017 when we got - I'm sorry, coming out of 2018 when we got on the call in January.","So we have nothing new to report on that, and we will have to see where we land and where commodities are as we close out the calendar year and we get into our discussions with suppliers and set our contracts for next year. We will update you on where all of that lands in January.","And then, the other thing I would comment on is that, in general, our outlook for commodity assumes that costs are relatively consistent with the recent spot prices, except for pulp, which is forecast to move down a bit further from here. So that is kind of what is going on with commodities.","Mike Hsu","Yes, OK. Andrea, and then on China, what I will tell you is, we are really encouraged by the progress the team is taking. Their strategy is to elevate the category by driving sustainable long-term growth. And I think, do we believe it's sustainable? I think that is our intent. And the way we are doing that is through product innovation that seems to be working very effectively in the marketplace. We have got a diaper that we launched toward the end of last year, middle of last year, the 5D diaper that is soft and flexible, breathable as much as any product out there except that the differences in the marketplace and while it's winning is that it protects better than the other products in the category, at least that is our perspective.","And so that is getting traction in the premium tiers. But just to be clear, our volume in diapers was down in the quarter. It's just that it was growing significantly in the premium side of the business. That said, organic was up because of the volume differences and also because of some net pricing changes. So I think the business is heading in the right direction. We think the work that we are doing is to drive long-term sustainable growth.","Andrea Teixeira","That is helpful. Just on the follow-up with Maria, now I understand the contracts are one year set with suppliers, so can you kind of bridge to us because kind of last year was obviously a big hit. This year, what is your assumption for pulp embedded in your revised guidance?","Paul Alexander","Andrea, this is Paul. I would say, in general, there has been no change in how we forecast commodities. And so we are using the forecasters that you are doing well, including RECY and then we generally would line up with what they forecast.","Andrea Teixeira","And include the timing of the contracts, right? I'm assuming that they don't rollover the way your contracts roll, right? You can't have the spot prices because they're significantly lower now, but you can't embed it because of your contracts. Is that the way we should think?","Maria Henry","We have got both things that affect us, obviously with the market prices, and then as we have discussed, we also have contracts that affect what we report as commodity inflation for Kimberly-Clark. One you have visibility into, and the other one you don't.","Andrea Teixeira","Correct. Yes. But you are not ready to give us as you did in the past where you gave us exactly the price of the pulp at this point?","Maria Henry","If you are after what we are thinking in terms of our fiber commodity? What I would say is that, on eucalyptus, which is a major input for us on the fiber side, we have reduced our outlook range to $1,050 to $1,100 per metric ton, and that is down $75 per metric ton.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Olivia Tong with Bank of America.","Olivia Tong","Great. Thank you. Obviously, given your commentary around brand spend initiatives, a few questions there. Clearly that is helping support some of your pricing and mix initiatives. But when do you actually expect these initiatives to drive some improvement in volume? So that is the first question.","And then second, just a little bit more around the new Huggies Special Delivery. Curious as to how you went about in terms of the thought process and the marketing around it because it's conveying a very different message versus what both you and your competitors have done in the past and it obviously stands up very dramatically on the shelf. So a little bit more color there would be helpful. Thank you.","Mike Hsu","Yes. On the brand investment, I think maybe the overall sale, Olivia, I think it has been working and that is a piece of the reason why it gives us the confidence to increase the investment in the back half. The example I will give you maybe is, if you talk about Brazil, pricing is up in the teens, volume is essentially a little bit less than flat. And so, while our assessment is, the elasticity has taken hold, but we have got a lot of other things going on that make that volume better than what the elasticity would've modeled, which is innovation.","We have got growth initiatives on adult care and baby wipes that is getting very, very strong growth, and marketing behind those initiatives. And then, increased advertising spend or improved advertising on the diaper products. So, I think just kind of one example, but I think we have seen that and it's part of the reason why we have more confidence to spend more.","Paul Alexander","And then on Special Delivery, Mike?","Mike Hsu","Yes, Special Delivery, we are very excited about that. You can definitely see some different hands on the business. Very - maybe a contemporary look and feel. We have got a great young team on it that is kind of in tune with, I think, millennial mom and very well tested. The technology is terrific, it's a showcase of, I would say, maybe an enhanced approach from us, which is a partnership globally from a technology perspective.","I mean, it takes the best of what we have been doing in North America, China, Korea and Latin America, and the team worked together to launch this product and we are very excited about all the features it has which is softness, skin protection, plant-based liner, a lot of free forms that make it more attractive to the consumer and then obviously the standout designs. Olivia?","Olivia Tong","Sorry, I was on mute. Just following up on Huggies Special Delivery, I know it's only been on shelf for a short time but any early color on retailer feedback so far? And did pipeline fill help at all in the quarter?","Mike Hsu","Yes, there is probably a little bit of pipeline, it's still relatively - we are still relatively early, so I wouldn't say the pipeline was huge and then again in the quarter. But retailer response has been very positive. I think they're very excited about obviously a look in the product quality and so got the expectations for Special Delivery. We are excited about it.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Powers with the Deutsche Bank.","Steve Powers","Hey, great. Thank you both. Just a quick follow-up on pulp. Maria, we have heard from others the idea of expected deflation from where we are now in the near-term followed by some level of tightening later in the year and into 2020. Is that your expectation as well or do you have an alternative view on where the underlying commodities trend?","Mike Hsu","That would be consistent with what we see and saying, Steve.","Steve Powers","Okay.","Mike Hsu","It's a little too early for us to talk about 2020 but we see those same forecast.","Steve Powers","Okay. Just to be clear, it's fair to assume that sort of embedded in the planning process?","Mike Hsu","Yes.","Maria Henry","Yes.","Steve Powers","Okay. Alright, great. And then, I guess, another follow-up on the reinvestments you are making above and beyond the incentive comp that you called out. It sounds like for the year it's mostly marketing with a bit more in people, processes and tools to further the ROIs you have been seeing and maybe counter some level of presumed competitive action as the industry benefits from costs. But Mike, in the past, we have also talked about Kimberly-Clark maybe being in a position to make some more assertive investments and assertive leading-edge investments in opportunity markets like India going forward, just a position in the company better for long-term growth. How are you thinking about that? Where do those types of initiatives rank in terms of the prioritization for future investment dollars?","Mike Hsu","Yes. Great question, Steve. And obviously, I think, as I mentioned earlier, I think what is changed over the past six months or so is the category conditions make investments, I think, more worthwhile or more productive, and we are seeing some of that across multiple markets. Most of the current investment that we are talking about for the second half is going into digital and capability building around revenue growth management and sales execution.","So those are the near-term focus areas, but we do believe we have great opportunity to enhance our investment and categories, let's say, adult care globally, baby wipes, and then in markets like India. And so, working through those as a team, and I think we have got a lot of good opportunities to invest into and accelerate growth.","Steve Powers","Okay. I will pass it on. Thanks.","Mike Hsu","Thanks, Steve.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Strycula with UBS.","Steve Strycula","Hi. Good morning and congrats on a good execution quarter.","Mike Hsu","Thanks, Steve.","Steve Strycula","So, a few quick questions. For Maria, I think I heard you say that on manufacturing expenses were going to be tracking a little bit higher than you expected versus the start of the year. What is driving it? I haven't heard a lot of other companies really speak to that.","Maria Henry","Sure. There is a number of items that affect what we call other manufacturing costs, which are general expenses that hit us in our manufacturing operations. They include things like fixed cost absorption, labor rate changes and inflation, product improvement investments and other one-time types of impacts such as write-offs or start-up costs associated with new equipment. It's not unusual that this is an inflationary area for us, but it is running a bit higher than we expected when we came into the year.","Specifically, for the second quarter, we saw increases across all of those levers. We talked about our volumes being off a bit, which leads to fixed cost absorption impact. With our labor rates, all the inflation that we are seeing particularly out of Latin America affects the cost there. And then, one area which has a question on investment, one area where we are investing is in product improvement and we are investing there behind the innovations that we have been talking about. And those increased investments in product quality and improvements in innovation flowed through that line item. So that is what is going on there. And I would point to the fixed cost under absorption in the product investments as two of the drivers.","Steve Strycula","Okay. And as a follow up to that, if we think about the $150 million reduction to your initial inflation outlook. That is about $0.33 to earnings or 5 percentage points to EBIT dollars. And it feels like you are flowing through about a third of that to shareholders. So is it, Mike, that we just - this is a really good opportunity to address the wish list of things that you have that are actionable right now in the marketplace, including increasing on bonuses and why not out there or is this just conservatism as we think about the back half?","Mike Hsu","Yes, I mean, I you know, I think that our mass was somewhere between - flown through between a third to a half. But again, I think, part of it is the market opportunity and we think the conditions are good for us to invest. The brands are responding, and it's going to be productive for long-term health of the business. And so that is what we are doing that. Some of the comp stuff is more formulaic. Last year we were cutting comp and this year, it's just a math formula but it goes back up. So - but really the focus for us is about brand reinvestment in both, as Maria said, and products in the digital or in the marketing spending and then in some of the capability built.","Maria Henry","Yes. I think if you took compensation aside, it would look a bit more like two-thirds flowing through.","Steve Strycula","Okay. And to close out, Mike, can you just walk us through a few of the key geographies as to what is happening on the constant currency basis across Brazil, Argentina and China? Can you touch on at a high level on a few of them, just give us a little bit more texture as to what is happening in those markets?","Mike Hsu","Yes. Very solid growth. I think, in Brazil, double digit growth overall net selling price and mix were up in the teens. Volume was about down slightly, I would say, or almost even. Overall in Brazil, I think the market price has generally moved, although some local competitors have been lagging. The better expected than expected volume performance really is related to great execution.","And when I say execution, it is the whole ball of wax, meaning it's the innovation, it's the marketing and then it's the selling. And all those things are working well for us. In addition, I think in a market like Brazil or Latin America more broadly, we have got very developed plans to expand kind of the categories in adult care and wipes and that is paying off this year.","Argentina, I guess, I would say, high double digit organic growth. The volume decline was in the, I think, mid single digit level. So you could - again, you could chalk it up the same thing, which is I think the consumer has kind of reset their expectations for price, but also very strong end market execution of the teams to kind of reduce the volume impact that you would have expected from that level of pricing.","So, Latin America, very strong performance from a revenue perspective. Central and Eastern Europe up almost 20% or a little bit over 20%, very strong performance in Ukraine and CIS. Russia continues to grow at a very good pace for us, although I will tell you, our share are little bit more under pressure there than we have experienced over the prior couple of years. But the formula there is also same thing, it'll be refrain innovation, marketing and greater in-market execution. ASEAN, up double digits. So we are feeling good about most of D&E markets.","Steve Strycula","Great, thank you.","Mike Hsu","Thanks, Stephen.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Caroline Levy with Macquarie Capital.","Caroline Levy","Good morning. Thank you so much. I have kind of a fun one first, which is, I was very surprised to see a black diaper package. Are young families no longer doing blue and pink for their babies, bedrooms and stuff? So if you could just talk about the logic behind black packaging?","Mike Hsu","Yes, Caroline, interesting, Yes. I was saying we have got some new hands on the business. I think that the team is attuned with kind of what millennial mom is looking for. The black packaging kind of is striking off the shelf. I will tell you, we have gotten strong retailer response to it. It is the first black packaging in the category and for us in the diaper category. Obviously, we have been black for a while in the fem care category.","So, I think it's so far early returns I would say, even though it's too early to really say. But it's doing its job, which is it striking it's shelf. And it's got a great shelf impression. And I would say overall, a more contemporary look and feel. And I think we are trying to address millennial mom, and so far it seems like it's heading in the right direction.","Caroline Levy","Excellent. Thank you. So I wanted to just talk birth rates. I mean, I remember maybe a year-ago you are talking about a shocking decline in South Korea. We are reading about North America seeing birth rate declines. And yet you are able to put up some really good numbers despite that in some of your - in Sydney and North America. What do you think is going on and how do you deal with that as a long-term trend?","Mike Hsu","Yes. Still a decline, maybe a little less shocking than the numbers that you may recall. South Korea, I think a couple of years ago, it was a low double digit decline. I think this year it looks like maybe about a high single digit. So that is an improvement, but it's still down. And the driver in South Korea is slower family formation. I mean, in fact, marriages are still down.","So, I think, that is when - that South Korea and North America similar birth rate has improved, but it's still down about in 2018 our estimates are down about 2%. And so, I think, in big developed markets, I think that is a trend that we have to deal with. And that is why you are seeing Huggies Special Delivery or some of the things we are trying to address.","The big thing about Special Delivery is, it sells at a significant premium to all the other products in the category. And the reason we feel good about that, and it's pretty well tested, it's got a lot of benefits that consumers are looking for. And that falls in line with the strategy we are really driving, which is elevate the core, which is - you have got, in big developed markets, the way to grow them is to drive premiumization. But the only way to make premiumization work is if you make the products work more and worth paying that premium for and that is what we are trying to do.","Caroline Levy","Excellent. Thank you. And just regional pushback. I mean, you have talked about the fact that you haven't seen competitor dynamics change around the price increases. But I think there is quite a bit of fear that as retailers continue to try to compete with Amazon, they may come back to the manufacturers as costs come down and push back. Can you just address that? And this is history. Are you seeing anything different?","Mike Hsu","I don't know that we are seeing anything different. I think that is an ongoing issue, Caroline, in the industry. But it's also one that those of us who've been around for a long time have been dealing with for a long time. And so we are used to this dynamic and managing through it. I will say, like most retailers that we deal with, they're mostly interested in driving growth. And so, while they may not like pricing in some categories or some retailers, they do like growth. And so that is where we are focused on working with them and partnering on the right way to grow the category.","Caroline Levy","Got it. And just my last one, on K-C Professional, your Western Central Europe volume was down 8%. Can you just talk to what is going on there?","Mike Hsu","Yes. The biggest driver in KCP and I would say another solid quarter for K-C Professional organic overall was up 1% in North American developing in emerging markets were up 2%. I think the biggest thing is we are leading price in, you know, with our leadership position in KCP generally, not all markets have followed, but we feel like this is the right move for us and we recognize as a little stickiness competitively and there is going to be some volume impacts.","Caroline Levy","So you think that is temporary?","Mike Hsu","Yes. Well, we will see if it's temporary, but it's something that we are prepared to kind of deal with as we work through the year.","Paul Alexander","Caroline, I think what I would add to that is, focused on the net of price mix and volume, especially in that market. And if you do that across developed markets, we were down about 1%.","Caroline Levy","Got it, thank you so much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies.","Kevin Grundy","Good morning, everyone. Hey, Mike, congrats on a good result this quarter. Not to beat a dead horse, but I wanted to ask the question on the reinvestment a little bit differently. So the context, of course, company's results have not been when you have hoped over the past three years. So far so good first half of this year. But even, Mike, like as we look at the Nielsen data of market share trends, I suspect in the U.S. still not quite where you would hope. So the question is, as you are working through the quarter and thinking about how the business is progressing, what the guidance is going to be with pulp prices rolling over was there any thought to investing all of the upside to try to sustain the top-line, which arguably is going to drive the most value for shareholders over time? So the question is really around the adequacy of the reinvestment and how you were thinking about that because when we met with you early in the year, the thinking was, you were not going to do any sort of earnings reset because you didn't necessarily see the innovation pipeline sort of justifying it. So, sorry for going on a bit, but it's really around the adequacy of the reinvestment as you saw it and balancing that with the earnings flow through. And then, I have one follow up.","Mike Hsu","Yes. Kevin, I'm really glad you raised that. That is one area we have got to really focus on. And if there is one part of the quarter that we need to improve on is our share results, and we are a little bit behind what our expectations are. Part of that is related toward leading price or being first mover on price in a lot of our markets and categories. And so, we were in some ways expecting some share impact due to that.","However, it's also a big reason why we wanted to drive this reinvestment here to shore up our share positions and make sure we are healthy for the long-term. I think we laid out on our Casey strategy 2022 that we are going to deliver our balanced value creation plan. And we think that this is an example of that.","Kevin Grundy","Okay. Alright. Fair enough, I can leave that, I guess. And then separately, you guys, of course, in tuck in M&A sort of picked up a bit here in the HPC space, particularly with an emphasis on personal care, largely skin care. Kimberly, of course, has not been very active on the M&A front in the past. And Mike, I think your commentary earlier was, we probably should not expect much of a change. I just wanted to kind of revisit that in the current environment. Is that still the course we should really sort of expect investment behind the business and returning cash to shareholders?","Mike Hsu","Yes, I don't think we would expect a significant change versus what we told you earlier this year. I mean, we like our categories. We still think there is a lot of growth potential in our categories, especially when you look at both our opportunity to elevate the categories and also to grow in D&E. However, we are going to continue to look at opportunities and we do that consistently. We have got a - it may not appear to be, but we have got a very active M&A and development team that is always looking at opportunities for us.","Kevin Grundy","Mike, would you care to comment just on what specific areas and or geographies?","Mike Hsu","Maybe I will pass for now, Kevin.","Kevin Grundy","Okay. I thought I would try. Alright. Thank you. Good luck.","Operator","Thank you. At this time, we have no other questioners in the queue.","Paul Alexander","Alright. We appreciate everyone's questions today and thanks to the support from our shareholders. And we will speak with you next quarter. Thank you very much. Bye-bye.","Operator","Thank you.

At that time, instructions will be given as to the procedures to follow if you would like to ask an audio question.","It is now my pleasure to introduce today's first presenter, Mr. Paul Alexander.","Paul J. Alexander - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Kimberly-Clark's second quarter earnings conference call. With us this morning are Tom Falk, Chairman and CEO; Mike Hsu, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Maria Henry, our CFO. Here's the agenda for the call. Tom will start with some opening comments about the current environment. Maria will then review our second quarter results and after that Tom will provide his perspectives on our results and the outlook for the year. And we'll finish with Q&A.","As usual, we have a presentation of today's materials in the Investors section of our website. As a reminder, we'll be making forward-looking statements today. Please see the Risk Factors section of our latest Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information. Lastly, we'll be comparing our 2017 results to 2016 adjusted results, which exclude certain items described in this morning's news release.","And now, I'll turn it over to Tom.","Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","Thanks, Paul, and good morning, everyone. Before Maria gives you some of the details on the quarter, I thought I would comment on how I see the environment overall and then how we're approaching it. So, while I remain optimistic about our long-term future, the near-term environment has become more challenging than maybe we saw at the beginning of the year. So category growth has slowed broadly in lots of places over the last year or so, and we expect that growth will pick back up over time, but that pickup may not happen quickly. In the meantime, competitive activity has increased, including higher spending in North America over the last 12 months.","So in this environment, we continue to focus on what we think are the fundamentals that create long-term shareholder value. That means we're continuing to invest behind our brands by launching innovation, pursuing targeted growth initiatives and then supporting our brands with strong marketing campaigns. At the same time, we fine-tune some of our promotion strategies and we have a heightened focus on delivering more cost savings and tightly controlling our discretionary spending in an environment like this. We're also continuing to manage our company with financial discipline and allocate capital in shareholder-friendly ways. So in short, we continue to execute our strategies for long-term success, and we are adjusting our near-term plans as we operate in a more difficult environment.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Maria for a review of our second quarter results.","Maria G. Henry - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","Thanks, Tom. Good morning, everyone. Let me start with the headlines for the quarter. Sales and earnings were down slightly, reflecting a challenging environment, as Tom just described, and comparison to strong results last year. We delivered significant cost savings in the quarter, and we've increased our full year cost savings outlook. And finally, we're on track with our overall capital plan.","Now let's take a look at the details, starting with sales. Our second quarter net sales were $4.6 billion, that's down 1% year-on-year due to lower organic sales. Tom is going to provide some more color on our top line in just a few minutes. On profitability, second quarter gross margin was 36.1%, that's down 20 basis points year-on-year. Operating margin was 17.5%, down 50 basis points. While margins were down slightly overall, I'm encouraged with the improvements that we achieved in our Personal Care and K-C Professional business segments, and also in the developing and emerging markets overall. Commodities were a $75 million drag in the second quarter, and for the full year, we're now expecting inflation of $200 million to $300 million, that's $50 million higher than our previous estimate driven by higher pulp costs.","Our teams continued to deliver significant FORCE cost savings. Second quarter savings were $120 million and we've increased our full year savings target to $425 million to $450 million. Our original target was for savings of at least $400 million. Given the current environment, we are also tightly managing our overhead spending. On the bottom line, second quarter earnings per share were $1.49, down 3% year-on-year. Lower equity income reduced earnings by $0.03 per share, offset by a lower share count and a slightly better effective tax rate.","Now let's take a look at cash flow. Cash provided by operations in the second quarter was $825 million, in line with our expectations. Cash flow was down compared to $860 million in the year-ago quarter, including the impact of higher tax payments this year. Second quarter working capital cash conversion cycle was down six days compared to full year 2016, bringing the year-to-date decline to five days. We're making very good progress in this area, and we expect to nicely exceed our original one-day improvement target for the full year.","We also continue to manage capital spending in this environment, and we now expect that full year spending will be in the lower half of our $850 million to $950 million target range. On capital allocation, second quarter dividend payments and share repurchases totaled more than $600 million. We continue to expect that full year dividends and share repurchases will total between $2.2 billion and $2.4 billion.","Looking at our segments, in Personal Care, organic sales fell 1% due to lower net selling prices. Organic sales were up 2% in developing and emerging markets but were down elsewhere. Personal Care operating margins were 20.6%, up 60 basis points. The improvement was driven by cost savings, partially offset by lower selling prices and higher input costs. In Consumer Tissue, organic sales were down 2%, driven by North America. Overall, Consumer Tissue operating margins were 16.5%, down 190 basis points. The results were impacted by lower sales and higher pulp costs. In K-C Professional, organic sales in the quarter were up 1%, with gains in all major geographies. K-C Professional operating margins were 20.1%, up 150 basis points. The comparison included benefits from cost savings.","So in summary, our second quarter results were impacted by difficult environment with weaker economies, category softness and increased competitive activity. Nonetheless, we are achieving strong cost savings, we're generating healthy cash flow, and we're allocating capital in shareholder-friendly ways.","I'll now turn the call back over to Tom.","Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","Thanks, Maria. I'll provide more detail on our top line sales and market conditions, and then I'll address our full-year outlook. As Maria just mentioned, our organic sales were down 1% in the quarter as we're operating in a challenging growth environment. In our consumer businesses in North America, organic sales fell by 2% that were impacted by category softness, lower promotional shipments and higher competitive activity.","Just for perspective, in the categories that we compete in, in North America, the total market declined by about 1% in the quarter. Looking at our businesses in North America, Personal Care volumes were off 1%. In the infant and child care mega category, our volumes were down mid-single digits. Beyond tough comparisons, results were impacted by competitive activity and lower category demand, which is down about 1% year-to-date following last year's 1% decline in the U.S. growth rate. On the other hand, volumes were up mid-single-digits in baby wipes and low single-digits in adult care. In adult care, we're introducing an improved Depend product this quarter, and we're increasing marketing and promotion support to help drive more growth in this category.","Our Consumer Tissue volumes were down 4%, and that compares to a 6% growth in the base period. We'd expect some better performance in Consumer Tissue in the back half of the year as we got a stronger promotional calendar planned and we're making some targeted promotion changes on Kleenex facial tissue.","Turning to developed markets outside of North America, organic sales were down 3% in the second quarter. Sales were down in Personal Care in South Korea, where the diaper category is being impacted by a pretty significant decline in the birth rate. We expect results to pick up some in the second half of the year as we got some diaper and feminine care product upgrades in the market and we're also relaunching our baby wipes business there. Volumes were also down in the quarter in Consumer Tissue in Western and Central Europe, reflecting a continued challenging environment there.","Moving to developing and emerging markets, organic sales were up 2% in the second quarter. For the first half of the year, organic sales have increased by 3%, with volume growth of more than 5%. So, I'm encouraged by our volume performance and, overall, we're largely on track with our plans in these markets.","Looking at second quarter performance in some of our key markets. In China, organic sales in diapers were similar year-on-year as higher volumes and improved mix were offset by lower selling prices. And while competitive activity picked up somewhat in the second quarter, we continue to be optimistic that pricing won't be as negative in China this year as it was last year. We launched several innovations in China in the second quarter. And going forward, we plan to continue to focus on driving winning product solutions behind our Huggies brand.","Moving to Brazil, organic sales in Personal Care were down high single-digits compared to a 10% increase in the year-ago period. Through six months, organic sales in Brazil are similar year-on-year, which is probably a better indicator of our underlying trends. While category volumes are still down in Brazil, our volumes were up mid single-digits, aided by innovation and changes to our promotional strategies there.","In Argentina, organic sales in Personal Care were up mid-teens driven by higher selling prices. Although category volumes are still down pretty significantly, our volumes are up somewhat following the relaunch of Huggies diapers earlier this year. And then lastly in Eastern Europe, our organic sales in diapers rose about 10%, as our teams there delivered another double-digit volume increase this quarter. We've also recently introduced several innovations on Huggies in Russia to help us drive even more growth.","Now beyond our sales performance, I'll just briefly build on Maria's comments to say that I am encouraged with the FORCE cost savings, our improvements in working capital, and the cash we've been able to return to shareholders in the first half of the year.","Now turning to our outlook. In terms of our full year targets, we expect organic sales will be similar or up slightly year-on-year. Our prior assumption was for growth of 1% to 2%. We still expect growth in the second half of the year to pick up somewhat from the first half, and that's largely due to easier comparisons along with benefits from innovations and other steps we're taking to improve our performance. On the bottom line, we expect that earnings per share will be at the low end of our target range of $6.20 to $6.35. That reflects our new outlook for organic sales and cost inflation, along with additional cost savings, some overhead spending reductions, and a slightly lower effective tax rate.","Our priorities for the second half of the year are as follows: first, to execute on our brand fundamentals with excellence to make sure we improve our top line performance; second, to deliver cost savings to help keep our margins healthy; and third and finally, to generate strong cash flow. Our teams are very focused on these priorities and our plan is to deliver sales and earnings growth in the back half of the year. Beyond the near term, over the long term, we're committed to continuing our long track record of making changes to improve our company so that we achieve success for our brands, for our businesses, and for our shareholders.","That wraps up our prepared remarks and now we'll begin to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks, good morning.","Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","Hey, good morning Lauren.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","I wanted to talk a little bit about the competitive environment in North America you called out across the consumer businesses. Is it, one, primarily from branded players, is it private label, and then also just how retailers are kind of playing into all of that or stimulating the change in the environment?","Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","Yeah, I'll give you a couple of comments, and maybe Mike can give a little bit more color. I mean I think the answer is probably all of the above. When you have weaker category growth overall and you have about the same number of people fighting over it, you can see that play out. And there is no question, there is channel shifting going on as e-commerce grows and that's putting pressure on lots of retailers. Maybe Mike has some other comments to add.","Michael D. Hsu - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","No, I definitely agree with that, Lauren. I'd say it's probably certainly branded players and then also private labels have an effect, too. I would say North America is always competitive, but we are really focused on the fundamentals that we need to bring, which is innovation, creating longer-term shareholder value. We are really focused on building the categories and so we got a really strong line-up of winning products out there right now. But we got to really fine-tune what's in our current marketing plans and promotions to improve our competitiveness in the market. We're also focused on, as Tom mentioned earlier, improving our in-store execution in the second half.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","And with in-store execution, and you mentioned kind of promotional adjustments, it feels like a lot of your category volume, maybe less so for tissue but more in personal care is sort of naturally shifting more online. So, how effective do you feel like for the focus on in-store, is there things that you're also doing to better position your businesses online right. We know Amazon has \u2013 we know they've made their push in diapers and wipes, and it looks like wipes is probably the piece that's had some success. So what are you also doing from an online standpoint, not just in-store?","Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","Yeah, I mean, in-store to us, I guess, broadly means whatever mom wants to shop. So that's a traditional bricks-and-mortar retail or an online retail, so it's making sure you got the right items in distribution, the right pricing, the right merchandising support.","Michael D. Hsu - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","Yeah, we've got a lot of resources focused on driving online growth and working with our customers on their online strategies. And obviously all of our customers or many of our customers are working towards the same end. I would say we're making pretty good progress in growing online. Still the majority of our business is still sold offline, but we're making good progress, but not satisfied with our online performance. But I'd say, bringing us back to the offline portion, I think if you characterize our first half, we were going up against a very strong comp in the first half last year and some of our promotion plans, kind of, were balanced more, tilted towards the second half this year. So, we are expecting much stronger performance in the back half, particularly of our family care business with promotions.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","Thanks, Lauren.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ali Dibadj with Bernstein.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hey, guys.","Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","Hey, Ali.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","So I have a few questions. One is just on organic sales, obviously, they continue to be challenging, clearly more challenging than we last talked. But you also say that you expect the top line to grow again. I'm trying to understand the underlying reasoning for that, and I guess, more specifically, is that the conclusion from Mike's strategic review that you said he was doing? Or is that yet to come really thinking about the long-term 3% to 5% organic sales growth target? And if that's not the conclusion from that review, when should we get that verdict?","And then, also want to talk about margins, almost in a similar vein, I mean, FORCE has done just extraordinarily well for you guys, obviously continuing to do so and now raising it, recently the target for this year. Can you give us a sense of how much of that needs to be reinvested? And where exactly are the savings coming from, in particular because you're seeing Consumer Tissue margins fall so much this quarter? Should we be thinking about cost cutting not coming from there anymore, FORCE not coming from there anymore and kind of Consumer Tissue margins being past peak?","Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","Yeah. Well, I think I got a lot of those. So, on the top line, I mean, a lot of it is, if you look at our North American business and, Paul, you can check me on the numbers, I think first half last year we were up 5%, in the back half we were flat.","Paul J. Alexander - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","Correct.","Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","So, just the comp will lead you more to growth naturally, just as we continue with the rate that we're on. So, I think the things that's probably different than on our top line look overall is the category declines, really some of the birthrate declines, both in North America and in places like Korea. You can still see category weakness in some of the Latin American markets, although some of the more recent data has been a little bit more encouraging on that front. In terms of the strategic review, I mean, I wouldn't say any of what we're talking about today is related to that. I mean, the strategic review is tending to look long-term and we still see the category potential in all of our categories as the developing and emerging markets grow. But how quickly we get to that future and the environment that we're in is still something that we're taking a look at.","Coming back to FORCE, I don't know, Maria, if you want to comment on cost savings?","Maria G. Henry - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","Yeah, we do continue to deliver significant cost savings through the FORCE program, and we were able to take up the full year target. And what I'd say is that as the program name implies, our teams really are Focused On Reducing Costs Everywhere. When you look at our supply chain savings that includes improving productivity and waste across our manufacturing operations, driving down the cost of our facilities, optimizing the cost of our product specifications and continually negotiating lower input costs or material costs of our products. And year-to-date, we are at 4% of cost of goods, which is really a strong performance, not only internally but benchmarks very well. I continue to see opportunities for us to continue to deliver the FORCE cost savings as we move forward. So good performance there, and I think more opportunity there.","Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","Yeah, we come back to the reinvestment rate. If you look at the cost savings we generated relative to the commodity costs and other things that hit us, I mean, you can see that even though we had a great cost savings quarter, we still had gross margins that were down because of lower pricing and higher commodity costs, so and the biggest single factor in the Tissue margins was pulp price change year-over-year. And the FORCE cost savings probably fell a little bit more in the Personal Care segment this quarter, which is where the margin improvement occurred.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","If I can go back to sort of the strategic review. Tom, you mentioned in your remarks, we're committed to making the changes to improve our company going forward. Is that something that's also being thought through in the strategic review? And what I mean by that is when do we get confirmation about 3% to 5% organic sales growth top line, not to put too much pressure on you Mike, but when do we get confirmation on that or a different number? And also are you going to tell us about perhaps some other changes, like how you are in Europe PC, maybe a bigger breakup, for example, the company or something. I mean, is there a timeframe for us to be thinking about when you guys would tell us, Mike, the outcome of your strategic review? And whether it touches all those elements?","Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","Yeah, Ali, I think your plan for the strategic review might be a little more glorious than what we're looking at. I mean, really what Mike and his team are trying to do and he can kind of add some comment to it as well as to say what are the things we need to do to really unlock the potential of our business in China, or how do we grow our adult care business everywhere when we see the huge opportunity there, and to kind of take us to the next level of performance and how our company operates and realizes the potential that we see in our categories everywhere. So that's under way. It's more about probably how we work together and use the matrix inside the company. It's not a portfolio analysis as you would have described it.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Got it. Okay. Go ahead, Mike.","Michael D. Hsu - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","I'd just add that, yeah, we're certainly excited about the long-term development growth of our categories. We do believe we're operating in some of the fastest-growing categories because of our D&E potential longer term. And so, we're really focused on category development and internally, we call it development of the white space for us. But we also recognize that the last couple of years have been a little slower and so we are working to see, hey, when do we get back onto that track. That said probably, and you may not find earth shattering news from us, but it's probably going to result in greater focus and more intentional development of some of our categories and geographies.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Got it. So, we shouldn't expect anything like in Analyst Day or presentation or anything? That was, all right, I also thought that's what is going to come out of this, but it sounds like no.","Michael D. Hsu - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","We give you our 2018 guidance; we'll give you an update on where we're at, at that stage so.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks very much.","Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","Thanks Ali.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jason English with Goldman Sachs.","Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","Hey, Jason.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey. Hey, good morning, folks. Thanks for the question. I guess, I want to pick up on Ali's line of questioning, because I think his line of questioning was very much focused in terms of the long-term trajectory and the intrinsic value of the company. And I think that's important because as I've had lots of conversations from investors, there's really been two sticking points for people.","One is the path to return to the type of growth that you used to be able to realize in Personal Care, and the second is the glide path to where margins can go in Tissue and Professional, particularly with the consternation of private label, price aggression. So, I was hoping you could delve in a little bit more deeply there. You mentioned category growth has slowed, can you give us some more context around what you think the drivers are and what levers may be there to get us back to reacceleration?","And then a little bit deeper on the Consumer Tissue side. The results today are likely to do nothing other than sort of fuel those concerns with margins sort of rolling in that business, pricing under pressure despite input cost inflation, is there reason to believe that private label competitive dynamics in that market are indeed going to be ratcheted a lot higher on the forward and likely going to be causing some \u2013 a minimal cap on margins there, if not some downward pressure?","Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","Okay. A lot of questions, Jason, we'll do the best we can on those, so coming back to the growth path and some of the drivers of weaker categories, I mean, in Personal Care and baby and child care in particular, it's been birthrate-related in a lot of the developed markets.","So we had kind of projected 2016 was going to be a flat birthrate year. In the second quarter, we got the final fourth quarter numbers that showed it down 2% for the fourth quarter, which brought the full year down 1%. So that obviously has caused category growth to be weaker than we would've anticipated going into 2017.","Korea's birthrate, I think, we got the final 2016 numbers, was down 7%, which is a pretty big, big drop. So I think there is potentially lots of reasons, we don't really understand it at a deep enough consumer insight level, I'd say. But a broad trend is that Millennials are having their children a little later, as long as they have the same number, we're in good shape because the category growth will return. You have to go through the adjustment while that age shift happens from a demographic standpoint.","So I think in Latin America, we've seen some of the negative category growth, and that's really economically driven because of some of the economic recession, with GDP per capita going backwards in places like Brazil and Argentina.","I'd say in the last couple of share periods in Brazil, we've seen a little bit more positive category growth and things seem to be returning more to an equilibrium there. Argentina is still a little bit volatile, we're seeing negative category trends and positive pricing trends, and so that's putting a lot of pressure on the consumer.","In other markets where you're seeing some category negatives were places that had big currency swings last year and where we took pricing and some of that pricing has come back out of the market this year, that would be markets like Russia and other key markets in Eastern Europe. So probably a bunch of things happening, some demographic, some economic, that put pressure on our categories in the first half of the year.","On tissue margins, I mean, good progress on KCP in the quarter and continue to see opportunity there as that business builds around the world. On consumer tissue, it's probably always going to be a little bit more volatile and affected by pulp prices.","We've seen good progress lately over the last couple of years. We were kind of asked where can it go from there, and we thought that high-teens was kind of the right place for consumer tissue to land in the near to medium term. And if I look at our year-to-date margins in consumer tissue, I think, it's 17.7%, so we are in the ballpark, it was a little lower than that in the second quarter, that's usually a light facial tissue quarter and we had a little bit higher pulp prices.","So I'd say we're not concerned about the current tissue trends. Private-label shares, as you mentioned, are up a tick in towels, but haven't seen a lot of share movement on private label really anywhere at this stage. So I don't know if that covers most of what you had, Jason; I think so.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yeah, I think, so. And it was a loaded question. So, I will be respectful of other's people time and pass it on.","Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","Thanks, Jason.","Operator","Our next question comes from Olivia Tong with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thanks, good morning. First, in terms of baby and child care promotion, I mean how much of this is being funded by you versus the retailer? Maybe can you talk about North American price by sort of major product segments, it looks like price was flat overall, but I imagine there is a fair bit of difference in your segment?","And I know you are not funding the majority of it, but how are you adjusting sort of your long-term plans to help combat against an environment in which the consumer is starting to get more and more used to lower prices, bigger and better deals particularly in that category? Thank you.","Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","Yes, I mean, you are right, Olivia, retailers determine the final finished products selling price in North America and that's the way it's always been. And so we go to market with a consistent trade deal. And then our customers decide how they want to apply those funds and whether they want to invest some of their own funds to attract the young family into their retail environment.","And that's kind of been the way the game has been played for a long, long time and that's really not any different now. It was the way Wal-Mart played as they grew and certainly some of the e-commerce players are offering hot deals to try to make sure the family gets converted to their shopping.","In terms of how do we flex in that environment, we're trying to make sure we've got a winning product proposition, number one, that you've got great product superiority, you got good marketing and innovation coming, and that you're communicating all of that to the consumer and that's changing with digital and social and all the other tools that we have. But I don't know, Mike, if you want to add any more color on that?","Michael D. Hsu - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","No. Yeah, certainly, Olivia, I think funding or you could see it in our numbers, I think, our price levels are comparable versus year ago. I would say probably the softness that we are seeing in the category primarily is driven by retail pricing. I think our overall plan though is and we're not happy about the softness, there is some shift into training pants and I think that's healthy for the category overall except in the way that it's occurring, we're not happy about the impact on our Polis business because some of that is being driven by the lower prices.","We are focused on innovation and being the category leaders and trying to drive the category to growth. And that means bringing in innovation, we're the consumer-preferred brand, strong consumer preferred brand proposition and so we're really focused on category driving messaging on the training pant category. And then in diapers, again, we continue to bring news, but we are recognizing we probably need to fine-tune our plans to make sure, and we have done that to make sure that we're competitive on promotion.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great, thanks. And then I guess in terms of North American consumer tissue, why do you think private labels is gaining the momentum that it is and why do you think there's so much of a push in promotion in tissue because, obviously, I understand the desire to winning new mom in diapers, but it's not as obvious in tissue?","Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","Yeah, I think that in some ways, I've got kind of the private-label shares here across our business. If you looked at it, it was up a tick versus the previous quarter and probably paper towels is the area where we've seen the most share growth generally. And if you think about it, there's relatively low cost of product failure in the paper towel category. So if the towel doesn't work, you take another one, as opposed to personal care where if the diaper leaks or the fem pad leaks, you've got a major problem. And so, I think, that's probably been part of it.","Michael D. Hsu - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","Yeah. And Olivia, I think, the thing that we'll say is, tissue, just like diapers, they tend to be strong traffic drivers for the retailers, and so that's why you're probably seeing some intensified activity there. I think, given what's going on in the economy and the retail environment, there are some external factors that are kind of tailwinds for private-label expansion.","However, we do believe that retailers, when they're competing, compete more effectively and successfully with national brands because of that value proposition that's more transparent to brands. And so we really feel like our job is to bring the innovation and the category-driving messaging. And you don't have to look further than what we've done in adult care, I think, if you looked 10 years ago, I think the category had been inverted. We lost our leading share position to private label.","The team went back to the brand foundations and really focused on bringing value-added news like Real Fit, and I think that's driven over double-digit share increases in that period and got us back to the right leadership and the right category expansion profile. So we recognize, given the economy, you're going to see some of this fluctuation, but we're focused on bringing innovation and the right messaging for the category.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. And if I can just sneak in one more on feminine care. Can you talk a little bit about the trends post the launch of U by Kotex, because at least from the tracked channel data, it doesn't look like much has changed so far?","Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","Are you asking about fitness?","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yes.","Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","Yeah, yeah. So I think volumes were down, but we're lapping, Olivia, 10% growth in the year-ago base period. So last year, some of our results benefited by some promotional shipments and then some distribution gains. So our market shares were flat sequentially and down a little bit versus Q2 last year. We did launch UbK fitness. I think we're off to a good start, it's on track. Consumer feedback is strong and we're just rolling out the marketing support behind that launch right now.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","All right. Thanks so much. Appreciate it.","Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","Thanks, Olivia.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning.","Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","Good morning, Bonnie.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","I have a bit of a follow-on question on your consumer tissue business. I was hoping you could touch on some of the executional issues you called out last quarter. Do you guys think you did a better job in Q2, broadly speaking? And then maybe specifically, do you think you did a better job of matching some of the promotions in the quarter with your displays, for instance? And then, where are you at with your price points in your tissue business? I think you guys have mentioned you wanted to sharpen those? And then finally, what other changes have you made to drive better growth in this business?","Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","Yeah. Bonnie, couple of changes. Just for a couple of facts, and I'm assuming most of those questions relate to North America. So our North America volume was down 4% in the second quarter, and that's up against a plus-6% comp in the year-ago base period. So that does reflect some lower promotional shipments and stronger competitive activity that happened in the quarter. Q2 was an improvement versus our 7% decline in the first quarter, but we still have a lot of work to do.","We're not satisfied with our performance yet. We have better activity coming up in the second half. We strengthened the promotion calendar. I think our field selling organization is better prepared in the second half with their events. And we fine-tuned some of our pricing, most notably on Kleenex, where we did take a price increase early in the year, the beginning of the year, and we've adjusted some of that on-shelf pricing given the market conditions and we're expecting better results.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. So bottom line, you think second half, obviously, should ramp in this specific business given things that you can control and just maybe broadly, do you think the competitive environment should ease, or do you expect that to still be pretty heightened?","Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","Don't know. I don't know how to answer that, but we're going to focus on what we control, which is improving our execution.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And then just maybe a quick question on China. You've been lapping some easy price compares in the market now for quite some time. So, I guess, I'm curious what gives you the confidence that this can improve in the second half, especially I guess given that Procter, I think, is about to finally begin rolling out a new diaper product in August, I think?","Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","Yeah, I mean, I think a lot of the pricing started in the back half of last year, and so I think, we're just going to start to lap easier price compares in the back half of this year. So I'd say we had some benefit from mix in this quarter as we had a little heavier newborn shipments last year. We still see strong underlying category growth. It's still a tough competitive market. I don't know, Mike, if you want to give any other color on that front?","Michael D. Hsu - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","Yeah, I think, the market and the competitive environment certainly remains very active. But we do think the pricing situation has eased compared to this time a year ago. We remain pretty excited and confident in our China business. We're expecting better volume gains in the second half and for the full year behind double-digit category growth. We do have best-in-class innovation. We rolled out a new tier 7 product earlier this year, and I think, that's performing very well. We've got premium tier diaper pants that are out in the marketplace. So, I think we've got the right innovation and the right products out there, and I think the team is doing a great job. And I think the long-term opportunity for growth in China is huge, as you know, and it's about five times as many births per year and the market size is, depending on what numbers you want to look at, comparable. And so over the long-term, this market is going to be much larger than the U.S. And so we've got a lot of opportunity to grow.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. That's helpful. Thank you.","Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","Thanks, Bonnie.","Operator","The next question comes from Stephen Powers with UBS.","Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thanks. So, Tom, I think you said in your prepared remarks that you seemed happy with the developing and emerging market progress so far year-to-date relative to your plan. I guess was that a volume comment, or was that a comment reflective of both volume and pricing and overall organic growth?","Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","Yeah. I mean, I would say that it's more directed to volume, but if you look at their results overall, and their sales in dollars, their profit in dollars, they're tracking much closer to their plan.","Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. So then trying to decompose the roundabout two-point reduction in organic growth outlook from where we started the year, is it really all related to the category volume pressures that you called out related to the U.S. and Korea in birthrates, or just versus the stronger competitive environment that we've also talked about? I'm trying to assess if it's not D&E, and it's not D&E volumes, is it just developed market volumes and birthrate, that really two points? Or there's competition?","Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","I'd say, no, there's probably two factors. One is currency-related pricing rollback. So as the dollar has weakened relative to where it was a year ago, there's markets like Russia, where we took pretty aggressive pricing and had to roll some of that back this year.","You're seeing some of the same factors in Brazil. And then obviously, there's some continued price competition in markets like China. So price is one factor. Some of it related to a weaker dollar that is part of it, and then category growth in developed markets, as we discussed, is probably the other factor.","Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC","Okay, so pricing coming back in D&E markets, but no volume, no volume, no positive volume actually?","Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","Yeah, and if you look at our decompose of this quarter, it was flat volume, minus 1 price. And a lot of that price rollback was some of the markets where there were some currency-driven pricing last year.","Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. To Bonnie's question on P&G's upcoming launch, have you factored any \u2013 I'm assuming that wasn't in your original outlook. Is there any incremental cushion you baked in for that? Or it sounds like you're kind of assuming kind of business as usual, I'm just trying to assess if that's the case, or if you've baked in some allowances there?","Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","I'd say business as usual in China as it's a competitive environment with lots of terrific product launches, primarily from our Japanese and other competitors. And so we had assumed going in that China was going to be a competitive environment with lots of competitive launch activity and that has played out.","And so I would say, again our team is focused on beating the best product in the market. And if that is P&G with this launch, then that will be who we're aiming at. But at this point, in recent times, it's been more the Japanese players that have had significant product news that we've been up against.","Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC","Okay, that's fair enough. And just if I could sneak in one more, I asked about this last call too, just want to see if we're still on the same trajectory. I think $800 million to $1 billion in buybacks was the outlook coming into the year, you seem to be running ahead of that, just want to checkpoint there? And then also on interest expense you had assumed that would be down, I know that you've got some August notes you're going to reissue. But it also seems like you issued more debt in the quarter than I expected. So what's the outlook on those two numbers as well, if I could? Thanks.","Maria G. Henry - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","Sure. On the buyback, the $800 million to $1 billion is still the right number for the year. We're on track with that. And in terms of the interest expense, we did some pre-funding on the $950 million that comes due in August, which is why you see a higher debt number at the end of the quarter, but that should normalize.","And the debt that we'll take out in August is a pretty high coupon, it's 6.125%, and so that will be replaced with lower interest rate debt and that should bring the interest expense down for the year.","Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Perfect. Thank you so much.","Maria G. Henry - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","Yep.","Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","Thanks, Stephen.","Operator","Our next question comes from Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets.","Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","Hi, Nik.","Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Yeah. Good morning, everyone. Good morning. Just two quick questions. There's been a lot of commentary recently at least this earnings season from a variety of companies on the U.S. weakening. And I mean we have our own theories, I'm just curious on kind of your assessment from the company's standpoint on what's driving the sequential deterioration? And then the second question is, just wanted to understand did the amount of promotions, particularly in North America, pickup as the quarter went on or has it been more steady? Thanks.","Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","Yeah. In terms of the U.S. category growth rate, as we looked at that year-over-year, I mean, the big driver is infant and child care in terms of why we're down. If you kind of look across the categories, adult care is still growing mid-single digits. Baby wipes is still growing low single digits. FemCare is pretty flat. Consumer tissue is pretty flat. And value of infant and child care is down 5%, it's like 1% volume and 4% price. And so net-net, our total categories were down 1% with a good chunk of it being driven by birthrate and then competitive pricing activity in baby and child care.","Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. And then on the promotion question?","Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","Promotion side, I mean, I wouldn't say it's more competitive. Mike, maybe you have a different view of that?","Michael D. Hsu - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","Yeah, Nik, no, I would say comparable to the first quarter. And I think, well, birthrate is a driver in the diaper business, and there is multiple reasons for that, including the hypothesis around the way in household formation. There is a decline in some Hispanic household births. So, that's one side.","But I think the competitive activity has been, I would say, at a higher level than we've experienced in recent years. And that probably started in the back half of last year and has persisted through Q1 and now Q2. And certainly we recognize the need to adjust and fine tune our promotional plans and strategy and we're doing that.","Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great, thanks a lot.","Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","Thanks Nik.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies.","Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC","Thanks. Good morning.","Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","Good morning, Kevin.","Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC","So first question, this is picking up on Steve's question, can you quantify for us and bridge the 2% organic sales growth that you were targeting at the start of the year and now sort of flattish, and specifically how much of it is a slowdown in the category, is that a point versus how much is maybe market share losses that were not anticipated?","And then related to that, so your guidance now suggests something like up modestly, maybe up 1% in the back half of the year, what's implied in that from an industry growth perspective? And then I have a follow-up. Thanks.","Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","Yeah, I mean, I think we've probably given you about as much detail on this as I can give you. I'm just kind of looking in January, I think if you recall, organic volume was up 2% and price was going to be similar to up slightly. And now we're going to tell you our volume is up slightly and price is probably going to be down slightly. And so, if that's helpful.","Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC","It's helpful, but what's the expectation for the industry? So in other words, I mean, is there an expectation that you're going to see market share in the back half of the year?","Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","I'd say our expectation is that our share should improve relative to where we are in the first half of the year. I'd expect the birthrate change isn't going to shift quickly. So, given that we had the 2% decline in births in the U.S. in the fourth quarter, that's going to roll over into this year. And I don't think the Korean birthrate that we talked about is going to turn around quickly either. So I think you are going to see some of the continued drag on category, and then we'll see where share falls out.","Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC","Okay. And then one follow-up, just sticking with the share question. So we're kind of limited here for now, it's a bit of a blackbox in terms of what's going on online across categories, not specifically the ones that you are participating in. Would we draw any wrong conclusions by looking at the share trends in the Nielsen data? Are you seeing drastically different share trends for your business online?","Because I guess, the way we look at it now, it's a challenging environment, but the market share performance for your portfolio has certainly been difficult. I mean as I look at it over the most recent 12 weeks, you've lost market share to varying degrees across your portfolio. Are you seeing something similar in the online channel? Or is there very different dynamics going on? So any commentary there would be helpful?","And I guess if the answer is, it looks similar, are investment levels appropriate now, both with respect to trade investment, and with respect to advertising and marketing? Does that need to move higher? Is the cost of business moving higher, even while category growths are slowing? So any commentary there would be helpful. And that's it for me. Thank you.","Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","Yeah, I think, Kevin, certainly the offline and non-measured share performance is better than the measured at this point. Our online growth is accelerating and our shares continue to grow. That said, I think we're not happy with our share performance in North America, and we are fine-tuning our plans to make sure that our share performance improves in the back half.","Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Faiza Alwy with Deutsche Bank.","Faiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yes. Hi. Good morning. So I just had a couple of follow-up questions. One on Consumer Tissue. So first, can you just clarify for us, it looks like pulp costs have increased versus April. But then, it also seems like you're not really able to transfer those cost increases to retailers. Can you just confirm that that's just because of the retail transformation that we're seeing especially in your categories? And is there any expectation that that is going to change as input costs potentially continue to increase?","Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","Yeah. There's no question, pulp prices are up sequentially, and our outlook is for them to moderate a bit in the back half of the year because our full year outlook for pulp price is slightly below what the current market price is. And up until this point, it hasn't resulted in any major finished product selling price increases, and I think the question is going to be more on the expected outlook for pulp.","And if people are expecting that to moderate, which at the moment they are, that makes it a little tougher to pass finished product selling prices along. And so, at this point, it hasn't resulted in finished product pricing. We have gotten some pricing in our Professional business. And they've had some similar trends on secondary fiber as you've seen on virgin fiber, but again, it is tough broadly getting selling price increases in developed markets at this point.","Faiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And then just on the competitive environment where you've talked about market share losses, I think this question was asked earlier, but could you just clarify for us how much of this is coming from, like, your primary competitor, like Procter? And how much of it is coming from smaller players? So asked another way, are you seeing, especially, as consumers are shopping more and more online, are you seeing a higher growth in potentially niche brands or private label, specifically online?","Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","Are you talking about any particular market, Faiza?","Faiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","I would say North America specifically, and maybe more so on the diaper side, or just infant child care?","Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","Yeah, I mean, so I'd say, in North America broadly, our shares have been fairly similar sequentially, and I think we're down about 1 point year-on-year. In infant care, Procter has picked up most of that behind their Easy Ups launch last year. I think in another category, I think Mike commented on FemCare, I think it's down two-tenths sequentially and there is not much to talk about there. Adult care, I think we're up four-tenths sequentially.","And if you look at some of the tissue brands, kind of a similar story. Facial tissue, we're down a couple of points year-over-year and up a tenth sequentially. Dry bath, we're down 1 point year-on-year and up 1 point sequentially. Paper towels, we're down a little under 1 point year-on-year and up a tenth sequentially.","And so, yeah, a little bit better, kind of a mixed performance sequentially and a little bit down year-on-year and most of it with the exception of paper towels has been other branded competitors.","Faiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Iain Simpson with Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale.","Iain E. Simpson - Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale SA (UK)","Thank you very much. Morning all. A couple of questions, please. Firstly, could you just talk us through where both pulp and reclaimed paper costs are at year-on-year and how you expect that to progress in the second half? And how we should think about its impact on pricing in both Consumer Tissue and Professional?","And secondly, I guess, a much wider question. I think the U.S. is almost unique amongst developed markets in having a branded Consumer Tissue category where companies can actually earn a return meaningfully in excess of their cost of capital. What sort of gives you comfort that this is sustainable and that what we're seeing now isn't the start of a slide where the U.S. Consumer Tissue ends up looking like Europe or Australia where it's almost completely commoditized? Thanks very much.","Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","Okay, on the pulp question. We typically quote eucalyptus pricing, because that's our biggest virgin fiber category. So our outlook is for $950 to $975 a ton on average for the year. I think the current market price is a little bit above that. And that compares to about $850 last year. So it's about $100 to $125 a ton would be our call up year-on-year.","Secondary fiber, our call, again, there's a wide variety of grades that you can buy there. We're looking at a double-digit increase versus 2016 and it's in the low $200 a ton for the typical grade that we look at.","And the broader margin question, I mean, we do have Consumer Tissue businesses all over the world and with some wide ranging market structures. So U.S. has consistently been a pretty high margin market, but we have other markets like Peru, for example, or Mexico that are similarly very, very profitable high margin markets for us. And even, yeah, markets like Korea and Australia are still reasonably good performing markets.","And so we think the strength of brand and innovation in North America is justifying the value that we're delivering. And we've got scale and efficiency here and that seems to be playing out and supporting the margin levels for most of the players in the category.","Iain E. Simpson - Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale SA (UK)","Thanks very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan.","Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning, everyone. So Tom, just back on your comments on, and I think Mike as well alluded for emerging market. And I understand, of course, China, you are probably lapping what you mentioned in terms of price declines. But I was curious about Brazil, you mentioned that you're probably growing mid single-digits. You also commented about Russia, which similar to Brazil, you have some kind of like return of the FX kind of like now becoming a tailwind.","How can we layer that with, for example, in Brazil, one of your competitors consolidating, the same competitor that consolidated in Mexico, is the competitive environment getting marginally worse there so you have to kind of pull back some of the pricing, some of the promotions into pricing which we're seeing by other multinationals there doing the same thing? Or how should we think, which goes against of course the economy has been improving from its bottom, but if you think about like competitive environment getting worse as we marginally think about Brazil pricing?","Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","Yeah, I mean, I would have said, at least the economic environment in Brazil is getting marginally better, and we've seen that in a little bit healthier category trends in the last couple of share periods. And it's been a competitive environment throughout. So I wouldn't say that we've seen a big step-up in Brazil competitive activity. Mike, I don't know, you were just down there not long ago, so you may have a different comment to add?","Michael D. Hsu - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","Yeah, I think we're cautiously optimistic about both maybe Brazil and Argentina about the economy showing signs of improvement, although that hasn't fully translated into our categories yet.","However, yeah, I think you're right, the competitive environment remains active and probably throughout our second quarter, maybe what we're getting is more volume than price. And I think the team has adjusted their plans to be able to plan that environment little more effectively. What they've done is improved their lower-tiers or their Tier 2 product to make that more competitive and then adjusted some price packs to make the on-shelf affordability better.","So I, I think we're cautiously optimistic about Latin America. I think the team is largely on track with what they set out for the year. And then, with CEE, which you mentioned in Russia, we're pretty excited about that business.","Even though they still have tough economic conditions, I think the consumer still demonstrates that they're willing to spend in our categories. We're up double-digits organically up there in Russia. We've got winning products. The team is executing great in store, we look great on-shelf and you can see it in their share, we're up about 1 point in the quarter in share, as you can see in that performance.","Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC","This is very helpful. Is it fair to say that on those countries specifically and including I'd say layer in your Kimberly-Clark Mexico partners seeing the same thing, is that the fragmentation of the brands not happening that much yet, right, as far as, I mean, we're in different problems, I should say, in emerging markets vis-\u00e0-vis what you see here in the U.S. You don't see yet like the same folks, I think, Walmex definitely does their part on Mexico but from the retail standpoint, you don't see them pushing for pricing the same way or promotions the same way as we're seeing in developed markets. Is that a fair assumption?","Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","I mean, I think it's a little different in each market. In Brazil, there's probably 30 or 40 diaper brands if you looked across every state in Brazil, and some are just tiny and you might have called them a private label, but they're just in one region or one state. And they wouldn't typically pop up on even the Nielsen data. So you have seen the trends, the consolidation around the bigger brands over time and that's not really changing.","And Mexico, we continue to have very strong shares. Pablo and the team down there have done a great job. And I'd say it's about the same number of other players, they occasionally change owners, Mabesa was acquired by Ontex, et cetera, but it hasn't really fundamentally changed the competitive position from that standpoint. And Russia is mostly the international players, it's us and P&G and the Japanese players are present there for the most part.","Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, thank you. Very helpful.","Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","Thanks, Andrea.","Operator","Our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks. I just have one quick follow-up. So one thing we know that Procter is changing in China, it's not just an upcoming launch but also their sales force coverage. They talked about adding 600 people to cover the mom and baby channel in China. So could you just share with us a little bit about your sales model in China, if you've dedicated coverage for channels, et cetera? Thanks.","Michael D. Hsu - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","Yeah. We do have dedicated channel coverage. We do concentrate more in the larger cities. So we probably won't have those head count numbers that our competitor is talking about. The other thing that I would point out Lauren is that almost the majority of our business now is sold online, and so that's where a lot of our resourcing and our strategy is focused on. But the baby channel is very important to us, we've got great coverage there, we've got a great team there and we've been performing very well in that channel.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay, thank you.","Operator","At this time, we have no other questioners in the queue.","Paul J. Alexander - Kimberly-Clark Corp.","All right. Well, we thank everyone for your questions and we'll wrap up with a comment from Tom.","Thomas J.

At that time, instructions will be given as to the procedure to follow up if you would like to ask an audio question.","It is now my pleasure to introduce today's first presenter, Mr. Paul Alexander.","Paul Alexander","Thank you and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Kimberly-Clark's Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Here with me in Dallas today are Tom Falk, Chairman and CEO; Mark Buthman, Senior VP and CFO; and Mike Azbell, Vice President and Controller.","Here is the agenda for our call. Mark will begin with a review of third quarter results and give a short update on the health care spin-off. Tom will then discuss our organization restructuring and also our full year outlook. We'll finish with Q&A. We have a presentation of today's materials in the Investors section of our Web-site.","As a reminder, we will be making forward-looking statements today. Please see the Risk Factors section of our latest Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of forward-looking statements. We will also be referring to adjusted results and outlook. Both exclude certain items described in this morning's news release. The release has further information on these adjustments and reconciliations to comparable GAAP financial measures.","And now, I'll turn it over to Mark.","Mark Buthman","Thanks, Paul, and good morning. Let's start with the headlines. First, we achieved organic sales growth of 4%, highlighted by 10% growth in KC International; second, we increased adjusted earnings per share of $1.61 that\u2019s an all time record and up 12% year-on-year; and third, we continue to see strong results from our focus on capital management, including working capital, cash generation, capital spending and returning cash to shareholders.","Now let\u2019s cover the details of our results. Third quarter sales were $5.4, that\u2019s up more than 3% versus last year. Underlying organic sales rose 4%. Adjusted gross margin was 35.1% in the third quarter, up 70 basis points year-on-year. Adjusted operating profit was up 15% versus year ago with an operating margin of 17.4% that\u2019s up 180 basis points compared to the prior year. Results benefited from organic sales growth $100 million of forced cost savings and lower G&A spending.","I am really encouraged by our team\u2019s continued focus on cost savings and spending discipline that\u2019s helping us improve margins and invest for future growth in areas like advertising which was up $10 million in the quarter. On the other hand, we absorbed $55 million of input cost inflation and negative effects from currency exchange rates.","Moving down to P&L, equity income fell 37% driven by softness at KC de Mexico. In addition, the adjusted effective tax rate was $0.05 drag on the quarter that was mostly offset by a lower share count. So putting it all together, third quarter adjusted earnings per share were $1.61, up 12% year-on-year and reflects continued topline momentum KC International, broad based margin improvements and forced cost savings.","Now, turning to cash flow, our cash provided by operations in the third quarter was $976 million, that\u2019s up 7% year-on-year driven by improved working capital. We continue to drive down primary working capital. Our year-to-date cash conversion cycle is down three days compared to full year 2013 so we\u2019re tracking to comfortably exceed our one to two day improvement objective for the year. ","In terms of capital allocation, third quarter dividend payments and shared repurchases totaled more than $0.5 billion. As a reminder, on October 7th, we increased our full year share repurchase target to $2 billion. That\u2019s up from our previous estimate of $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion as a result of cash proceeds we expect from Halyard Health in conjunction with the spin-off of our Health Care business. So this means that full year dividends and share repurchases should be at about $3.3 billion.","Now, I\u2019ll highlight a few areas from our segment areas for the quarter. In personal care, organic sales rose 6%, performance was led by KC International with organic sales up 12%. In terms of highlights for KCI this quarter, in diapers, organic sales were up 25% in China, 25% in Russia and Eastern Europe and 10% in Brazil. Organic sales in KC International were also up double digits in feminine care, led by Brazil, China, Eastern Europe and South Korea.","Finally, our adult care and baby wipes businesses delivered double digit organic sales growth in the quarter. In North America, personal care organic sales were down slightly, volumes were up for our Poise and Depend adult care brands, GoodNites youth pants and Huggies baby wipes. On the other hand, volumes were down in Huggie diapers and Pull-Ups training pants.","Overall personal care operating margins were 19.5% in the quarter, that\u2019s up 160 basis points year-on-year with improvements in North America, KC International and Europe.","Moving to consumer tissue, organic sales increased 3%. In North America, organic sales were up more than 3% behind strong volume performance. That reflects market share gains, innovation and increased promotion activity. KC International, organic sales were up 5%, was driven by higher net selling prices in response to unfavorable currencies and cost inflation. Consumer tissue operating margins of 16.8% were up 250 basis points year-on-year driven by organic sales growth and cost savings.","Now, K-C Professional, organic sales increased 3%, performance was led by 13% growth in K-C International. We continue to expand our business for industrialization and economic development recurring particularly in North America and China. Elsewhere KCP organic sales were down 2% in North America and up 3% in Europe. Overall, KCP margins were 18.9%, that's up 50 basis points year-on-year. And lastly healthcare organic sales were off 3% mostly due to lower net selling prices, healthcare operating margins up 13.3% were down compared to a strong performance a year ago, our year-to-date margins remain healthy and up year-on-year.","Now a quick update on the healthcare spin-off, we\u2019re in the final stages of completing the transaction, the form 10 registration statement has been deemed effective by the SEC. Halyard\u2019s Board of Directors has been fully established and debt financing for the company is in place. The spin-off has set to occur at the end of the day on Friday, October 31st and Halyard Health will begin trading under the ticker symbol HYH on Monday, November 3rd. ","So that wraps up my comments. To recap, we achieve solid organic sales growth, we delivered significant cost savings on all time record adjusted earnings per share and we continue to allocate capital and shareholder friendly ways. Now I\u2019ll turn it over to Tom.","","Tom Falk","Thanks, Mark and good morning everyone. Since Mark has reviewed our third quarter results, I\u2019ll just add that I am encourage with our performance and a challenging environment. While we certainly have opportunities to further improve our growth initiatives are on track and our financial discipline is generating strong cost savings, margin improvements and cash flow. ","Now let me turn the comment on our organizational restructuring. As we have said all along, since we announced the healthcare spin-off, we\u2019re committing to offsetting the impact of the stranded overhead cost that result from the spin. This restructuring program will do that and will make us more efficient at the same time. Restructuring program will also give us more flexibility to invest in our brands, to invest in our targeted growth initiatives and to build the capabilities that will help us win in the marketplace.","This restructuring is a result of a global assessment by our functions and by our business teams that identified the ways that we could streamline the organization structure, simplify the way we work and make our overhead spending even more competitive with the best-in-class companies. ","Our organizations in all major geographies will be effected by this program. Workforce reductions are expected to be in a range of 1,100 to 1,300 people and primarily affect salaried employees. Majority of the reductions are expected to occur by the end of next year. The financial details for the restructuring are included in this morning\u2019s news release, but to recap this whole cost for the program were expected to be $130 million to $160 million after tax, charges will begin in the fourth quarter of this year and it will be wrapped up by the end of 2016. Savings will begin in earnest next year and should total 120 million to 140 million pre-tax by the end of 2017 that\u2019s nicely above the stranded overhead cost from the spin which are about $85 million.","Cash cost will be about 80% of the total charge, so the cash payback on the restructuring is less than one and a half years. This restructuring effort is further evidence of how we manage our company with financial and cost discipline. ","Now let me move to the outlook for the full year. Although the macroeconomic environment remains volatile, there have been no significant changes to our full year input cost or currency rate assumptions from the outlook that we provided to you in July. Still most currencies have weakened relative to the U.S. dollars just the last month, as a result we expect that currency overall will be a sequential headwind in the fourth quarter as compared with our third quarter results. ","We also continue to closely monitor the environment in Venezuela. Access to letters of credit to pay for imported raw materials there continue to be inconsistent. Going forward if we don\u2019t receive adequate amounts of letters of credit, we could curtail some of our production as necessary rather than further increase our U.S. dollar exposure.","Now in terms of our business overall, we have good top-line momentum with more than 4% organic sales growth of the first nine months of the year. We expect the full year to be at least at the midpoint of our 3% to 5% target. On the bottom line, our guidance for the year is consistent with our previous outlook adjusted for the healthcare spin-off. We expect to adjusted earnings per share will be between $5.93 to $6.03 assuming the spin-off occurs at the end of October. This guidance includes a $0.10 per share impact from the spin-off of the last two months of healthcare's 2014 earnings. Our previous guidance was between $6 and $6.15 a share and included a full year of healthcare results.","So adjusted for the spin-off, the midpoint of our current outlook is equivalent to the midpoint of our previous guidance. Following the spin historical results for healthcare business will be reported that earnings from discontinued operations so included in our 2014 outlook is $0.47 of adjusted earnings per share from discontinued operations. That means our outlook for adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations is $5.46 to $5.56 a share. ","So summary, we continue to deliver good financial results and we\u2019re on track with our plans for the year, we\u2019re taking further steps to improve our business and we are convinced that successful execution of our global business plan will continue to result in strong returns for our shareholders. That wraps up our prepared remarks and now we\u2019ll begin to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","","Ladies and gentlemen, at this time the floor is now open for your questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Gail Glazerman with UBS.","Gail Glazerman - UBS","Just starting on the restructuring program, do you think the benefits you could see next year can at least offset the stranded costs? I know you\u2019re not looking for much impact, but can they at least offset that?","Tom Falk","I think between the combinations of the benefits we\u2019re going to get plus we\u2019ll have some transition services agreement income, we should be able to cover the stranded cost hit next year. We\u2019ll give you more guidance on specifics on that in our January fourth quarter release when we\u2019ll have more specific guidance for 2015.","Gail Glazerman - UBS","Okay, and just turning to Personal Care, can you talk a little bit about both the adult incontinence market and the strength that you saw particularly in light of P&G's reentry into the market, as well as diapers? And is there something strategic and big that you need to do to start to get that growing again?","Tom Falk","Sure, I\u2019ll cover both of those. In Adult Care, we probably would say that we\u2019ve done a pretty good job of preparing for the entrance of Procter into the category, so we\u2019ve been able to launch a lot of innovations. We\u2019ve actually strengthened our distribution in the face of their launch. So we feel like we\u2019re on track with our plan for the year, and yes, I am sure you\u2019ll hear from Procter later this week. My guess is they\u2019ll say they got the distribution they were looking for and their launch it on track. And so it could be that both those statements are true and the rest of the category is feeling the tension in terms of ten on private labels is where most of the share gain that Procter\u2019s got and so far has come from, but good strong growth there.","On the diaper front, what you\u2019re seeing is, is a trading up trading down phenomenon. Our super premium segment of our category grew double digits in the quarter picked up a couple of share points, but we\u2019ve lost more than that in Huggies main line and Love\u2019s picked up a fair amount of share. And so there is some product performance things we\u2019ll be addressing and we\u2019re going to make sure we\u2019re watching the value gaps with Love\u2019s to try to stabilize that business and deliver a better performance. But you can rest assured that we\u2019re not happy with the U.S. diaper business at this point in time.","Gail Glazerman - UBS","Okay and just lastly on K-C Professional, I guess there is a way from home increase in the market can you just give us an update on how that\u2019s proceeding?","Tom Falk","","Yes, we\u2019ve probably had limited benefit from that and as you saw in the quarter, we had negative price in KCP in North America. So you\u2019re seeing some price erosion in the low end of that business and so any net price gain has been pretty minimal at this point in time, and I think you\u2019re seeing a fairly stagnant economy is probably not helping much on that front.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ali Dibadj with Sanford Bernstein.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford Bernstein","So a couple of things, first one to push a little bit more on diapers and as a broader category because in North America, because you talk a little about price mix improving slightly but then in North America in particular clearly the Huggies volumes were down and I am trying to understand whether you\u2019re seeing any resurgence into Pull-Ups versus what used to be any improvement from the consumer trade up there? And also any birth rate changes, we\u2019re starting hear rumblings of positivity there?","Tom Falk"," ","Yes, we'd say in the birth has been very slight positive signals so far, which in a sense is good, it\u2019s not falling anymore. So that\u2019s probably good news. I wouldn\u2019t say it has turned into a baby boomlet yet on that front. And then in the Pull-Ups category, we really aren\u2019t seeing much traction yet and so still moms staying in diapers a little longer, still seeing size six growing as moms are choosing to stay at that level, so those things we\u2019re working on to make sure we\u2019re driving the right innovation in Pull-Ups. We did have a very good, GoodNites quarter as we launched some new innovation on GoodNites and so our total childcare volumes were pretty flat in the quarter, but Pull-Ups was down and GoodNites was up, and didn\u2019t show up in the share number because there is a lot of GoodNites stuff as pipeline fill.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford Bernstein","Okay and then on North America consumer tissue looked like volumes were good, price mix was down three, can you talk about the effect of de-sheeting on that price mix (obviously) [ph] it might have rolled off? And in particular how much of that is related to what we\u2019ve been hearing for years now, but sounds like it\u2019s down in the ground and producing the private label pad technology trying to compare with Europe pad? And moreover what do you think the price volume equation looks going forward?","Tom Falk"," ","I think the -- good question. So, I\u2019ll say on consumer tissue, we\u2019ve rolled off most of the de-sheeting impact, so there wasn\u2019t much in the quarter on that front at all. We did step up promotional activity from second quarter where we were not competitive in the marketplace. It was competing with other branded activity in the market where some of our competitors have stepped things up in the second quarter. We picked it up in the third quarter and you saw that show up in the volume growth so business that response well that we were more competitive we were not leading the price down but we were trying to make sure we\u2019re matching up to the future pricing in the marketplace and saw a good volume growth across the board and a good back to school season on facial and saw high single digit growth there. Good growth on Cottonelle and a solid growth on Scott Tissue, Viva Vantage\u2019s launch is pretty much on track and towel growth was up mid-single digits overall. So, just good execution and making sure you\u2019re competitive on shelf every day.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford Bernstein","Okay. And the last one if I can just throw in is on Halyard in your health care business. So, is it fair to think about the overall dilution I mean we mentioned and we talked about it about 9% on a full year basis excluding any adjustments. But then if you go through and look at the transition services agreement you look at the share repurchases that you\u2019re getting from the payments they\u2019re giving you, and then this incremental cost cutting. Is it fair to think about the net dilution of something like 4% to 5% on an annual basis is that the right way to think about it?","Tom Falk"," ","Yes, I think you\u2019re probably in the ballpark. We\u2019ll give you a little bit more specific guidance on that in January. But I\u2019d say, we\u2019d expect to try to minimize that as much as possible. And we\u2019ll be looking in our January guidance to give you on a continuing ops basis a plan that looks like our global business plan with consistent top line and high single digit bottom line, a mid to high single digit bottom line as we\u2019ve done in the past.","Operator","Our next question comes from Olivia Tong with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America","Good morning. Thanks. Can you talk a little bit about the drivers behind international growth because that continues to be quite robust first half past for the categories growing now have seen any changes in the categories since the quarter ended? And are you gaining more share in existing retailers how much of that is incremental distribution?","Tom Falk","Yes, I mean there is a lot going on in emerging markets and they\u2019re pretty exciting place from a lot of dimensions this year with a lot of volatility and a lot of some political instability mixed in. So, it\u2019s been a pretty exciting place and our teams there have done an awesome job of executing, driving innovation in the market. And so, if you think about Russia and Eastern Europe, we\u2019re up 25% in the quarter done a great job of launching diaper pants in boy\/girl there and have really taken off a fairly tough currency environment, managed to get price to offset a lot of the currency hit. So, we\u2019d say we\u2019re growing ahead of the category there. But the category is probably growing high single low double digits and we\u2019re -- as you look at the broad Russia and Eastern Europe markets together, Russia is probably a little slower than that but good execution from our team on the ground.","China again 25% growth in the quarter that\u2019s on a 45% comp last year, so very strong growth. We\u2019re in the 100 cities now that was our goal to be in a 100 cities by the end of the year. So, we\u2019ve picked up distribution which is part of it. We\u2019ve done well in e-commerce which is the fastest growing segment in China. And so we\u2019d say the Nielsen data would looked at the categories not doing much, our guess would be that China diaper category is probably growing high single or low double digit at this point. And we have not seen a big shift since the end of the quarter that I know of.","And moving to Latin America, good execution in Brazil with the launch of boy\/girl diaper pants there as well in the face of a Unicharm launch and a pretty aggressive Proctor investment and so our business there performed pretty well. And we\u2019d say we\u2019re going to again, probably growing a little faster than the category in Brazil and across Latin America. Argentina would be another market where a lot of economic turmoil but the team has done a great job of delivering price increases and volume increases in the market. So, it\u2019s been an exciting year in international with good innovation, good execution in the market and it\u2019s shown up in good results.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America","Thanks. Appreciate the comprehensive review. And just following up on that, you talked a little bit about the dollar strengthening and where you got price in Russia. How do you think about profitability for KCI going forward obviously with the dollar strengthening beyond just Russia?","Tom Falk","No, I think that it will be a headwind in the fourth quarter for sure, we guess that probably sequentially it\u2019s much of $0.10 headwind on currency third quarter to fourth quarter. And we\u2019ll pull a plan together for 2015 that continues to look at preserving the shape of that P&L and continuing to drive growth in local currency and we\u2019ll be transparent with you on how that shapes up in terms of dollars.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America","Would you expect KCI margins to be up year-over-year next quarter?","Tom Falk","They make good progress this quarter, and they had a good cost savings quarter. They\u2019ve done a great job of getting price where we\u2019ve had currency weakness. And so I\u2019d expect certainly margin stability sequentially. We had terrific margins across our segments in the third quarter so that\u2019s maybe a tougher comp. But I would say if you look at our year-to-date averages in the segments, that's certainly a good predictor of what we\u2019re capable of, and would expect that to continue.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America","Got it, thanks. Just if I could add one last question, I know you\u2019re right now not ready yet to give fiscal '15 EPS outlook but on raw materials with crude and natural gas down pretty dramatically recently would you expect raw materials in places to decelerate next year or does the stronger dollar and still higher pulp and resin more than offset that? Thanks.","Tom Falk"," ","I think this recent move hasn\u2019t floated its way into the supply chains yet. So, if you looked at pulp outlook it was still it looked like its trending higher in \u201915, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the recent moves in the dollar are fully baked into that yet. If you looked at polymer, polymer is going up right now, not down like oil has done but I would expect if oil stays where it is that the polymer supply chain would start to reflect some of that. And so we hopefully have a bit more clarity on that when we talk next in January.","Operator","","Our next question comes from Chris Ferrara with Wells Fargo.","Chris Ferrara - Wells Fargo","","Hey, good morning. Tom, I hate to get into \u201915 again, but I am only doing it because you said a couple of things that I just want to make sure I can pull together correctly, right so you said that this synergy was 85 million, I think you said that you think you could offset that in 2015, I want to also understand how that works with your 2014 continuing operations base of 546 to 556. So that fine 546 to 556 includes all of this synergy, right so you will be offsetting 85 million or call it $0.15 plus a share in \u201915 if you can offset that, is that the right way to think about it?","Tom Falk"," ","Yes, so we\u2019re going to get some transition services in common and in \u201915 it will lost a portion of the 85 million and then we should get the additional restructuring benefits that we think should have a shot at offsetting the rest of it. So, I think the answer to your question is yes, to the extent I understand it.","Chris Ferrara - Wells Fargo"," ","No, that\u2019s helpful, I guess I am just trying to understand what the growth rate will be offered. So that 546 to 556 should have a deflated date, if you were to have sort of a long-term planning algorithm EPS growth rate that you just cited sort of mid to high single-digits in \u201915 it would be above and beyond that 85 million of cost offsets, is that right?","Tom Falk"," ","Yes, I think that\u2019s directionally right, on the other hand we\u2019ll have other investment opportunities, currency, commodity cost issues and so that\u2019s the rest of the picture that we need to bring together into a plan and share that with you in January.","Chris Ferrara - Wells Fargo","Okay. And then I guess on SG&A, the 2014 levels were, I mean even in dollars below 2013, below 2012 levels even. I know you\u2019ve said you\u2019re pretty pleased with cost savings and that\u2019s a good number. But is there anything specific that was going on this quarter in SG&A that we should think about and the sustainability of that sort of trend?","Tom Falk"," ","You have to put more focused attention, I think as people were getting ready for the restructuring they were already starting to cut cost in many areas, good management of the control levels things like travel and other things were lower in the quarter than normal. And so, I think that\u2019s part of it and if you looked at the comp versus third quarter last year, we had more compensation increases last year and we had a little bit of compensation decreases as we adjusted some of our long-term plans in the quarter that might be the only thing that might qualify as a little unusual although those things get adjusted every quarter up or down. Third quarter last year was on the up note and this year was a little bit a little bit lower as we reflected some of the currency implications and other things and on our sales impact on the three year count that\u2019s rolling every year.","Chris Ferrara - Wells Fargo","That\u2019s right. Can you just one last quick one, can you just say where the Venezuela growth was for the quarter?","Tom Falk"," ","Volume growth was pretty flat and so I don't know if Paul has looked at total top-line, but\u2026.","Paul Alexander","","Yes, we did have a little bit of price benefit, but you\u2019re right Tom there was no volume growth in the quarter in Venezuela.","Chris Ferrara - Wells Fargo","Thank you.","Operator","","Our next question comes from a Chip Dillon with Vertical Research Partners.","James Armstrong - Vertical Research Partners","","Hi, this is James Armstrong for Chip. How are you today? The first one is going back a little bit to the cost overhead reduction charge that\u2019s taking place in the fourth quarter. If we\u2019re seeing most of that charge in the fourth quarter, why aren't we seeing the full benefits until 2017, could you help walk us through a little bit of timing behind that?","Tom Falk"," ","Yes. Sure, we\u2019ll book the severance so we made the decision even though of the separations won't occur and will roll out over all of \u201915 and even some in the \u201916.","James Armstrong - Vertical Research Partners","That helps. And then switching to tissue, is tissue volume strength coming at the expense of the other national branded players or do you think you\u2019re gaining share versus private label?","Tom Falk"," ","If you look at the share charge, private label shares were pretty stable sequentially and actually are up a bit year-to-date and our shares are up a bit year-to-date as well. So with the primarily taking share from other player, other branded players.","James Armstrong - Vertical Research Partners","And then lastly as you look at the demographic trends and coming back to this a little, with millennial households forming, what\u2019s your forecast in births in the coming year? And how do you expect that to impact diaper demand as we go out into the 2015, \u201816, \u201817 timeframe?","Tom Falk"," ","I\u2019d say our -- we talked about birth rate in a couple of earlier questions and our prediction is relatively flat, very slow growth in the U.S. birth rate. So, we can quote you a number offline but we\u2019re not seeing much at this point. I would say that\u2019s going to be a big driver of category growth in the next couple of years. But I\u2019d say, we\u2019re also continuing to tinker with the model to be better at predicating at our more recent models looking at household formation. And unemployment levels have been reasonable coming out of the crisis, I am not sure they\u2019re going to be as useful as we move into a more stable economy and find the next driver of growth rate is something that we continue to look for.","Operator","Our next question comes from Wendy Nicholson with KCC.","Wendy Nicholson \u2013 KCC","Hi, my question has to do with Venezuela, in light of sort of how long that\u2019s been as difficult as it\u2019s been for you and others; is there a scenario where you would exit Venezuela like Clorox has decided to?","Tom Falk"," ","Wendy, at this point, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s an option for us. We\u2019ve been consistently profitable in Venezuela, which is I think different from the situation that was there at Clorox. We have substantial Bolivar reserves in the country in cash to continue to finance our operation. Our issue is access to U.S. dollars to import raw materials and so Mark and I have set an overall U.S. dollar cap that we\u2019ve reached for that business. And so as long as we continue to get foreign exchange, we\u2019ll be able to find ways to continue to run the operations there. We\u2019re also looking at more local sourcing, can we find more raw material that we can buy with the Bolivars that we have to run that business. And at end of the day, we\u2019re trying to make sure we\u2019re serving the moms in Venezuela that need diapers and need bathroom tissue every day to care of their families. We\u2019re trying to provide the employment in a stable way for our employees that are there, and as long as we can do that and operate ethically, we\u2019ll continue to operate in Venezuela.","Wendy Nicholson \u2013 KCC","Got it and your market shares there are stable or strong?","Tom Falk"," ","Our market shares have been stable although because we have been limiting our exposure. We know we\u2019re not in full throttle of growth there, so we\u2019ve walked away from business because we didn\u2019t have foreign exchange to bring products in. And as you know from probably reading about that place, there is shortages all over the place, so market share is in a relative driver. I mean, our driver of that business is access to U.S dollars.","Wendy Nicholson \u2013 KCC","Got it and then just back on the U.S. business, obviously to the extent commodities come down as we expect them to and that flows into the market place, I mean it seems like there should be or could be a lot of more flexibility on both your part as well as your competitors' part, just simply get more promotional? And is that a concern for the category, I mean I know you got to be frustrated by your market share trends, but is your plan really to bring innovation to market or is it more marketing or is there a risk that we get into some sort of down and dirty price competition like we\u2019ve seen in some other categories in the U.S.?","Tom Falk"," ","At this point, you\u2019re not seeing the commodity wave flow our direction, in fact if anything, I think polymer went up $0.08 a pound this month or something, so you\u2019re not seeing the benefit flow through that would support the first part of your statement and pulp has been sticky. You\u2019ve seen eucalyptus come down, but it\u2019s still at the high end or even slightly above our full year outlook. Northern softwood hasn\u2019t come down and it is above our full year outlook. So you\u2019re not seeing the commodity underpinnings of that that would lead to more price competition. And at the end of the day in every category, the value that mom gets as a combination of price and performance, and we got to make sure we\u2019re delivering the right product performance at a competitive price, and that\u2019s probably true the world over.","Operator","Our next question comes from Connie Maneaty with BMO Capital.","Connie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets","I am wondering about the restructuring you\u2019re now undertaking, so it looks like it is bigger than the stranded overhead, so my question is excluding the savings that you\u2019re going to get from it, do you think you have enough money to spend defending and growing your categories in diapers and adult incontinence or did you need this program in order to be able to invest more?","Tom Falk"," ","No, I think that\u2019s the right way to think about this is that -- we started out looking at the restructuring program saying first priority is we've got to cover the stranded cost because those are not going away and we\u2019ve got to make sure we do no harm with the spend that we protect the core business. Second priority then is to say what else can we do to create more capacity, to invest in our business to invest in growth ideas, to invest in innovation. And our business teams around the company really rallied to that and came up with an aggressive plan and it's never easy to do these things, and these are people\u2019s jobs and employees' lives that are effective by it but it is something that we need to do to allow us to invest and grow the business. And actually the question is, is it enough, it\u2019s probably never enough. And we\u2019ve also had a great quarter of cost savings in our forced program and we need more from there as well. And so we\u2019re continuing to look at opportunities to get more productive in every aspect of the business to make every P&L line item work for us to allow us to compete and invest and grow our business wherever we\u2019ve got opportunities to do that.","Connie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets","Okay. So are the restructuring programs, you said something I found interesting. Are the restructuring programs essentially designed by the business units or are they more top-down directed?","Tom Falk","Well it was a little bit of both. And the functions that had the most stranded cost there we had a clear target and each of the teams went and worked for that target. On the business unit side they did a lot of competitive benchmarking and said we\u2019re the best in class companies operating in each of the major functional areas that serve each of the businesses and came above up with a list of ideas and initiatives that we supported and decided to go forward with. So like every good plan it\u2019s a mix of top-down and bottom up.","Connie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets","Okay. If I could just ask one final question on Venezuela, I mean, assuming that the three official exchange rates converged to one over time, it\u2019s not going to be towards the stronger end of the currency rates it will be towards the weaker end. So, if these levels converged to say like 30 boulevards or 40 boulevard to the dollar, what\u2019s the impact on you since you\u2019re still at the official 6.3?","Tom Falk","So several things, first of all, the balance sheet would get re-priced so we\u2019ve got little over $400 million I think $435 million will be disclosed in the Q today of exposure that will get re-priced that whatever that new rate is so that\u2019s mostly in cash but it\u2019s -- so that will be effect on that line. And then the next question is again what price are you allowed to sell at so when you have that level of currency devaluation typically there is particularly for imported products finished product price adjustments all those prices are controlled by the Venezuelan government so there would be application for price increases depending on how those go and what level of prices you\u2019re able to charge would determine on whether you\u2019re going to be able to bring in imported products or not or even bringing imported raw materials and convert it to finished products.","And so we take a look at that environment and try to come up with a business plan that made sense. But again you kind of come back to the key driver of it is whatever rate they pick, are you going to get exposure or access to U.S. dollars to be able to pay for the materials and products that you need to sell in that market. And so we\u2019ll work through that whenever those decisions are made by the Venezuelan government.","Connie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets","Okay, thank you so much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Erin Lash with Morningstar.","Erin Lash \u2013 Morningstar","Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I was wondering if you could speak to the acquisition environment obviously the step up in the share repurchase expectations for this year is fairly pronounced. And so I just wondered if that indicated anything about what you\u2019re seeing in terms of valuations for potential acquisitions?","Tom Falk","We are a big acquirer, we\u2019ve done some tuck-ins and [indiscernible] actually most of the tuck-ins we\u2019ve done over the years have been in healthcare. Quite honestly our corporate team has been full consumed with the spend this year and with the -- as well as getting ready for the restructuring. So we\u2019re out of capacity of human capitals to go look at very many deals. But we haven\u2019t seen much likely that was of interest to us.","Erin Lash \u2013 Morningstar","Thank you, that\u2019s helpful. And then just in light of the competitive environment, I wondered if you could speak to just the kind of your assessment of your overall distribution? And if there are areas of opportunity to further extend distribution of your products into specific channels that would be helpful?","Tom Falk","Sure, and the interesting thing is around the world they\u2019re all different kinds of channel migrations occurring so you continue to see the traditional retailers for our consumer products but we\u2019re also seeing more ecommerce in markets like China and Korea, that\u2019s growing very rapidly and is taking a bigger and bigger share of the category. In markets like Argentina there are small panulerras neighborhood diaper stores that are growing rapidly in China, there is these baby stores with a high end diaper baby clothing, baby formula kind of a store that\u2019s a very prolific channel. So one of our key focus points is to make sure our products are available wherever mom wants to buy them and make sure that we get the right offer and the right mix of products on sale and really is tracking those channels and staying connected to mom digitally and finding out where she wants to buy, how she wants to buy has been a key opportunity for us and been a lot of fun for our marketing teams to be able to work on that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.","Lauren Lieberman - Barclays Capital","My first question actually follows on just what you were discussing in terms of distribution and ecommerce. I feel like I\u2019d love to get some color on what efforts you're making in the U.S. because I feel like a cross both baby care and also the tissue business, you\u2019re probably bit under exposed in ecommerce channels, could you discuss what you are doing if anything to sort of to change that?","","Tom Falk","Yes, sure, I'd say while ecommerce is certainly -- we were a little bit late to the party in the U.S., we\u2019re probably ahead of the curve in markets like China and Brazil and Argentina and others, fully competitive in Korea and places like that. So, we\u2019re catching up in the U.S. and have got a good relationship with many of the large ecom players both in the traditional brick and mortar retailers that are going in that space, the Wal-Mart\u2019s and Targets and Sam\u2019s Clubs and Costcos of the world as well as Amazon and diapers.com and places like that. And clearly all of the ecom retailers just like our traditional retailers want the young family as a loyal customer and because of the basket size that those shopper suddenly begin to buy and the lifetime value of that is really important to them and so, we worked a lot on that front. ","Tissue and -- we\u2019re present the logistics of that and the cost of distribution a higher bulk lower value item, the last mile to a consumer home isn't as obvious although there is some activity going on in that space and we\u2019re working with our ecommerce partners to try to figure out where does that make sense and how do we do it most efficiently. ","We\u2019re interestingly doing probably more work now with adult care and so depends and poise are probably areas where you would see a little bit more consumer discretion and you might have a desire to send the product as a care giver to a family member and so there is a kind of a natural opportunity for us to be able to use that and make it easy for consumers to get the products that they need in that market online. Still very small and early days but there is a lot of activity happening there.","Lauren Lieberman - Barclays Capital"," ","Okay, great. And then also on adult care, also small and early days, I was hoping you could discuss the impressive test market and I am guessing also very early but anything you can share on that would be really interesting?","Tom Falk","Yes, I mean we think that\u2019s an interesting idea and could be a very exciting product, it's very early days in the test so we don\u2019t have a lot of data to even read yet. But we\u2019ll see what happens and hopefully we\u2019ll have something to talk about as it comes through the test next year sometime.","Lauren Lieberman - Barclays Capital"," ","And how are you going about just spreading word of mouth on that because I think new --not necessarily new to world but new to the over the counter consumer market and I think education and awareness is a huge piece of it, has that even being viable. So, what are the plans?","Tom Falk","We have a long tradition of talking about new categories in different ways as you look at coming out. We were the first to talk about feminine protection with Kotex back in the 1920s and then depend and talking about incontinence in the 1980s. And so, I think you\u2019ll expect to see with all the new digital tools that we got available opportunities. There we were also connecting with the appropriate medical community as well that with the logical recommenders of product forms like this. So they are exploring some of those different avenues in the test and we\u2019ll see which of those have the biggest return and move the needle and then we\u2019ll try to do more of that as we think about launching. This maybe a product that takes a bit of time to build and we\u2019ll see how that plays out in terms of consumer behavior change.","Lauren Lieberman - Barclays Capital"," ","Okay, great. And last thing is just very subtle, and I think I picked this up correctly, that you talked about Russia and Eastern Europe as a bucket rather than just being Russia and why the change?","Tom Falk","Well we've actually, whenever we\u2019ve said Russia before it always included Eastern Europe, it's just Eastern Europe was pretty small and has gotten bigger, that we thought we should get them into headline so our business in the Ukraine has actually also doing really well. Our business in the stans, the Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Azerbaijan all those countries that none of us have visited very often those -- that part of the world has also grown nicely and it's new geography for us and so we\u2019re going in and building a good business there on the collection of that is actually delivered quite a bit of growth this year.","Lauren Lieberman - Barclays Capital"," ","Okay. So those numbers are comparable, it's just giving Eastern Europe.","Tom Falk","Yes.","Lauren Lieberman - Barclays Capital","Okay. Thank you so much.","Tom Falk","(Multiple speakers) to talk about a little bit more. ","Lauren Lieberman - Barclays Capital"," ","Okay. Thanks, Tom.","Operator","","Our next question comes from Javier Escalante with Consumer Edge Research.","Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research","","Hello. Good morning, everyone. I have a follow up on China, Russia and Brazil. You mentioned that category growth is still at least high single-digit. So, if you could tell us whether this is actual volume growth or is it inflationary pricing, whether you are seeing still trade up, I mean what part of, if you can help us understand in these three markets whether you are seeing a still consumers trading up or is it trade down because of the difficult economies. Could you give us a little bit more of a view of the customer in these three markets?","Tom Falk","Yes, I think a good way to think about all of these markets is that you are still seeing GDP per capital go up in all of these markets. As the middle class builds and builds and more people are employed and are able to enter the middle class and afford our products, so even if they have a downtick in their GDP growth rate, the GDP per capita is still increasing at a descent rate and that\u2019s fueling the expansion of consumable categories. And so I'd say the three markets are pretty different and that's since China there hasn\u2019t been much price.","You typically are seeing consumers\u2019 trade ups, so the lower tiers are moving up into the upper tiers. The golden baby phenomenon is still very much alive or mom wants the very best products for her baby, and so you\u2019re seeing more rapid growth in e-Commerce in China. So, if you looked at Nielsen numbers, you wouldn\u2019t see that kind of category growth rate, but if you -- it's in precise data in China is difficult to get but our guess is that you\u2019d see high single low double digit growth in the category with very little price. ","In the case of Russia and Brazil both, there was some price this year and so Paul, I don\u2019t if you\u2019ve got any more detailed numbers, but in the high single double digit -- double digit growth in both in Russia, you probably had half of that was price, I'd guess in the period and not everybody took it, not at the same time. And there has some innovation in launching diaper pants that is a premium price offering that the consumer has traded up into and so you are seeing some mix improvements in both Brazil and Russia. But both also got some price to offset currency that was a factor in the category growth.","Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research","And when it comes to -- that is very helpful, Tom, actually when it comes to what Unicharm is doing in Brazil, is it similar to what it is in China? Is it super premium product? Or is it different?","Tom Falk","It's a super-premium product and it\u2019s actually priced quite a bit higher than everything else in the market, and so far hasn\u2019t gotten much traction at least in the measured shared data. Both Procter launched aggressively as did we every kind of diaper pant, we know how to make and occupied I think all of the [indiscernible] positioning that Unicharm might want to go do and so we never take them for granted or underestimate them, but so far our defense plans in Brazil have been working pretty well.","Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research","And finally if I may on Mexico which is completely different from the dynamics in Russia, China and Brazil, could you explain us a little bit of what\u2019s happening? Why the JV income profits are down by some much? What is it pricing environment, could you explain that better? Thank you.","Tom Falk","Those -- Pablo Gonzalez will be hosting a call on Thursday, we'll then go in more detail on their numbers. So I don\u2019t want to scoop in too much. But I\u2019d say it\u2019s been a continuation of the trend where it\u2019s been a slower growing economy than was predicted, that\u2019s showed up in slower growth in lots of categories, and more investment in price to try to simulate category growth and I think that hasn\u2019t been fully effective. So we\u2019ve invested in price which has hurt the top line and hurt profitability to hold and stabilize share positions, which we\u2019ve been successful at doing. But it\u2019s been a much more challenging economic environment, I think they\u2019ve had commodity cost inflation as well and a little weaker peso, so it\u2019s been -- they\u2019ve had a number of factors that have combined to suppress their results from what they\u2019re hoping for this year. But Pablo can give you more color on that on Thursday.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank. ","Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank","My favorite topic, toilet paper in the U.S., it seems like there is a price war that\u2019s kind of emerging, I mean how problematic do you see that being because I know your pricing has been negative at least in the scan channels for a while, but it seems like P&G has finally kind of bit the bullet and taken their pricing down pretty substantially in the last three or four months, so do these trends continue and kind of where does it end because like the latest round of data was actually pretty damming in terms of substantial sequential price cuts, so any commentary there would be appreciated?","Tom Falk","I mean the investment level certainly picked up in the late second and early third quarter and we matched up to it in the third quarter, and you saw that in our price numbers. We also saw it in pretty good volume performance, when I look at the overall margins in our consumer tissue business and the uptick that we got in the quarter, this is a kind of near-term high watermark for us. So I\u2019d say we\u2019re balancing the marketing mix and driving the premium variance where we can and investing in price to make sure we\u2019re competitive on future price points. And that\u2019s kept the momentum going in that business which obviously we\u2019re watching what P&G and GP cope to in this environment, but we\u2019re weathering the strong reasonably well.","Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank","Great thanks and then just the 45% of KCI that\u2019s not LATAM, Russia and China, it looks its growing low single digits and I am assuming that those three are up like 17% or something at quarter, so what\u2019s the story there? I mean it\u2019s an opportunity to accelerate growth in those markets. I know Australia is kind of slowing growing, market in South Korea is probably the same, but is there anything else there that is perhaps an opportunity or threat?","Tom Falk","I\u2019d say Korea is actually on track with their plan this year. Again, but it is a slower growth market than a lot of the rest of Asia. Australia, you paint that one correctly and now we\u2019ll have some big currency headwinds in the fourth quarter as they roll forward. The rest of Latin America is mixed bag and in Costa Rica and Central America is a little bit more developed, had a little bit more competition in the quarter so we\u2019re working on some things on that front. But I\u2019d say Australia and Korea are by far the two big players in the balance of KCI that we talked about.","Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank","Great, thanks so much. And then one last final, the call has gone a long time, the growth rate in diapers in Brazil is like half in the latest periods. Do you know what\u2019s driving that because it was sort of like pretty substantial like 20%-ish range and I fell to like 10%, 11%? Do you know if it\u2019s like a temporary spiders or something more sinister going on there?","Tom Falk","No, I mean it\u2019s a more competitive environment. So everybody is spending money like crazy, Proctor is spending aggressively, we are as well, Unicharm is launching. And so I would say delivering double digit growth in that environment has been a pretty solid performance especially against a weaker economic backdrop which probably hasn\u2019t helped on that front. And we\u2019ve had a terrific performance in fem care in Brazil. And so, there is a lot of good things happening in that business overall that we\u2019re pretty happy with.","Operator","Mr. Paul, at this time, we have no other questioners.","Paul Alexander","All right, thanks for all the questions today. And we\u2019ll wrap up with quick comment from Tom.","Tom Falk","Once again solid execution with greater results in K-C International lots of opportunities as we spin Halyard, so congratulations to the Halyard team.

Alexander","Thank you, and good morning everyone. Welcome to Kimberly-Clark's Year-End Earnings Conference Call. Here with us today are Tom Falk, Chairman and CEO; Mike Hsu, Chief Operating Officer; and Maria Henry, CFO. Here's the agenda for our call. Maria will begin with a review of our 2016 results, focusing on the full year. Tom will then provide his perspectives on our results and the outlook for the full year. We'll finish with Q&A.","As usual we have a presentation of today's materials in the Investors section of our website. Now, as a reminder, we will be making forward-looking statements today. Please see the risk factors section of our latest annual report on Form 10-K for further discussion of forward-looking statements. We'll also be referring to adjusted results, which exclude certain items described in this morning\u2019s new release. The release has further information about these adjustments and reconciliations to comparable GAAP financial measures.","And now I'll turn it over to Maria.","Maria Henry","Thanks Paul good morning everyone. Thanks for joining the call today. Let me start off with the headlines for our full year results. Sales and earnings for the year were consistent with our previous outlook. We achieved record cost savings and excellent margin improvement. We generated strong cash flow, improved capital efficiency and return cash to shareholders.","Now let\u2019s take a look at the details of our results, starting with sales. Fourth quarter net sales were $4.5 billion with organic sales growth of 1%. Full year net sales of $18.2 billion were down 2% and included a 4 point drag from currency rates. Organic sales growth was about 2% for the full year in line with the guidance we provided back in October.","On profitability we had very strong performance in 2016 and we expect to make more progress in 2017. Our fourth quarter adjusted gross margin was 37%. Full year gross margin was 36.6%, up 70 basis points year-on-year. Our adjusted operating margins was 18.9% in the fourth quarter, bringing the full year 18.4%, that\u2019s up 110 basis points. Adjusted operating profit for the year rose 4%, right in line with our original target of 2% to 5% growth.","Our team has delivered record FORCE cost savings of $435 million for 2016. That was well above our initial target of at least $350 million coming into the year. Saving were 3.8% of our cost of sales, up nicely from 3.1% in 2015. I'm encouraged by the progress our business unit and supply chain teams are making on this front and I continue to believe there is long-term potential in this area. Our savings target for 2017 is at least $400 million. In the fourth quarter, we successfully completed our 2014 organization restructuring. We generated $70 million of saving in 2016, bringing the cumulative benefit to $140 million annually. I'm pleased that we were able to achieve the high end of our savings commitment one year ahead of plan.","Commodities were $65 million benefit for the year. In 2017 we expect commodities to change from a positive to a negative for us. We're expecting a modestly inflationary environment and we're planning for cost inflation between $50 million and $200 million. Currency declines continue to impact our results in 2016. For the year the total earnings dragged from currency within the low double digit. The net impact of changes in currencies, commodities and net selling prices reduced our earnings by about 10% just above our original plan of a high single digit drag. In total, fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share were $1.45 bringing the full year to $6.03, that was up 5% year-on-year and in line with our previous outlook of $5.95 to $6.05.","Now turning to cash flow and capital efficiently. Cash provided by operations was $3.2 billion for the year, up 40% year-on-year and somewhat ahead of our plan. The increase was driven by improved working capital and lower pension contribution. We expect another year of strong cash generation in 2017. However, it's likely that our cash flow will be down a little bit, given our over-delivery in 2016 and our expectation for higher tax payments this year. We reduced primary working capital cash conversion cycle by two days in 2015 that was at the high end of our original improvement target of one day to two days. We're planning for a one day improvement in 2017. On adjusted return on invested capital we improved these metric 120 basis points. That's well above our long-term target of 20 basis points to 40 basis points.","On capital allocation in 2016, we returned approximately $2.1 billion to shareholders, through share repurchases and dividends. That marked the sixth consecutive year that we\u2019ve returned at least $2 billion to our shareholders. In 2017, we plan to repurchase $800 million to $1 billion of Kimberly-Clark stock. In addition as mentioned in our news release we\u2019re increasing dividend in 2017 by 5.4%. This is our 45th consecutive annual increase in the dividends.","Now let\u2019s take a look at the segment results for the year. In Personal Care organic sales rose 3%. That included 5% growth in developing and emerging market and 4% volume growth in North America. Personal Care operating margins were healthy at 20.5% even with last year.","In Consumer Tissue, organic sales were even with the prior year. Consumer Tissue operating margins were 18.7%, that\u2019s up 120 basis points, including benefits from cost savings and lower input costs.","In K-C Professional, organic sales were up slightly with 5% growth in developing and emerging markets. Lower sales of nonwovens to Halyard Health reduced the segment top line by more than 1%. We don't expect that drag to repeat in 2017. K-C Professional operating margins were 19.1% that was up 80 basis points with benefits from higher selling prices and cost savings.","So to summarize, our full year top and bottom line results were consistent with our previous outlook. We delivered record high saving, improved our margins nicely and increased ROIC. We generated strong cash flow and continue to allocate capital in shareholder friendly ways.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Tom.","Thomas J. Falk","Thanks Maria and good morning everyone. In terms of our full year 2016 results, I\u2019ll focus my comments on organic sales on our market shares and current market conditions. Then I'll address our outlook for 2017.","So starting with our results. As Maria just mentioned, organic sales were up about 2% for the year. In developing and emerging markets, we delivered 4% organic sales growth even though we were impacted by category declines in some markets and by price competition in China.","Let's take a look at some of our key markets. In Eastern Europe organic sales in diapers increased by more than 15%. Results there were led by Huggies in Russia with double digit volume growth and 1 point of market share improvement. In China, organic sales in diapers were up low single digits as strong volume growth was mostly offset by lower selling prices. Our market share was pretty similar year-on-year in China.","Looking ahead in the China market, we expect another year of significant volume growth. Category demand should remain strong and we have lots of innovation coming on Huggies including a new super premium diaper pants that we recently launched on Singles Day in November. Based on market trends in the last 2016 were cautiously optimistic that pricing in China will be less negative than 2017.","Turning now to Brazil, organic sales in Personal Care were down slightly for the year. Category volumes fell throughout 2016 and competitive activity on diapers picked up in the second half of the year. Our market share for the year was down in Brazil 1 point diapers, but up 2 point in feminine care. We expect that market conditions will remain difficult in Brazil in 2017 particularly in the first half of the year.","In Argentina, volumes in Personal Care were down high single digits and that\u2019s similar to the overall category. Conditions were more challenging in the backup of the year and we're continuing to closely watch the dynamics in this market. Our adult care and feminine care businesses in developing and emerging markets had very strong organic sales growth, double digits for adult care and high single digits for feminine care. In developed markets outside of North America, organic sales were even year-on-year.","Moving now to North America, our consumer businesses achieved 3% volume growth and had excellent operating profit performance for the year. Overall, market shares were stable year-on-year in a pretty competitive environment overall.","Looking at key categories in North America. In child care volumes were up high single digits with benefits from category growth and innovation on pull-ups training pants. Baby wipes volumes increased mid-single digits. On Huggies diapers volumes were down low-single digits while market shares were up about half a share point. In adult care, volumes rose mid-single digits aided by category growth and innovation on Poise and Depend.","Then lastly in feminine care and in Consumer Tissue, volumes in both businesses were up low single digits.","Moving to K-C Professional in North America our organic sales were up 2% and we think that\u2019s a little bit ahead of the market in that space.","So overall while we experienced challenging category conditions in 2016, particularly in some of the developing and emerging markets, our market shares are broadly healthy and holding up well in this environment.","Now moving beyond sales. I'm very encouraged with our performance on cost savings, margins, cash flow and return on invested capital. Results on these metrics were excellent and we\u2019re ahead of plan across the board and demonstrating the continued strength and great execution by our business teams. Finally we grew the bottom line by 5% and that\u2019s in line with our guidance for the year.","Now moving onto our outlook for the coming year. In 2017 we\u2019ll continue to execute our global business plan strategies. Our teams will invest in innovation, marketing and targeted growth initiatives to keep our brands strong. We also continue to manage our Company with financial discipline, focusing on cost savings, cash flow and shareholder friendly capital allocation. In terms of our specific guidance, on the top line we\u2019re targeting organic sales growth of approximately 2% that\u2019s broadly in line with our assumption for overall market growth in 2017. But we're expecting only modest improvement in the overall environment in developing and emerging markets. But we aren\u2019t expecting growth to pick back up significantly in 2017, we're still very optimistic about the long-term possibilities for us in these markets.","Innovation continues to be an important part of our growth plans. In developing and emerging markets we've got a number of launches planned in diapers and diaper pants, feminine care and adult care. We also have a strong line up in North America. Near term activity includes upgrades on Huggies Snug & Dry Diapers, Goodnites Youth Pants and Depend underwear. We expect that organic sales growth will be higher in the second half of 2017 compared to the first half of the year and that\u2019s largely because of tougher comparisons in the first half of the year. On the bottom line we\u2019re targeting earnings per of $6.20 to $6.35 and that\u2019s up 3% to 5% compared to our adjusted results in 2016.","We plan to achieve solid improvements in both growth and operating margins in 2017 and that\u2019s despite an expectation for a mid-to-high single digit drag on earnings on the combined impact of changes in currencies, commodities and selling prices. Our outlook also includes a meaningful decline in equity income that's driven by the weaker Mexican peso, which impacts our earnings for K-C de Mexico.","Recent spot rates for the peso have been down 15% or more compared to the average rate for 2016. In terms of capital allocation, you should expect us to continue to be shareholder friendly. We expect to allocate between $2.2 billion and $2.4 billion to dividends and share repurchases in 2017. That's a higher amount than in 2016 and that\u2019s equivalent to 5% to 6% of our current market capitalization. So all in all, we remain focused on continuing to compete effectively in the near term as we execute our global business plans strategies for long term success and shareholder value creation.","That wraps up our prepared remarks and now we\u2019ll begin to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Windy Nicholson with Citi Research.","Wendy Nicholson","Good morning. Could you just talk about the pricing environment, your guidance, specifically for 2017, looks like it's almost entirely volume driven? I'm surprised a little bit not only with currency headwinds, but also with your expectation for higher commodity prices and innovation, why you're not expecting more benefit from price mix. Thanks.","Thomas J. Falk","I think I would say, we\u2019re going to have some carry-over price drag in places like China. We still probably will get some additional positive price in markets like Brazil and Argentina, but we're not counting on a lot of price. In some of these markets the consumer has been pushed pretty hard and we just don't see of a big opportunity to take price. And even in markets like the U.K. where you\u2019ve had though the Brexit phenomena, we will try to take some small positive price increases, but we're not counting on a lot of that to drive our year in 2017. So I think while the currency hit isn't as big as it\u2019s been in the past, the commodities we're assuming that oil is up double digits and secondary fiber is up double digits. But some others like eucalyptus pulp is going to be pretty flat, but we\u2019d just say the net of that is we're not counting on a lot of price in 2017.","Wendy Nicholson","Okay. But your innovation broadly speaking can we assume that that\u2019s for the most part on premium priced innovation or is it more just important to get the pricing right for the local consumer?","Thomas J. Falk","I think. Both of those. We\u2019ve tend to try to innovate on the premium end. We want all of our innovation to be margin accretive where ever we can. In markets like Brazil though, we are making sure we\u2019re innovating on the low tier when the category is moving down into tier 2, you want to make sure you've got a good performing product and can make competitive claims. And so we are trying to make sure we're innovating where the consumer is moving toward.","Wendy Nicholson","Got it. Terrific. Thank you very much.","Thomas J. Falk","Thanks, Wendy.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ali Dibadj with Bernstein.","Ali Dibadj","Hey, so wanted to kind of inter relate two things. One is a marketing research and general expense being down to 70 basis points. Trying to get a better understanding what the driver of that was and if any that was adjustments in Q4 on spend i.e. decline. Linking that to where you're effectively expecting for 2017, which is kind of an acceleration for the past couple of quarters of organic sales growth after this kind of 2% level same for the year. And I get the sequencing you gave in the first half was a back half. But A; was it advertising spend that went down and how should we take that as we think about your expectation for acceleration for 2017 on the top line?","Thomas J. Falk","Yeah so, I guess, the way I\u2019d come out that, I\u2019d say the marketing research general did not include advertising in that number so that would really be the cost of the marketers and any marketing research or other things. I would say if you just looked at the quarter there was probably some more timing things particularly on our R&D where the third quarter was a little heavier than the fourth quarter, which is a little unusual for us. But that why I probably look at the full year number to be more predictive, our advertising spend overall was pretty similar to the prior year fourth quarter, but down a little bit sequentially. So that\u2019s not that unusual. We continue to see shifts out of advertising into digital couponing and a lot of that cost gets captured between gross and net sales. So you don't really get good visibility of that. But as you think about the top line in 2017, the way I would come out at it is that we're calling a roughly 2%, that's roughly what we did in 2016 on average. 2016 was very front half loaded and the back half was fairly wide as you described and 2017 from a cost standpoint, you know have tougher comps in the front half and easier comps in the back half, so I think we\u2019re calling fairly similar overall to what we saw for the full year in 2016.","Ali Dibadj","And then just the sequential improvement that you're seeing, your saying it\u2019s just basically from a cost perspective, right. I mean, the zero and the one this past couple of quarters getting up to 2 you're saying that really just look \u2013 the comparisons are easier for the back half and that\u2019s where we\u2019re going to make up the plaque. Is that the right way to think about it?","Thomas J. Falk","Yeah, that\u2019s right way to think about it.","Ali Dibadj","Then just on the commodity piece to it. You know I guess $50 million to $200 million of inflation. Are you basically saying, you're not going to be able to recover any of that? Is that the right way to think about because historically you've been able to recover 60%, 70% of commodity inflation, so it\u2019s just a different environment right now competitively that you just sounds like won't be able to recover any of that given the pricing you\u2019re suppose in for 2017?","Thomas J. Falk","Yeah, I wouldn't say any of it, it will be much more market specific, so in places like Brazil and Argentina where there's a lot of local market inflation, not necessarily even big commodity categories. You know that they will be taking price up in those markets. Will they recover all it? You know I think that\u2019s an open question. You are seeing more competitive activity in some of those markets. We still have some of the carryover drag from some of the Chinese price reductions that we experienced in 2016 that will be a drag in 2017. In markets like the U.K. or in or even in North America, the level of inflation that we're seeing, we may get some pricing in case KCP around secondary fiber where we\u2019ve got double digit price increases in secondary fiber. But I wouldn't expect to get much price on our other broad consumer categories just because the inflation level isn't that big relative to the size of those businesses.","Ali Dibadj","Okay thanks.","Thomas J. Falk","The other the other thing Ali is that we feel pretty good about our cost savings going forward. And so our ability to absorb a little bit of inflation, these are fairly low inflation numbers, relative to what we've seen in the past and generating cost savings in the $400 million in a year, it gives us the ability to recover some of that and be competitive in the marketplace.","Ali Dibadj","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.","Lauren Lieberman","So I want to just carry on this conversation about pricing versus inflation. Is there something specific to your categories and kind of where they fall in the line of kind of consumer needs and willingness to trade down or pull back on usage, just limiting the ability to price in line with local inflation? If to provide as you said the consumer has been pushed pretty hard, particularly in Brazil and increasingly in Argentina, is what triggering the share losses, their modest. Is it trade down that you're really seeing in the marketplace? Or is it another kind of similarly priced competitor that\u2019s winning currently?","Thomas J. Falk","Is there an all of the above answer I can choose, Lauren on that one.","Lauren Lieberman","No.","Thomas J. Falk","Because I think it is a little bit of all of those I think. There is \u2013 growth rates in a lot of our categories have slowed. We said we were expecting category growth rates of roughly 2%. We would have said several years ago three to four was probably more what we were trending. So growth rates have come down, there's still lots of competition including local competitors who are aggressively pursuing business and we're trying to make sure we\u2019ve got the right innovation, we got the right price point, we\u2019re executing well in market and that probably makes it a little tougher in this environment to get price increases, in a market like Brazil, where the category is going backwards 3% to 4% in volume and you're taking list price up, you can generate some short-term category value increases, you don't want it to be a race to zero either.","Lauren Lieberman","Yeah understood, okay. You had also mentioned in the release, lower category demand in diapers in the U.S. Could you talk a little bit about that, is that a birth rate conversation that\u2019s driving that?","Thomas J. Falk","There's been a pretty big category shift in the last year where training pants category growth is up strong double digits and diaper category growth is down a little bit. Since I got Mike Hsu here on his first call Mike is running North American business, why don\u2019t you weigh in on that one Mike and give them a little color around that.","Michael D. Hsu","Yeah, I think our baby and child care team across both child care and infant, doing a great job, but I do think we see a category shift to train pants and I think in some ways Lauren, we see that as probably some positive green shoots on the economy because training pants to sell at a premium to diapers in a like-for-like sizing, you know the consumers now, when they have confidence in the economy, tend to trade up. And the converse happens when the economy is bad. So I think there has been some shift. The other thing is though that we've made some significant improvements starting in 2015 on product quality. Pull-ups can give a performance of a diaper, but the benefits of training. And so we made a major improvement in 2015, we saw double digit consumption growth in 2015 and that\u2019s carried through to 2016.","Double digit consumption and probably high single digit on shipments and so I think there's been a lot of activity there. In terms of the commercial programming, I think we've been talking to moms about the benefits of training and when to start training and I think that\u2019s having an effect in the category. The other factor is our primary competitor has also re-entered or refreshed their product in the category and made a lot of promotion activity which is probably drawing consumers in the category. So there's been a shift from diapers, but the overall mega category, if say all out at across non-measured and measured channels and diapers and child care is overall plan.","Thomas J. Falk","So we were up a couple of percent or percent and a half or simple like last year.","Lauren Lieberman","And the last thing was just the Nielsen data if there's been this disconnect we\u2019re seeing across companies and categories. But if you can comment at all about in your categories what you think the shift to kind of untrack channels that are driving in terms of growth versus what we're seeing in the open.","Thomas J. Falk","Yeah Lauren, it\u2019s probably playing out the biggest in diapers and because of a couple of factors. The non-measured, the online channels are growing at a rapid rate and so you can't see some of the customers that are in there. Also some of the changes in terms of who is reporting with whom between Nielsen RRI [ph] also going to start affecting us as well. So it's a bit of a challenge right now when we're working through some of these issues too.","Lauren Lieberman","Okay. All right. I'll pass it on. Thank you so much.","Thomas J. Falk","Thanks, Lauren.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jason English with Goldman Sachs.","Jason English","Good morning folks. Thank you letting me ask the question. Like the others, I\u2019ve got two questions. First at a high level. Tom your guiding FORCE, so your second year of under-delivery versus your historical 3% to 5% aspiration. You mentioned category growth overall is obviously a key contributor with it just being at a slower end market environment out there. How are you thinking about the forward, is there a path back to that 3% to 5%. Is sort of 2%, maybe to 2% to 3% is sort of a new reality for at least the foreseeable future. If there is a path that's going to drive us higher, what are some of the key variables that you think we should be looking at, at the gate whether or not we can get traction on that.","Thomas J. Falk","Yeah, that's a key question, Jason. Obviously, I\u2019d say, Latin America economic recovery would be a key driver. So if you look at Brazil, Argentina, they\u2019re taking a pretty big shock, but Brazil in particular from lower oil prices. As those come back that we\u2019ve got pretty big business with down there that could tier a lot of top line growth issues. On the other hand, as you look at places like Russia, China, still very strong category volume growth and we still see big penetration opportunities in lots of markets around the world. So I think that's why we would still say long-term there\u2019s huge opportunity here for us. In the short-term we're at a little slower spot than the GDP growth per capita of range that we're going to make the categories go at a little slower rate.","Jason English","Makes sense. Thanks. Next question is on EBIT math. I really appreciate all the inputs you give us in terms of the guidance assumptions into next year and I also obviously appreciate the bridges you gave in the Qs in terms of what's driving EBIT growth. We can kind of use all these variables to build it up and see what the theoretical earnings potential is for next year. But one wild card that we don't have good visibility to is the other line that you roll in the 10-Q, I know there\u2019s a lot in there. But it's been a material source of leakage the last couple of years, north of $400 million every year of operating profits and leaking out to other line. Can you give us some color on what are some of the key inputs to that? How we should be thinking about that catch-all other as we go into this year?","Thomas J. Falk","Yeah, well, call it other Jason, because it is just a big unknown, but no seriously, I\u2019ll let Maria give you a little bit of color, but there\u2019s a lot of local inflation in there. We also have other product improvement costs would be in there, so for upgrading and adding functionality to a product we would put that into that line. Any start-up costs for new capital equipment around the world would go into that line, I don\u2019t know Maria, if there\u2019s anything else you would add to that or build on that.","Maria Henry","Yeah, I think that's right. It definitely has a currency component to it as well as the inflation component to it is what drives it.","Jason English","And thoughts on what that could look like as we go through 2017.","Thomas J. Falk","I would say that line tends to be pretty similar year-to-year, but I don\u2019t know Paul, if you\u2019ve got any other, we have never tried to forecast other, so.","Paul J. Alexander","Yeah, I mean typically as you'd expect with all companies we're going to have general inflation in our P&L and we break out the commodity component of that inflation. But wage increases, things of that nature, benefit cost, those are going to be, I would say modestly increasing year-to-year.","Thomas J. Falk","Pretty similar year-to-year.","Jason English","All right. Thanks a lot guys. I\u2019ll pass it on.","Thomas J. Falk","Thanks Jason.","Operator","Our next question comes from Caroline Levy with CLSA.","Caroline Levy","Hi, good morning. Just a follow-on, on that inflation question \u2013 wage and benefit inflation. Paul you\u2019re saying that that sort of the offers, that its excluding the other or I mean, is there allocation to each division?","Thomas J. Falk","Each country team would have their own wage and benefit program and we just \u2013 as we break out the analysis of change and share that with you, we capture those cost increases on the other bucket and so I think that\u2019s the nature of the question that was asked. So we try to run a very efficient corporate overhead team and Maria oversees the corporate G&A budget and I know they're planning for a fairly flat, I don\u2019t know if you want to comment on how you\u2019re approaching that going into 2017.","Maria Henry","Yeah, on the corporate side we have pretty aggressive management of those expenses. I think you saw a decrease year-over-year 2016 to 2015 when you look at that segment reporting that we have on the corporate expenses. So we\u2019ll remain diligent on that and I think we benchmark well in that area.","Thomas J. Falk","Trust me if we were sending our operating unit teams bigger bills from corporate, we would hear about it, so.","Caroline Levy","Got it. Okay. My other question is understanding what's going on in the China diaper market please. Because my understanding is there's kind of 30% share now are held by locals. And it's a bit confusing that in something with technology I would imagine, very important that hundreds of local players have been able to take so much share. If you could just tell us a little bit more about what's going on with pricing. What's going, what isn't and how you see us coming out of this?","Thomas J. Falk","Yeah that local share seems very high to me. I mean, you\u2019ve got essentially four big global diaper players with P&G is still the share leader. Their share is high teens. Our share would be high teens. Kao would be similar and Unit Term [ph], I think it's about 10 share. Then [Hang On] which is the local players about a 5 share. So I think Caroline it may depend on which dataset you're looking at their because there\u2019s a substantial portion of the Chinese market is in e-commerce. Another good chunk is in baby superstores and then there is relatively smaller segment than you might see in other markets that are in traditional retail. So if you looked at a just a Nielsen traditional retail number you could probably get a high share for a local player but that\u2019s covering a very small part of the market.","Caroline Levy","Got it I mean I actually got those numbers from a competitor, but it does seem clear that competition is extremely high and pricing is weak. What do you think marks a turning point in this \u2013 in pricing?","Thomas J. Falk","Well, I think the pricing is down double digits for the year, a lot of that happened in the \u2013 started really in late of 2015, but rolled through early 2016. Our expectation is going into 2017 that pricing is not going to get better in the short term. We do see good category volume growth, see a strong growth rate, high single digit, maybe even low double digit increase in births in China, good category participation rate. So there aren\u2019t many markets in the world that are growing that fast and it's not surprising that that there's a lot of competition there. Our team has done a fantastic job of is improving the products and reducing our costs, so that our margins overall in China are still quite attractive.","Caroline Levy","That's great. Thank you very much.","Thomas J. Falk","Thank you Caroline.","Operator","Our next question comes from Stephen Powers with UBS.","Stephen Powers","Good morning. Tom on the composition of growth next year, maybe looking at by segment. Are you anticipating a similar mix in terms of the growth between Personal Care Tissue and Professional? Or do you see an acceleration in Tissue and Professional and then perhaps offset by some level of decel in Personal Care?","Thomas J. Falk","For Personal Care, should still be the fastest growing segment I would say overall. KCP had about 1 point drag this year on their segment organic growth due to lower sales to Halyard and some of our internal nonwovens, so that was expected because that supply agreement kind of wound down. So we won't have that negative comp of holding them back in 2017, so KCP could be a bit higher. Consumer Tissue I'd say overall will be pretty similar.","Stephen Powers","Okay. Thanks. And then Maria if we turn to FORCE, I know there are a ton of moving parts and how you run that program from the bottom up. But is there any way you can call out any kind of bucket of costs in particular in terms of where you saw upside in fiscal 2016, just looking back over the year. Then more importantly, where you expect the most incremental improvement to come in 2017 because the momentum. Both based on what you achieved in 2016 and what you\u2019re indicating that for 2017 is well ahead of where I think you would have put it a year ago at this time. So I\u2019m just trying to understand better where you're seeing that momentum sourced from? Thanks.","Maria Henry","Sure. Yeah for the FORCE cost savings, come in three main areas and that was consistent in 2016 as it has been and those as a remind our savings that we drive from negotiating with our vendors, so on lower material prices, improving our productivity in ways across our facilities through manufacturing process and driving out ways everywhere. The third area is optimizing the cost of our product specifications and in particular looking for \u2013 what are things that don't matter to the consumer that we can optimize or how do we engineer our products with more effective material to lower the overall cost of the product. So those were the three areas for 2016 that drove our FORCE cost savings. What I will say though is because we did a little over our expectation our teams were incredibly focused on driving savings as we continue to fight it out in the very tough macroeconomic environment. So some of the areas where we over-delivered include in our international markets and also in some of our manufacturing and distribution operations. Those were ahead of our expectations in 2016,","Thomas J. Falk","Just a thing I would add to that is Maria and our new supply chain leader, Sandra MacQuillan, have done a great job of driving inventory down. As we have \u2013 had held less inventory you get lots of other distribution and logistics savings and that probably another area that we\u2019ve done better and I think there's more to come there.","A \u2013 Maria Henry","Yeah I would agree with that and I think that really helped us on the cash flow side. We put two days off of our CCC, that was in the high end of our expectations and a lot of that improvement was driven by inventory, which I'm particularly pleased with the teams are very focused on that area. Not only global supply chain, but the local teams are really doing a great job on working capital.","Stephen Powers","Okay. Thank you very much.","Thomas J. Falk","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank.","Bill Schmitz","Hey, Tom, good morning.","Thomas J. Falk","Good morning Bill.","Bill Schmitz","Hey a couple of things. The first is do you guys think you have enough spend capacity. It seems like all the growth in the category the next 10 years, as they come in the pack category. So have you thought about the capital requirements there? Whether you think it's more modular diaper lines to make taped in pant diapers in the same line.","Thomas J. Falk","Yeah, I mean, I\u2019d say the simple answer to your question is yes, we do believe we have enough pant capacity and so we\u2019ve been at and that\u2019s pretty much we\u2019ve been adding pant capacity in major market in the world. We got new assets in China, Brazil, Russia, Czech Republic even Central America. And so - and our team in Mexico has also added capacity, so yeah we do feel pretty good about that. Not to get too technical, but the grade change between the diaper and a pant would be time consuming enough, that you probably wouldn't want to do it very often, so it's better to have dedicated assets.","Bill Schmitz","Okay, all right, that\u2019s helpful. Then what do you think the end game is for all the competitors, with all the pricing activity we\u2019re seeing in some of these markets. Is it mostly like distribution specific, so like are you seeing super intense activity on e-commerce side in China and maybe less activity in the traditional stores? Any deeper color on like what you think the rationale is for \u2013 so it seems like it\u2019s just breaking the category growth globally. So I'm just trying to figure out like what you think the end game is for yourselves and others.","Thomas J. Falk","Yeah, I mean, I think the end game for us is deliver winning products, build market share and sustain your business over time. You know it's kind of tried and true techniques and in China we invested a ton in 2016 in our newborn program to make sure that we were capturing new moms and carrying them through. We're doing a lot of hospital sampling in many markets around the world to make sure that mom goes home from the hospital with the right products. And so it's all the basics. I mean, as we deconstruct some of the P&Ls to attempt of our key our competition, I think these are still attractive businesses, even at reduced prices and we've been good at getting the cost out to help protect our margins structure. And so we want the diaper to work better and cost less and if we can continue to deliver on that, yeah, that makes it tougher for anybody to compete with us. I don\u2019t know if that addresses it specifically. There\u2019s another part to your question, Bill, I don\u2019t know if I answered better or not.","Bill Schmitz","That\u2019s perfect. The other probably is just like do you see more aggressive activity in like different parts of the distribution network nearby channels or was it?","Thomas J. Falk","I think the point I would make there is that e-commerce is making pricing more transparent everywhere. So there's more \u2013 you know if retailers just to comp each other\u2019s promoted prices and now e-commerce you can go comp three websites quick and easy and there\u2019s apps that'll do it for you and so I think that's probably driving more of an EDLP type environment recognizing, there\u2019s still room for some promotion. I don\u2019t know Mike if you've got a view of that of what you see in North America.","Michael D. Hsu","Yeah, I mean, North America I think the e-commerce is having an effect and I think it\u2019s both the transparency, it\u2019s also maybe the game theoretical impact which is \u2013 some of our customers feel like they can, promote their products and they're service offering more aggressively, promoting certain product lines more aggressively. I think that has a \u2013 as you may call that it a deflationary effect across the categories some times. And so in some ways, you could argue that, it\u2019s not healthy for the category, in other ways, you know can bring new users into the category. So you know our job is, we\u2019re trying to serve our customers across the board and we need to make our products that serve their needs and the economics can work for us and so that's how we're approaching it.","Bill Schmitz","Okay. Great. And then just one last quick follow-up. I mean, is there anything funky, I know you said there is a shift in spending on the R&D side on the SG&A line, with (M&A) or whatever in the fourth quarter. Was there anything like instead of comp reversals or things like that digital app [ph] next year?","Thomas J. Falk","Nothing really unusual and that\u2019s said just we were probably tightly controlling spend, but as you would hope we are always doing. But I would say no there was no unusual item that rolled through there.","Bill Schmitz","Okay, great. Thanks so much.","Thomas J. Falk","Thanks, Bill.","Operator","Our next question comes from Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets.","Nik Modi","Two quick questions. Tom, if you could just give us your assessment of the global consumer, I'm putting the category dynamic aside with competition. Just we're hearing from a lot of global companies right now and it seems like the message is that the emerging markets are starting to stabilize. I'm just curious on what you're seeing in some of the big markets. Then the second question is and I know this is kind of out of left field, but are you guys working on anything actually as it relates to robotics and automation, not just in the supply chain and manufacturing but more back office type stuff? Thanks.","Thomas J. Falk","That is a left field question Nik, I think that would be the first time I have had that one. But let me answer the first question. So the global consumer I would say probably a bit of a mixed bag if you're in a economy that had oil as a large part your economy, but you\u2019re feeling still some pressure. So now you saw negative GDP in Russia. Nigeria, certainly under pressure, very slow or negative GDP per capita growth there. Some of the challenges in Brazil have been there as well. So if you're a oil consuming nation you\u2019ve got a big windfall in 2016 and so a pretty good GDP per capita growth generally or improving. So I would say if you look at a market like China, the underlying category demand growth, the birth rate those are all really positive signals.","Despite a little bit of a little bit of a slowdown in their overall GDP growth, you still saw a really good growth in GDP per capita and more consumers coming in reach of our products and entering the category and starting families et cetera. And you\u2019d see some similar things. Vietnam is a very a good market for us as well. You saw \u2013 actually saw a very \u2013 we had a terrific year in Korea, despite a fairly flattish economy, our Korean business did pretty well. So I\u2019d say, the U.K. with Brexit. Our KCP business in particular saw, a little weaker year than we were expecting there. I think you saw some distributors not wanting to hold inventory, not certain necessarily what was happening next, that seemed like that calmed down a bit at the end of the year. It feels like maybe the U.K. is more stable at the moment and we'll see what the next step is in Brexit. But I don't know Marie if you want to add anything to that, so.","A \u2013 Maria Henry","Yeah, I\u2019ll take the next one though.","Thomas J. Falk","Okay, go ahead, do robotics \u2013","A \u2013 Maria Henry","And robotics, yeah, and machine learning in back office, yeah. We have a global business services initiative at Kimberly-Clark. We've got shared services center around the globe, where we look to consolidate and optimize transaction services and more routine type of back office work. And robotics automation can be applied in those areas, so we are working with our vendors and staying on top of the technology. And understanding why is that opportunity for us. But clearly its part of our global business services initiatives where we're looking at robotics, automation, machine learning and how we might be able to change the game on that in the future.","Thomas J. Falk","Maybe just to build on that Nik, a way to think about it is if you could think about the perfect order or the perfect payables transaction or the quantity, the price, the delivery terms, everything lined up perfectly with the purchase order or it could sale right through your system and get paid without any human involvement, that would be the gold standard. I'd say too often some of those things don't work out and you need human beings to fix and adjust and correct all those minor errors that happen. And if you think about a customer transaction, if we could take the customer's order, get the price exactly right, the quantity shipped on the date they wanted it with the correct terms. So it applies right through our system and their system without any additional intervention that's a big opportunity and it takes friction out of everyone's transaction costs. But we still got a long way to go to get to that.","Nik Modi","Great. Thanks so much for the perspective.","Thomas J. Falk","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Erin Lash with Morningstar.","Erin Lash","Thank you for taking the question. I was hoping we could talk a little bit about usage particularly in for diapers in developing and emerging markets. Obviously, with the economic environment been challenging particularly in Brazil whether that, you've seen usage continue to come down or whether some of the price competition that you\u2019re seeing is actually negating a declining, or any on preventing I guess, a decline in usage?","Thomas J. Falk","Yeah, I would say, Erin, it\u2019s kind of a mixed bag if you looked at Russia, which has had a pretty good economic shock, we still saw a very strong a category growth. Our Huggies business was up double digits in volume and we had higher selling prices, lot of innovation so responsive consumer to that. Brazil on the other hand you\u2019ve tended to see, category volume declines in the low single digits 3% to 4% over the last couple of quarters. So that would say the consumer is either reducing their household inventory or reducing their usage in some cases or shifting from five or six diapers a day to three or four diapers a day that could account for that, if a subset of the consumer base is doing that. Argentina has probably been the biggest shock, they\u2019ve had a pretty big economic transformation under way, there are going to move some of their utility cost to more of a market rate and that's having a big impact on household budgets and you're seeing lots of categories declining in that market. I think it will take some time to really tell how that\u2019s going to shake out. But we saw in the third and fourth quarter in Argentina double digit declines in category diaper volume, which, that\u2019s pretty unusual, you don't see that every day.","Erin Lash","That's very helpful. Thank you. Then just with regard to the growth that you're seeing in the training pant category in the U.S. that\u2019s been entirely driven by the, I guess, average age toddler or child as opposed to a shift or any consumer interest in moving down similar to the emerging markets for the diaper training pants has been picking up steam and is preferred for even newborn consumers, correct?","Thomas J. Falk","Yeah I think that\u2019s true. I don\u2019t Mike, do you want to comment on diaper pants broadly.","A \u2013 Michael D. Hsu","Yeah, I think we\u2019re still digging through the data on that, but I do think, a part of it is, I would say yes right now it's about average. I think our training pant business leaders would say, hey you know we think mom\u2019s should be starting earlier and so there's a strategy on their part to say, hey, we want our children to start training earlier and we want them to stay more consistent in the training pant, and so that\u2019s long-term strategy for the pull-ups brand manager. Then for the Huggies, they want them to stay in Huggies and I think our job again here is to want to serve the consumer and how they want us to be served and give them the choices and provide the best products, so they can make the choice.","Thomas J. Falk","Then to your point in the U.S. market we're not offering training pants that go down to newborn sizes. Or as in some of the emerging markets you do find diaper pants in smaller sizes although, usually not newborn, but usually in size one, two, you find some of those are still pretty small part of those categories.","A \u2013 Michael D. Hsu","Yeah, training tends to start around 18 months to 24 months.","Thomas J. Falk","Yeah and even diaper pant usage in emerging markets tends to start when babies are a little bit more active crawling stage.","Erin Lash","Thank you. That's very helpful.","Thomas J. Falk","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Olivia Tong with Bank of America.","Olivia Tong","So obviously with the comps that you have in 2016, you\u2019re looking for organic sales growth to more second half weighted. But can you talk about the phasing of some of the innovation that you discussed in your prepared remarks? Are there some quarters that will benefit more than others. And then on price makes, obviously you said flat to up slightly, but you're now looking much from prices, we already discussed, so it sounds like obviously more is coming from mix. So much what's that based on? Do you expect the environment to improve as the year progresses and consumers mixing up? Or is there something else to that? Thank you.","Thomas J. Falk","Yeah, I\u2019d say, there could be a couple of mix factors. As I said earlier in China we invested a lot in newborn in 2016, as those babies move up into the more mainstream diapers, you know we expect to see a little bit of more positive mix. And newborn hurts our mix just because there's more diapers in a bag and you sell the bag for the same price. Although you'd argue that builds your franchise, so you definitely want to have a leadership share there. But we\u2019re probably a little overweight newborn in China and that will have an effect on us going forward. I\u2019d say broadly we're not expecting a lot from price or mix in 2017. So I think they would both be slightly positive, but that's not going to be the story driving our growth, that\u2019s going to be core volume.","Olivia Tong","Got it. And then the cadence on innovation.","Thomas J. Falk","Cadence on innovation, obviously it\u2019s going to vary by market and so typically we've got quite a bit of stuff going on in North America. Mike I don't know if you want to comment on some of the things going on in independent polls without revealing any too much competitive launch data.","A \u2013 Michael D. Hsu","Yeah I think the teams there, particularly in adult care were still focused on driving the category penetration, which is still a big opportunity for us, the business is performing well, up mid-to-high single digits. I think the innovation is coming. We\u2019re really focused on that you know adding value in the category and some of things, employees within Shape [ph] and Depend in the 2016 like Depend which has been a very successful item. And then coming in 2017 new and improved super premium on Depend both real fit and silhouette. So again super premium, softer, more broadened set of performance.","Thomas J. Falk","In China we launched a new super premium diaper pant in November and so that will really just start to get traction as we roll into of 2017.","Olivia Tong","All right. Thank you so much.","Thomas J. Falk","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo.","Bonnie Herzog","I just had a question on your Personal Care business North America. Could you talk a little bit more in the competitive environment and promotional activity, which appears to remain pretty elevated across major category. Then can you give us a sense of how you're thinking about the environment going forward? What's really factored into our FY2017 guide?","Thomas J. Falk","Yeah, Bonnie, yeah, I think the environment is elevated and I think we saw an elevation occur in the third quarter, you could probably see that through in our results back then. I think we improved in the fourth quarter, I think the team has responded well to the kind of the change in environment and ramped up their intensity in terms of both securing the right merchandising activity and the right marketing activity. I think our call is that it\u2019s going to remain this way for a while, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re assuming for 2017. I think our teams are prepared for right innovation both in diapers, child care, adult care and fem care and we\u2019re excited about our plan for 2017.","Bonnie Herzog","Then regarding your innovation pipeline, would you characterize in general your pipeline, as more full versus last year across your categories? Just trying to get a sense of where you go out with innovations going forward?","Thomas J. Falk","Yeah, I\u2019d probably say comparable, but we've got some pretty good items in there and I think we\u2019re not ready to kind of disclose what they are yet, Paul, But I think we feel good about it.","Paul J. Alexander","Yeah, so I\u2019d say, Bonnie, we\u2019re pleased, but never satisfied on that front.","Bonnie Herzog","Okay. And then just one final question for me, can you just give us a sense as to how your higher margin wiper business with K-C Professional is trending recently. I think it\u2019s been a few quarters, since you guys called this out. So just trying to get a sense that you still think, strong growth there or things may be moderated. Thanks.","Thomas J. Falk","Yeah, I would say you know wipers was a little - was flattish in the quarter and for the year. We saw a little bit more growth in our core washroom business, so we've driven a lot of our innovation and commercial programming around the washroom and its probably refreshed that business a little bit. We\u2019re still seeing opportunity with wipers particularly in some of the heavy manufacturing areas, things like aeronautics and so forth, where we do a fair amount of work. So as those picked up we should see some opportunities to drive more wiper business.","Bonnie Herzog","Okay. Thank you.","Thomas J. Falk","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ali Dibadj with Bernstein.","Ali Dibadj","Thanks for the follow-up. So look, I was just reflecting on the whole conversation this the time and last quarter and everything and we\u2019re all kind of taking as a granted, that there is much more competition out there. But we don't talk a lot about why and I\u2019m trying to get a sense of why from your perspective there is a lot more competition, so clearly local players, clearly P&G is he stepping it up. But how would you characterize it, so and long-term concerns might be things like they're just lower barriers to entry, so tougher to differentiate? Competitors are cutting more cost, they're willing to spend more back. Maybe it's just that the macro environment is tougher and so people are more intrigued about share gains than anything else. But putting your sense of that, kind of and you're going to say look there\u2019s a great category its always been competitive. But it\u2019s clearly more competitive now that than it has been. So trying to get a sense of your belief and the drivers of that to get a better sense of, is it going to get worse, is it going to get better, or is it going to be same. Does that question make sense?","Thomas J. Falk","Yeah, no, I think that\u2019s fair. I guess, the way I would think about it would be; number one, as economic growth globally has slowed down and some of the markets we talked about. There's just less growth around and just as many people chasing it. So that inherently will make that just a bit more competitive if you\u2019re growing 3 to 4 and now you're growing too. And then you got the same number of competitors, it just makes \u2013 the same number of people fighting over in pieces of a smaller pie or smaller growth opportunity. So that\u2019s probably one. I also think you're seeing more competitors, expanding into more markets. So CNPC has moved out of Chile and is now operating in Brazil and moving into Peru and they're operating in Mexico, you know that's new geography for them and they\u2019re obviously trying to get traction in launch. We\u2019ve seen Unit term [ph] launch in Brazil. They haven\u2019 t build a big share position there yet, but that increases the competitive set. SCA [ph] has done acquisitions and increased their footprint globally in lots of places and so maybe it used to be us and our primary global competitor in a market, now you've got usually one or two other global players that are around and just makes it, so you got to be sharp on innovation, you got to sharp on cost and you got to be great on execution. We're up for that challenge, but there's other players in the neighborhood.","Ali Dibadj","So it\u2019s really helpful, so does that concern you given that it feels like those things aren't going away for your 3% to 5% organic sales growth target longer term, right? I\u2019d assume people aren\u2019t going to now retrench and go away, unless you believe the underlying market gets better, so people are more relax. But does that concern you at all, the things you just described more competition in the same market. Theoretically you\u2019d expect it to put pressure on your 3% to 5% organic sales growth for long term, is that right, is that a fair concern or no?","Thomas J. Falk","I mean, I would say, this, I mean, I think the, if you think about all the weighting of those factors. The slower economic growth is the one that\u2019s probably, that you can't do anything about but that's probably the bigger challenge. The economies are growing better. There's more growth to feed more mouths in category in particular places. And so the effect, we got more competition in more places. At the end of day, we\u2019ve got to deliver a winning product solution at an attractive cost and execute it well on the market and so does everybody else. So yeah I'm absolutely up for that challenge.","Ali Dibadj","Thanks very much for that.","Thomas J. Falk","Thanks Ali.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jon Feeney with Consumer Edge Research.","Jonathan Feeney","Thanks very much guys. I just wanted to follow-up on Ali\u2019s question actually about, could you compare, within everything you just discussed. If you compare and contrast the dynamics in Brazil and Argentina specifically with maybe what kind of went on with the entry into China. What\u2019s different from macro standpoint? Maybe are there any learnings from the China experience, what you're kind of going through versus how you can handle and maybe what your next, couple of years will hold as maybe the structure of competition in Brazil and Argentina change. Does it evolve in the same way China is kind of involved right now? And maybe what have you learned from the development of that super premium segments in China? Thank you.","Thomas J. Falk","Yeah, I mean, they're pretty different markets I would say and so China is an explosive growth opportunity where more and more people as our GDP per capita improves, are entering the category. So with billion plus, people in the country that is a near limitless supply of consumers that could eventually come into our category. I\u2019d say if you contrast it to Brazil, you probably had higher category penetration rates to start with. Unless GDP per capita growth and lately it\u2019s been negative in GDP per capita trends. And so yeah, I\u2019d just say it\u2019s a different starting point and different economic. Ones a got great tailwind and one 's got a headwind that you're running against. We have launch diaper pants in Brazil, have seen pretty good conversion and launched things like, in adult care in our Depend, Plenitude, which is our brand in that part of the world. We've been pretty successful at transitioning the category from a lower cost briefs, which is more like an adult diaper to a higher cost pant will much similar to what we would sell in the U.S., just because it\u2019s much better solution and then deliver terrific value. Even though that is a income challenged consumer and so, you do still see responsiveness, but you don't have the explosive growth of GDP per capita and more people under in the category of that you probably have in China.","Jonathan Feeney","Thank you very much.","Thomas J. Falk","Thanks Jon.","Operator","And at this time we have no further questioners in the queue.","Paul J. Alexander","All right we appreciate all the questions today and we\u2019ll wrap up with a comment from Tom.","Thomas J. Falk","Well, once again, we had a good year 2016. We've laid out an aggressive plan for our global business class strategies in 2017. And we appreciate your support of Kimberly-Clark. Thanks very much.","Paul J.

We now have your presenters in conference. Please be aware that each of your lines is in a listen-only mode. At the conclusion of today's presentation, we will open the floor for your questions. At that time, instructions will be given as to the procedure to follow if you would like to ask an audio question. It is now my pleasure to introduce today's first presenter, Mr. Paul Alexander.","Paul J. Alexander - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Kimberly-Clark's First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Here with me today are Tom Falk, Chairman and CEO; Maria Henry, CFO; and Mike Azbell, our Controller. Here's the agenda for the call. Maria will begin with a review of our first quarter results. Tom will then provide his perspectives on our results and the outlook for the full year. We'll finish with Q&A. As usual, we have a presentation of today's materials in the Investors section of our website. Now as a reminder, we will be making forward-looking statements today. Please see the risk factors section of our latest annual report on Form 10-K for further discussion of forward-looking statements. We'll also be referring to adjusted results and outlook, both exclude certain items described in this morning's news release. The news release has further information on these adjustments and reconciliations to comparable GAAP financial measures.","And now, I'll turn it over to Maria.","Maria Henry - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thanks, Paul. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining the call. Let me start with the headlines for the quarter. Organic sales were up more than 2%, mostly due to higher volumes. We achieved strong cost savings, margin improvements and growth in adjusted earnings per share. And cash generation was healthy and we continue to allocate capital in shareholder friendly ways.","Now let's cover the details starting with sales. Our first quarter net sales were $4.5 billion, that's down 5% with a 7-point drag from currency rates. Organic sales rose more than 2% in the quarter. That was slightly below our 3% to 5% full-year target, and Tom's going to provide more color on our top line in just a few minutes. On profitability, first quarter adjusted gross margin was 36.6%, up 100 basis points year-on-year. Adjusted operating margin was 18.3%. That's up 90 basis points. In addition to this overall improvement, I'm encouraged that our margins were up in all three business segments. Our FORCE cost savings for the quarter were $95 million, so we're off to a good start relative to our full-year target of at least $350 million. Our FORCE cost program continues to help us offset currency headwinds and fund growth investments on our brands.","Our Organization Restructuring remains on track and generated $15 million of savings in the quarter. Commodities were a $30 million benefit, mostly in oil-based materials. Offsetting those benefits, the total earnings drag from currency this quarter was more than 20%. In addition to translation effects of about 7%, that figure includes substantial transaction effects in developing and emerging markets. Despite this headwind, our margins in the D&E market were essentially even with year-ago levels, mostly from the benefit of price increases and cost savings.","On the bottom line, first quarter adjusted earnings per share were $1.53. That's up 8% year-on-year. A lower adjusted effective tax rate contributed about 6 points of that earnings growth. As we said in January, the quarterly tax rate could be more variable this year. This is the result of timing of benefits from tax planning initiatives. For the full year, we continue to expect the tax rate to be between 30.5% and 32.5%.","Now let's turn to cash flow. Cash provided by operations in the first quarter was $553 million and in line with our expectations. On capital allocation, first quarter dividend payments and share repurchases totaled nearly $500 million. In February, we announced a 4.5% increase in our dividend, taking it to $3.68 on an annual basis. This was our 44th consecutive annual increase in the dividend, helping us maintain our top tier payout in the CPG industry. We continue to expect that full-year dividends and share repurchases should total between $1.9 billion and $2.2 billion.","Looking at the segment results. In Personal Care, organic sales rose more than 4%. That included 7% growth in developing and emerging markets. Overall Personal Care operating margins were 20.3%, up 60 basis points. The improvement was driven by organic sales growth, cost savings and lower input cost. In Consumer Tissue, organic sales were even with year ago as growth in North America was offset by declines in developed markets. Consumer Tissue operating margins of 18.7% were strong and up 20 basis points. Our K-C Professional business grew organic sales 1%. That included 4% growth in both North America and developing and emerging markets. Lower sales of nonwovens to Halyard Health reduced the segment top line by about 2%. K-C Professional operating margins were 19.7%. That's up 280 basis points year-on-year, and includes benefits from organic sales growth and cost savings.","Before wrapping up, let me go ahead and recap. We delivered growth in organic sales and adjusted earnings per share, along with significant cost savings and margin improvements, and we continue to allocate capital in shareholder friendly ways. I'll now turn the call over to Tom.","Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Maria, and good morning, everyone. Since Maria just reviewed the financial details of the quarter, I'll focus my comments on organic sales growth and our full-year earnings outlook, then we'll open it up for your questions. So starting with the top line, as Maria mentioned, our organic sales increased more than 2% in the quarter. North America had a good start to the year with volumes up nicely in all three business segments. Internationally, we continue to grow, although at a lower than normal rate this quarter.","Let me review our top line results in a bit more detail, and I'll start with our international business. In developing and emerging markets, organic sales increased 5%. Looking at some of our key growth markets, in Eastern Europe, organic sales in diapers rose 25%. That's on top of a 55% growth rate in the year ago period, which included significant volume gains in Russia in advance of a price increase. In China, organic sales in diapers were up about 5% compared to a very strong growth rate of 35% last year. Our volume growth in China remains healthy, although results were impacted by competitive promotion activity. We expect better organic growth for the full year on Huggies in China, particularly in the second half, and that reflects our plans for innovation, brand investment, city expansion, and improving category growth.","In Brazil, organic sales in Personal Care fell about 5% compared to 20% growth in the base period. Volumes were impacted early in the quarter, particularly in diapers, by the price increases that we initiated in January. Category demand also continues to be down in Brazil. Nonetheless, our sales improved as the quarter progressed and we expect better results across the balance of the year.","Elsewhere in developing and emerging markets, our feminine care and adult care organic sales were both up double-digits in the quarter, and baby wipes organic sales were up high single digits. So we remain very optimistic about our developing and emerging markets businesses, and we continue to target high single-digit organic sales growth for the full year. Stronger results in Brazil and China, along with more benefits from innovation launches and selling price increases, should help us deliver higher growth compared to the first quarter.","Moving to our developed markets business outside North America, organic sales were down slightly. We continue to generate good growth in South Korea, while market conditions were challenging in Western and Central Europe.","Turning to our North American consumer businesses, our teams there delivered another strong quarter, with 4% volume growth and healthy market shares. Innovation, great marketing programs, and good retail execution continued to drive results across our portfolio. Adult care volumes increased double-digits in the quarter with strength on both Poise and Depend. Baby wipes and child care volumes each rose mid-single digits. Consumer Tissue volumes improved 3% with growth in all categories led by Viva and Scott paper towels and Kleenex facial tissue.","Overall, our brand positions are healthy in North America. Our first quarter market shares improved or were even with prior year levels in seven of the eight consumer products categories in which we compete. And that includes diapers where Huggies' shares were up more than a half a point year-on-year and up almost two points sequentially.","Looking ahead, we have a number of near term innovations launching in North America. That includes our best ever Pull-Ups training pant, upgrades on Huggies diapers and baby wipes, and new and improved Poise and Depend adult care products. Finally, in K-C Professional in North America, our organic sales were up 4% in the first quarter. Execution and volume growth was good in both washroom products and our higher margin wiper category.","Now, moving on to our outlook for the year. We continue to target organic sales growth of 3% to 5% for 2016. Compared to the first quarter, we expect more benefits from targeted growth initiatives, product innovations and improved net realized revenue. Our currency and commodity markets remain volatile. As we mentioned in this morning's news release, our current assumptions have improved somewhat compared to three months ago. And while this helps our U.S. dollar results, it also means we're expecting less benefits from selling price increases this year. As we said before, it's important to look at currencies, commodities and selling prices together since they are all related. We're now planning that the net impact of these three factors will be a mid to high single-digit drag on our bottom line growth this year, and that's slightly better than what we shared with you in January. If this turns out to be the case, we'll have added flexibility to invest more behind our top line growth initiatives.","So putting it altogether, we continue to expect adjusted earnings per share in the range of $5.95 to $6.15. That represents 3% to 7% growth year-on-year, which we continue to believe is a good outcome in this environment. So in summary, we continue to execute our Global Business Plan strategies, we expect to deliver on our financial commitments again this year, and we're optimistic about our prospects to continue to generate attractive, long-term shareholder returns. So that wraps up our prepared remarks, and now, we'll begin to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question will come from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thanks so much.","Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Lauren.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Good morning. Just on D&E in Personal Care, you've been pretty clear on your view and optimism that it will get better from here. The comparisons weren't a surprise. That was known. So, what was it in the quarter that ended up being a negative surprise? You said it was early in the quarter. Is there anything in particular you can call out that took you by surprise?","Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So, I mean, I wouldn't say surprise so much as it was a little bit tougher situation in a couple markets, Brazil in particular. The category volume for diapers and bath tissue is probably down about 4%, at least in the measured from Nielsen. Category value is pretty flat from pricing. So, you don't see category consumption go negative in markets in diapers and bath very often, so that was probably a bit unusual. It reflects the, kind of, the tougher economic conditions in Brazil, I'd say. So that was probably one that we'll be facing this year.","On the other hand, we pushed hard on price in January. Some retailers pushed back, so we had a little bit of volume hit on that front that picked up sequentially as the pricing went into the marketplace. And so, that gives us some confidence that through price and a little bit better volume in the back half of the year, we'll put a better result on the board in Brazil.","China had more price competition in the quarter. We had a very strong fourth quarter with a big push on Singles Day and e-commerce. Had a strong January with some Chinese New Year stuff and I think some of the other competitors spent a little bit more aggressively. And we wanted to make sure we sustained our momentum, so we met competitive pricing where we needed to to make sure we kept our volume growth growing and had good double digit volume growth in China. And so, I expect that to continue as well. And if you look going forward in China, price cut competition kind of did heat up in the second half of the year, so our comps get a little easier on that as we roll into the back half of this year.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Great. And on Brazil, I guess, one would be, are you assuming that this kind of negative volume growth persists through the year? Is that part of the forecast at this point?","Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I would say we're still trying to figure out how much of it is household inventory destocking, or am I just buying smaller count packs? And is that part of it versus how much of it is, have I shifted into the category, am I consuming less? And so, I'd say, we're probably not modeling it to be as bad as it was in the first quarter, but we're not expecting a robust category growth story in Brazil this year.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And then just finally overall on demand in emerging markets, I did think it was interesting that K-C Professional actually looked pretty solid. And you hear sort of macro-wise, is it perhaps industrial production, things are getting better. So, any view on kind of the lag or the relationship between KCP being a leading indicator for where consumer demand ultimately goes?","Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I tell you, in North America, we had a strong quarter. We probably picked up some share. We had better execution, so the kind of 4%-ish growth that we saw in North America is probably ahead of category. And again, the shares aren't as robust and reliable as Nielsen, but what we have seen would say that we've picked up a little bit of share in North America.","In developing and emerging markets, I think what you're seeing in addition to the underlying economic growth is a positive trend toward better workplace conditions. And so, better access to having towels and tissue in the workplace, more awareness of need for safety gear, and having the right gloves and glasses and ear protection, et cetera. And so, I think that's a trend that will continue as more and more companies are really held to the same worker safety standards.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. All right. Great. Thank you so much.","Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Lauren.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bill Schmitz with the Deutsche Bank.","Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey, Tom. Good morning.","Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Bill.","Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey, can you just talk about the pacing of the organic growth throughout the quarter both for you guys and the category? I know it's still really early, but how's April sort of shaping up?","Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Actually, I haven't seen a ton of data on April because I've been spending some time getting ready to explain the first quarter. But I would say the momentum throughout the first quarter, particularly in some of the key emerging markets, they had a stronger March than they started the year, and so that's a positive sign. I was just with a lot of our international teams recently at our brand week, and I would say everybody is expecting their results to improve as the year progresses, so.","Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Yeah, that's helpful. And then just on the 9% emerging markets growth, what do you -- and this is probably an industry question also, but as the pricing rolls off, doesn't volume become a much bigger component of the sales algorithm? And what does that mean in terms of advertising spending and what you need to do when you shift from inflationary pricing to volume growth?","Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, no. Absolutely, volume growth and category penetration, category development is going to be a key part of it. And so we've continued to invest more in emerging markets, particularly as you're opening up new market areas. So, as we've gone into Africa and places like Kenya and Nigeria, you do wind up spending ahead of your sales value to develop the category. So, yeah, but again, I don't think it's going to be one that's going to shift our P&L in a dramatic way to achieve that. I mean, we are getting some efficiency and moving more to digital and getting some pretty good ROIs on that move as well.","Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, that's helpful. And then just one quick last one on the gross margin outlook. How do you see it pacing throughout the year? And the reason I ask is I think you did sort of $30 million of commodity deflation this quarter. So, that's a little bit less than half at the midpoint of the full-year target. So, is that the way to kind of look at the gross margin outlook? And I know there's probably some currency puts and takes, as currency gets a little bit more favorable probably in the gross margin line in the back half.","Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I mean, Bill, that's probably a hard one to call just because there are such big, moving factors in it. It's going to be the combination of how does pricing commodity costs and currency hit in any particular quarter. So, I'd say we're pleased with the progress in the first quarter, and are looking forward to that continuing as the year progresses.","Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thanks so much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ali Dibadj with Bernstein.","Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Morning, Ali.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hey, guys. Hey. So, I want to go back to the top line acceleration expectations for the rest of this year. And you mentioned three drivers. Targeted growth initiatives, would love to understand what that means. Product innovations, is that to gain share or grow price or kind of more context about product innovations, if you can? And the last one is improved net realized revenues. And I'm trying to figure out how you do that one, especially if there's more competition in China in particular. It doesn't look like it abating in the U.S. If there's a little bit of a tougher consumer market in Brazil and in Latin America broadly.","And I'm trying to understand how you're saying improved net realized revenues will drive a top line, but at the same time in the 2016 outlook, you say benefits from higher net selling prices are expected to be somewhat lower than prior assumptions. So, I'm trying to figure out what that difference means. So, those three buckets, but really more time obviously on the net realized revenue and what sounds like a contradiction in your strategy.","Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","No, well, let me come at a different way, Ali, and say, so if you look at diapers in China and Brazil, which were the two soft spots, and set those aside for a second and say, gosh, fem-care was up double-digits in D&E, adult care was up double-digits in D&E, baby wipes were up high single digits in D&E. So, really a continued strong performance of the trajectory that we've been on, pretty broadly based across lots of markets, behind good innovation, behind great marketing, behind good execution in market. And so, that's all going to continue.","And so, I think on the China and Brazil question, we talked about those. So, China, underlying volume growth in diapers was good. The price competitiveness was tougher than maybe we expected going in. On the other hand, we're going to lap some \u2013 when that started in the second half of this year. And so, we'll see where it goes from here, but our expectation is that it's not going to get worse.","And in Brazil, that's probably one where the categories have had some more challenges. And so, we have been aggressive on pushing price, given the currency transaction hit that's taken place there. And to the question of the contradiction, I mean, I don't think it's a \u2013 we're comparing to two different things. So, one was compared to our original guidance for the year. We're probably going to get a little less price than we thought because currency is a little bit less negative than we thought. So, the need to get prices is not as great.","On the other hand, sequentially, we still are going to get year-on-year benefit from price as we roll through the year. So, we didn't get it all in January. We announced it during the quarter, and so we'll get some benefit as the year picks up, but not quite as much as we thought going into the year. So, we're just trying to provide you with those two perspective, versus the plan and versus prior year, to help you see it the same way that we're seeing it.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","So, what I'm trying to understand is then what gets better, right? So, pricing is one of the ways things get better, but you're going to be taking less than you expected, how does that get you out of the hole you're, right, that you are right now? And you can talk about it with or without soft spots in China and Brazil. I mean, there's a hole in the top line growth and I'm trying to find out \u2013 I'm trying to understand if it's not pricing, because that's going to be a little bit worse than you expected, what is it that you're changing, right?","Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, the pricing comps are going to get better, so, I mean, some of the prices \u2013 so, in U.S. diapers, for example, we started a lot of the Huggies Snug & Dry price alignment in the second quarter. So, there was a first quarter comp there that was still negative. That will get \u2013 that comp will get easier in the second quarter and second half. China diapers, the pricing and competitive environment started to heat up as we rolled into the second half of last year. That comp gets easier as we roll into the back half of this year on the price front. So, the comps get a little easier on the pricing standpoint, and I think that first quarter was probably the low point for that.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","But that's \u2013 so I apologize for this, but that's not new, right? You're saying just for take pricing, you were going to take pricing, the comps get easier. But you knew that and you're saying now you can't take as much pricing as you planned to at the start of the year, right? That's what the outlook statement says.","Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Right.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","But you're also saying you're going to take pricing to offset the slower growth this quarter, which is clearly below your expectations. So, I'm just trying to figure out how to bridge that gap, right?","Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","No, no, Ali. I'm not saying, we're not going to take price to offset the slower growth this quarter. I think we are saying that we are going to take more price as the year progresses in markets where we've had that, but not quite as much as we thought going into the year.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. Okay, so can \u2013 on another note, can you talk about the cost savings ramp-up that you had, looked pretty good for the quarter? What specifically are you seeing in terms of opportunity that allows you to ramp up the cost savings plan this year? Thanks.","Maria Henry - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, we're happy with our FORCE cost savings in the first quarter. We delivered $95 million, and so that's a good start against our full-year target of $350 million in savings. The teams delivered across all three of the major areas that we look to, to drive cost savings, so negotiating material prices were very strong in the quarter, the global procurement team did a great job to start out the year. We \u2013 the progress in optimizing the cost of our products specifications, and we also got improvements in productivity waste within our supply chain and manufacturing operations. So good start to the year, happy with what we were able to deliver on FORCE.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay, thanks very much.","Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Ali.","Operator","Our next question will come from Stephen Powers with UBS.","Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Hey, thanks. Maybe just following up on Ali's question on the top line there, not to belabor it, but you obviously talked \u2013 you talked about what's in your control, the innovation, the distribution gains. Can you just be a little bit more specific about what you're assuming from here sequentially on both the macro environment, stable, better, worse; as well as the competitive environment, stable, better, worse, versus what you saw in Q1?","Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Any particular geography you're interested in or just broadly?","Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC","Well, broadly. And then I've got a drill-down question on China specifically. So I want to \u2013 but yeah, broadly.","Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","If you look at the macro environment, we put a lot of the assumptions in the guidance deck. But it's essentially, we're not assuming spot currency rates. We're assuming \u2013 we look at forwards, so we \u2013 the rates in our guidance probably aren't quite as favorable as what's in today's spot, but it's somewhere between where it was at the beginning of the year and where the spot rates are at this point in time. So if spot rates stay where they're at, there's probably more favorability on currency and maybe more risk on pricing. On commodities, pulp got a little better in this forecast than where it had been. In terms of underlying economic growth in individual markets, again, we continue to say relatively modest growth environment.","We're not predicting a huge falloff or any other kind of economic crisis developing in a major market anywhere in the world at this point in time. Brazil is probably the one that we're watching most closely as obviously expecting slower category growth getting back to a \u2013 for them getting back to a flat organic growth number for the year will be the first priority given that they started out the quarter with negative 5% on diapers.","In terms of the U.S., actually, we saw probably better growth in our business than the underlying category growth because we picked up share in a number of markets and consumers are still responsive to innovation. We saw private label shares flat to down in nearly every category that we're in, which is again another sign of health of the consumer for us, and are probably maybe more bullish on the outlook in North America at this point in time than maybe we would have been even at the beginning of the year.","Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And competitively, are you \u2013 is there any pockets of \u2013 where you're expecting more competition than what you've seen so far?","Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I would say China is probably one that has become more competitive. It's a terrific market. There's still great category growth. We're still expanding into more cities. The consumer is very responsive to innovation and it's worth investing in. The good news in China is that even though it's been more price-competitive, we've also been very aggressive in China on cost savings. So our gross margins in China have been stable or even a little bit better despite the price investment to stay competitive in those markets. So our team in China has done a terrific job of executing their plan and improving the shape of their P&L.","Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And in China specifically, we too had picked up on intra-quarter sort of intensity picking up, especially in fem-care, online, and especially in the value tier. But from your comments, this kind of confirms my fears that \u2013 sounds like it was a little bit more broad-based. Would you say it was more focused in one category, one price tier, one channel specifically, or is it \u2013 was it broad-based? And it sounds like you expect it to persist.","Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I would say for us, our fem-care business had a pretty strong quarter, probably a little bit less price sensitivity than we saw in diapers. We're probably not as well-developed on fem-care and e-commerce as we are in diapers. And certainly, e-comm was a more competitive marketplace, but then, yeah, that also drives pricing in your more traditional brick and mortar channels because everyone's got price transparency in what the deals are everywhere these days.","Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Great. And last and I'll move on. But is \u2013 any comments you might have about the cadence of marketing spend throughout the year as you follow through on the new innovations that you called out? Thanks.","Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, we got a lot of launch activity coming. And so, I'd say our first quarter, we were, I think, down slightly year-on-year and up slightly from our prior year average. But we've got a lot of stuff coming in \u2013 launching in the second quarter in a lot of markets. So you probably will see it slightly higher, although again, it's not a big driver of our P&L.","Operator","Our next question comes from Olivia Tong with the Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Good morning. Thanks.","Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Olivia.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. How are you?","Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Pretty good.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","In terms of the year, is there more innovation this year than in years past to provide \u2013 to help out that acceleration come along?","Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I don't know if we have a good way of measuring that. On the other hand, I feel really good about our innovation across a number of categories. And so we've got some terrific things coming on diapers in lots of markets, diapers and diaper pants. And that's going well. We've had a lot of innovation on baby wipes and have seen good responsiveness to that. Our fem-care team has great innovation coming. Adult care is launching innovation in lots of places. We had some good things happening on Consumer Tissue as well. Our K-C Professional team has had lots of new products in the market.","So we've got a lot of things to talk about. And we were \u2013 I was just with a lot of our key customers in the U.S. at our \u2013 at the National Association of Chain Drug Stores Annual Meeting where you do one-on-ones with customers across all classes of trade that run drug departments. And our customers are pretty happy with the innovation that we've got coming and are pretty excited about pulling that into their retail environment.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Tom, that sounds great, but it doesn't sound like the innovation delta relative to years past is going to change materially. So if China is getting more competitive and price was clearly a bigger factor in Q1, and that's here to stay, and emerging markets are so much more challenging in Consumer Tissue that volume is actually taking a big step down, what drives that acceleration then as the year progresses?","Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I'd say the underlying volume growth in China was very, very strong. Yeah, it was still strong double-digits in diapers and in fem-care. The pricing comps get easier because some of the pricing competitiveness started in the second half of last year. So I'm confident China is going to post another solid growth year, even though they started out in diapers a little slow due to the lapping or the rollover of the pricing initiatives. And as you look across our markets, Brazil, we talked about, had a little bit of a slow start. Expect that to pick up and close the gap. But we had good underlying performance in really most of our other markets, so I'm pretty confident in the team delivering the plan this year.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. That's helpful. Thank you. And then on the diaper volume being flat in North America, obviously, it's hard to tell sometimes with the Nielsen data, but the Nielsen data did look fairly favorable, and typically, correct me if I'm wrong, some of the non-tracked channels, particularly online, does better than the tracked channels. So was there an inventory issue or were there just divergents in terms of trends in tracked versus non-tracked?","Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","No, I mean, there had to be some inventory change in there because we picked up share. We were up 2 points sequentially and up a half a point year-over-year. Last year, we were selling in the Snug & Dry relaunch, so there could have been some effect of that. We had a strong fourth quarter, so there could have been some early January promotional buying that got shipped in December. But by and large, I'd say we look at our weekly consumption and we're pretty happy with the trends, and eventually, that shows up in volume. So I'm not too worried about that one.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. Thanks so much.","Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Olivia.","Operator","The next question comes from John Faucher with JPMorgan.","Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, John.","John A. Faucher - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, Tom. So, I guess as you think about Brazil, I guess, I understand why the trends at their current level really aren't \u2013 you expect a bounce-back. But I guess as I look at this, right, we look at the Latin-American pricing and the FX-driven pricing rolling off, where does the volume come from? Is it market share, right? Because birth rates aren't changing in that context. So as the volume improves sequentially, is it market share because U.S. brands are less uncompetitive from a pricing standpoint? Do consumers use more diapers, what have you? So does that question make sense? Why would the revenue get better as the volumes sort of need to catch up as you lose the FX-related pricing?","Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So, maybe let's shift markets, John. And so we'll talk about Colombia, which has also had a big currency hit. Right? And it's not one that we usually talk about a lot because it's a relatively small market than the Indian market, but they had 20% organic growth last year, I think they were up 25% in the first quarter. And it's challenged, it's got some linkage to the oil trade, although not as much as others, but they've suffered from some of the same currency devaluation and have pulled through it.","You look at Eastern Europe, what's going on in Russia and CIS. Big currency devaluation, strong price increases, some negative GDP, and yet, we're still seeing reasonably strong underlying volume growth and category demand. And so Brazil is a little bit of an outlier right now and we're trying to make sure we understand what's actually going on there from the consumer standpoint.","On the tissue front, you saw in lots of markets this quarter, slight negative volume and positive price because we were pushing hard to get price in that market, especially because you're buying pulp in dollars and you've got a big transactional impact, and you've got to recover some of that to hold your P&L in shape. And that eventually will work its way through and you'll return to the more normal population-driven growth on Consumer Tissue, I think. But, yeah, I do believe that Brazil will get better, but it's probably going to be a challenging year there this year.","John A. Faucher - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Great. So the way to think about that is maybe on the tissue side, the consumption gets whacked more by the pricing. Because on the diaper side, again, I guess it doesn't seem like it'd get hit that hard, but tissue is one where you feel like the actual pound consumption usage does get hit harder by the pricing.","Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, it's one that when you push pricing in a market like Brazil where there's a substantial amount of general trade, initially, they will push back. So January sales were soft as we pushed pricing and they said, no, thanks, and you take a volume hit. As we look at our shares in Brazil, we only have January and February, we don't have March data yet, but we were down about a point in diapers in the first two months, up a couple of points in fem-care and I think relatively flat in bath tissue. So I'd say not a big shift from a share standpoint despite the volume hit. And as March volumes were better, I would expect that we got a lot of that share back. And at the end of the day, you want to make sure you're holding or gaining share in those markets amid all the volatility of commodity and pricing changes.","John A. Faucher - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thanks.","Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, John.","Paul J. Alexander - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, John.","Operator","Our next question comes from Erin Lash with Morningstar.","Erin Lash - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","Hi. Thank you for taking the question. I was wondering if you could kind of delve into a little bit more detail in terms of the competitive environment in China. And you talked about increased promotional activity, and whether that increasing competitive pressures are from other national players or whether you're seeing that from the locally domiciled peers in the market?","Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I would say in China in particular, the toughest competition of late has been our two Japanese-based competitors, Kao and Unicharm. Obviously, the weaker yen last year helped them support that in a way. At least it didn't have as big of a negative impact on them relative to what was going on in the U.S. And so they've been more aggressive, Kao in particular. We've been gaining share, Kao has been gaining share, Unicharm has been losing share. And so there's been more competition in that direction. Huangong (39:03), we do run into at the low end of our business and the high end of their business, but I wouldn't say they've been the aggressor as much as the other multinational competitors.","Erin Lash - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","Thank you. That's very helpful. And then I think you mentioned earlier in the call about more of an increased propensity to spend in North America. One of the categories that had been challenged, I think, over the last few years has been Pull-Ups in particular, given that consumers haven't necessarily been placing their kids in Pull-Ups and keeping them in diapers when potty training. I know you talked about a new Pull-Up launch innovation coming to market later this year. I just wondered if you could kind of bridge that gap, and whether you're already seeing improving trends within that product category or whether you foresee that happening later in the year into next year.","Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, we've actually \u2013 it was nice to see a good mid single-digit volume growth on our childcare business this quarter. And that was ahead of the product launch, which is rolling out literally as we speak. And so we're really excited about what this new product can do, and we hope we will see some category uptick as we roll into the summer season, which is typically a bit of a seasonal peak for Pull-Ups, and we'll see how that plays out over the second quarter and third quarter.","Erin Lash - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","Okay. The mid single digit volume growth was across childcare, though, right? So that was both diapers, as well as Pull-Ups, as opposed to Pull-Ups exclusively?","Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","The \u2013 no, childcare was \u2013 we define it as essentially just Pull-Ups, GoodNites and Little Swimmers.","Erin Lash - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","Okay.","Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So diaper volume, we would measure separately.","Erin Lash - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","Okay.","Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","And really, in that childcare space, it was really all driven by Pull-Ups.","Erin Lash - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","Okay. Long term...","Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So it was a little early in the first quarter (40:42) Little Swimmers volume. That's more of a second quarter and third quarter business.","Erin Lash - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","Got it. Thank you very much. I appreciate it.","Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jason English with Goldman Sachs.","Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Jason.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey, good morning, Tom. Thank you, guys, for the question. I feel like we're beating this up pretty good, but I do want to come back to Brazil real quick. You referenced the January-February data out of Nielsen. And when we look at that data, it shows your sales up 5% when it's lagging the category up plus 9$. Reflective of the 100 bps of share loss, it's still positive. So \u2013 and you sort of referenced (41:36), some retailer reaction.","Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yes.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","How much of the weakness in Brazil do you think was maybe just that, a bit of a destocking effect or retailer backlash? And you said you saw a pickup in March, at least from a shipment perspective. Can you give us a sense of sort of where you're running as you came out of the quarter?","Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","On the Nielsen data, as you know, it doesn't cover the traditional trade very effectively, and that's probably where we had more of the volume hit in the first part of the quarter. And that is the part where they will have more inventory swings. I know you hear that from other CPG folks as well.","And so, in terms of as we exited the quarter, I don't know if I've got any specific data other than it was a nice, sequential uptick from where they've been running in the first two months. So, we'll see what the shares look like.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yeah. So, you're seeing a little bit of improvement at the end of the quarter. North America maybe a little inventory shipment, so maybe that was subdued. So, some reason to believe it does get better on the forward.","Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Jason, I'm way more bullish than the rest of the guys on this call. I have a lot of reasons to believe actually.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Well, good. I'm glad. I'm glad. I hope it all plays out in the numbers on the forward. A question for ...","Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","By the way, Jason, hope is not a strategy. So, we're going to make sure we deliver it.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Right on, Tom. That's exactly what we love to hear. Quick question for Maria on the FX impact. The 20% number is a big number. It implies much more of a multiple on sales than we've seen in the past from a transaction hit. Just back of the envelope, it suggests that maybe the transaction that EBIT had on the sales was around a 29% margin versus 19% last year. Why the uptick on transactional leverage? Anything unique to be aware of? And as we think about the forward, I think on the last call, you had said sort of all-in, a 15% drag. Where does that number stand today based on sort of, at least, your currency assumption even if it's not on spot?","Maria Henry - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Sure. The relationship between the top line and the bottom line in terms of the currency hit depends on where the currencies are moving and, in particular, for this quarter, we had significant impacts in places like Eastern Europe, Russia, and in Latin America, Brazil. And given where the mix of the currency changes, the biggest currency impacts hit, that's what drove the bottom line impact to be a stronger multiple of the top line impact than what we're typically used to seeing. So, it's mostly mixed-driven.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. And that 15% figure from last quarter?","Maria Henry - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","15% was the combined impact of currency, commodities pricing for the overall \u2013 the \u2013 Paul, remind me on the 15%.","Paul J. Alexander - Vice President-Investor Relations","Yeah, let me just build on that. So, yeah, we said last quarter approaching 15% for an all-in currency impact. As you see in the release, we said that translation impact is expected to be toward the low end of the 5% to 6% range. So, adding in a reasonable multiplier effect, it should be in the low double-digits of a drag for the year for currency.","Maria Henry - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Just on the currency side.","Paul J. Alexander - Vice President-Investor Relations","Yeah.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Thank you so much. I'll pass it on.","Paul J. Alexander - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, Jason.","Maria Henry - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Caroline Levy with CLSA.","Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Caroline.","Caroline Levy - CLSA Americas LLC","Thanks. Good morning. Hi. I wonder if you can update us on the Poise Impressa product.","Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Sure. I would say, so far it's going quite well. And so, it was \u2013 Paul, what, a couple points of our growth in Depend in the quarter. So, we're up double-digits in the U.S. We would have been about 8% ex Impressa. So, it's having a meaningful impact. We were just with our retail customers at the Chain Drug Store Convention as I mentioned, and they were very, very bullish on what they're seeing so far. We're doing some work to kind of assess what we've learned since the launch, what price points work and how do we get even more impact and improve our mix at shelf.","And so, we'll be making some adjustments on shelf position and promotion strategy as we roll through to help it go even a little bit faster, but so far so good. And obviously, this is one that will take a bit of time for consumer behavior to change, but it is an exciting solution for an issue that some women have and another approach for them to help them improve their quality of life.","Caroline Levy - CLSA Americas LLC","Thank you. That actually gets to the second part of the question just on innovation in general. Would you say that, in general, you're premiumizing and getting pricing through mix when you innovate? It's a sort of broad-based question across all categories.","Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I would say that you want to try to create value from your innovation at whatever tier you innovate in. So, if you're innovating on something we're doing on Scott tissue, you want to also be able to create value for your consumer and for your business if you can. So it isn't \u2013 we are trying to premiumize where we can, but some of the things we're doing, we're launching more of a value-tiered diaper pant in many markets, but it's a better solution. It's a premium to other value-tiered diapers, but it's still aimed at the value consumer. And so, we are trying to make sure we're innovating at relevant price points across our product spectrum.","Caroline Levy - CLSA Americas LLC","Thank you. And then just thinking about your pricing being flat overall for the company for the quarter and down in Europe\/South Korea, up 5% in EM, flat in North America, I would have thought South Korea\/Europe was a much smaller percent of the volume. And so net-net you might have had some benefit of pricing. Can you tell us how to think about that today and also going forward?","Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, sure. In our developed markets outside the U.S., so Western Europe, Central Europe, Korea, Australia, primarily, those are markets that are traditionally fairly challenging to get pricing in. Those are also markets where we do some hedging of our transactional currency exposure more regularly. And so, the need to get price to cover your transactional currency hits is also less than you would see in a market like Brazil or Russia. And so, I would say, yeah, we typically go into the year not expecting to get much price. If you do get revenue realization, it's going to be more through mix or innovation than through absolute list price change.","Caroline Levy - CLSA Americas LLC","But do you think that trick continues to trend down in those developed markets?","Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","In terms of price or volume, or...","Caroline Levy - CLSA Americas LLC","Price, price.","Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, no. I would say we don't expect to get much of any price realization this year. And in markets like Western Europe, you could see some price erosion as those markets are a little bit more competitive. South Korea, overall, is a very strong market for us. We had a terrific first quarter, had very strong volume growth. You continue to see some move to e-commerce in that market, and so that sometimes can result in a bit of a price drag as the channel shifts to that direction. But by and large, we're not seeing much price move up or down in the developed markets.","Caroline Levy - CLSA Americas LLC","Okay, just lastly on that, thank you so much, but if you think about e-commerce growing incredibly rapidly in, say, China and some of the Asian markets, I think that probably foreshadows what's going to happen more globally. Do you think net-net that is negative for pricing, online growth?","Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","We are looking to see how e-commerce does scale. And it's certainly in a market like China, where it may be skipping a generation of retail development, you don't have as many retail channels developed in a lot of those markets, and you are seeing very dense population, very high smartphone penetration, and a much lower delivery cost to get that last mile delivery. But I think almost every retailer these days is looking at an online option, even if it's click and collect in their existing retail space.","And so, I think what you are seeing is more price transparency, and so that probably has an effect on particularly retailers that have a high-low strategy. But I think we'll have to wait and see how e-com develops as more and more traditional retailers get in the game with click and collect and other things.","Caroline Levy - CLSA Americas LLC","Thanks so much. That's really helpful.","Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Caroline.","Operator","Our next question is from Javier Escalante with Consumer Edge Research.","Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Hi, good morning.","Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hello, Javier.","Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Hello. How are you?","Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Very well.","Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research LLC","I need a couple of clarifications on the pricing front. In the U.S., I've been trying to reconcile the commentary on volumes and market share and yet this low top line. Is it an issue of that the relaunch of the Huggies Snug & Dry has a lower price realization and you're seeing negative mix, or is it more that you spend a lot on the trade to push innovation and you didn't get the lift that you expected to get in North America? And I have another clarification in China.","Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Are you just talking about diapers, Javier? Because, overall, our North American volume was pretty good.","Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Diapers. Diapers. Diapers.","Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah.","Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research LLC","I know. I understand the volume was pretty good. But I'm looking at diapers, and in general, say, diapers\/Pull-Ups, say, training pants. Not just specifically diapers\/child care.","Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So, in diapers, we started the Snug & Dry relaunch last year in the second quarter. And that was with a price reduction to narrow the gap and get the value right relative to some of the other more value-oriented products that are in the market. And so, we've seen, since that, a better performing product at a more attractive price, consistent progress on volume and share. First quarter was a little light on volume. We talked a little bit what might have caused that. Some of that could have been sell-in last year for the Snug & Dry launch; some of it could have been a little stronger December. But by and large, as we look over since the relaunch, our volumes are up nicely, our share is improving. Long way to go; we're not declaring victory on that front.","On the Pull-Ups front, if you look out over multiple quarters, we really realigned some of our pack count price architecture in the second half of last year, saw some better performance in the category late in the year. Still not where we want it to be. Had a better start to the year in the first quarter but the Pull-Up's strongest selling season is typically second and third quarter. We've got a new product out and we'll see how it goes in the second and third quarter, but we're optimistic about it.","Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Just to clarify, again, in North America. Did you increase trade spending and that's why that contributed to the lack of pricing in the quarter or not?","Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","And so, whether it's a trade or list price reduction, to us, we would treat it the same way. It's a price reduction. And so, on Snug & Dry, we did reduce the price into our retail partners to narrow the value gap. I don't know if we did it through a trade promotion allowance or through a list price change, but the effect is the same in the marketplace.","Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Okay. Thank you very much. And finally, on China, again, just one clarification. So, the competition seems to be more on the (54:27) because this is where Kao and Unicharm operates and also in the main cities in China. Procter just launched \u2013 or launched a few quarters ago a premium diaper. Could you comment whether that launch somehow had a negative impact on your own trends and whether that diaper is priced below yours, if you can clarify that? I mean, The Premium Pampers that Procter had been working on? Thank you.","Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I know Procter has launched -- again, I would say we would see more aggressive competition from some of our other multinational competitors and we try to make sure we're competitive on pricing across the spectrum of products in the same tier that we're in. So, we want to make sure our super premium products are competitive with other super premium and our premium would be the same. Now, in any given retailer on any given day, could somebody have a hot promotional price? They could. You try to look at it over a marketplace in a period of time. And so, again, I would say we're competing, as is Procter, as is Unicharm, as is Kao, and it's sort of normal business. But a lot going on in China and it's a big, attractive market that I think a lot of people are investing in.","Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research LLC","But the one thing that \u2013 the push by Kao, (56:06) and Unicharm had been for a long time. So, basically the one new additional pressure seems to be coming from Procter. Now is when it coincides with your commentary about price competition, about your commentary about volumes being up, organic sales being lagging by a lot, volume. So, that incremental launch and pressure from Procter is what is making the market more competitive, because Procter still is much larger than you are in China in the diaper category.","Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So, Javier, I guess I don't see it that way, but you'll have a chance to ask the P&G guys on their call in a little bit. And I would actually say I think the weaker yen gave the Japanese competitors a little bit more headroom to price competitively. There are some other things around free trade zone and imported product that benefited them over a short term. That's sort of closing off now. But there are some other things in that marketplace caused price to be a little bit more competitive in the first quarter, and we'll see what Procter has to say about it, next week sometime.","Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Yeah. We will ask. Thank you very much.","Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.","Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Lauren.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks. Hey, sorry. Didn't expect to get back in. Just one last lingering question on Brazil was just the degree which you're saying trade down or some of the, like, local players gaining some share, is that kind of you're accounting for volume declines in the market? Is that a dynamic you're seeing there at all or not really?","Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I wouldn't say the local players gained share. I took a quick look at the share coming in. We were down about a point on diapers, and I think Procter was the one that was up, Paul. But I don't remember looking at it in diapers for the first two months.","Paul J. Alexander - Vice President-Investor Relations","Pretty flattish.","Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Pretty flattish, yeah. And so, not a lot of big movement. And then on fem-care, we were up, like, 2.5 points in the Jan-Feb shares. But there's more national players there. So, I wouldn't say -- we are watching for that, though. Are they trading down even within our business within tier? And so, I think we are seeing a little bit more what we would call Tier 2 or the more value-oriented product mix shifting a bit, which is another sign of the consumers under pressure in that market, but we'll continue to watch that and see how it plays out.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And that value-tiered diaper pant you mentioned, I'm sorry. Did you say which markets it was launching in or where or when?","Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","There's a bunch of markets that we're launching that in. So, really in a number of D&E markets across Latin America and Asia, in particular.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thank you so much.","Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Lauren.","Operator","At this time, we have no other questioners in the queue.","Paul J. Alexander - Vice President-Investor Relations","All right, then. We appreciate all the questions today and we'll end with a closing comment or two from Tom.","Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So, once again, we appreciate the interest in Kimberly-Clark. We've had good momentum, we've got a strong plan for 2016, and expect us to continue to deliver on our commitments. Thanks, again, for spending time with us this morning.","Paul J.

We now have our presenters in conference. Please be aware that each of your lines is in a listen-only mode. At the conclusion of this morning's presentation, we will open the floor for questions. At that time, instructions will be given as to the procedure to follow if you would like to ask an audio question.","It is now my pleasure to introduce today's first presenter, Mr. Paul Alexander.","Paul Alexander","Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Kimberly-Clark's year-end earnings conference call. With us today are Mike Hsu, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Maria Henry, our CFO.","Here is the agenda for our call. Maria will begin with a review of full year 2019 results. Mike will then provide his perspectives on our results and the outlook for 2020. We will finish as usual with Q&A. We have a presentation of today's materials in the Investors section of our website.","As a reminder, we will be making forward-looking statements today. Please see the Risk Factors section of our latest Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of forward-looking statements. Finally, we will be referring to adjusted results and outlook, both excludes certain items described in this morning's news release. That release has further information about these adjustments and reconciliations to comparable GAAP financial measures.","Now, I will turn the call over to Maria.","Maria Henry","Thanks, Paul and good morning everyone. Thanks for joining us today.","Let me start with the headlines on our full-year results. Organic sales increased 4% driven by higher net selling prices. We achieved strong margin improvements and bottom line growth while increasing our brand investments and we improved capital efficiency and returned significant cash to shareholders.","Now let's cover the details of our results starting with sales. Full year net sales were $18.5 billion, that's even year-on-year and included a three point drag from currency rates. Organic sales were up 4%.","Looking at the top line by geography, in North America organic sales in consumer products increased 3%. Within that Personal Care grew 4% with positive volumes, pricing and mix. Consumer Tissue grew 2% with selling prices up 7% and volumes down 5%. In KC Professional in North America, organic sales increased 3%, driven by higher prices in all major product categories.","In developing and emerging markets, organic sales rose 6% that included about 2.5 points from Argentina. In terms of key Personal Care markets, organic sales increased 20% in Eastern Europe and high single-digits in Brazil, China, and ASEAN. Outside of Brazil and Argentina, we experienced increased volatility and soft results in Latin America, particularly in the second half of the year in Peru, Bolivia and Chile.","In developed markets outside of North America, organic sales rose 1%. Moving on to profitability, full year adjusted gross margin was 35% up 180 basis points year-on-year. Adjusted gross profit increased 5%. We generated $425 million of cost savings from our FORCE and restructuring programs that was right in line with our initial target and slightly better than we expected in October.","For 2020 we're targeting to deliver between $425 to $500 million in total cost savings and that includes $325 million to $375 million from FORCE. Commodities were a drag of $145 million in 2019, although they turned favorable in the back half of the year. Foreign currencies were also a headwind reducing operating profit at a high-single digit rate.","For 2020 we expect commodities will be somewhat favorable mostly offset by currency headwinds, particularly in Latin America. Other manufacturing costs were also higher in 2019.","Moving further down the P&L, between-the-line spending was up 90 basis points as a percent of sales. That included higher advertising spending, which was up 60 basis points. SG&A spending also increased and included higher incentive compensation along with capability building investments.","Adjusted operating margin was 17.8%, up 80 basis points and adjusted operating profit grew 5%. Operating margins were up nicely in all three business segments, led by Consumer Tissue and secondarily KC Professional.","The adjusted effective tax rate was in line with plan and a drag year-on-year, partially offset by higher equity income and a lower share count. In total, full year adjusted earnings per share were $6.89 up 4%. Our October guidance was for earnings of $6.75 to $6.90 and our original outlook last January was for earnings of $6.50 to $6.70.","Now let's turn to cash flow and capital efficiency. Cash provided by operations was $2.7 billion down year-on-year as expected and driven by higher working capital. We expect a solid increase in cash flow this year, driven by higher earnings. Capital spending was $1.2 billion in 2019 in line with plan and up year-on-year due to supply chain restructuring projects. Spending will remain elevated in 2020 because of our restructuring.","We improved adjusted return on invested capital by 70 basis points to 27.2% which is an all-time high. On capital allocation, dividends and share repurchases totaled $2.2 billion, that's the ninth consecutive year we've returned at least $2 billion to shareholders. We expect to return a similar level of cash to shareholders in 2020 and our Board has already approved our 48th consecutive annual dividend increase.","Let me finish with a short update on our restructuring program. Overall, we've made significant progress as we close out the second year of this program. The implementation of our redesigned overhead organization has gone very well and we've already realized most of the total program SG&A savings.","In terms of supply chain, activities continue to ramp up. We've announced 7 of the approximately 10 facilities that we expect to close or sell and we've taken action on 6 of those. In 2020 we will start up approximately 20 new assets globally, which is roughly twice the level of activity that we would have in a typical year.","Looking at the key metrics, we're about 70% to 75% of the way through pre-tax charges and workforce reductions. Cash payments are about 65% complete and on saving we accelerated savings in both 2018 and 2019 and so far we've generated $300 million of savings compared to our total program target of $500 million to $550 million by the end of 2021.","So overall, it was a very good year and I'm pleased that we delivered top and bottom line growth ahead of our plan, while we invested more in the business for the long term.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike.","Mike Hsu","Thank you, Maria. Good morning, everyone.","Let me start by saying, I am encouraged by our results and the progress we made in the first year of executing K-C strategy 2022. On the top line organic sales were up 4% in '19 ahead of our original plan for 2% growth. Our team has maintained strong focus on price realization and executed their plans well throughout the year. As a result, pricing was up 4% and that's the highest realization we've achieved in a decade and it was necessary because of the multi-year inflation that we faced.","Our strategy is to elevate our categories and drive trade up also helped us improve product mix by one point. While volumes were down 1% that was better than our original expectation because of strong end market execution, higher brand investment and less impact from price increases.","Beyond sales, we delivered broad based margin improvements and above plan earnings. We continue to leverage our financial and capital discipline as we achieve significant cost savings, improved ROIC and return significant cash to shareholders.","We also invested more in our brands and businesses in 2019. As Maria noted, we increased advertising spending by 60 basis points. Digital advertising is now about two-thirds of our working media mix and it's helping us target consumers more effectively and deploy our campaigns more quickly.","We're leveraging our digital expertise and more businesses around the world and our marketing ROI is improving. Importantly, our digital strategy is helping us grow volumes and businesses like in Fem Care internationally, Diapers in Eastern Europe and Adult Care in North America.","Now beyond advertising, we've also started to invest behind and focus more on improving our other commercial capabilities, including revenue management. We're taking a disciplined program management approach to this effort. This includes making sure we have the right tools, processes and resources so we can better leverage these growth capabilities. While it's still early days, we're making good progress and I expect more going forward. All in all, our teams have made excellent progress in 2019. And I'm proud of their accomplishments.","Now I'll turn to our outlook for 2020. Our plan is consistent with our balanced approach to value creation includes higher growth investments and aligns with our K-C strategy 2022 financial objectives. On the topline, we're targeting organic sales growth of 2% and that's consistent with our medium-term objective and similar to our expectation for category growth.","We expect selling prices, product mix and volumes to all improve in 2020. Pricing should be weighted for the front half of the year, while volume growth will likely be more weighted to the back half. We expect the promotion environment to be competitive but remain broadly constructive.","We will continue to increase our growth investment in 2020 and that includes investment in digital marketing, in our commercial capabilities and in our products as part of our innovation agenda.","In the first half, we will launch innovations in North America on Huggies, diapers and adult care along Cottonelle bathroom tissue. In D&E, we have several upgrades coming in personal care in key markets such as China, Eastern Europe and Latin America. We're confident in our growth investments and innovations will help us grow volume and improve product mix this year and improve share performance over time.","Our investments will start right away in the first quarter while the benefit should build as the year progresses. We're targeting to grow adjusted operating profit 3% to 5% and on average, that implies 50 basis points of our operating margin expansion. Gross margin should increase more than that.","On the bottom line, we're targeting adjusted earnings per share of 710 to 735. At the midpoint, that represents growth of 5% in line with our K-C strategy 2022 objective. Finally, as Mario said we expect to improve cash flow and return significant amounts of cash to shareholders.","So in summary, I am encouraged by our progress in 2019 and our outlook for 2020. We're investing more in the business to drive long-term success and we're confident in our ability to deliver balanced and sustainable growth and create shareholder value.","Now that concludes our prepared remarks and now we'd be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.","Lauren Lieberman","I guess, first thing is I'm struck by the 60 basis point increase in advertising spending and my model which goes back to dare I say 1997, that's the largest one-year increase in advertising in the company's history that goes back that far. So that coupled with the fact that you had $100 million of incremental SG&A in the fourth quarter and then looking ahead into next year, the implied reinvestment spend.","So can you just talk about like are there areas where you feel like as a company you've been under-invested that it requires this much step up in spend, some of it's being supported by the fact that it's a benign input cost environment, but the plans that you'd laid out a year ago didn't contemplate the deflation that we're seeing. So I'm just kind of curious like the aggregate amount that's going back in, where you would say it's most focused and what it takes to start to see a return on that because the revenue guidance for 2020 while healthy doesn't seem to tie with the amount of money that's going back into the business?","Mike Hsu","Yes, I think there is a part of it - maybe there is a small part of it, which say, hey, we had a tough couple of years, and so we had trimmed back a little bit of A&CP. So part of that is restoring a bit of that. But the other part, I would tell you is, we feel really good about our stance on investment, and I think it really reflects, in our view, the quality that we have in our commercial programming for this year.","And also I think the fact that the category conditions we think are very conducive to growth and I think that's a big change versus when we talked this time last year where we were uncertain about the marketplace and we still were launching new innovations and new commercial program. So we feel really good about that.","I think consumer demand has been pretty darn resilient and the competitive environment has been - we would say broadly constructive and so that makes the conditions pretty - very good for growth. And then the commercial programming, we've got great innovation that launched in 2019 in North American Adult Care, in China in Diapers. We've got great innovation coming this year across Personal Care in multiple markets that we're very excited to support.","And so we feel good about that, so a big chunk of it is increased investment in the product and ongoing and we have some good news coming. And then Importantly, I mentioned digital, which is about two-thirds of our overall advertising spend is being very productive for us and we feel really good about our campaigns and the content we have out there and our team's ability to manage it effectively at a higher ROI level.","So that's the second area, and then commercial capability. And for us, I'll translate commercial capability it includes kind of the innovation process, it includes revenue growth management, it includes sales execution and then the digital aspect. And so all those areas we're investing and building our capability there.","Maria Henry","Yes, and Lauren, I chime in that we were up 200 basis points in the fourth quarter. We were also up in the third quarter. And if you recall, fourth quarter and the back half of 2018, we had particularly low spending between-the-lines, so I think the full year comparison is the best way to look at this. And for the full year, we're up 90 basis points, 60 basis points of that.","With advertising, Mike mentioned the investment in commercial capabilities which ramped up toward the end of the year. And then the other thing I call out is incentive compensation which we've talked about before. This year, we over delivered on our plan and therefore had higher variable compensation.","In last year, the opposite was true, we under delivered on our plan and therefore the variable compensation was lower. So you look at the year-on-year increase and that's an effect. And the last thing I'd point out there is the way that our plan was constructed back in January, we had planned for a ramp on between the lines spending in the second half and even more or so in the fourth quarter, just the way that timing of our programs in areas like IT, we're scheduled to execute.","Operator","Our next question comes from Olivia Tong with Bank of America.","Olivia Tong","Wanted to talk about the pricing contribution for fiscal '20, interesting to see that you're expecting to be positive. So is that price that's already in place that had yet to lap or more pricing that hasn't been introduced yet that you're putting in place or more a function of decisions you're making on promotional levels like you did on in China as you focus on revenue management?","Mike Hsu","Yes.","Olivia Tong","Has there been any - sorry and just any change in your promotional expectations for fiscal ' 20? Thanks.","Mike Hsu","No. Yeah. Thanks, Olivia. Yeah, I think broadly I'd say with the pricing environment 2019 was broadly constructive and we - our expectation is for it to remain still in 2020. We do have some pricing in our plan. I would say, a big chunk of that - the majority of that is carryover from actions we took in 2019, right and so you'll see most of that come through in the first half. And then we do have probably some pricing plan to address specific issues in specific markets where we've got some volatility in currencies or the economy. So that's that aspect.","I think in the - the overall, I'd say not pricing in 2019, I think it was ahead of plan and the volume impact was less than plan. There were probably a few isolated hot spots and there are probably a few isolated hot spots now. Our teams are staying close to those situations and we're going to fine-tune our promotional plans as appropriate, but maybe the headline, I would say is, we're more focused on driving category growth and driving it the way that you would want us to do that by launching improved products and driving advertising.","We'd rather I think earn our share and own our share through innovation and advertising instead of renting it through a promotion. And so I think right now our expectation is the environment should remain constructive.","Olivia Tong","And then just following up, obviously you've talked about China price promotion actions you've taken in the past, just your view on the market for D&E, Personal Care because it's nice to see the volume growth again, but the sales have decelerated a bit. So just if you could talk to that a little bit? Thanks.","Mike Hsu","Okay, Olivia just to be clear that was about China.","Olivia Tong","Yes. Specifically in China.","Mike Hsu","Yes. China, we're feeling very encouraged by our progress. We're up double digits behind really strong momentum on Fem Care and really an improving trends in the Diaper business. I'd say on the diaper side, really what's driving our improvement is really good innovation that's gaining a lot of traction with consumers in the marketplace. It has been to-date mostly launched in our premium tiers or Tier 5, 6, 7 and which is growing at a pretty good clip. I'd say we still have some issues on our lower tiers where we have - we look still little more softness there.","We are expanding our innovation. We have more exciting innovation that we're launching this year and we're rolling that out across the business in Diapers and so we feel really good about our position. The birth rate has been down a little bit '19 versus '18, we expect to probably be flat to down a little bit in this year as well. But we still think there's plenty of developed market development opportunity in China and we're still very early I think in the life cycle of our categories in China.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ali Dibadj with Bernstein.","Ali Dibadj","So I have a couple of three questions. One is on your comments about constructive pricing, we've - I asked this earlier this morning too, but we've kind of seen this movie before where there's sometimes of air pockets where pricing stay that combined rollover, so gross margins expand for this opportunity to invest in the category through advertising everything else which is what your plan is for the year.","But again, having seen this before, you've seen it before as well. Often times a quarter from now, maybe two quarters from now you start seeing competition creep in from a pricing perspective and things - it'll get that worse not that it gets bad, it'll just get a little bit worse than the plan. So how are you confident that this movie is not going to end the same way or have the same competitive pressure picking up over the next little while here and tactically how much notice do you get about that?","Mike Hsu","Yes, I mean I - the scenario that you paint or that possibilities always exists. And I think the overall is, we're going to remain competitive in the marketplace and we'll be competitive on price.","However, I think maybe the emphasis, Ali, for us is we feel really good about our innovation and we feel really good about our commercial, our marketing programs and so that's where we want to invest. And you may have covered categories that have commoditize I worked in categories that people seeing that commoditize over time and that's a dead end.","And so for me, I think we want to take the high road and build our categories. We have - if you - our thesis say there's a lot of growth left in our categories in D&E and in elevating our categories in developed markets, but to do that you need to bring innovation and you need to get the consumer good reason to buy which is by creating more value for our products.","So that's where our focus is. We will be, however, competitive, but the other factor on pricing. I'd say it's also, if you look at it, we're still above our 2017 cost levels. And so we're still - we still want our margins back to kind of where they are. We're now all the way back at it and to the extent that we would like them. And then the other side of it is that we are anticipating some pulp inflation in the back half of the year.","So there is a lot of other factors going on, but our teams, I would say, have gotten sharper and more tuned with our revenue growth management capability to the market conditions. And so we'll stay close to it, but we're going to run the play which is the highroad play right now.","Ali Dibadj","I'm not - again I'm not questioning you guys, I just wonder others follow that same high road who are in more private label prone or smaller or more private or whatever. Okay. I guess we'll watch it. Second question of three is on free cash flow, it looks like certainly for the year, it was down quite a bit, a lot of that was CapEx driven. Could you talk a little bit about and Maria, if you could you talk a little bit about the drivers of free cash flow in 2019, how we should think about it for 2020 and in particular the CapEx as a percent of sales still looking perhaps elevated?","Maria Henry","Sure. The cash flow in the fourth quarter was actually strong at $924 million for the year. As you call out, operating cash flow was $2.7 billion and that's down from prior year. It's not - it's in line with our expectations. So it was a very plan for - as you know, we are funding the restructuring last year, this year and so we've got elevated expenses coming up on CapEx.","The big driver on operating cash flow which we've talked about before is that we had a big shift in working capital, particularly around payables where in the fourth quarter of 2018, we had a very high inflow from working capital driven by payables timing. We basically had to pay that back out in the first quarter of 2019 and that affected operating cash flow for the year that was the big driver.","Encouragingly though, Ali, when I look at our cash flow from operations, we were up nicely year-over-year in the second half of 2019. We were up about 10% and the trends on working capital are positive, but that was true both in the third quarter and the fourth quarter. I'd also call out related to that, our cash conversion cycle was 10 days for the year which was a day better than it was in the prior year and it was better than our expectations.","In terms of CapEx, CapEx was elevated in 2019 and it will be elevated again in 2020 as we work through the restructuring. And as you recall, we said we'll main out the restructuring program that we were expecting incremental CapEx of $600 million to $700 million on that program.","And so during the time of the supply chain activities which is '19 and '20 on restructuring on a percent of sales we've got a pretty high number, I think it was 6.5% of sales or something like that. But we did say that coming out of the restructuring, our expectation is that CapEx will be 4% to 5% of sales and that is down from our historical model of 4.5% to 5.5%.","So a long answer, but I feel that the cash flow for the year was good and as expected CapEx. CapEx is in line with what we've been talking about as we execute on the restructuring.","Ali Dibadj","So it's still going to ramp down after 2020. Okay, that's very helpful. Thanks for indulge me for my last question. We talk about China with a question earlier, but just more broadly the emerging and developing markets for you only grew 3% that continues to be a slow down. I get the comp is tougher, but are there signs of improvement in that growth rate or should we continue to expect kind of again taking into account compares that we're talking about this low single-digit type of emerging market - emerging and developing market growth rate? Thank you.","Mike Hsu","Ali, I think we feel very good about our D&E performance. I know it's slowed down sequentially a little bit in the fourth quarter, but if you look at the key markets, Brazil continues to do very well, we would say excellent performance in a tough market. China, I think the trends are improving CE, as Maria pointed out, 20% growth on the year.","So we feel good on our key markets. I think the big driver of the slowdown, if you look at the fourth quarter was one we're starting to cycle pricing in some key markets in Latin America, for example, in Brazil, I think our pricing in the front half was up double-digits and so we're starting to cycle that.","And the other part of it is, as we mentioned, we've got some softness due to some macro issues and competitive issues in, what we would call, South Latin America which is, Peru, Bolivia and Chile and you're probably aware of what's going on there but there's a lot of social unrest which is actually affecting some of our categories, and so we're managing through that. We've got a great team, they're very experienced in kind of working through this and we've got very solid plans to address at least some of the competitive issues in those markets.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan.","Andrea Teixeira","My question is on [Technical Difficulty]","Mike Hsu","Andrea you're cutting up. We can barely hear you.","Andrea Teixeira","I'm sorry, I don't know if you could hear the question. So my question is on emerging markets. So with China growing double digits, I think you just mentioned Brazil doing well but lapping the double digits price increase. So is the other South of Latin America markets which I understand that is much smaller, what are you embedding in terms of deceleration for develop emerging into your guide or you just are expecting it to continue to be in the low-single digits into your 2%, so that obviously embeds the developed markets would be about 1%? So I would just want to kind of double clicking your separating emerging markets and developed markets?","And then just a clarification question on the reinvestment question, so I understand that you were try - like you were saying like we have a lot of innovation, but according to our math, you're kind of reinvesting about $400 million on top of your base of SG&A and already invested about - you already increase around $170 million. So I understand the breakdown in assumptions, but if you can break into the large line items including compensation, R&G and advertisement into your guide, so that we can understand why it's kept into the mid-single digit growth?","Paul Alexander","Sure. This is Paul here, Andrea. There were several questions there. So I'll take the first one or two and then we'll pass the investment questions over to Mike and Maria. On the outlook for 2020 in developing and emerging markets, we don't have a hard and fast number to give you, there are several moving pieces in the business. But as Mike said, we're confident about the underlying trends in several of the markets. There is some increased volatility that we saw in the first - in the back half of 2019. We think that those have largely stabilized, but probably at a lower level.","So as we enter 2020 that will be with us for a period of time. But overall, we would be looking to deliver solid organic growth in developing and emerging markets in 2020. In developed markets, in general, our expectation is unchanged from what we have been delivering over time, which is modest growth.","Maria Henry","And then on the between-the-lines outlook for 2020, we are expecting it to increase both in terms of dollars and as a percent of sales and that we expect to be driven by higher advertising as well as I'd say secondarily capability investments. Just as a reminder, there is a few other moving pieces in SG&A, we are expecting some modest benefits from restructuring in 2020, we'll have the benefit of incentive compensation normalization.","And then going the other way, we'll have our normal labor and other cost inflation that run through SG&A. Beyond that, we're not providing a specific target for the level of increase, but we are interpreting that it will be a healthy level of increase.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jason English with Goldman Sachs.","Jason English","I wanted to come back to emerging markets because I'm having a hard time footing the narrative with the numbers. The 3 points organic, how much did Argentina add to that this quarter?","Mike Hsu","It was slightly less than two points.","Jason English","So we've got slightly north of 1 point is sort of underlying emerging market growth right now. And you're saying China is up double digits, Central Eastern Europe growing like '20s, Brazil strong. Is it the declines in the sort of non-core EMs or that substantial that there weighing you down or were the growth figures you are giving us for these other markets where they annualized and not just the quarter? Just having a hard time because I always view Brazil, Central and Eastern Europe and China is like chunky and if they're growing the EMs I thought it would do better. So I'm really having a hard time footing strength there but really no growth kind of in aggregate?","Mike Hsu","Yes. So again, I think it's as you postured which is good growth out of those markets and I think a continued growth and a little softness and what I would term our other Latin America was probably the big chunk of that. It's actually probably a little more substantial or when you add it all up, then you might think.","Maria Henry","And then also K-C Professional outside those North America has had lower numbers in the D&E markets than what we would have anticipated. And the same factors as we talked about with the volatility, but obviously when we get the total numbers that includes K-C P as well as the consumer business.","Operator","Our next question comes from Wendy Nicholson with Citigroup.","Wendy Nicholson","Circling back on kind of a line of questioning about the international markets. We talked about the margin internationally before and I know there's just a lot of structural lower pricing and whatnot. But just in terms of - has a longer-term kind of over the next three to five years, how much will be international margin benefit from the restructuring and a lot of the restructuring you're doing is North America centered, but I'm just wondering how long will it be until we can see real margin improvement in those international markets? Thanks.","Mike Hsu","Yes, I mean. Well, I would say, we are planning for margin improvement over time and I think there's a couple of different things, one related to the restructuring which gets us to better and more common assets across the world, especially in Personal Care, so that's going to be one factor.","But the other piece is our strategy to elevate our categories. And so we are going to see - we are expecting and planning for mixed premiumization and innovation that's going to drive more positive mix and margin over time. A good example of that would be China. We feel great that we've delivered substantial product improvement. Our gross margins are at record levels with that product improvement. So that's kind of a win-win innovation in our minds.","Paul Alexander","And Wendy, you'll be able to see our geographic disclosures when we publish our 10-K in February, but I can preview it to say that our international margins in total were up somewhat in 2019, despite the volatility and the currency headwinds.","Wendy Nicholson","So I'm just thinking obviously to the extent of focus is on accelerating the growth there for long as the margin gap is a significant as it is, it's actually a headwind to your margins. So I'm just trying to balance that as I think about it over the next few years, would love to see you grow faster outside the U.S., but obviously going to come at a cost if you can't ramp up those margins as well?","Maria Henry","Right.","Wendy Nicholson","Second question just back on the North American business. Are you surprised, I mean just given sort of the size of private label in some of your categories, we're surprised that we haven't seen more promotional aggression on part of private label? Do you think we should expect that in 2020? I mean I guess, we've been surprised not only because so many retailers are talking more about private label investments, but also in your categories, it seems like given the commodity environment we're at pretty unique opportunity for some of those private label guys to get more aggressive on pricing. So what's your take on that and is it just that consumers are really loyal to brands and innovation in your category all of a sudden or is that a legitimate threat as we look at 2020 and the cost environment?","Mike Hsu","Yes, I guess maybe the key thing for me is, in general, we're seeing a little increase in private label throughout '19 pricing particularly in Tissue has not moved up, right. And so maybe in some select pockets, but in general has not moved up at the same levels that the brands have. So that's one factor.","I really don't expect and wouldn't think it would make sense to overly promote private label, mostly because of the reason that you probably surmised which is, I don't believe consumers drive retail choice or their choice of retail outlet by because of private label. I think the study after study that concludes that they make choices based on national brands and they - and that's what drives that behavior.","And so I don't know that necessarily promoting on the private label side is a productive behavior. In fact, I would say, I have skin in the game here but I would suggest that if they drive the right national brand strategy, I think that will help grow the retail business more effectively.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies.","Kevin Grundy","Mike, I wanted to come back to the topic you were kind of dancing around I guess asking it different ways, but with respect to gross margin, so your performance was fantastic as was Procter's this morning. Still seeing some pricing benefit albeit one dissipating and commodity costs lower. So from a retailer's perspective and understanding the importance of brand. So we've been asking this from, okay what are Procter moves, what are private label moves or so forth on promotion. But from a retailer's perspective, why wouldn't they be coming back to you guys now to the manufacturers and asking for some of this to be dealt back through trade promotion. They never want to take a price increase, right. So now in the current environment, now why wouldn't - what's the risk that retailers sort of force the issue and lean on manufacturers to start dealing some of this back? And then I have a follow-up.","Mike Hsu","Yes, well I think, Kevin, again I still point out that we still had inflation in 2019. Our costs are still higher than they were in 2017. And so when we say this inflationary impact has been multiyear, our pricing hasn't - even hasn't fully recovered that, it's actually far from fully recovering that. So that's kind of my view from my chair on the pricing.","On the other side of that, I think you'll need to talk to the retailers to get their views, but my personal side would be our discussions with retailers tend to be around how we're going to grow the category and that's what they're most interested in. As long as we've got the right plans with innovation and category support to drive category growth that's really kind of where their focus is and that's what - where most of our conversations are about these days.","Kevin Grundy","I'm bringing a quick follow-up to a question that was asked earlier. I think what investors, what analysts will try to figure out is the level of conservatism that's in your guidance versus how much investment whether that's advertising and marketing or other areas, excuse me, of OpEx that are there more sort of locked and loaded. Can you help us think about that, because in the absence of kind of putting some parameters around that, given the benefit that you're seeing from commodities, that you're seeing from FORCE, that you're seeing from Restructuring, it certainly looks conservative and it's hard to envision advertising and marketing stepping up to a level that's implied. So can you help us as best you can with the level of conservatism and flexibility maybe behind the competitive environment? Maybe kind of help us think about that? And that's it from me. Thank you.","Maria Henry","Sure. What I would say is I think that we've got a reasonable and balanced plan that we're shooting for in 2020 and we've shared with you the primary assumptions that go into that. What I can also tell you coming up on my fifth year here is that there are lot of variables that happen that we can't accurately predict as we go into a year. We've seen that happen on the downside a couple of years ago, a bit on the upside last year.","And so as we go through the year we'll react to the environment that we're in, but there is potential volatility on the commodity side, there is potential volatility on the currency side. We've talked a lot about strong competition and competitive activity, so far in this call. So there is a lot of moving pieces and as we always do, we will make the decisions that we need to make during the year to deliver on the balanced model that we strive to achieve year-on-year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Strycula with UBS.","Steven Strycula","I've got a question for Mike and then a quick follow-up for Maria, Mike on your organic sales outlook for the full year, should we interpret that to mean that volume should improve from the rate it was in '19 or we should see absolute volume growth for the full year fiscal '20 and what specifically is driving that. I imagine you're going to say innovation. So how do we put the Diaper innovation in the context for 2020 relative to how the special delivery diapers for Huggies did in, call it, 2019?","Mike Hsu","Yes. The organic outlook is 2% and that really reflects our expectation for both the category and then obviously our performance as we cycle the pricing. The volume in our plan is absolute growth, again, we're expecting balanced growth from volume mix and still a little bit of pricing, Steve. Its innovation, I probably would say that the flip on volume is not going to be as daunting as you might perceive because, I would say, our underlying volume performance in 2019 was very good. And what I mean by that is obviously if you're going to take pricing you're going to have a negative volume effect in accordance to whatever you think your elasticity is.","And so we saw that, but I do think we had really good underlying initiatives whether they were driving distribution and new categories and new markets in different countries or launching innovation and increasing advertising. We saw the volumes come underlying that offset most of or some of the price elasticity effect and actually more than we had anticipated. So we think we've got very - we had very good execution in 2019.","And I don't think the effect in '19 was related to elasticity impacts were less than we expected, it was more related to execution of volume initiatives were better than we had expected. Did that help?","Steven Strycula","No it does. For Maria just quick follow-up to Ali's question, could you give an operating cash flow number of $2.7 billion in 2019 should that be a little better or a little worse in 2020. And then on the commodity piece, if it was $60 million deflationary in the fourth quarter, but the full year outlook is $50 million to $200 million. Can you help us think through what is basically baked into your commodity outlook assumption? Thank you.","Maria Henry","On cash from operations, we are expecting that to be up in 2020. And on Commodities, we are expecting fiber to start to pick up particularly in the back half of 2020 which is built into our assumption of the $50 million to 200 million for next year.","Operator","At this time, we have no further questions in the queue.","Mike Hsu","Great. Well, we appreciate everyone's questions today and have a good day. Thank you very much.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes this morning's presentation. You may disconnect your phone lines and thank you for joining us this morning."]}}
