Folliard - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Katharine. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining the call today.","We had a great first quarter, driven by strong performance in all our key businesses areas and with the continuation of our store opening plan. I'll give you some of the highlights for the quarter.","Used unit comps increased by 4.9% and total used units grew by 9.3%. Gross profit per unit relatively flat at $2,200 compared to $2,220 in the first quarter of last year. Total wholesale units grew by 4.7% and gross profit per wholesale unit of $1,032 was similar to $1,046 in the first quarter of last year. Other sales and revenues increased 14% year-over-year and CAF income grew 15% to approximately $109 million.","I'll now turn over to Tom to talk about finance, Tom?","Thomas W. Reedy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Tom. Good morning, all.","Tom mentioned CAF income grew by 15% compared to first quarter of fiscal 2015 and average managed receivables grew by 17% to $8.7 billion. As mentioned in the release results for this quarter, we're again positively impacted by favorable loss experience at CAF.","The weighted average contract rate, that rate we charge to the customers, was 7.4%, up slightly from last year's first quarter at 7.2%. Our allowance for loan losses grew to about $84 million or 0.94% of managed receivables. CAF net penetration was 42.2%. Half a point of that came from the loans originated under our subprime test, and that compares with 41.3% in last year's first quarter.","Net loan dollars originated in the quarter rose 10% to $1.4 billion due to the combination of CarMax unit sales growth and CAF's modestly higher penetration. And during the quarter, we repurchased 1.8 million shares for about $120 million. That's down from the pace in recent quarters, reflecting the increase in stock price.","Tom?","Thomas J. Folliard - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","SG&A for the quarter increased approximately 11.6% to $350 million. Contributing to this growth was the addition of 16 stores since the beginning of the first quarter of last year and a $7.9 million increase in share-based compensation expense. On a per unit basis, SG&A increased $51 to $2,098 compared to $2,047 in the first quarter of fiscal 2015, $39 of which was related to the stock-based compensation expense.","During the first quarter we opened three stores, two in new markets for CarMax, Minneapolis and Gainesville, Florida. We also opened our third store in the Philadelphia market. After the first quarter ended, we opened our third and fourth stores in the Denver market. That was actually yesterday, and added a second store in the Providence market. We plan to open one more store in the second quarter in Tallahassee, Florida, which will be a new market for us.","Our comp unit sales were driven by improved conversion and continued growth in customer traffic. Our web traffic was up almost 10% compared to the same period last year. Monthly web visits grew to nearly 16 million. And now over 60% of our visits are coming from something other than a laptop and a desktop, so either a mobile device through our app or on a tablet.","And with that, we'd be happy to take your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Craig Kennison of Baird.","Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Good morning, thanks for taking my question. This is more of a long-term question, but we have this view that millennials might respond to your hassle-free business model better than prior generations. I'm curious what CarMax is doing to target this group any differently, whether it's from a marketing perspective or what your technology spend might look like going forward.","Thomas J. Folliard - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","That's a good question, Craig. We're in the middle of investing in continued capabilities on our website and mobile devices, and I don't think that's just for millennials. I think that's really for all consumers. If you look at consumer behavior over the last several years, it's clearly shifting towards wanting to do more and more of whatever shopping process they're involved in online. And we see that continuing to shift, and then within that, continuing to shift towards mobile.","So we're working hard on our app and trying to have fantastic pictures on there. We've added zoom capability. We've added high-definition and zoom capability. We've given customers the ability to transfer a car from any store to any other store. We've given them the ability to pay for that online. If it's a paid transfer via credit card, they can fill out a big chunk of the paperwork online. And I think there's lots more to come there. It's just an ongoing process and trying to stay out in front of technology. But continued investments in the website and our mobile device I think will attract not only millennials, but other customers as well.","Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thanks, I'll get back in the queue.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli of RBC Capital Markets.","Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Good morning, guys. Can you talk about subprime penetration? It still seems to be bouncing around a little bit and was down from 1Q last year. I guess what I'm wondering is how much of that drop is from business being picked up by Tier 2 lenders, and how much of that is maybe from some changes that the Tier 3 guys are making? Thanks.","Thomas W. Reedy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I think we talked about this a little bit last quarter. We've seen pretty stable performance from our Tier 3 lenders. If you look at what they're approving and the quality of their offers, it's been pretty consistent for the last several quarters. And as we've talked about, you've got to remember that their performance is a byproduct of both what they're doing on the credit front and what they're seeing coming through the pipeline. So I think it's fair to say that their behavior has been consistent and we're seeing a little bit more assertiveness in the Tier 2 space.","Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets LLC","All right, so no change in terms of thought process regarding the Tier 3 that they're probably just seeing less product because of the Tier 2 activity.","Thomas W. Reedy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I can't speak for them, but if you look at credit quality of applications this quarter, it's up about two points year over year. That moves the mix a little bit. And I think we've done a lot of work to build a good stable of Tier 2 lenders that each brings something different from the table from a credit perspective, and that adds incremental sales. So like I said, I think we're happy with the performance of our Tier 3 lenders. I think that we see consistent aggressiveness out of them in the last several quarters. I wouldn't attribute it to anything but some things moving around.","Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets LLC","So just to be clear, when the Tier 2 guys that needed taking up some share, we should assume that's a much more profitable transaction for you, correct?","Thomas W. Reedy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. As you know, we pay $1,000 per car in the Tier 3 space and we make $300 a car from the lender in the Tier 2 space. So every time we are shifting that volume, we're taking loan from $1,000 out-of-pocket to $300 in. So yeah, it's good. And you saw that reflected in the other margin this quarter. Our third-party finance net income, which is actually an expense, was actually flat year-over-year with 9% sales growth and that's a direct result of the mix of Tier 3 being a little bit lower.","Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Got you, many thanks.","Thomas J. Folliard - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And, Scot, as you know, one of our main goals at CarMax is to make sure that when customers show up at the store that they have access to credit and we always talk about global approval rating which is of applicants, how many get an approval from one of our lenders starting with CAF and then heading down through all of our other partners. And that number is over 90%. So we're pretty pleased with the credit offering that we have for our customers when they show up at the store, whether it's through CAF or one of our partners.","Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Got you. All right, thanks a lot guys.","Thomas J. Folliard - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Scot.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Nagel of Oppenheimer.","Brian W. Nagel - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Morning. So I have a question, a follow-up that I'll kind of shove into one here. The question on the buyback and Tom, you discussed this a bit in your prepared comments, maybe an explanation why we saw a lower buyback never heard in Q1 versus the prior quarters. But can you give us a little more color there on how you're thinking about that buyback relative to the stock price? And maybe how should we consider the cadence of buybacks in coming quarters...","Thomas W. Reedy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I don't really want \u2013 we're not really going to be in a position to get into what we're going to do in future quarters, but I can tell you that our intentions are very much that it's a priority for us to return capital to shareholders, and as we've talked about the last couple of quarters, to move our capital structure towards where there's a little bit more leverage in it. And that is something we're committed to do over the medium to long term.","In any given quarter, we might see some bouncing around, because rather than having a trading mentality, we're trying to take a programmatic approach to buying back stock. We've set up a program and we let it run for a period of time. That program's going to have guidelines in it that allows for more share repurchase at lower stock prices and dialing it back as the stock goes up.","So \u2013 and we just kind of look at it from a longer-term perspective. We'll adjust those parameters as is appropriate going forward, but that's pretty much as much as I can say about it. We had a program in place that dials back at higher stock prices. We saw the stock price increase significantly over the last several months. And as time goes forward, we'll adjust it as appropriate, but keeping an eye on the fact that we do want to keep making progress towards more leverage in the capital structure.","Brian W. Nagel - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Got it, that's helpful. And then my follow-up question, unrelated. Just an update from a marketing perspective. Are you still list \u2013 is CarMax still listing cars on Autotrader.com and Cars.com? Is that still a marketing vehicle you utilize?","Thomas J. Folliard - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","At this time it's not, Brian. We have gone on and off testing with Cars.com and Autotrader.com, and we'll continue to test on whatever listing sites that add incremental sales and that are worth the investment. With the growth in carmax.com up to 16 million hits a month, we're a pretty prominent website, particularly in all the markets that we operate in, and we haven't found that there is incremental value there. So at this time, we're mostly just using our own website. We are continuing to test, but we don't have any cars on Cars.com or Autotrader.com at this time.","Brian W. Nagel - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay, thanks a lot.","Thomas J. Folliard - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sharon Zackfia of William Blair.","Sharon M. Zackfia - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hi, I guess just two really quick questions. Tom, can you talk about why average selling price is down? I don't think I've ever seen that before at CarMax. And then secondarily, the stock comp, the $7.9 million, is there going to be accelerated stock comp all year, and how do we think about that and the G&A line?","Thomas J. Folliard - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So the first part, I think we were down \u2013 well, I'm getting the number here \u2013 I think we were down a couple of hundred bucks. And I'm with you, Sharon, I don't generally expect ASPs to go down, so I don't have a great explanation for it. I think lower prices are better for our customers. I don't think it really is an indication of much of anything because the move was so modest. What was it last quarter?","Thomas W. Reedy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","$100.","Thomas J. Folliard - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","We were roughly flat last quarter. I think we're up $100. So I haven't really read too much into it. It's such a small change in price. And then your second question, Sharon?","Sharon M. Zackfia - William Blair & Co. LLC","The stock comp, I think you had $7.9 million of incremental stock compensation this quarter. I'm just kind of trying to figure out if there's accelerated stock compensation all year, how we should think about that and G&A?","Thomas J. Folliard - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","That's largely going to be driven by how the stock performs. And a big chunk of that is in our restricted stock units that go to the vast majority of the associates who are in the equity program largely in our stores. And that's a cash-settled expense for us, and it's subject to variable accounting. So this is going to be largely based on how the stock performs and a number of other factors.","Sharon M. Zackfia - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt Nemer of Wells Fargo.","Matt R. Nemer - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning, everyone. I wanted to just piggyback on Craig's question around mobile and web capabilities. Just wondering if you can give us an update on the EasyShop program and what we can expect in terms of future web capabilities over the next year or two.","Thomas J. Folliard - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Matt, so that was a \u2013 we originally called that out as a test. And EasyShop was a branded thing \u2013 excuse me, within the website. We're really not calling it that anymore. It's now really just expanded capabilities throughout the website, and we'll continue to test those capabilities. And when we find something that works, we'll roll it to the whole chain. And so the things I mentioned earlier, the ability to transfer a car, the ability to pay for a car, the ability to make an appointment, the ability to put a car on hold remotely, all those things are rolled throughout the company now, but we stopped branding it. We just realized it worked better as just part of the capability of our normal website.","I really can't give you what I think the other things will be that \u2013 the capabilities that we'll add going forward, other than we're working really hard to try and make sure that customers can do whatever part of the transaction that they want to do from home, we want to make sure we give them that capability. So that's kind of where we're focusing. We want to improve their experience. We want to make sure we have the best search engine, we want to make sure we have the best touch screen experience, and we want to make sure we have the best mobile experience.","And the other thing I would say is we need to hold ourselves to a standard of the experiences that people have in other parts of their lives and not just their experience that they have when they're shopping for a car. So the bar has definitely been raised as it relates to experiences online and experiences with mobile devices, but we're working real hard to stay out in front of it.","Matt R. Nemer - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","And just a quick follow-up. I'm just wondering if you can give us a quick update on the small-store, small-market format.","Thomas J. Folliard - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So I think we mentioned we were going to open five stores, read the results for some period of time, and then evaluate our plan going forward. On the last call, I mentioned that we feel very confident in the way we've performed so far. And if you look at our growth plans going forward, the 13 to 16 stores over the next few years, embedded in that will be small-format stores. So we've identified right now at least 80 markets that meet that criteria, and that will be part of our regular growth program going forward. Last month, the store that I mentioned in Gainesville, Florida is a little bit of a hybrid. It has a small-format front end, which means we operate it with the overhead structure that we've created for the small-format stores, but we have a full production shop in the back.","So we're always going to be working on our formats and try to find out what's the most efficient way to want to run a store at various volumes. And we have incredible variation and incredible capabilities as a company to be able to go after just about any market now. We can open a market with selling as few as 75 cars a month, and we can run stores that sell as many as 1,000 cars a month. So I'm really proud of what we've accomplished in being able to address all kinds of different market sizes.","Matt R. Nemer - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","It sounds like they're working. That's great news, thanks so much.","Thomas J. Folliard - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Fassler of Goldman Sachs.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks a lot. My primary question relates to the wholesale business. Obviously, units will show volatility from time to time, and the profitability of the wholesale business was terrific. But the unit growth and the ratio of wholesale to used sold was a little bit lower than we had seen. So any insights as to what drove that this quarter and how you're thinking about the wholesale business generally this year?","Thomas J. Folliard - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Matt, I've talked about this a number of times. I really don't worry about the wholesale business in any given quarter. We think about it over a very long period of time. If you look at it over a long period of time, it has essentially grown with unit sales. We're not worried at all that it's \u2013 it grew 5%. I'm glad that it grew 5%. It's a very, very big business for us. It's a very profitable business for us. It requires an incredible amount of effort in the stores.","You think about every time we open up a new production store. And even in a new market, we've got to run another business within it. We have to have great customer service. We have to attract dealers to our auctions every day, and we have to give those dealers a great experience because they have other choices and they can go other places.","So again, it's a big business. It grew 5% in the quarter, not quite what the retail growth was. But as you've been following us for a long time, you've seen that number dramatically in the other direction as well sometimes. So we're really thinking about that business over the long haul. And also, as you know, that business is not an independent business. It's attached to retail. Almost all the cars sold in wholesale are direct acquisitions from consumers, many of those who are buying cars from us, so we have to make sure that we're competitive. So I was very pleased with the quarter for wholesale.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.","That's helpful. And, Katharine, hopefully you won't count this follow-up as an actual question. But just the stock comp, you have \u2013 you now disclose three or four sub-categories within SG&A. Does the stock comp number spread amongst the four of them, or is it focused in compensation?","Thomas J. Folliard - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","It's all in compensation.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great, thank you so much, guys.","Thomas J. Folliard - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And, Matt, one more point on that. Almost all the variability in our stock-based compensation expense is non-executive comp, just to make that point.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.","And it seems like, since you offered, it seems like on a per-vehicle basis, when you exclude stock comp, the delta was actually quite favorable, pretty well controlled year on year.","Thomas J. Folliard - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Exactly. And remember, carrying \u2013 that's with 16 more stores in the base than were there last year, which as you know, in the early part of their life story is very SG&A inefficient until they grow to where we expect them to grow. And we've always said, we think we need mid to high single-digit comps to get some leverage there. I was really pleased with the way SG&A ran during the quarter.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks so much.","Thomas J. Folliard - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Montani of Evercore ISI.","Michael David Montani - Evercore ISI","Hey, good morning. I just wanted to ask first off on vehicle demographics, if you could share the penetration of zero to four-year-old vehicles. I think it was 75% last quarter and growing pretty nicely. So could you just update us there on what you're seeing?","Thomas J. Folliard - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","For the quarter, it was 76%. And you mentioned 75% was in the fourth quarter, and that's on top of 73% the year prior. So I think pre-recession, that number was 85%, and then coming out of the recession it was 70%. So yes, we've seen some shifting back towards. We've been expecting this with the shifting in supply, with the change in the SAAR. But from quarter to quarter, it was relatively flat from the fourth quarter to this quarter.","Michael David Montani - Evercore ISI","Thanks. And just to follow up on that, if I could, you mentioned that the buy rate was a little bit lower this quarter. Can you just share with us what's going on to drive that? Is there anything from a pricing dynamic that's impacting you in any way there, and also what the penetration is of retail used units that were from the appraisal lane this quarter?","Thomas J. Folliard - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","It was still a pretty good number. We're buying around 30%. That's pretty good for us. It's modest fluctuations in the buy rate. We called it out only because it was there, but it's not something that I really can add any color to because I don't think there was much to it.","Michael David Montani - Evercore ISI","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Murphy of Bank of America.","Elizabeth Lane Suzuki - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Good morning. This is actually Liz Suzuki on for John. With the loan charge-off rates running lower than expected, do you think half would be comfortable taking on a little more risk in expanding that sub-prime test even further?","Thomas W. Reedy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I think the two are actually unrelated. We're looking at the subprime test almost as a different line of business with a different pool of credit. And as we've talked about before, we're constantly testing within our core CAF business different pockets of credit, both pricing and what we'll approve on an ongoing basis. And to the extent it makes sense and we keep the profile of the portfolio intact, then we'll roll those things out.","As far as the current environment having an impact on that, these are anywhere from five to six-year loans. And I think the results in any one quarter or a couple of quarters aren't going to \u2013 aren't anything to go out and swing your credit policy for what you're going to be collecting in five years.","Elizabeth Lane Suzuki - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","That makes sense. What do you attribute those lower loss rates to this quarter?","Thomas W. Reedy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","The losses are really a combination of how many people are going bad and how many \u2013 how well we're doing recovering funds from those loans that have gone bad. And we've had some success in doing a little bit better on the recovery side, but the vast majority of what we're seeing in loss performance is that just fewer people are going bad. And I think that's not inconsistent with what's going on in the lending industry in general right now, at least, at the higher credit level.","Elizabeth Lane Suzuki - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great, thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Aram Rubinson of Wolfe Research.","Chris J. Bottiglieri - Wolfe Research LLC","Hi, this is actually Chris Bottiglieri on for Aram. I had a quick question on the direct operating expenses within CAF. You've done a very nice job of managing it over time. But it seemed to slow a little bit in Q4, but now in Q1, came back down a percentage of AR. So I want to think about how you manage that over time as you continue to grow your book. And two, if the subprime test proves successful, like what does that mean for your direct expenses within CAF? Thank you.","Thomas W. Reedy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","We try to manage those expenses over time as efficiently as we can. Unfortunately, it's not only our activity that impact that. And so if you think about what's entailed in the finance business, there's a lot of activity contacting customers. If you're in an environment where people are less delinquent and there's fewer losses that \u2013 and fewer people not paying, which we are today, that means you're making less calls. It probably needs less resource to do that.","If the world changes and you got to pay more attention and be making more calls, that will have an impact on your costs. But I think the team down at CAF has done a great job of getting more efficient in both those types of environments, and we'll try to continue to do so.","And as far as Tier 3, as we roll that out, to the extent we roll that out, you would expect that it's a more high-touch business and it would have some impact on CAF's overhead costs. But we're not at a point where we can forecast that for you.","Chris J. Bottiglieri - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay, cool. Thanks, guys.","Thomas W. Reedy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks.","Thomas J. Folliard - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brett Hoselton of KeyBanc.","Irina Hodakovsky - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thank you, good morning. It's actually Irina Hodakovsky up for Brett Hoselton. A quick question for you, guys, on the used vehicle sourcing. We've been expecting an acceleration in off-lease supply to drive that supply of zero to four-year-old car inventory. And what I'm seeing is on the industry reports, on the certified vehicle sales, we're seeing double-digit increase through March, 11% up, and your increase is substantially below that. And I'm wondering if you are not getting those cars yet or if there is some sort of a bottleneck in inventory supply, or any commentary you can give us on what you're seeing in terms of zero to four-year-old vehicle supply coming in.","Thomas J. Folliard - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","You can't just look at CPO by itself. You have to look at total comps for the industry. If you look at the average of all the publicly traded new car dealers, used comps during the first quarter were at 5%, so about in line with where we were. Within that is where you see the growth in CPO, so there is a distinction there that you have to make.","Lease percentage right now, I think, in the new car industry is somewhere around 30%. And when you see that supply coming back is really two years and three years later after you see a high lease percentage. So I'm not sure that we've seen much of it yet, but it's never been a problem for us to source cars. And when cars are at a high lease percentage, when you look out two years and three years later, generally, they're more organized at the auction, so it's a little easier for us actually to buy those cars when we see them come back to the marketplace.","But we really haven't seen lease percentage change our ability to source cars over time, and we've been at this for over 20 years. So we actually think it's not a bad thing at all that there's a higher percentage of leases right now. And over the next two years or three years, that'll give us more access to those cars.","Irina Hodakovsky - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Great, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Armstrong of C.L. King & Associates.","William R. Armstrong - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.","Good morning, guys. Your weighted average contract rate for CAF was 7.4% versus 7.2% a year ago. Was there a mix going on there or are you seeing overall interest rates that you're getting from consumers starting to go up?","Thomas W. Reedy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I wouldn't really read too much into that much of a lift. But as I've said, we've been in environments where rates are going down. We always want to make sure we're standing with the market; and in environments where we went to \u2013 rates going up, we want to be tested as well. So we have been doing some tests with increased rates in certain pockets, but like I said, I wouldn't read much into the difference in the \u2013 the weighted average contract is pretty consistent.","Thomas J. Folliard - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And remember, we're very market-driven with a three-day guarantee for our customers to go get a better loan somewhere else and we unwind it free of cost. So that is a kind of a check and balance on how much rate we can actually get out of our consumers. But we think it's a huge competitive advantage that not only CarMax Auto Finance, but all of our other lenders as well, provide customers that opportunity to go get a better deal somewhere else, if they'd like, in the first three business days and get out of it at no cost whatsoever. So it's a good check and balance, but it's a great offering for the consumer.","William R. Armstrong - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.","Right, understood, and then just a quick follow-up. Could you tell us what your originations were for the quarter for your CAF subprime test?","Thomas W. Reedy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","It's about $15 million. As we talked about at the end of last year, we're comfortable continuing at that pace of about 5% of the Tier 3 originations. I think we're just under $90 million in total originations to-date now.","William R. Armstrong - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.","Got it. Okay, thank you.","Thomas W. Reedy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Levin of Deutsche Bank.","Mike L. Levin - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning, guys. Just to kind of follow up on CAF. We've been expecting to see the collateral spreads kind of tighten gradually over time, but the last three quarters would be kind of holding steady at about 6.3%. Does this kind of feel like a near-term equilibrium that you guys are seeing, or would you expect to see some contraction as we kind of move forward and the Fed moves rates?","Thomas W. Reedy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, I think you hit the nail on the head. We're going to \u2013 it's going to depend on what goes on with rates. As we've talked about before, our ability to manage that spread is very much market-driven. And to the extent we see cost of funds going up with \u2013 because benchmarks are moving up, we'll clearly test and see what we can manage that spread to, but it's going to be driven by what the market will bear and what our competitors are doing, and what makes sense for the customer.","So it's very hard to speculate on it. We have seen spread compression if you look year over year. We just managed to outgrow that from an income perspective with growth in the portfolio overall, some larger originations in those prior years, and some favorable loss performance the recent quarters.","Mike L. Levin - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great, thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rick Nelson of Stephens.","N. Richard Nelson - Stephens, Inc.","Thanks, good morning. The CFPB now oversees the large non-bank auto finance and provided CAF I assume is under their jurisdiction. Are there any changes required from an operating standpoint or a cost standpoint now that you've got this oversight?","Thomas W. Reedy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I think the short answer is yes, we do expect there to be greater cost in administration. Now the flipside of that is the announcement last week didn't tell us anything new from what we've been planning for quite some time. As we've expected all along, capital will be subject to the bureau's supervisory authority as a larger participant. The definition of larger participant isn't really that large. It's about 10,000 loans a year in originations. So the vast majority of auto lenders are subject to it.","But I think what it means for us is we're going to continue, as we have been, to refine our compliance program and meet the bureau's expectation. We're paying careful attention to industry developments and looking at our practices. Every time we see it, we learn more about what the bureau is interested in and making sure that we're doing our best to comply with what we think they want to see.","But in answer to your question, there and going to be some administrative costs around that just, like we expect with the Dodd-Frank Reg AB II. With the extended reporting requirements, it will be a cost of doing business, and we'll let you know what it is if it's material when the time comes.","N. Richard Nelson - Stephens, Inc.","Got you. Thanks, good luck.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Seth Basham of Wedbush.","Seth M. Basham - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Good morning.","Thomas J. Folliard - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hi, Seth.","Seth M. Basham - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","My question is around conversion. Tom, you mentioned improved conversion helping comps. But how do those levels of improvement compared to recent quarters?","Thomas J. Folliard - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","That's another one that's been pretty volatile over time. And I still think of it as you have to look at it over a much longer period of time. And I've always felt that over time, we would get our comp sales improvement from a combination of traffic and conversion. So there have been quarters where conversion has outpaced traffic, and there have been quarters where traffic has outpaced conversion. In this particular quarter, we said it was divided between the two to deliver the 5% comp, but there's volatility in both of those things and I expect it to be volatile going forward, but I think over a long period of time I expect to get improvements out of both.","So I'm not sure I really answered your question, but I can tell you we've had quarters where conversion improvement has been higher than this quarter, but we've had some quarters where we've been flat or behind as well. So really you have to look at it over a much longer period of time. I don't think one quarter is a good proxy for the long term, although in this quarter we had a little from both.","Seth M. Basham - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Got you. Just as a follow-up maybe, is there anything you can point to in terms of the trends in conversion rates in certain sectors of your customer population, whether it be credit tiers or otherwise and whether or not inventory levels are affecting conversion, those types of things?","Thomas J. Folliard - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","That's a really good question. We spend a lot of time trying to figure that out and we don't have a lot of success. So I'd say it comes from all kinds of different areas. There's an argument that people are more prepared when they show up at the store because they've spent more time on our website. There's an argument for more inventory for selection for the customer. You can clearly see impacts from movements in credit that impact conversion as well.","We have extensive training programs going on in our stores in all areas of the company, which I think help conversion of course. We can buy cars a little bit better, have the right selection at individual stores even without having more cars. So we always say around here conversion is a very big word and it includes lots of things. So I really can't attribute specific points to any one of them.","Seth M. Basham - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","All right, very good. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Whiston of Morningstar.","David Whiston - Morningstar Research","Thanks, good morning, more of a strategic question for you. We're in a rather robust part of the economic cycle, and I'm sure you're always optimistic about all phases of the company. But in particular, given where we are in the cycle, what parts of your business you think you're most excited about over let's say the next 12 months?","Thomas J. Folliard - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","As you said, we're excited about all parts of our business. I think for me it's two things. It's the ability to continuously improve our existing store base, which has gotten quite large, and then our ability to enter new markets successfully, whether they're small markets or medium-sized markets or metro markets, and then to be able to deliver a consumer offer that has all kinds of advantages against the competition that allow us to continue to succeed.","So I'm really excited about the core business. In the last several months, I visited lots of ours stores that have been around for 15 and 20 years, some are hitting all-time highs in sales. And then I've been to some of our new grand openings, and it always gets me excited to see how engaged people are to come and work for CarMax and deliver a great consumer offer. So again, for me it's continuing to grow the existing stores and then being able to go after new markets as well.","David Whiston - Morningstar Research","That's helpful. And then just one other question. It's been tax refund time recently. I'm just curious, did you see a meaningful uptick in business with these other tax refund seasons or is it a little down or flat?","Thomas J. Folliard - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","We're really well past tax refund season now. For us, that's January, February, March timeframe. And over the last couple of years, we've seen some volatility around timing from just tax refunds, in general. But whatever you would've seen from tax refunds, you would've already seen in our business through the fourth quarter and then now that the first quarter is over.","So it's always a big-time year for us particularly coming out of the winter and we had a big year this year as well.","David Whiston - Morningstar Research","Okay, thank you.","Thomas J. Folliard - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paresh Jain of Morgan Stanley.","Paresh B. Jain - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good morning, everyone. Just following up on the question on millennials and tech. CarMax has always led with technology and transparency in this business, but there is some serious money being spent by these peer-to-peer business models and they're gaining a lot of traction in millennials as well. And we've talked about this earlier and you said you're keeping a close eye on these models. And while you may not see them as direct competitors, is that an opportunity missed or is it something who can push you in the near future? And if so how quickly you can do that?","Thomas J. Folliard - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","That's a good question and I have the same answer as before. We're keeping a close eye on it and we'll decide if that's something we need to go after. As of this moment, we're not heading down the peer-to-peer path. But if you really think about the way CarMax works, the fact that we make a cash offer on every car is enabling a lot of peer-to-peer transactions and some of those are coming through us that would have otherwise gone peer-to-peer.","So a customer who normally would have put their car online and be \u2013 or have put up in their yard and put a for-sale sign on it, now they're bringing a lot of those customers. They're bringing their cars directly to us and sell it to us. So it may not be exactly the way you're thinking of it, but I think we're getting plenty of customers who would have gone through the peer-to-peer channel and are deciding to sell their car directly to CarMax.","Paresh B. Jain - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Very well. And just a quick follow-up, would you rule out an acquisition of that kind in this space or would you do it organically?","Thomas J. Folliard - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","We're evaluating all different options and we're open to any way that makes our business better and delivers a better return for our shareholders.","Paresh B. Jain - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of James Albertine of Stifel Nicolaus.","James J. Albertine - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Good. Good morning and thanks for taking the question. I was hoping and I apologize if I missed it in prepared remarks or another question, I dialed in a few minutes late. But hoping to get an update on the vehicle transfer activity, so the propensity for consumers to order a vehicle from outside their home market and have it shipped to their closest store. And then as a follow-up, any insight you could provide near term on sort of retail activity, particularly given some of the storms and flooding that we've been hearing in the Texas and sort of southern regions? Thanks.","Thomas J. Folliard - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So on the first question, that number has been around 30% for quite a long time now. But that's a big number. We sold 600,000 cars last year, which means we transfer roughly 200,000 cars at the customer's request to the store near them and then sold the car. So we're transferring as many cars or more than anybody else at the customer's request when they see a great presentation of that car through our website. With 40 high-definition pictures and zoom capability, I think we'll continue to make progress there, but the number has been relatively flat. But again, it's a very, very big number.","In terms of our regional differences, we never comment on regional differences. The only thing I'd tell you is I continue to be very proud of our CarMax team whenever we have a disaster in any area that involves large-scale loss of products. We're able to be there for the consumer when they are ready to buy something else.","And we also are a place where people can get rid of their cars, whether they \u2013 if a car is flood-damaged or hail damaged, we still make an offer on the car. We turn around and wholesale that car. We won't retail one of those cars, but we still are there for the consumer when they need us in markets that have some trouble. But I can't really comment on any differences in performance.","James J. Albertine - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great, thanks again.","Operator","I will now turn the call back over to the speakers for closing remarks.","Thomas J.

Thank you very much. Tom?","Tom Folliard","Thank you, Katharine. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. Well all-in-all, it was a great year for CarMax I\u2019ll go through some of the highlights of the year and of the quarter. First for the year total revenues were up 15% to a little over $12.5 billion. Used unit comps increased by 12%, our strongest comp performance since fiscal 2002 and total used units grew by 18%. Wholesale units up 5%, CAF income grew 12% to more than $336 million, net earnings grew 13% to a record $493 million and net earnings per diluted share rose 16% to $2.16.","On the market share front our data indicates that we increased our share of the zero to 10 year old used vehicle markets by about 17%, bringing our total to approximately 5%. We also opened 13 stores during the fiscal year, the most in any year in our history. As for the fourth quarter, used unit comps up 7%, that\u2019s a combination of a modest traffic improvement and continued improvements in conversion and total used units grew by 12%. Total used vehicle gross profit grew by 12%; used vehicle gross profit per unit was $2,141 in both this and last year\u2019s fourth quarter.","Wholesale units increased by 2%, and have a little bit more than 30% our appraisal buy rate was slightly higher than last year\u2019s fourth quarter. Our gross profit per vehicle fell $32 to $953 per unit. CAF quarterly income grew by 6% to $81 million this quarter. I\u2019ll now turn it over to Tom Reedy. Tom?","Tom Reedy","Thanks Tom. Good morning everybody. CAF delivered another solid year with income up 12% and average managed receivables growing 23% to more than $7 billion. In the fourth quarter, CAF income grew 6% compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013. Weighted average contract rate, the average rate charged to customers, has been relatively stable over the past several quarters. For accounts originated during the quarter the rate was 7.2% compared to 7.1% in last year\u2019s fourth quarter and 7% in this year\u2019s third quarter.","The allowance for the loan losses increased to $70 million in line with growth in managed receivables and a 1% flat as percentage of net receivables compared to last year. For CAF, net loans originated in the quarter rose 4% to $1 billion. Our net penetration was 40% for the current year\u2019s fourth quarter versus 43% for the prior year's fourth quarter.","Third-party subprime providers accounted for about 17% of our sales in the fourth quarter. That\u2019s flat year-over-year which represent some moderation versus the first three quarters where we saw an increase to 5 points in Q1 and 3 points in each of Q2 and Q3. As we said in the press release, we launched our test in January to learn more about originating and servicing customers who would typically be funded by our subprime providers. During the quarter, we originated $9 million. It\u2019s very early in this process and we will share information and learnings once it is appropriate.","Before I turn the call back to Tom, I will take a moment to discuss the accounting correction associated with our cancellation of reserves for the ESP and GAP products. During the fourth quarter, we developed a new approach to projecting cancellations for ESP and GAP. Our previous method works well historically when trends were relatively stable. However, we learned it was too slow to identify changes in underlying cancellation trends. Over time, modifications to the products and our administration of them along with an evolution in our business, meaning a greater percentage of our sales coming from subprime financing caused changes in the overall cancellation profile of these products. We failed to adequately reflect these changes in our cancellation reserve and have made the Q4 correction described in the release. We are now using a more sophisticated model that takes more granular view of the data and we believe we will provide a better and more timely identification of changes in cancellation trends. Tom?","Tom Folliard ","Thank you. SG&A for the fiscal year increased 12%, to $1.2 billion on a per unit basis, that\u2019s a decline of $102 a car, to $2,161 compared to $2,263 in fiscal \u201913 driven by our 12% CAFs. As you know SG&A expenses are largely fixed variable expenses represent approximately 25% to 30% of our cost structure.","During the fourth quarter we opened five stores including our entry into the Philadelphia market with two stores, we also added one in each of our existing markets in St. Louis, Washington and Baltimore and Sacramento. After the fourth quarter ended, we opened stores in two new markets, Dothan, Alabama and Rochester, New York. Including these two stores we currently plans to open 13 stores in fiscal 2015 including the opening of our first store in the Cleveland market which is notable since it is Katharine\u2019s home town.","Katharine Kenny ","Yes.","Tom Folliard","While our store traffic has increased modestly during fiscal \u201914 our web traffic continues to expand significantly. For the year, average monthly web visits grew to 12 million, up 32% compared to fiscal \u201913, and by the end of the year average monthly visits had grown to over 13 million a month with visits to our mobile site representing approximately 30% of that and our mobile app traffic is about 12% of the total.","And lastly we are pleased that after the end of the year CarMax\u2019s board of directors authorized an additional $1 billion expansion to our share repurchase program.","And with that we will be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Matt Nemer with Wells Fargo Securities; your line is open.","Matt Nemer - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC ","A couple of questions. First, Tom, could you talk to the weather impact to the quarter? I don\u2019t know if you measured store days lost or some function of that, would be curious what the impact was.","Tom Folliard","Yes, I am sure there was impact in the quarter. We don\u2019t do a store days lost Matt, but you know in my memory we had it one day where we had 30 stores closed. We had days when we had the entire Dallas market closed which I don\u2019t really remember that happening. Historically we have always felt like we get those sales back and they might shift from quarter to quarter. So it is very difficult for us to attribute a sales loss or gain to a quarter because of weather. But it was obviously pretty significant as I said, with the number of closed stores; it also has an impact on our ability to produce cars. So it is a combination of traffic for sales and the shops being shut down and not being able to get inventory out front, I think the stores have done a fantastic job of working through some very challenging circumstances during the quarter to put us in a good position going forward, but there is no question it had an impact, I just can\u2019t really quantify.","Matt Nemer - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC ","Okay, great. And then secondly, could you just talk to what impact the mix to subprime has had on ESP revenue over the last year, so just explain, or help explain maybe what is different about that purchase from an ESP standpoint?","Tom Folliard","Hey Matt, from an ESP standpoint, there is not a dramatic difference in our penetration between subprime and other sources funded through our channel, meaning CAF or other partners. We do see a difference, we don\u2019t see as attachment of the ESP product, if customer does not finance internally with CAF or with one of our partners. But to the point, on the reserve through, I mean, the increase in the subprime customers as the percent of sales, if you could step back and think about, as subprime has got a higher default rate. The biggest reason we see a return to ESP is because of the customer exiting the car that could be because they bought another car that could be because they\u2019ve got repossessed or something else going on for financing. So as there has been a higher percentage of subprime in the business the ESP returns have evolved this much. As far as the attach 30 ESP in our penetration there is not a significant difference between subprime and another channel within CarMax.","Tom Folliard","So it\u2019s no real impact on revenue Matt just on the returns.","Matt Nemer - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC ","Got it, okay. That\u2019s helpful, thanks so much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.","Brian Nagel - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.","I want to maybe shove a couple questions into one question, all tied around subprime. So, Tom Folliard, when you reported your third-quarter results, you called out a -- I guess it was somewhat of a disruption in the subprime relationship with one of your partners. So maybe if we can get an update on that, in the last three months, what you have seen there. Then the follow-up to that would be, as you look at the subprime penetration, which is now 17%, flat year-on-year, is that CarMax topping that out? Or is there some other factor out there that is basically keeping it from growing year-on-year?","Tom Folliard","Well, certainly not CarMax topping it out, and what we talked about it at the end of the third quarter was a slight pullback we saw from our subprime providers and as Tom mentioned in his opening remarks we saw subprime as a percent of sales grow by a few points at each of the first three quarters so we continue to see some of the behaviors that we\u2019ve seen out of our partners in terms of getting more aggressive with the origination channel that CarMax provides. And at the end of the third quarter, we mainly noted that we saw that pullback some we didn\u2019t assign a magnitude to it because we weren\u2019t so sure and as it has come out in the fourth quarter, this is still a very strong quarter for us, it\u2019s a big percentage mix of our sales at 17% it\u2019s flat year-over-year.","So we can\u2019t control what our subprime providers do or any of our lenders for that matter they have all their own models. They see these loan applications after they\u2019ve been declined by everybody else. They\u2019re terrific partners they\u2019ve been a great add to our business and they allow us to offer credit terms to a full suite of credit profile that enter our store each and every day. So that\u2019s how it came out for the quarter, how they\u2019ll move going forward, it\u2019s very difficult to say but all we were talking about at the end of the third quarter was we didn\u2019t expect to see continued expansion as it relates to the percent of sales.","Brian Nagel - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Matthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.","Thanks a lot. Good morning. My first question relates to CAF so if we look at the loss ratio that you experienced this quarter the prior two year seasonally that number had come down year on year it was up a bit which is not the first time that had been the case in recent years but it was up a bit more than we\u2019ve seen for a few quarter. So any comments on the moves and the loss ratio and what that means how that reflects your experience in marketplace?","Tom Reedy","No Matt I don\u2019t think there is anything to call out particularly in the loss ratio where it\u2019s at today is essentially what we would expected based on the evolution of our portfolio and the expense we have done over the last couple of years. I will comment that weather does impact credit as well with people being able to make payment, make calls et cetera but we don\u2019t think there is the big impact there. If you remember last quarter we did talk about it favorable loss experience in the third quarter and early in the year that was something that didn\u2019t materialize this quarter, so that would explain a little bit of it as well. As far as losses we\u2019re not seeing anything unusual.","Tom Folliard","Yes actually in line with our expectations.","Matthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.","Then as relates to subprime, as we think big-picture about this business, can you talk about the cost of servicing a subprime loan over the life of that loan, compared to servicing a higher-quality credit?","Tom Reedy","Yes Matt I mean obviously if you think about subprime the cost of servicing is going to be significantly higher than the average of our portfolio. But I would point out that it\u2019s not going to be dramatically higher than kind of the lowest stand of what we already do in the CAF business. We already do a pretty wide spectrum, and obviously we\u2019re accounting for that accordingly in our estimation of whether it makes sense from a profitability perspective or not.","Tom Folliard","I think we have quite a bit of experience with frequent contact with customers.","Matthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.","If we think about the $1,000 bogie, which is currently roughly what you pay your third-party partners, and we think about the cost to bring that in-house, should we assume that that compares favorably to the fees you pay to third parties?","Tom Reedy","I mean Matt I think we\u2019re going into this test not as similar we\u2019re going to breakeven it or not make money with this product from the perspective of so we intent to go forward and if this thing make sense we would intent to have the finance piece on its own been viable from a profitability perspective. The $1,000 that we avoid from the discounts from the third party lenders will be incremental to that.","Tom Folliard","But it\u2019s merely part of the calculation, clearly part of the calculation we would so many things go as we would hope we\u2019d expect to make money on the financing independent of that 1,000, so the answer is yes it would be (multiple speakers)","Matthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.","Okay. Then finally, just by way of cleanup, last year I think you originally disclosed 15% penetration for third-party subprime providers. A couple of our clients have called this out to us. This year you identified the penetration at 17% and said that was flat with a year ago. So are you essentially restating the year-ago penetration of subprime?","Tom Folliard","We are not restating it, Matt, but there is a program we have that\u2019s a lead generation program that has become a more significant part of the business. So, as it got to the point where it mattered in the number, we started adding it in and really back just to make sure that things are consistent year-over-year.","Matthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.","All right. We will clean that up with Katharine later. Thank you so much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sharon Zackfia with William Blair. Your line is open.","Sharon Zackfia - William Blair & Company","Hi, good morning. I know it hasn't been a ton of time since you have had the smaller format stores. But I am just curious, as you have changed the operations for those smaller markets, if there is anything yet that you are seeing that maybe you can extrapolate and back-solve from an operational efficiency standpoint to your more large historical stores.","Tom Folliard","That\u2019s a good question Sharon and it is still a little bit early. We only have, we have three of those stores opened now that we opened Dothan, Alabama and we have not yet rolled anything back into the existing stores. But I do think there will be opportunities there particularly around labor sharing and the ability to cross-train people to do multiple things in the store as oppose to in our higher volume stores if you are a buyer or you are in the business office or you are in sales, you can stay busy doing that one thing whereas in one of these smaller stores you really have to be able to do multiple things and that\u2019s true for both commission associates and hourly associates. So, I think some of those learnings, we will absolutely be able to go back into the bigger stores. We haven\u2019t had a chance to do that yet nor have we had enough time to read the results. But so far we have the three stores open and some of the things that we have to do in that store like leverage inventory on a grander scale, have more rapid transfers to make sure customers have access to more inventory than just a 100 cars representing that store that stuff is all working very smoothly so far. But we don\u2019t have much else to report in terms of results.","Sharon Zackfia - William Blair & Company","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Seth Basham with Wedbush. Your line is open.","Seth Basham - Wedbush","Good morning. My question is around subprime as well. I just would like to better understand. In the course of the last few months or in the next few months, do you plan on testing or signing up any other third-party providers to fill that gap that is left by the pullback with one of your current providers?","Tom Folliard","I would say no. We can\u2019t get across the spectrum of our lending with our partners we are always testing but where do we test is we look and see if the lender brings incremental values to the table meaning that they are proving things others don\u2019t and to the extent partners either fits in Tier 2 or the Tier 3 space, if do that, we will consider. But we are very happy with our relationships. One nice thing about CarMax and our growth plan is we believe there is room for us to potentially participate in that space and for our partners to continue to grow their business as well that\u2019s the benefit of building stores every year and taking market share. And in terms of a pull back, Seth, it really as you see in the fourth quarter, just came out flat, it\u2019s not a pull back, it\u2019s a pull back on the growth rate. But in terms of, again being able to provide great offers to a whole suite of credit customers in our stores, it came through again in the fourth quarter to work really well.","Seth Basham - Wedbush","Right, understood. So you look forward -- I don't know if you want to provide any forward-looking guidance; but would you expect that trend to persist, where you won't see any further penetration of subprime into 2014?","Tom Folliard","As you know Seth, we don\u2019t provide any forward-looking guidance but again we can\u2019t control at our models.","Tom Reedy","That\u2019s going to depend on the appetite of our lenders and what they are seeing in the business that they originates through our channel and we want them to run a profitable business. Our main goal is to have a sustainable source of financing for all of our customers.","Seth Basham - Wedbush","Right. Last related question is just on your subprime test. When do you expect to have conclusive evidence whether or not you're going to pursue it more broadly?","Tom Folliard","I mean I would say it\u2019s going to be at least a year.","Tom Reedy","Yes, our plan is to originate about $70 million as Tom mentioned earlier we are up to about 9 and then it\u2019s going to take a lot of the results.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Craig Kennison with Robert W. Baird. Your line is open.","Craig Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co","Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. You mentioned in the press release that your share of the 1 to 10-year-old car market is up 17%. Can you give us the number of cars in that cohort and what your actual market share is?","Tom Folliard","Well we also mentioned our actual market share is approximately 5% of 0 to 10 year old cars sold. I am not sure of the number; 21 million Katharine says the number of cars in that cohort. So, I mean it\u2019s a really great share gain. We have the best comps we have had since 2002 and I don\u2019t have the numbers right in front me but it\u2019s as good a share gain as I can remember over the last several years. Value of the used car market is still, it\u2019s not like it\u2019s growing rapidly, so it\u2019s still either flat or slightly down depending on whose estimate you look at. So, we are really pleased with our ability to continue to grow share.","Craig Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co","And can I have a follow-up, can you tell us what\u2019s your best market share is on a local basis?","Tom Folliard","We have talked about 10% to 15% depending on the age of the store and every market is little bit different and some markets aren\u2019t fully stored but we think 10% to 15% is a reasonable number over a long period of time.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets","Thank you. Good morning, guys. Can you talk about the sensitivity between CAF penetration rates and the slightly higher collateral coupon rates we saw in the latest securitization? Logically it makes sense, but is there an intention to start to tighten up credit a little bit on the CAF side?","Tom Folliard","No anything that you\u2019re seeing on the CAF side is going to be mostly a byproduct of what\u2019s coming through the door. I mean as we mentioned before we\u2019re continually testing on pricing and different pockets of credit that we can look at. But from a big picture perspective we have not changed our approach and there is nothing to read into that.","Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets","So you don\u2019t think the slightly higher collateral coupon rate that you are charging customers impacted their take rate at all?","Tom Folliard","That\u2019s more function of the market Scot, yes.","Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets","Okay. Then just a follow-up. Can you provide any more color regarding how we should think about SG&A trends during the next year or two? You guys had to do a lot of, let's call it investment spending, before you started on your store growth path. We are up and running now, and obviously that compares against a lean infrastructure. And again, without providing specific guidance, just a better way to think about SG&A trends. Thanks.","Tom Folliard","I think you\u2019re referring to us restarting our store growth plan which we\u2019re in full swing now and as we mentioned we opened 13 stores this year we plan to open another 10 to 15 for the next three also. But that\u2019s been a steady build up. So that\u2019s a cost pressure we\u2019ve had to overcome. As you saw in our results if we can deliver comps at this level, we\u2019re going to provide some pretty good leverage on a per unit basis over time. And we also pointed out this time that about 25% to 30% of our total SG&A cost is variable and that number is going to flex up and down with sales. But as we\u2019ve always said we\u2019re still in a growth mode, we\u2019re not growing significantly more next year than we did this year but there is still quite a bit of cost around growth, there is quite a bit of cost around fringes and some changes in kind of some of the fixed cost base. And we continue to make investments in our business.","So again I feel like as long as we can deliver solid comps we\u2019ll be able to leverage SG&A pretty well.","Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets","So Tom Reedy I think you have talked about kind of what comp you would need to leverage SG&A historically? What would that number look like today?","Tom Reedy","I think we have nothing different; it\u2019s the same kind of level that 48% comp, mid to high single-digit we think we got some leverage.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ravi Shankar with Morgan Stanley your line is open.","Yijay Ying - Morgan Stanley","Morning, everyone. This is Yijay in for Ravi. Just one question for me before I jump back in the queue. Could you provide a bit more color on the mix of your used cars that you sold in the quarter? And maybe just comment on how that has evolved over time and how you think that will impact your gross margin going forward.","Tom Folliard","Yeah, we have talked about this in the past and we\u2019ve done as you can look at our numbers over the last several years as our mix has moved and changed, we\u2019ve done a pretty decent job of managing margin around that. So we\u2019re not thinking that a mix shift is going to impact our ability to manage margins. But we really haven\u2019t seen much in the way of mix shift over the last couple of years. In terms of mix of age our zero to four mix remains approximately 70% of our total sales and our five to 10 year mix is around 30%. As you remember a few years ago we talked about that number of five to 10 year old cars having doubled, coming out of the recession from 15% to around 30%. But that number has been pretty stable for the last couple of years. And we really didn\u2019t see much in terms of a mix shift in sport utilities or compacts or anything of that nature.","So last couple of years it\u2019s been relatively stable in terms of mix.","Yijay Ying - Morgan Stanley","In terms of the age then just a quick follow up. Do you expect that to improve, maybe improve is the wrong word but do you expect zero to five to increase this year and over the next couple of years then?","Tom Folliard","We have been anticipating with the increase in SAAR that we would see our mix of zero to four year old cars increase; it just didn\u2019t happen over the last couple of years. So do we expect going forward at some point? Yes, but we\u2019ve also seen a slowdown in the SAAR growth, I think it ended a little over 16 million at the end of last month and I think only like a 2% growth. But that\u2019s really the driver of supply obviously. So the other factor is going to be consumer behavior and how quickly do they trade out cars and that\u2019s just something we really can\u2019t predict. But over time we would expect our mix to start to move a little bit more in that direction as the supply comes back.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of James Albertine with Stifel. Your line is open.","James Albertine - Stifel Nicolaus","Great. Thanks for taking the question and good morning, everyone. Just to follow on to a prior question as it related to the aggregate used vehicle market, I think you mentioned flat to slightly down in aggregate, but yet 17% share gains for you specifically. I am sure you probably have the data. Is there a way to sort of help us get to the bottom of -- is it negative sort of person-to-person transactions that\u2019s offsetting growth in retail formats? So it\u2019s said another way, are the retail formats actually growing relative to that commentary around flat to slightly down for the aggregate marketplace?","Tom Folliard","Well that is -- what we\u2019re talking about is retail not wholesale. So I am not really sure of your question.","James Albertine - Stifel Nicolaus","Okay. I wanted to make sure I understood that correctly then.","Tom Folliard","Based on retail cars sold, when we look at our wholesale business of whatever north of 300,000 units sold, those are all not included in the transaction -- I\u2019m sorry, included in the share calculation. The share calculation is only of cars retail. And we have talked about this data set in the past. It\u2019s a difficult data set to get your arms around. Approximately a third of all cars resale are sold from person to person. That number has been pretty stable over the last several years. And this is our best estimate. It\u2019s the way we have been doing it for years and it\u2019s our best estimate. Share and - I am not sure it\u2019s exactly precise but I am sure that we\u2019ve gained share pretty significantly and had a level that - as good as we\u2019ve seen in several years.","James Albertine - Stifel Nicolaus","If I can, and I know that you don't give intrayear granularity, but given the surge in the off-lease vehicles that we are seeing come back into the marketplace, is there a tendency -- do your share gains incrementally ramp as that surge has progressed? Said another way, back half of last year maybe did those share gains accelerate as far as you saw it?","Tom Folliard","We never really correlated share gains with changes in supplies that relates to leases. Having been here for 20 years and seeing lease percentages as a percent of new cars sold move up and down over that time period and then subsequently those cars coming back into the market place, if not really something that we have seen as a predictable variable to say that we would either gain more share or sell more cars.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joe Edelstein with Stephens Inc; your line is open.","Joe Edelstein - Stephens Inc. ","Hi, good morning. Each month we look at the monthly securitization filings that you put on the website. But the piece that we just don't get a lot of visibility on is what is in the warehouse and what is happening there. Could you just give us an update as to what the average net spread on those loans look like? Should we just assume that it is similar to the most recent securitization, which was down closer to like a 6.2% (multiple speakers) spread?","Tom Folliard","I think, looking at the securitization is a good proxy, because you can lock down on what actually out there. We are also giving you this data every quarter on our originations. And so from, that\u2019s a pretty good indication that you could get on what\u2019s going on in the warehouse, looking at the quarterly origination information and then kind of combining that with what you got up there in the public domain. And things are moving relatively quickly from the warehouse to the securitization\u2026","Tom Reedy","We are doing one every quarter these days, based on the origination of the CAFs. I think it is pretty decent proxy.","Joe Edelstein - Stephens Inc. ","Right. I guess as the timing of those newer securitizations do become a bigger part of the portfolio mix and you roll off the older, higher-rate deals, can you comment at all on what your expectation would be for net spreads as we progress throughout this year?","Tom Folliard","I mean, we\u2019ve not given any guidance about things going forward for a couple of years. But I think if you -- I think you can take the data out there on securitization and you can kind of see how to work itself through. It usually takes us couple of years for things to work through after we make the change in rate or you can observe a change in spread, and we expect that \u2013","Joe Edelstein - Stephens Inc. ","And the expense is steadily declining here for the last couple of years and that\u2019s kind of just that what we should expect going forward at this point?","Tom Folliard","I think we should expect it\u2019s going to be where the market leads it to be. And we are going to provide a competitive rate of financing per customer, that\u2019s the most important thing that we do with CAF, as we are sitting in the catbird seat, if you will, as far as looking at those amounts, first we have provided competitive product. Cost of fund is going to be what it is and we\u2019re going to charge what the market allows us. That\u2019s why we continuously-- and you know the spread that we\u2019re living at today is significantly better than historic levels still. And we are very happy with the profitability level of CAF. It started having growth going forward, that\u2019s going to give by-products of them providing competitive offer and us growing core business in a number of sales that we run through the CarMax channel.","Joe Edelstein - Stephens Inc. ","Sure. If I may just ask one more question about the provision rate, that provision rate has picked up sequentially throughout the year. I guess there are some seasonality factors I am sure that go into that calculation. But can you just speak a little bit more directly to your calculation process there related to the provision? Should we model it and expect it to step up throughout the coming year as well?","Tom Folliard","All I could comment is, as I did earlier that I think the provision for loan losses is in line with our expectations, where it should be for the portfolio, and that\u2019s pretty much in line as far as we can talk about going forward.","Joe Edelstein - Stephens Inc. ","Okay. Do you have the ending delinquency balance handy, by chance? I know you will put that in the filing, but just if you have that.","Tom Folliard","Yes, Katharine and Celeste can get back if you wanted to, and give some detail on that.","Joe Edelstein - Stephens Inc. ","Just a couple of follow-ups. That\u2019s all. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Armstrong with CL King & Associates; your line is open.","Bill Armstrong - CL King & Associates, Inc. ","Good morning. A question about market share. I think you said earlier you have about 5% total share. I assume that is throughout the United States. Could you update us on some of your more mature markets where you've got a lot of penetration, like Chicago, Washington, Atlanta? What sort of share do you think you have there right now?","Tom Folliard","Bill, first that number is not the entire United States, it\u2019s only the markets that we\u2019re in.","Bill Armstrong - CL King & Associates, Inc. ","The only ones you are in, okay.","Tom Folliard","May be a little more than half, so if you look at it as a share nationally it\u2019s probably approximately half of that. And I talked earlier about markets where we have seen more mature markets achieving somewhere in the 10% to 15% range that\u2019s about as high as it goes. We are not going to get into specific detail around markets but again and the data is, it\u2019s challenging dataset that we have tried to have a consistent way to look at it over a long period of time. And recently as our sales mix has moved into the older category and a more significant percentage, we will now report only 0 to 10 year old share which is more representative of what we fell in aggregate.","Bill Armstrong - CL King & Associates, Inc. ","Right. In those more mature markets where you have had a significant presence for now a few car-buying cycles, do you see market share continuing to grow? Or is that stabilizing and leveling off?","Tom Folliard","The reason I put a wide range around it is, it\u2019s just again it\u2019s a difficult measure. The second part is, in some of our more mature markets where we thought maybe it was only a three store market or a five store market because of our ability to grow, we have been able to go back in and add more stores which contributes to more share. So, we are still a relatively young company particularly if you look at the number of stores we have that have been through a couple of buying cycles. So, I think we got a long way to go to continue to learn but I think that\u2019s a pretty good range to work with what I said earlier.","Bill Armstrong - CL King & Associates, Inc. ","Okay. Just one really quick follow-up. The ratio of wholesale cars to retail cars has been going down for the last few quarters. What is driving that trend? Can you remind us?","Tom Folliard","That\u2019s a difficult one for us to get our arms around other than we think over a long period of time they will kind of grow around the same. And remember we have couple of years where the disconnect was gigantic in the other direction.","Bill Armstrong - CL King & Associates, Inc. ","Yes.","Tom Folliard","Where our wholesale approximately doubled over two years, so it\u2019s really strong volumes. We run a great auction business. We have great wholesale customers that support us each and every week and I think we provide great customer service and it\u2019s been a terrific part of the total CarMax diversified business model.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Murphy with Bank of America, Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Elizabeth Suzuki - Bank of America, Merrill Lynch. ","Hi, this is Liz Suzuki on for John. With the accounting correction, how should we think about modeling ESP and GAP revenue and gross profit going forward? Is it going to remain closer to the lower levels of this quarter? Or was that accounting correction just a one-time adjustment that shouldn't be ongoing?","Tom Folliard","So, that\u2019s very good question Liz and it is an adjustment to take care of going back over the last few years but in terms of the magnitude of the dollars on a per contract basis, it\u2019s approximately 30 bucks. So, in terms of our ability to price that back, we would feel like that\u2019s a number that we could easily price back without much impact on penetration. Now that being said, the product itself has price changes all the time. We have been doing this for a long time over 20 years and as our partners learn more about the product and about the performance, we will see price changes. We do anticipate additional price changes this year to the product unrelated to the change required to get back the reserve. The impact that that will have on our penetration, we will have to see. We have also done a great job of training and developing our store teams to be able to sale the product. We think it\u2019s a great deal for our customers.","Our customers who buy ESP product as a group are happier than those that don\u2019t. So, we continue to believe in it and although it\u2019s a minor adjustment on a per car basis, it obviously have the impact that it did and we believe we fixed it going forward.","Elizabeth Suzuki - Bank of America, Merrill Lynch","Great, thank you. Just one quick one. Regarding used vehicle pricing, are you seeing any impact from the GM recall on the pricing of your inventory for Chevy, Pontiac, or Saturn vehicles? And are you hearing any concerns either from the ABS market or elsewhere about residual projections coming down?","Tom Folliard","We have not yet, I am not saying that that won\u2019t happen but as of yet no, we haven\u2019t seen much of an impact on pricing or we certainly haven\u2019t heard anything from anybody in the lending world.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of avid Whiston with Morningstar. Your line is open.","David Whiston - Morningstar ","Good morning. A question on the comp performance. You often cite improvements from improved execution in our stores. I was just wondering if you could get a little more detail about that. I mean, I assume it's been the same playbook all along. But what has been changing at a more granular level to be better?","Tom Folliard","It kind of is the same playbook, so it\u2019s not, and I couldn\u2019t point to any one thing. I just think our teams have done a really great job. We are also more experienced, we have some more experienced sales people in our stores who are better at selling. We have talked about credit in the past being a factor, car quality is a factor, having the right inventory in the right place at the right time is a factor for conversion. So, conversion is a multi-person effort. It\u2019s not just a sales person in the store. It\u2019s a combination of whole bunch of different things, I think the initiatives that we have worked on over the last several years to get more efficient and become a better operator, I think have also helped. So, it really is a combination of things and I really couldn\u2019t be more proud of our store teams for how hard they have worked over the last several years to continue to improve our execution.","David Whiston - Morningstar ","Okay. On the capital structure, is there any thoughts on ever taking on debt for buybacks?","Tom Folliard","As you can see we have got a significant amount of cash on the balance sheet today. We are generating a lot of cash. So the answer to that, we\u2019ll cross that bridge when we come to it. We\u2019re obviously concerned about making sure we\u2019re returning capital to shareholder appropriately. That said I don\u2019t think we\u2019d be uncomfortable with more leverage in our capital structure and we have significant access to capital to the extent we wanted to do that. We\u2019ve got unused credit facility three quarters to the billion dollars and access to capital from a number of other venues if you wanted to.","David Whiston - Morningstar","I guess related would be: what about a dividend?","Tom Folliard","As I said we\u2019re constantly thinking about what\u2019s the best thing for our shareholders and if we have something to talk about on that front we will, but at this point there is nothing to talk about.","Operator","(Operator Instructions). Your next question comes from the line of Seth Basham with Wedbush. Your line is open.","Seth Basham - Wedbush Securities","Two quick follow-ups. First, can you give us some color around tax refunds and how the year-over-year change in tax refunds tends to affect sales going through your store?","Tom Folliard","The tax refund time for us is always a seasonally high time for sales and we have to get prepped up and make sure we have the inventory ready. If you remember last year there was a delay in the tax returns but I think we saw similar delay this year it\u2019s not something that we think impacts us over the year but it can shift sales from one quarter to the other. Although I think I am not exactly Tom I think was pretty similar to last year in terms of timing. Delayed last year and a little delayed this year as well.","Seth Basham - Wedbush Securities","Got you. The data I was looking at suggested that tax refunds are up 12% year-over-year through February. So I was wondering if that had to any extent a positive effect on your business. But I guess you don't have the data to show that.","Tom Folliard","No.","Seth Basham - Wedbush Securities","Got you. All right. Then secondly as it relates to wholesale, can you help us connect the dots there? With wholesale sales down and ASPs down, your buy rates up, are you seeing more limited appraisal traffic or some other factor affecting the wholesale trends?","Tom Folliard","The wholesale sales were up not down, margin was slightly down. But I mean we have seen, we went for a number of years where we saw an appreciating wholesale market which was obviously pretty unique and that provides the tailwind and for a number of different reasons I would say the last year or so have been what we would consider more of a normally depreciating market. So pretty strong buy rate, remember this is not a business that you can isolate and manage independently. It is absolutely attached to the retail business and to everything else that we do. So maintaining a strong buy rate, making sure that customers who come and want to sell us their car and also buy a car from us get a strong offer, so that they\u2019re likely to sell us their car and then in turn buy a car from us is one of the more important things that we do.","So a buy rate of around 30% that\u2019s about as we have ever had in the quarter so wholesale comes out the way it does based on the amount of traffic that we get through the door.","Seth Basham - Wedbush Securities","Okay. So no big changes in the rate of change in appraisal traffic, and no big changes in the rate of cars going to retail versus wholesale that you buy?","Tom Folliard","No.","Operator","And we have no further question in queue at this time.","Tom Folliard","Thank you operator and thank you everyone for your support and interest and just a couple of closing comments. The year when we celebrated our 20 year anniversary, we also have cumulative retail sales of over 5 million units and cumulative wholesale sales of almost 3 million units and in fiscal \u201814 alone we sold almost 870,000 total cars in those two categories. And I just want to thank our 21,000 CarMax associates for all they have done over the last 20 years to make this all possible.

In the second quarter, total revenues grew 11% to $3.6 billion, net earnings grew 10% to $155 million, and earnings per share increased by 13% to $0.70 per share. Earnings per share for the quarter included $0.06 related to the receipt of the Toyota legal settlement proceeds.","In terms of other key drivers for the quarter, used unit comps increased slightly for the quarter and total used units rose by over 6%. Gross profit per used unit remained flat compared to last year at $21.73. Total wholesale units grew by over 7% and gross profit per wholesale unit expanded by 3% or $25. Other sales and revenue increased 11% year-over-year due to an $8.5 million improvement in third party finance fees, and CAF income grew 10% to approximately $93 million.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Tom Reedy to discuss finance. Tom?","Tom Reedy","Thanks Tom. Good morning everybody. Overall, the CAF story is not too different from what we discussed in Q1. In the second quarter, CAF income grew 10% compared to the second quarter of FY14, and average managed receivables grew 19% to $7.7 billion. CAF weighted average contract rate \u2013 the rate charged to customers \u2013 was 7% versus 6.8% in last year\u2019s second quarter. This rate has been relatively stable at around 7% for the past several quarters.","The allowance for loan losses grew to $78 million. This represents 1% of average managed receivables, which is consistent with last year. As we saw earlier in the year, credit losses for the quarter were moderately better than our expectations. CAF net penetration at 41% was relatively flat compared to last year\u2019s second quarter, and net loans originated in the quarter rose 7% to $1.2 billion. That\u2019s in line with the total growth in unit sales.","Tom?","Tom Folliard","Thank you. SG&A for the quarter increased approximately 5% to $298 million. Excluding the legal settlement gain, SG&A expenses increased 13% primarily due to the addition of 18 stores since the beginning of the second quarter of last year and a $6.4 million increase in stock-based compensation expense. On a per-unit basis excluding the legal settlement gain, SG&A increased $116 to $2,183 compared to $2,067 in the first quarter of fiscal 2014.","During the second quarter, we opened four stores, three in new markets for us: Madison, Wisconsin, Lynchburg, Virginia, and Portland, Oregon, and one in our existing Dallas market. Store traffic was up modestly in the quarter and our web traffic also continued to expand. For the quarter, average monthly web visits grew to nearly 14 million, up 15% compared to the same period last year. Visitors to our mobile site continue to represent approximately 30% of total visits while visits utilizing our mobile apps represented another 15% of the total.","With that, we\u2019d be happy to take your questions. Operator?","Question and Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions]","Our first question comes from the line of Matt Nemer. Your line is open.","Matt Nemer \u2013 Wells Fargo","Good morning everyone.","Tom Folliard","Hey Matt.","Matt Nemer \u2013 Wells Fargo","So just quickly on SG&A expense, should we expect\u2014you\u2019ve got fewer stores opening in the back half. Should we expect that the growth rate in SG&A could go back to the single digits or do you think we\u2019ll stay at this elevated level for the rest of the year?","Tom Folliard","I\u2019m not sure, Matt. We deleveraged in the quarter, but that was largely due to a relatively low comp. I\u2019m not sure of the timing of openings during the rest of the year, but it was definitely impacted by a heavy weight of newer stores in the quarter.","Tom Reedy","Yeah, we had a heavy weight of new stores at the end of last year and early this year, so it\u2019s definitely the most effective new locations we\u2019ve had in recent history.","Matt Nemer \u2013 Wells Fargo","Okay, and then secondly, could you just talk to the reasons behind the lower EPP penetration and the higher cancel rates? Any change in the program that\u2019s causing that?","Tom Folliard","The changes in the program, we discussed at the end of the year when we talked about having to make adjustments for the reserve, so we had some price changes and we saw some impact in penetration, but we\u2019ve had price changes several times over the last 20 years that we\u2019ve been doing this, and occasionally it has a little bit bigger of an impact. It\u2019s still a very strong ESP penetration for the quarter, and EPP is a combination of both ESP and GAP, both of which had price changes since the last time we talked.","Matt Nemer \u2013 Wells Fargo","Got it, okay. Thanks so much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Aram Rubinson. Your line is open.","Aram Rubinson \u2013 Wolfe Research","Thanks for taking my question, guys. Two things \u2013 one, can you give us some color on the subprime? I know it was down as a percent, but can you tell us kind of where the non-subprime creditors, like this Exeter and others, fit into the mix, and if you were to look at your prime business only, what kind of comps you might have kind of seen in prime only.","Tom Reedy","Yeah, it\u2019s very hard to pull that all apart, and we\u2019re not in a position to talk about how much specific headwind Tier 3 was. As you saw, it was down about five points year-over-year as a percent of our sales, which is consistent with last year; but we need to remember that Tier 3 is not only impacted by their behavior but by what\u2019s going on above them and what\u2019s coming through the door. Over time, we\u2019ve seen the mix of Tier 2 to Tier 3 change \u2013 you know, two years ago Tier 2 was a bigger percentage of sales, last year Tier 3 was bigger. This year, we\u2019ve seen Tier 2 pick up somewhat, so they\u2019ve been picking up some of the penetration that Tier 3 lost, but it\u2019s difficult to discern exactly how that translates through the comps because Tier 3\u2019s behavior is also a byproduct of what they\u2019re seeing and what they\u2019re experiencing in their portfolio.","Tom Folliard","If you remember, our water flow of assets starts with CAF and goes on to Tier 2, and from there to Tier 3, so Tier 3 doesn\u2019t see any of the applications that are approved and booked by anything above them.","Aram Rubinson \u2013 Wolfe Research","Okay.","Tom Folliard","And this change in percent of sales is similar to the change we saw in the first quarter.","Aram Rubinson \u2013 Wolfe Research","Can you just tell us, is there any reason to think as the back half your comparisons get easier \u2013 they go from 16% down to 10% and then 7%. Is there any reason to think that the sales trend wouldn\u2019t improve commensurate with that?","Tom Folliard","Yeah, we don\u2019t give any forward-looking guidance.","Aram Rubinson \u2013 Wolfe Research","All right, I was asking for it a little differently, but I appreciate that. Have a good day.","Tom Folliard","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brian Nagel from Oppenheimer. Your line is open.","Brian Nagel \u2013 Oppenheimer","Hi, good morning. I wanted to maybe ask the subprime question a little bit differently, but if we look at\u2014like you just mentioned in response to the prior question, you\u2019ve had now a couple quarters with a pretty significant decline in subprime as a percentage of total sales. But does that reflect\u2014as we think about what\u2019s happening behind that, is that just simply a mix shift, or are you seeing further tightening, if you will, on the part of your partners? Then the follow-up question on that, and I think you mentioned it briefly in your press release, but maybe just some update on your own subprime test and how that\u2019s going, and what we should expect going forward.","Tom Reedy","Sure, I can comment a little bit on that. The Tier 3, as I said, it\u2019s a combination of factors. We\u2019re clearly seeing them continue to provide, I\u2019ll say less attractive offers than they were a year ago, less compelling offers for the customer so therefore we\u2019re seeing less conversion in that space. But as I mentioned, it\u2019s a byproduct of their behavior plus what they\u2019re seeing coming through the door, and we\u2019ve seen some pickup in the behavior of our other partner lenders.","With regard to our Tier 3 experiment, we\u2019re still early into it \u2013 we just started. I think the first wave of originations is just starting to anniversary six months, so we\u2019re really not in a position to talk about how that\u2019s going yet, and we\u2019ll have an update for you as soon as something makes sense to talk about. But it\u2019s on track, we\u2019re expecting to continue to do it throughout the year and get through the test as we announced it.","Brian Nagel \u2013 Oppenheimer","So if I could just follow up, and not to get too cute with this, but we\u2019ve been talking a lot about subprime and CarMax, and there was a point last year where you really called out your partners, you know, for one reason or another seemingly getting\u2014well, pulling back some of the business. So you commented again about year-on-year, but if we look at it maybe not year-on-year but Q2 versus Q1, is there still a further pull back or has it stayed about the same?","Tom Reedy","I wouldn\u2019t know specifically. I\u2019d say we\u2019re seeing the same type of trend as we did in Q1. Remember, we first talked about this at the very end of\u2014we saw it happening at the very end of Q3. There was a notable shift in behavior. I think\u2014you know, we have no reason to think behavior is changing from where it is today. We want those guys to run a profitable business that\u2019s going to be sustainable and support our customers for the long run. They are going to test and make changes as appropriate for their portfolio, and we wish them all the best of luck in doing it.","As far as Q1 to Q2, though, I would say it\u2019s more of a continuation of the same. We\u2019re seeing less attractive offers than a year ago being presented to the customer, and therefore less take-up on the Tier 3.","Tom Folliard","It\u2019s a similar drop-off, Brian, in points of sale \u2013 about five points in the first quarter, five points in the second quarter. It still represents 15% of our sales, it\u2019s still business that we\u2019re really happy to do, and really happy to have a credit offer that reaches all kinds of different customers.","Brian Nagel \u2013 Oppenheimer","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Murphy from Bank of America. Your line is open.","Liz Suzuki \u2013 Bank of America","Good morning, this is Liz Suzuki on for John. It looks like comps were a little lower than what we expected, even adjusting for the lost Saturday. Do you think consumers are substituting new vehicles for used, given the attractive financing rates available, and are you seeing more competition from new vehicle dealers, particularly on a monthly payment basis?","Tom Folliard","It\u2019s really hard to tell the reasons why somebody would buy new over used. I think it\u2019s good for us when we see the SAAR continuing to grow, as we\u2019ve talked about. Over time, I think it will have long-term benefits for us, both on the supply side and the fact that consumers are more willing to get out there and sign up for a loan and buy a car.","As far as our comps are concerned, I don\u2019t really view it as very much different from the first quarter. It was three points in the first quarter. If you add back a point for Saturday, we\u2019re really just not that far off. I\u2019m really pleased with the way the quarter turned out. It\u2019s the most cars we\u2019ve ever sold.","Liz Suzuki \u2013 Bank of America","Great, thanks. Just one follow-up, which is do you have what the typical monthly payment amount is for a CarMax customer?","Tom Folliard","I don\u2019t think we do off the top of our heads, but it\u2019s $20,000 average sale price, it\u2019s 90 or 95%.","Tom Reedy","We\u2019ll get back to you.","Tom Folliard","Yeah, we can get back to you on that. I\u2019m not sure.","Liz Suzuki \u2013 Bank of America","All right, thank you.","Tom Folliard","You can back into it with our contract rate from CAF, but then you\u2019d have to go all the way down the credit tier as well, so.","Liz Suzuki \u2013 Bank of America","All right, thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Fassler from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Matthew Fassler \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Thanks a lot, good morning. My primary question here relates to SG&A. We saw some volatility, I guess, in the year-on-year trends, particularly for compensation and benefits per vehicle retail. I know that\u2019s the biggest line item in SG&A. It was down a chunk year-on-year in the first quarter, up a chunk year-on-year in the second quarter, kind of nets out to kind of flattish year-on-year. Anything significant driving that volatility, and how would you think about\u2014which quarter would you say is more representative of the trend you\u2019d expect to see going forward?","Tom Reedy","Hey Matt, it\u2019s Tom Reedy. If you look at that, and I think if you remember last quarter, we noted that stock-based comp was favorable in the quarter and didn\u2019t want to take any credit for it. This quarter, it went back the other way because the stock price went up, and I think you\u2019re right to look at it in kind of a year-to-date basis rather than a quarter-to-quarter, because that piece has been quite volatile.","Matthew Fassler \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Understood, okay. Secondly, just a follow-up on some of the questions that you\u2019ve already gotten on subprime. Presumably you have a long range view about where subprime essentially lands. Historically it\u2019s been as low as mid-single digits and obviously as high more recently as the low 20\u2019s. When all is said and done, and I\u2019m sure you\u2019re modeling the business out by source of finance, or at least have some sense of where you\u2019d expect it to be, where do you think this ultimately settles in terms of subprime penetration?","Tom Folliard","Matt, we actually don\u2019t model it and we don\u2019t know where it\u2019s going to settle out. As Tom mentioned earlier, it\u2019s a reflection of our partners\u2019 behavior and the credit we have coming through the door. We\u2019re happy to do every one of these deals. We think they\u2019re 100% incremental. Remember \u2013 Tier 3 lenders don\u2019t see an application until it\u2019s declined by every other lender, so it\u2019s a part of the business that\u2019s going to come out the way it comes out, and we expect some volatility there but we don\u2019t really have any view into where we expect it to shake out long-term.","Matthew Fassler \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Got it. Understood. Thank you so much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Seth Basham from Wedbush. Your line is open.","Seth Basham \u2013 Wedbush Securities","My question revolves around the finance lending program as well. Specifically, can you comment on what the approval rates were this year relative to last?","Tom Reedy","Down very slightly, but we\u2019re still seeing over 90% of our customers receiving approval of some kind in our stores. If you remember, as we\u2019ve been talking about the last couple of quarters, the decline in kind of attach on the subprime business is more a byproduct of the nature of the offers that the lenders are providing, whereas in the past a $13,000 loan may have had a $100 or $200 down payment requirement, that number may be several hundred dollars higher today, making it a more difficult transaction for the customer. So it\u2019s a combination of a number of things, but as far as actually receiving an offer, it\u2019s still very strong in our stores and overall we\u2019re very happy with the finance environment. We think we have a great array of lenders for our customers, and customers have great access to financing in the CarMax system.","Tom Folliard","Yeah Seth, as Tom said, 90% of customers are getting approval from somebody in our kind of hemisphere of lending, and that number has been\u2014you know, 90 has kind of been as high as it\u2019s ever been for us, but it\u2019s been stable there for a couple of years now.","Seth Basham \u2013 Wedbush Securities","Got it, understood. So you mentioned that traffic was up a bit or flat, but conversion was down \u2013 a little bit different trend than in recent quarters, I believe. When you think about conversion in credit tier, was there any change in the tiers other than the subprime?","Tom Folliard","This quarter was not very much different from last quarter. Whenever we talk about conversion and traffic, my view is that you have to look at both of those things on a much longer term basis than just one quarter, and I\u2019ve always felt like our growth will come partially from growth, but it never seems to match up exactly in a quarter. So like you said, conversion was flattish, traffic was slightly up, but I\u2019m not sure what that says for the quarters going forward.","Tom Reedy","CAF was relatively flat as far as penetration for the quarter, and we saw subprime down a few points. We saw an increase in Tier 2 and a smaller increase in the customers that did not need financing in our system.","Seth Basham \u2013 Wedbush Securities","Understood, and the last follow-up \u2013 just thinking about conversion, is there anything besides credit that might have affected the conversion rate this quarter relative to the last couple quarters?","Tom Folliard","No.","Seth Basham \u2013 Wedbush Securities","Great, thank you.","Operator","Our next questions comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli from RBC Capital. Your line is open.","Scot Ciccarelli \u2013 RBC Capital","Thank you. Can I just clarify something? So what you outlined for subprime, so the 13.8% penetration, that is purely the Tier 3 providers, and some of the drop-off we saw there was picked up by what you consider Tier 2 providers. Is that the right way to think about that?","Tom Reedy","Scot, that number is the Tier 3 providers plus the CAF test, so it\u2019s all customers that would have been funded in that space, including ours, which is a very small portion of it is CAF.","Scot Ciccarelli \u2013 RBC Capital","Got it \u2013 okay. And then out of the CAF approvals that you have in the regular CAF program, how much of that\u2014I know you guys have your proprietary scorecard, but how much of that would you guys generally consider subprime, because obviously if you go through the securitizations, you\u2019re charging mid-teens interest rates for a lot of people, and I\u2019m assuming those aren\u2019t what you and I would call prime customers.","Tom Reedy","No, as we\u2019ve talked about before, Scot, CAF\u2019s (indiscernible) if you want to call it that, is across a broad spectrum of credit, and it\u2019s customers that we\u2019re experienced with in our system, we have a good track record with and we\u2019re able to securitize. I\u2019m very hesitant to define subprime because I think it\u2019s different in the eyes of almost anyone you ask. You can look at the strat tables in our deals and kind of get a feel for it, but\u2014you know, we like every customer we do at CAF. That\u2019s why we\u2019re approving them.","Tom Folliard","And as you know, Scot, we\u2019ve been doing this for a long time. We\u2019ve done lots of securitizations, and when you look at the aggregate portfolio that we\u2019re originating, it\u2019s delivering a very low loss rate and is very attractive to investors.","Scot Ciccarelli \u2013 RBC Capital","Right, understood. The last question is inventory was up kind of sharply this quarter \u2013 it was up in 1Q as well. What\u2019s the outlook for that and kind of the right way to think about inventory growth going forward? Thanks a lot, guys.","Tom Folliard","Sure, thank you, Scot. Most of inventory growth in the first couple of quarters has been around a combination of new stores that are open and building inventory for new stores that are about to be open. We have some stores that are carrying more inventory than they did last year, and we were a little bit low last year and we had relatively high turns with pretty good comps in the first and second quarter last year. So it\u2019s a combination of we were probably a little behind where we wanted to be last year. We intentionally are a little ahead this year, but it\u2019s mostly driven by either new stores that are open or preparing to open new stores, so we have to buy cars in advance, we have recondition them, we have to have them in process, and in many cases shipping some pretty significant distances to get new stores open, like the last one in Portland.","Scot Ciccarelli \u2013 RBC Capital","But comfortable with the levels today?","Tom Folliard","Yeah, absolutely.","Scot Ciccarelli \u2013 RBC Capital","Got it. Okay. Thanks guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of James Albertine from Stifel. Your line is open.","James Albertine \u2013 Stifel","Great, good morning, and thanks for taking my question. Wanted to get a sense on an updated view from you guys on the broader supply environment. I think most would expect, given the trail for the new vehicle growth in the market, that perhaps we\u2019re earlier innings in the used supply ramp; and yet, your pricing for the used retail side was up, I think ahead of our expectations. It was pretty considerable, I would think, in the second quarter, so I just wanted to get kind of your idea to maybe diagnose what\u2019s going on from the supply side and what\u2019s driving pricing with respect to what you\u2019re seeing in the market. Thanks.","Tom Folliard","Yeah, our average retail was pretty close in the second quarter compared to the first quarter. In terms of supply, the first part for us is looking at self-sufficiency. Self-sufficiency was slightly over 50%, so those are the cars that we buy through the appraisaling that then become retail cars for us, but not much of a change from the first quarter.","In terms of the new car sales translating to future supply, I think you said it \u2013 we\u2019re in the early innings, and I would agree with you although we\u2019ve seen a nice pick-up in SAAR. The supply kind of trickle down will happen over the next couple of years, so we\u2019re excited about that. We have said in the past that we historically over-perform in kind of two, three, four-year-old cars. That mix of sales for us was slightly up in the quarter but not very much, and so we still think that is yet to come.","James Albertine \u2013 Stifel","Just as a quick follow-up, do you think pricing can hold at these levels as supply continues to ramp?","Tom Folliard","I don\u2019t really have much of a prediction on that. The only time we\u2019ve ever seen significant drop-off in our average retail was during the recession, when we saw our average retail drop by over $2,000. Other than that, due to inflation and due to just continued increased costs of new cars, a new car now is over $30,000, it\u2019s just not something that I think will go backwards.","James Albertine \u2013 Stifel","Appreciate it. Thanks again, and good luck in the third quarter.","Tom Folliard","Thank you.","Operator","As a reminder, if you do have a question, please press star then the number one on your telephone keypad. Our next question comes from the line of Bill Armstrong from CL King & Associates. Your line is open.","Bill Armstrong \u2013 CL King & Associates","Good morning, guys. Back to subprime, is it fair to say that the traffic trends or maybe the number of subprime applications was down year-over-year?","Tom Reedy","I can say overall through the quarter, we saw credit applications down very slightly. There\u2019s nothing specific to talk about as far as volumes through the door. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s much\u2014","Tom Folliard","No, and as Tom said earlier, if you look at our applicant flow, 90% of customers get an approval of some kind from one of the lenders that we provide or that partners with us, but it\u2019s not just an approval, it\u2019s the quality of the approval. So it\u2019s a combination of a number of different things. Everybody has their own scorecard, everybody runs their own business. We do the best we can with the approvals that we get, and our stores, I think, do a fantastic job of trying to help customers get through whatever challenges that they may have, whether it\u2019s on the credit side or the trade-in side. We\u2019re really proud of the offers that we have for our consumers from top to bottom in the credit tiers.","Bill Armstrong \u2013 CL King & Associates","Okay, and then just one quick one \u2013 the EPP estimated cancellation reserve rates, was that something material, and would we see more of that going forward?","Tom Reedy","No, if you remember earlier in the\u2014or at the end of last year, we adjusted the rates at which we reserve on both ESP and the GAP product. This year, part of the reason that we are seeing increased costs, or a lower amount of revenue margin in those products, is that we are reserving at that higher rate. As far as\u2014there\u2019s no major adjustments embedded in that, but we are reserving at a higher rate than we were a year ago, and have been all this year.","Tom Folliard","Yeah, and remember \u2013 whenever we reserve at a higher rate, that\u2019s the rate we think we should be reserving at, so we have it set for what our best prediction is of what\u2019s going to happen with returns going forward, both on the ESP side and on the GAP insurance side.","Bill Armstrong \u2013 CL King & Associates","Okay, and then could you just remind us when we will anniversary that higher reserve rate that you\u2019ve put in place?","Tom Reedy","Q1 of next year.","Bill Armstrong \u2013 CL King & Associates","Q1 \u2013 okay, got it. Okay, thank you.","Tom Folliard","Okay.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Whiston from Morningstar. Your line is open.","David Whiston \u2013 Morningstar","Thanks. Good morning. Any detail you can give on the quarter relative to prior year quarter on traffic and the conversion rate?","Tom Folliard","We said traffic was up modestly and conversion was flattish.","David Whiston \u2013 Morningstar","Okay, thanks. Then more a strategic question \u2013 are you guys considering or actually doing basically a substitute for Craigslist for private sale where two customers could buy a used vehicle at a CarMax store with a CarMax inspection done for a fee?","Tom Folliard","No. I\u2019m not sure what you mean there, but no, we\u2019re not doing that. We\u2019re only selling cars that we own.","David Whiston \u2013 Morningstar","Okay, thank you.","Tom Folliard","All right.","Operator","There are no further questions in queue at this time. I turn the call back over to the presenters.","Tom Folliard","All right, thank you very much.

[Operator Instructions]","I will now turn the call over to Katharine Kenny. Please go ahead.","Katharine W. Kenny","Thank you, and good morning. Thank you for joining our fiscal 2013 second quarter earnings conference call. On the call today with me, as usual, are Tom Folliard, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Tom Reedy, our Executive Vice President and CFO.","Before we begin, let me remind you that our statements today regarding the company's future business plans, prospects and financial performance are forward-looking statements that we make pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are based on management's current knowledge and assumptions about future events that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. In providing projections and other forward-looking statements, the company disclaims any intent or obligation to update them. For additional information on important factors that could affect these expectations, please see the company's annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 29, 2012, filed with the SEC.","Before I turn the call over to Tom, let me also remind you that we are holding 2 of our regular analyst days in our home office here in Richmond on October 2 and October 30. If you're interested in attending, please let us know. Tom?","Thomas J. Folliard","Thank you, Katharine, and good morning, everyone. Well we were pleased to report used unit comps for the second quarter of 5% compared to last year and total growth in used units of 8%. Traffic was somewhat lower than last year, but conversion increased due to the continuation of better credit offers and strong execution by our store sales teams.","Total used vehicle gross profit grew with total sales by 8%. Used vehicle gross profit per unit of $2,172 remained virtually unchanged compared to last year's second quarter. Appraisal traffic was up again this quarter, but wholesale unit sales decreased by 2% due to a drop in the buy rate compared to last year. Remember, the buy rate for this quarter was approximately 28%. And as we've discussed before, the buy rate is correlated to changes in overall wholesale pricing, which affect the offers we can make to consumers, and we recently have seen some moderating wholesale vehicle valuations.","Total wholesale gross profit fell as a result of lower unit sales and a slightly lower per-unit gross profit of $907. As far as CAF, CAF quarterly income grew by 19% -- Tom will talk more about that in a second -- to $76 million, largely as a result of a 14% increase in total managed receivables. I'll talk a bit about supply and mix of sales.","We do believe the decrease in the supply of used vehicles since 2008 has adversely impacted our sales over the last couple of years. Assuming current SAAR trends continue, we expect to see an improving supply situation, particularly in 0- to 4-year-old cars where we have historically had higher share. We believe that as supply rebounds, it will positively impact our business over the next year or 2.","For mix, during the quarter, sales of 5-year and older vehicles as a percentage of our total sales remained well above 25%. Year-over-year, sales of SUVs and trucks fell by about 2 points -- 2 percentage points this quarter and was offset by a similar increase in the percentage of compact and midsized vehicles sold.","I'll now turn the call over to Tom Reedy to talk about financing. Tom?","Thomas W. Reedy","Thanks, Tom. Good morning, everybody. You saw in the press release, CarMax Auto Finance continued to deliver strong results. CAF income grew $12 million or 19% compared to the second quarter fiscal 2012. This modestly outpaced the growth in our portfolio of average managed receivables, which increased 14% to more than $5.2 billion. Our interest margin after the provision for loan losses was up 16% due to that receivables growth plus the combination of the transition back to our pre-recession origination strategy, continued low funding costs and favorable loss performance.","We also realized a year-over-year reduction in expenses arising from operating efficiencies. The growth in managed receivables was largely driven by strong origination volumes over the course of fiscal 2012 and into early fiscal 2013, which were lifted by the expansion in CAF penetration over that period, increased average selling prices and CarMax sales growth. For the quarter, net penetration was 37%, down modestly compared to the second quarter of FY '12, and net loans originated in the quarter increased 7% year-over-year.","The allowance for loan losses grew by $13 million or 37% to $49.5 million. This increase reflects the shift in our portfolio back to a pre-recession origination strategy, as well as the growth in average managed receivables. Despite the change in credit risk, the allowance only increased 0.1% to 0.9% of average managed receivables, so our receivable loss performance remained very strong.","Regarding access to financing for our customers, it remains at historically high levels, with more than 85% of applications continuing to receive at least 1 approval from us or one of our partners. Third-party subprime providers accounted for about 14% of sales in the second quarter. This is a continuation of the trend we have seen throughout the year.","During the quarter, we also renewed the $800 million warehouse facility that expired in August. As you know, we maintain $1.6 billion of capacity, and the other $800 million facility expires in February of 2013. We continue to see a strong ABS market for bonds backed by auto receivables, and we feel good about the availability of funding in the current environment.","Now I'll turn it back to Tom.","Thomas J. Folliard","Thank you. I'll comment on SG&A and growth, and then we'll open it up for questions. We continued to ramp our infrastructure for growth during the second quarter. Given our store openings, our level of used unit comps and the speed of our ramp-up, the level of SG&A spending we've reported in the first half of this year is about where we expected to be. We remain pleased with the performance of our new stores.","During the second quarter, we opened 3 new superstores, and we plan to open 5 more during the second half of fiscal '13, including 3 in our third quarter: one in Des Moines, Iowa, which is a new market for us; one in Oxnard, California, which is our 10th store in the Los Angeles market; and the first of 2 stores we will open this year in our new Denver market.","Our Des Moines and Denver stores will be the next 2 of what we refer to as our next-generation model, the first of which we opened in February in Chattanooga. You will also note that in today's press release, we included 3 planned openings in existing markets for the second quarter of our next fiscal year in Houston, Sacramento and Frederick, Maryland.","With that, I'd like to open it up for questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question is from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets.","Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","A couple of quick items, hopefully. As your -- I guess, as the age mix has gotten a little bit older, Tom, are there certain vehicles that you're now retailing that maybe you would have wholesaled in the past?","Thomas J. Folliard","It's a little bit of a tricky question because the answer is yes, but not because we've changed our quality standards. So we are retailing an older mix. We've been talking about that for the -- I think the last 3 quarters or so where our mix of 5- to 10-year-old cars has gone up pretty significantly. But we have not lowered our quality standards at all. However, there are some cars that we would have wholesaled maybe because they needed a little bit more time or a little extra reconditioning to get them up to our standard that we are now shift -- that we have shifted over the last year to retail, and we've done quite well with that segment. So it is pulling a little bit away from wholesale volumes.","Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Got it. Any way to kind of size that impact?","Thomas J. Folliard","No, not really. I mean, I probably could, but I'm not -- I don't have the numbers right here.","Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Got it, okay. And then also, just in terms of the SG&A growth, I mean, I think you guys have done a good job prepping everybody for the rising SG&A as you kind of support the new store infrastructure. Can you give us an idea of how much of the SG&A growth might have been tied directly to the new store build and the pipeline that you're kind of building for future openings?","Thomas J. Folliard","Well, first, let me talk about the -- SG&A sequentially from first to second quarter was pretty flat. And when you look at it year-over-year, there's a bigger increase in the second quarter compared to last year than there was in the first. But that was probably more due -- that was more due to kind of an unusually low SG&A for a couple of items last year second quarter. So sequentially, it was pretty flat. If you think about SG&A on a cost-per-store basis, it's roughly $1 million to $1.5 million or maybe a little more per new store opened, so that's part of that ramp-up. When you see us getting ready to open more stores in this year than we did last and more in last year than we did the year before, that ramp-up includes approximately about $1 million to $1.5 million per store.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of John Murphy with Bank of America.","John Murphy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just one quick follow-up on this SG&A. I mean, Tom, as you look at the 10 stores that are opening this year and we look at them next year, I mean would you expect their SG&A sort of coverage or SG&A to gross to be sort of more normal? I mean, will they be fully ramped on an SG&A basis versus your gross profits next year?","Thomas J. Folliard","No. We've always talked about our ramp life of a store to be around 5 years. So it's not exactly linear, but it certainly does not get to, let's say, the chain average after 1 year. So there's no question that a new store for us in terms of SG&A efficiency on a per unit sold is significantly disadvantaged to the average of the chain. So as we roll more and more of these new stores into it, we do get the SG&A negative impact of new stores, but obviously, we believe it's the right decision long term. And these stores make a terrific return over time, but they have, I'd say, a bit of a slow ramp-up. We've always said it takes about a year before they get to breakeven, covering all of their opening costs. But in terms of if you really look at SG&A on a per-unit basis, it takes longer than that.","John Murphy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. That's very helpful. Then a second question about the used vehicle market, just more in general and what you're seeing. I mean, if you look at it, a new vehicle to a used vehicle pricing and assume that you get 0% financing on a new vehicle and you're paying 8% to 9% to finance a used vehicle, I mean, the equation seems like it's getting to a point where you may see some traditional used car buyers that would come into your stores tripping into buying a new vehicle. I\u2019m just curious if you're seeing that and how much pressure you think that's putting on volumes for you in general.","Thomas J. Folliard","Yes, we see it, and we've -- but we've always seen it. So we always see it on -- there's always some segment of car where that's true, particularly if manufacturers, at any given point in time, are running really aggressive financing programs. But if you look broadly at the average, the average new car is now over $30,000 and has been for most of the year, a number I'm a bit surprised by, to be honest with you. And the spread between the average new car sold and the average used car sold really hasn't diminished hardly at all because new cars continue to rise as well. But there is no question that there are some models, particularly with the financing piece, where if we have a very late model, whatever that car is, and you compare it to a new and you get 0.9% financing, some customers are making the decision to buy a new car. But that's always been true for us. All the way back to when we started the business in 1993, it's always been true on some segment of cars, depending what's going on with the manufacturers, how aggressive they're being with incentives, how aggressive they're being with financing and then, again, on a specific set of make and models. But broadly across the board, the environment really hasn't shifted very much.","John Murphy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then just lastly, for the other Tom, on CAF. I mean you talked to going back to pre-recession origination strategies here, and I'm assuming you're just meaning buying deeper into subprime, which I think you guys have been talking about. But then you talked about third-party subprime providers increasing their penetration from 7% last year to 14% of originations this year, so it sounds like third-party subprime providers are actually really what's growing in the subprime portion of your business. I'm just trying to understand. I mean, is CAF getting crowded out there in the subprime? Or what's going on?","Thomas W. Reedy","John, I wouldn't characterize CAF as doing any subprime. We historically approved a spectrum of credit that we got comfortable with throughout our history. During the recession, we dialed back on the lower end of that credit and, over the course of the last 2 years, have taken that back. So it's really -- CAF\u2019s just getting back to the credit that it had historically originated. The subprime partners, over the last 1.5 years or so, have started taking up a bigger portion of sales, partly because we've seen lower credit coming through the door. And I think if you look industry-wide, we've seen some data from the credit bureaus that would indicate the percentage of auto sales getting financed today, a higher portion is subprime and a lower portion is superprime than a year ago or so. But the biggest part of it is that those partners of ours increased their appetite for approving CarMax customers and, more importantly, making them attractive offers. So the offers that our subprime partners are making today are more attractive to the customers than they were 1 year, 1.5 years ago. And we're getting more of the subprime customers taking them up on those offers.","Thomas J. Folliard","Yes. And John, the change in the subprime for us, the 7% to 14% year-over-year, it's kind of in line with what we've seen over the last several quarters. And as Tom mentioned, the vast majority of that is not because we're seeing a dramatically different credit profile coming through the door but because our subprime lenders over time have gotten more and more comfortable with the CarMax origination channel. And as Tom said, they're giving both -- they're approving some more customers, but they're also giving better quality approvals, for example, lower down payment to existing customers that were already coming in.","John Murphy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So if we look at this increase from 7% to 14%, I mean, that accounts for the large majority of the same-store sales growth is really this increase in subprime loans going through.","Thomas J. Folliard","It does in this quarter. And as we have always said, our goal at CarMax is to make sure that every customer that comes in the door has a good chance to buy a car because we provide them access to financing, and we're happy to be able to help these customers. We're happy that we have providers that have worked with us over the years and continue to get more comfortable, as I said, with the origination channel. So although these deals are not as profitable as a regular deal, we\u2019re happy to do every one of them because we also believe that they're 100% incremental. Remember that a subprime customer at CarMax that gets approved through one of our partners, those partners don't even see that application until it's declined by all the other lenders. So at that moment, that customer, in our opinion, is about to leave the store, and they get this approval, and they're able to drive away with a high-quality car. And that's part of the reason why the -- a big reason why our partners have gotten more comfortable -- and they\u2019ve told us this -- is because of the quality of car that we provide, and that just means that our customer is more likely to have their car operate longer, and they're more likely to pay longer.","John Murphy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And then just lastly, the follow-up, and I promise this is the last one. That really does mean that this backlog of trade-ins and churn that you'll see from the new vehicle SAAR picking up is still to come. It's still on the come and actually hasn't really benefited you just yet.","Thomas J. Folliard","Oh, and I think that has absolutely nothing to do with the subprime. That's just straight math of the availability of 0- to 4-year-old used cars. I mean, the SAAR went from an average of 16.8 over 8 years down to as low as -- in 1 month, it was in the 9s. So as it continues to grow, you -- it's not an exact science. You can't just look out and say the supply is going to pick up by this much and therefore our sales will benefit because customers' behavior has changed. We're not sure about turn-in rates going forward, but we're absolutely convinced that as the SAAR continues to grow and the supply of 1-, 2-, 3- and 4-year-old used cars grows, that we will absolutely benefit. It's the segment that we've always over-performed with. When you look at our total share that we've reported over time of somewhere between 5.5% and 6%, if you broke that out by model years, we've historically done better in the 0 to 4 segment. That segment is not there in the volume it used to be, but it's certainly going to be coming back.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley.","Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","What levers do you have that you can pull on the wholesale business to improve results here and get that increase in the buy rates? I mean, do you have to adjust something, whether it be how much you're paying for these cars or how many cars you're getting on the wholesale side?","Thomas J. Folliard","We've always talked about wholesale being a balance between wholesale and retail. And if -- there's no question we could increase our buy rate and we could increase our volume, but our margin would go down. If we raise all of our offers by $500, I'm 100% sure we would buy a whole bunch more cars, but our margin would go down across the board by $500. So it's always a balancing act for us. 28% for the quarter is on a -- I think it's over the top of 30% last year. Although it's only 2 percentage points, I think it's around 6.5% change. 28% is still pretty high. We're pretty happy with 28%. We were down at 23% in the recession, so we still feel pretty pleased about it. We've talked about wholesale over the last few quarters being abnormally high. We've had massive increases in wholesale. Our wholesale business has doubled over 2 years. Believe it or not, we're pretty happy that our wholesale business is maintaining these really high volumes that we\u2019ve achieved over the last couple of years. So being down a couple of points and being able to maintain our margin and have a really -- what we consider a very strong buy rate, we're still -- we still feel pretty good about our wholesale business.","Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Understood. And are you seeing any impact at all from rental car companies aggressively de-fleeting over the summer in response to lower insurance business? Is that starting to make an impact on the market?","Thomas J. Folliard","No, we haven't seen that at all.","Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And finally, now that you have this very aggressive ramp of opening new stores, are there any levers that you can pull on the SG&A side to get these stores ramped up faster, either just doing things in bulk on the administrative side or something that maybe reduces that 5-year ramp rate to maybe 3 or 4 years?","Thomas J. Folliard","We're always trying to figure how to run our stores more efficiently, how to convert more customers that come through the door, how to lower our costs, how to lower our staffing. Those are the things that can shorten up the ramp rate. If sales pick up quicker, if we have a better environment, if the supply side of the business really drives extra comp sales, that would help with the ramp. But in general, even with that, we would still expect the store to grow out past its fifth year. And every year that a store grows, it continues to get better and better on an SG&A perspective. So there's not one button we could push that could take it from 5 down to 2 or 3. And it's really not 5. It's a lot longer than that because we've seen our stores grow past their fifth year. And even a 2% or 3% comp rate in the later years is a terrific leverage point on SG&A. And the last part is we are opening 10 stores this year and 10 to 15 next year, so we'll still see some ramp. But for the next 3 years, we've said 10 to 15 stores. So if we have a reasonably similar amount of openings year-over-year, you won't get that chunk of SG&A deleverage that we have by increasing the growth rate that -- like we have over the last 3 years.","Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Got it. So just to clarify, you expect a store to get up to like a normal corporate level run rate by year 5, but it may still grow above that. Is that the right way to think about it?","Thomas J. Folliard","Yes. Well, historically, we've grown into the fifth year, and then we've seen growth past that. And we don't -- we just don't have that many stores that are more than 10 years old but -- and then we had the recession knockdown, so it's really difficult to judge. But our expectation is our stores can continue to grow, although slower. They grow pretty quick from 0 to 5, slower from 5 to 10 and even a little slower past 10. But our belief is that our stores will continue to have some modest growth past their 10th year of life.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Sharon Zackfia with William Blair.","Sharon Zackfia - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","I guess I'm just curious as to the improvement in sales trends is pretty nice this quarter. I guess you mentioned conversion. I mean, is there -- I mean, what do you think has really changed in the business this summer? And then if you could comment on new stores, how they're doing so far. I know it's early. But I think it'd be helpful to know if they're kind of adhering to the old plan that I think was the 10-year-ago white paper or if there's kind of a new paradigm.","Thomas J. Folliard","Well, on the first question, I think our quarter -- our second quarter last year was negative 2 or negative 3. So we have seen an increase in conversion. There's no question that some of it is from the higher-quality offers of our subprime lenders, but I think our stores are doing a really nice job with the customer flow. And we continue to get benefits from training and development of our sales managers and our sales consultants, and we're very pleased with the results there. So all of our comp sales were from those 2 things. So we're pretty pleased with it for the quarter, as I said. In terms of the store and comparing it to the white paper, that's a difficult comparison because our profits on a per-car basis have changed so much since the white paper, and we have not updated it. So even if our stores were underperforming to model of sales, if they're performing at our current margin levels and you factor in the money we're making in CAF and wholesale, which wasn't in the original white paper, then from a financial standpoint, we could still deliver the returns that we expected at a lower sales level, which is one of the great things we've done, I believe, over the last couple of years of improving the CarMax business model is we can go into a lot of these markets with really high expectations, even if our sales expectations are lower. So when we've said that we're really pleased with our new store performance, we're going all the way back to when we restarted growth when we opened the 5 stores. And then -- I mean, I'm sorry, the 3 stores and then the 5 and then the 10 this year. When you put that group of stores together as a group, they're performing at or better than the rest of the chain.","Sharon Zackfia - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. And then I mean, as you look at the longer term as carmax.com becomes more important as kind of the leader into the business, I mean, are the stores -- do you expect them to continue to get kind of modestly smaller over time? Or I mean, what does the store look like 5 years from now?","Thomas J. Folliard","We've done -- I think we've actually done a pretty good job of like taking square footage out of our stores and being able to squeeze more out of them. But they're going to be sized based on the market that they're going into. Our next-generation store in Chattanooga was a little bigger. We put some more screens, some more technology. We had a little different customer experience in there. We had some customer segmentation in there. The square footage piece is not that expensive. And if it pays off, we would gladly do that going forward. But I'd say that it's an ever-evolving model for us, and we're just going to try to figure out what's the most efficient way to get the most sales out of each box, each square footage and each piece of acreage, which is actually the bigger chunk, because I think another thing we've been able to do over time is we'll go to a market and be able to build a CarMax on 5 acres, when before it might have -- we might have needed 15 if I'm going back 12 or 14 years ago. And so our ability to get it -- it\u2019s just equally as important for us to be able to get the A site, the best site in the best retail row. And we feel very good about the progress we've made there.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Simeon Gutman with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Unknown Analyst","It's Dan [ph] filling in for Simeon. I guess the first question, just wanted to kind of get your big picture thoughts on supply of late models. Obviously, mathematically, it looks like the population of nearly new maybe turning in the, say, like 1- to 2-year-old group. But if you look at the whole 1- to 6-year-old population, it doesn't seem like it's still there -- it's still not there yet. So I guess, separate from the math, which you already referenced, how does it feel in the marketplace? Is it any easier or about the same? Just kind of want to get your thinking there.","Thomas J. Folliard","Because it -- because the math actually matters and it takes time for it to flow into the system, you said it right. We have not seen a big movement in the supply just yet. But obviously, with the SAAR being in the 14.5 range now, if it stays and continues to grow, which we hope it does, then we'll see benefit in the next couple of years, 1 year or 2 years and especially 3 years out. But we just have to wait for that supply to come back. But if you're saying what does it feel like right now, if you look at what we've done over the last year is respond to what consumers have wanted, which is older cars. And as I mentioned in the opening, our mix of 5- to 10-year-old cars is north of 25%, up close to 30%. And that number doubled from a year prior to that. So that's where more of the supply is and that's where our customers have shown us that they want to buy more cars. Our hope is that as the supply comes back -- we've gotten better at that older segment. We've gotten better at reconditioning it. Our customers are more comfortable buying that car from us. As I said earlier, we have not lowered our quality at all. And we're hopeful that as the supply comes back, we'll be able to take advantage of the increased supply again in a segment that we've historically outperformed in and, at the same time, continue to maintain some of the momentum we've built in some of the older stuff.","Unknown Analyst","Right. And then hopefully just -- I guess kind of as a quick follow-up, just also want to get your thoughts on traffic. I think it was down last quarter. Obviously, in used cars, it's been, like you said, pretty good, which is generally good for you. So we were just hoping to see kind of like what's going on that changed that, maybe.","Thomas J. Folliard","I mentioned traffic was slightly down. The used car market is down. We buy Polk data. We look at Polk data constantly. We only have it through June. But through June, 0- to 6-year-old car market was down 8%; 0- to 10-year-old market was down by 1%. So there's that piece. Secondly, I think the economy is still pretty sluggish. With unemployment where it is and with consumer confidence where it is, I still think that, that's impacting our traffic. It's impacting the customers' willingness to go out and sign up for as long as a 6-year loan. So I still think we have that -- the kind of the economy hanging over our customer traffic.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Craig Kennison with Robert W. Baird.","Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Tom, you just mentioned the Polk data. Do you have that data for 7- to 10-year-old cars as well, just to clarify the impact on the older vehicles?","Thomas J. Folliard","Well, I've just said 0 to 6 was down 8%. This is through June, so this is actually -- it's missing 2 months of our quarter. And 0 to 10 was down 1%. So as I said, there's more supply still in that 5 to 10, 6 to 10, whatever. But the market and kind of our wheelhouse where our kind our sweet spot is, is still down pretty big.","Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","That's fair. And then discussion on the supply has been helpful. But could you talk about the Manheim index and used car prices in general and how a decline in that metric will affect both your retail business and your wholesale business? I'm not sure that everyone gets that.","Thomas J. Folliard","Well, the decline in -- at wholesale, the Manheim index is an indication of depreciation over the course of the year. And it's nothing new for us to have to deal with the depreciating car environment. It's actually -- we did it for a long, long time before we had the unusual circumstance after the recession where we dealt with an appreciating environment for a couple of years. So -- but the impact is, since the market is going down and we make market offers to our customers, it's going to impact generally our appraisal buy rate. I think that one of the reasons we saw our buy rate go down a couple of points this quarter, particularly compared to last year, is we've seen some moderating of wholesale pricing through the summer, some depreciation. So that's the biggest impact it has in our wholesale business. On our retail business, a customer who's trying to sell us their car, if they sell us their car and they're trying to buy another car, then they're more likely to buy a car from us. So you can make the correlation that if we're -- our buy rate is down a little bit, then there are a few less customers in there who would have bought a car from us because we didn't give them the offer that they expected. But again, 28% is a pretty high buy rate for us.","Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Yes, you bet. And then lastly, with Hurricane Isaac, did you lose any selling days in any stores due to the weather?","Thomas J. Folliard","We did. But like we've always said, it doesn't really matter over the -- by the end of the quarter. So -- and it was mostly in kind of south Florida and along -- we only have 1 store in Louisiana, Baton Rouge.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Matt Nemer with Wells Fargo Securities.","Joshua Dolin - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","It's Josh on for Matt. Can you give us an idea of what's going on with your web traffic and how that's trending? I know, last quarter, it was up kind of in the lower mid-teens. And maybe compare that to what's going on with decreased foot traffic. And any sense of why that's not converting over?","Thomas J. Folliard","Traffic was up again. I don't have the exact number on the website, but it's never connected. Our web traffic over the last few years has always grown at a much higher rate than our comp sales. And that's just the way consumers are behaving. The other big shift in consumer behavior, which obviously we're not the only ones seeing this, is mobile devices and iPads and touchscreens. And that traffic is now, I think, 30% of our total volume. Just a year ago, it was 10% to 15%. So we saw it go from 5% to 10% and up to 30%. So I think some of the change in our traffic obviously is the ease at which people can now go search things on a mobile device. So -- but again, we're real happy with the website. We're really happy with our -- with where we are with mobile, but we got a long way to go. We don't have an app out yet. We'll be doing that soon, and we expect that mobile devices and iPads and things of that nature will continue to become a bigger and bigger chunk of our traffic.","Joshua Dolin - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","All right. That's helpful. Continuing with online capabilities, can you give us an update of what's going on with EasyShop, where that's been expanded, how that program is working out for you?","Thomas J. Folliard","Sure. It's -- we currently have EasyShop available in 8 of our stores in North Carolina and Tennessee. And they are -- as we said, the main goal is to give consumers more ability to do more of their -- to complete more of their shopping experience from home. So whether it's filling out a credit app, initiating a transfer, paying for that transfer with a credit card, making an appointment, filling out a portion of their paperwork, all that stuff is working great as far as the customer is being able to complete that -- those components of the transaction. I expect we'll be rolling out parts or all of EasyShop to all of our stores over the next, say, 12 to 24 months. But it's still a little bit early, and it's still something that we have to get a read on for each of those different components and make sure that we roll it out effectively.","Joshua Dolin - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Sure. Are you seeing increased penetration in people using EasyShop in those markets?","Thomas J. Folliard","It's probably about flat over the last 6 months or so. I do need to correct. I said that the used -- the 1- to 6-year-old used car market was down 8 points. It was down 2, so I misspoke there. I apologize. And 0 to 10 was down 1. So both were down, but I misspoke on the magnitude of 0 to 6.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of James Albertine with Stifel, Nicolaus.","James J. Albertine - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Wanted to ask you on the competitive landscape. I'm not asking for market share. I know you don't provide it on a quarterly basis. But really wanted to get a sense for how you're thinking about the gap that, for the better part of the last 2 decades, you've created relative to the majority of your peers, right? We've had a market dislocation now. Late-model supplies have been disrupted obviously for the last -- the better part of the last 3 years. And in that time, technology across the board has been improving, and the industry, in some sense, has become more commoditized than it ever had been before. So as you're ramping growth within existing and new markets, what gives you comfort that you're maintaining, if not expanding, that gap you had, whether it's proprietary tools, technology, go-to-market strategies versus your peers across the board?","Thomas J. Folliard","Well, first and foremost would be our volumes. Our average store sells about 330 cars a month. The average new car dealer sells about 50 used cars a month. That number -- that gap really has not moved at all over the last 10 years. So if I just look at our volumes compared to whoever the competitor is in whatever market we're in, that gap really has not moved. We operate 23 of the 25 top volume used car stores in the United States and 43 of the top 50. And we're the #1 volume used car seller in every market that we operate in. So I feel like from just the numbers, it looks like customers are still choosing us over the competition. That being said, there's no question that the availability of information to consumers has moved dramatically over the last, let's say, 5 years. The availability of third-party tools for our competition to have access to has changed dramatically over the last 5 years, providing customers access to finance, providing dealers access to inventory management models and things of that nature. The reason, I think, that our competitive edge remains as strong as ever is it's not like we haven't been evolving and improving over that same time period. I feel like we're much better today at running this business than we were 5 years ago. We're more efficient. Our data that we've talked about that we continue to build on year-over-year is cumulative, and we continue to benefit from that. Our ability to leverage our inventory is unparalleled. We have 40,000 to 50,000 cars online at any given point in time. We've gotten better and better at transferring and moving those cars for our customers. We have a website that is dedicated to managing all 113 stores in the chain. And from a store perspective, or our customers' perspective, any car is available to them. Our ability to build new stores and to move employees in without having to retrain them because our systems were all designed from scratch. We don't buy any of it off the shelf. It continues to, I believe, become a bigger and bigger competitive advantage over time, so -- and we have initiatives in place to improve in all of those areas. So although there are tools available and we've seen some movement and, as you said, there's been a shift with the supply, I really believe that as we get these new stores open and as the supply comes back, we are poised to really take advantage of the advancements that we've made and our bigger positioning around the U.S. with more stores.","James J. Albertine - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","That's a great answer. And just as a quick follow-up to the subprime questions earlier, the increase in the third-party financing to 14% from 7%, just wanted to get your sense of where you see that targeted mix in a more normalized environment, be it this time next year if supply resurges or somewhere else down the road.","Thomas J. Folliard","Yes, sure. First, that's -- it's kind of flattish to last quarter, so this is not really out of line with what we would have expected in terms of the percentage. We don't have a targeted percentage. As I said earlier, every one of these deals is a deal that we want to do. What I'd really like to see happen -- because we're not uncomfortable with the volume of deals that we're doing. What I\u2019d really like to see happen over time, as I mentioned, with the supply coming back and with all the things I just talked about, that as our volumes come back, we\u2019re able to make it up on the other side. To me, if it's 14% and it goes down to 5% because the rest of our business grows dramatically, that would be fine. But if they both grew, that would be fine with me, too. So we don't have a targeted percent for that segment of our business. We're very pleased to be able to make a competitive offer to that customer.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I've got -- I want to start out with 2 questions, sort of marred in the details a bit on the other revenue line. The first relates to warranty penetration. Your warranty dollar number was up over $7 million, I guess pretty close to $0.03 a share year-on-year. It was the biggest increase you've had in quite a while. Any insight as to the drivers of better penetration? Was it pricing? Was it penetration of vehicles sold? Any other color would be great.","Thomas W. Reedy","Yes. Matt, there's a number of things going on in ESP. But I think the disconnect you're seeing is the math doesn't pencil out with -- does an increase in attach rate on ESP plus the growth in sales equal the same amount of growth in ESP? Our contracts with our ESP partners are based on performance, and we simply received a feedback from one of them this quarter. It's something that is not unusual, but it doesn't happen every quarter. And because of how the performance of claims has been over the last year, one of our partners gave us a rebate essentially.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Roughly had...","Thomas J. Folliard","A portion [ph] of it is absolutely better penetration. We\u2019ve had very strong ESP performance.","Thomas W. Reedy","Yes. We're up with penetration a couple of points.","Thomas J. Folliard","So it's the ESP penetration, the increased sales volume and the rebate.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","How material was the rebate?","Thomas W. Reedy","It's a couple of million.","Thomas J. Folliard","It's a couple million dollars of the $7 million.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. So we should look on an ongoing basis for a growth rate that more approximates the growth rate in used car revenue, presumably?","Thomas J. Folliard","Correct.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then you've obviously gotten a couple of questions on subprime. I guess that line item continues to grow year-on-year. But you're, I guess, a quarter away from cycling the beginning of the pop in subprime penetration. So would it be your expectation that once you start the cycle, this increase that, that line item kind of levels out for you? And if you could just remind us of the economics of subprime for you on that third-party financing fee line item.","Thomas W. Reedy","Matt, I think you're right. We have no indication that our partners have -- will have any different appetite than they currently are doing today, either positive or negative. I think we're in a comfortable spot. So as we start rolling over that change in behavior, I think we should see it be more consistent. And as far as the economics of subprime, as you know, we pay them a fee or we sell those loans at a discount. It's about $1,000.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And just also by way of reminder, is there any difference in the intrinsic characteristics of the cars that get sold to subprime customers that would help compensate for that? Or do they look like more or less cars that would be sold through a higher-quality credit?","Thomas W. Reedy","Overall, I don't think there's anything that differentiates them too much. We see some small variances, but nothing worth talking about.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. And then finally, there have been a couple of questions about the tools available in the environment and the increased impact of online on the business, broadly speaking. I guess, the one area I would like want bore down into a little bit is the theme of price transparency and think about that both from the sell side, that is your customers' perception of value, and also the buy side in terms of the deals that you're getting when you're buying cars through the wholesale business. As you look at your pricing versus the competition, and this is something, I guess, that we will have to try to measure on your own, are you seeing any material difference in the way you're coming to market from that perspective, assuming that your competition, which historically was not wired at all over the past few years, probably has -- whereas you were over the past few years, probably has developed somewhat greater capacity to at least be thoughtful of that?","Thomas W. Reedy","Yes. I mean, that's a very difficult thing to figure out when everybody is negotiating everything except for us. So despite the fact that there's more availability of data for consumers, at the end of the day, when you end up at the average car dealer, they'll negotiate the price, they'll negotiate the financing, they'll negotiate the trade, they'll negotiate the warranty, none of which we do. So it's still very difficult to make price comparisons to prices that aren't really the price.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Rod Lache with Deutsche Bank.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just had a couple of follow-up questions. I was hoping you can maybe give us a sense of when do you think the supply of vehicles improved for you, just sort of adjusted for the weighted average age of the vehicles that you sell. Because I would think that the supply of 1- and 2-year-old vehicles will improve first, so that's one factor. And then also related to that, you commented that you're spending a little bit more time reconditioning as you're selling more \"greater than 5 year old\" vehicles. How does the reconditioning costs get affected as the mix kind of normalizes?","Thomas J. Folliard","So on the first question, the -- again, it's not something we would project. I would just say over the next 1 to 4 years, we're going to see those volumes and the supply pick up. Because the thing we don't know is how significantly has consumer behavior changed in terms of how quickly they trade out of their car. I think a lot of that behavior is driven by how comfortable people feel about the economy going forward. So it\u2019s just -- it's too big a variable to try to say, on a linear basis, we expect the supply to come back in a predictable manner to, I think, the level that you're asking. So I just feel really good about the supply coming back over the next few years, but it's, \"Is it 1? Is it 2? Is it 3?\" It's really hard to say. But again, just feel really good about the fact that it is picking up, and we do expect the supply to come back. And your second question was\u2026","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","The second question is you said that -- I think you said that you're spending more money reconditioning now, that 25% to 30% of your sales are these more than 5 year olds?","Thomas J. Folliard","Yes. So on a gross basis, an 8-year-old car is going to need more reconditioning dollars to bring it up to our quality standard than a 2-year-old car. That has always been true for us. It will always be true to us. So our volume of cars in 5- to 10-year-old has gone up, and therefore, our reconditioning dollars have gone up. But when we look at our savings, we have to mix-adjust those savings to understand if we're really getting them. So when we think of it that way, we're still getting the savings that we talked about earlier. It's just that from the starting point of where we measured those savings, we would obviously be starting from a lower point if it was a 1- or 2-year-old car with, say, 10,000 miles on it compared to an 8-year-old car with 90,000 miles on it. So again, we just have to mix-adjust our reconditioning when we're thinking about savings. But when you look at total gross reconditioning dollars, as our mix has shifted older, those dollars have gone up.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Right. But that\u2019s going to normalize at some point.","Thomas J. Folliard","By the way, that doesn\u2019t impact our ability to sell that car or our profits.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Right. And my question is more along the lines of looking forward over the next, let's say, 2 years or so. Wouldn't the mix normalize a little bit more? And wouldn't that be another opportunity in terms of bringing the overall reconditioning dollars down?","Thomas J. Folliard","Not really. Because again, all the reconditioning needs to be mix-adjusted on a year-by-year basis. So although the gross dollar would come down, as you said, that's not really a driver of our ability to sell the car or -- I mean, it is overall. But I'd just tell you, we expect to spend more dollars on an older car, and we always will expect that.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then just lastly, obviously, there's some pace of growth that you need in order to avoid the SG&A deleveraging, and it depends on the pace of your store growth and wholesale trends and other things like that. I was hoping you might be able to update us on where you think that is roughly today.","Thomas J. Folliard","Well, in general, in the past, we have always said mid- to high-single digit comps can start to get some leverage in a ramp-up growth mode. We're still in a ramp-up growth mode. We will be again next year. And look, we've only given guidance out for growth for the next 3 years. If we got to a stable growth number where we build roughly the same number of stores but the base of the existing stores increased, then you would see SG&A leverage come quicker. But all we've talked about is the next 3 years for now, so we'll see.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Clint Fendley with Davenport.","Clint D. Fendley - Davenport & Company, LLC, Research Division","I'm just wondering. Generally, given the seasonality in your business, generally, we have seen the SG&A flex down in the third quarter. I'm wondering, just should that change this up -- for the upcoming quarter given the plans to open 3 new stores in new markets in the quarter?","Thomas J. Folliard","Yes. We're not going to give any guidance out on SG&A, Clint, sorry.","Clint D. Fendley - Davenport & Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay, okay. I guess going back a little bit to the previous question around some of the SG&A per retail unit, and I know you've said mid- to high-single digits could potentially keep that number flat. How much would that change if you were to go, say, from 10 new stores per year possibly up to 15 or so? Or should we expect a big change in that?","Thomas J. Folliard","Well, we've only given guidance for the next 3 years, and it's 10 to 15. But it all would depend on how many stores are in the base. And there's a lot of variables in there, how many stores are in the base, what are comp sales over the next several years, how big an impact do we get from the supply stuff we've talked about. Comps are a beautiful thing on SG&A. So I mean, at 15% comps, we could build as many stores as we wanted probably and still get leverage.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Bill Armstrong with CL King & Associates.","William R. Armstrong - CL King & Associates, Inc., Research Division","To what extent -- and I'm not sure if you can determine this, but to what extent might subprime growth be driven by the fact that you do have an older mix of vehicles in your inventory and in your sales mix and then that might be attracting -- just naturally attracting more -- a higher percentage of subprime customers.","Thomas J. Folliard","I think that has very little to do with what's happened because the spike we saw at the last quarter -- I mean, I'm sorry, the spike we saw in the third quarter of last year, we were just really moving the inventory at that time. And as we said, it's not that our customer flow -- there's no -- it's true that our credit is down slightly. If you've just looked at our, let's say, our Beacon score through the door, but it's not down enough to explain the change. Most of the change is, as we've said, our providers getting more and more comfortable with the CarMax origination channel and making better quality offers to the customers that were already showing up at the store.","Operator","Your next question as from the line of Efraim Levy with S&P.","Efraim Levy - S&P Equity Research","What do you see in terms of mix for trucks and SUV share?","Thomas J. Folliard","We mentioned that our mix of trucks and SUV were down about 2 points year-over-year, and that was offset by an increase in compacts and subcompacts, up about 2 points.","Efraim Levy - S&P Equity Research","And the impact on profitability on a shift like that, is that meaningful?","Thomas J. Folliard","It's not. There's no impact at all.","Operator","Your next question as from the line of David Whiston with Morningstar.","David Whiston - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Just a long-term capital allocation question for you. I think clearly the best use of cash is to keep growing the store base. But it is there ever a profit environment and a macroeconomic  environment where the board would be comfortable enough to do a share buyback to at least offset option issuance while also growing the store base?","Thomas J. Folliard","As we've said before, we understand our position. We're pleased with all the improvements that we've made to the business model over the last few years, and we are generating cash at a faster rate than we can spend it building stores. And also, as we've said before, all options are on the table. So we continue to look at what we think the best use of capital is in the short term, taking into account what our long-term goals are. But we've always said we think the best use of capital is to continue to build stores, but in terms of a share buyback or dividends or any other use of -- any other traditional use of capital, we continue to evaluate each of them. And if we have something to report, we'll tell you.","Thank you. And seeing no further questions, I want to thank all of you for joining us, and thanks for your support and interest.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the first quarter fiscal year 2013 conference call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I will now turn the conference over to Katharine Kenny.","Katharine W. Kenny","Good morning. Thank you for joining our fiscal 2013 first quarter earnings conference call. On the call with me today, as usual, are Tom Folliard, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Tom Reedy, our Executive Vice President and CFO.","Before we begin, let me remind you that our statements today regarding the company's future business plans, prospects and financial performance are forward-looking statements that we make pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are based on management's current knowledge and assumptions about future events that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. In providing projections and other forward-looking statements, the company disclaims any intent or obligation to update them.","For additional information on important factors that could affect these expectations, please see the company's annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 29, 2012, filed with the SEC.","[Operator Instructions] Tom?","Thomas J. Folliard","Thank you, Katharine. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. Used unit comps for the first quarter were flat compared to last year. Excluding appraisal-only traffic, we believe our traffic was somewhat lower than last year, but we are pleased that the continued strength of our overall execution allowed us to maintain our solid per-unit gross profit for both used and wholesale vehicles.","Our focus on new store growth continues to gain momentum. In the first quarter, non-comp stores drove our overall 3% growth in used units. Total used vehicle gross profit grew by 3%, and used vehicle gross profit per unit was similar to last year's strong first quarter at $2,221. Overall, appraisal traffic grew, but wholesale unit sales decreased by 2%. This was largely due to 3 factors: extremely difficult comparisons in the last 2 first quarters of 52% and 32% growth; a slightly lower buy rate; and a shift in the calendar that resulted in one less Tuesday, which is one of our auction days. Excluding this calendar shift, we estimate wholesale units would have been flat to last year.","Our wholesale gross profit per unit declined somewhat from our all-time high of over $1,000 last year, but at $980, represents the second highest in the company's history. CAF quarterly income continues to be a strong contributor growing by 8% to $75 million. During the quarter, sales of 5-year and older vehicles as a percentage of our total sales remained at historic highs, above 25%. Sales of SUVs and trucks remained above the same as a percentage of our total quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. As we've discussed before, our mix of vehicles will continue to vary based on consumer demand.","I'll now turn it over to Tom to talk about CAF. Tom?","Thomas W. Reedy","Thanks, Tom. Good morning, everybody. CAF income was up $5 million or 8% compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2012, and our portfolio of average managed receivables grew 16% to more than $5 billion. Growth in earnings lagged growth of the portfolio due to the year-over-year increase in the loss provision. While we experienced continued positive loss performance in the first quarter this year, we're up against a tough comparison.","Remember, loss experienced after resulted in the provision being a credit in Q1 of last year.  As for favorability in the loss provision in both periods, income growth would have more closely resembled growth in the managed receivables. Increase in managed receivables was largely driven by strong origination volumes over the course of FY '12 and into FY '13, which were lifted by growth in CAF penetration, increased average selling prices and CarMax sales. CAF penetration grew over the past year as we have moved back to a pre-recession origination strategy and taken volume back from third-party lenders. As you may recall from our prior conversations, this was always our plan. We started taking this volume back in early fiscal '12, and by January of this year, had transitioned to retaining it all. During the first quarter, CAF financed 37% of retail vehicle sales versus 34% in the prior year period. And our loans originated increased 14% versus the first quarter of fiscal 2012.","The move to a pre-recession strategy was also apparent in allowance for loan losses, which increased $12 million or 36% to $46.6 million. The increase is not a reflection of any deterioration in performance. Adjusted for changes in the underlying credit mix, receivable performances continued to improve.","Access to financing for our customers continues to be very strong with more than 85% of applications receiving at least one approval. Third-party subprime providers accounted for about 16% of sales in the first quarter, a level similar to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, and that compares with 8% in the last year's first quarter.","We typically experience our highest subprime volume in the fourth quarter due to tax refund season. However, this year originations by our subprime lenders ramped in Q4 and remained relatively strong through Q1. As I mentioned last quarter, we are seeing some deterioration in the credit quality of applicants, but the majority of the increase is the result of our subprime partners providing more attractive offers to our customers.","You may have noticed that unused capacity in the warehouse facility was down about $350 million at quarter end. Since then, we priced and closed our second public ABS deal of 2012 sized at $940 million.","I'll now turn it back from to Tom to wrap up.","Thomas J. Folliard","Thank you, Tom. I'll talk about new stores for a minute then we'll open it up for questions. First, since resuming our growth, our new stores in aggregate are performing slightly above our sales expectations, and we are very excited about our store opening plans over the next several years. As you know, during the first quarter, we opened 2 new stores -- 2 stores in new markets, Lancaster, Pennsylvania and Bakersfield, California. In June, we also opened a third store in our Nashville market and our first store in Fort Myers, Florida. You will also note that in today's press release, we included 3 planned openings in new markets for the first quarter for our next fiscal year in Columbus and Savannah, Georgia and in Harrisonburg, Virginia. Harrisonburg will be the pilot for our updated small store concept.","And with that, we will open it up for questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of John Murphy of Bank of America.","John Murphy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","As we look at these used unit volumes, which were flat year-over-year after a quarter of positive growth, how much of that segment then would you attribute to the lack of supply versus lack of demand? And on the demand side, are you seeing any shift away from used into new? Or is that not really what's going on?","Thomas J. Folliard","It's a variety of factors, and it's really difficult for us to say that there's a shift from used to new. But the lack of supply is not just -- it has multiple impacts on our business. One, we have historically performed -- kind our sweet spot has been 1- to 3-year old cars, and obviously, there are less of those available. You've seen that with our mix of our inventory shifting towards overstock. But the other part is there's just been this appreciation across all segments in the wholesale business that have caused this really high retail. So I believe it's having some impact on our sales. I also think that the weak economy and high unemployment rate continues to be a drag on the consumer.","John Murphy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And as new stores open up, is there a higher cost associated with sourcing the inventory for those stores? In other words, how much of a difference is there between average gross profit per unit in a newly opened store versus one that's been up and running for a while?","Thomas J. Folliard","Our average profits, we manage them pretty consistently. And it's not that there's a big difference in the newer stores, but they're obviously starting off at a much lower sales rate, and they're carrying a much heavier load of SG&A.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Craig Kennison of Robert W. Baird.","Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","On the advertising program you guys have, how satisfied are you with the return on investment? And just how effective do you think that advertising program is?","Thomas J. Folliard","I wish we can manage our advertising better than we can. We're a firm believer that we need to continue to build our brand. Obviously, we wish we got a little more traffic in the quarter than we did. But advertising is not just what we spend on TV but also our strategy around the Internet, around paid searches and our listing, where we list our cars with Cars.com and AutoTrader.com and other listing agents. So it's been very dynamic over the last several years as we shifted lots of dollars towards the Internet. And we believe we're making a solid investment in advertising. We believe we're building our brand. And we believe, over the long run, advertising, obviously all that we're spending will pay off.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Nagel of Oppenheim.","Brian W. Nagel - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","So the question -- just on expenses, if we look at here in Q1, expense growth was roughly muted given the accelerating unit expansion you're experiencing. So the question I have is that -- should we expect expense growth to pick up as we move through 2012 here and as the unit growth picks up further as well?","Thomas J. Folliard","Well, a lot of it is going to be driven, Brian, by whether or not we get stronger comp sales. I mean, unless you're just referring to growth expenses, the majority of the difference year-over-year is related to new store growth.","Brian W. Nagel - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","So I guess -- yes, so if I'm looking just at that piece, how should we think about the cadence of that component of your expense through 2012? In other words, so you have 2 centers, 2 stores here in Q1. If you opened a large number, would there be higher expenses then associated with that?","Thomas J. Folliard","Well, of course, there's going to be higher expenses with more openings. When you look at it on a year-over-year basis, we opened up 5 last year. We'll open 10 this year. But we're also prepping for between 10 and 15 the following year. So yes, you're going to see some more expenses as it relates to growth. We haven't guided around that specifically by the quarter, but you would expect to spend more money in the year when you're building more stores.","Thomas W. Reedy","Yes, Brian, if you look at this quarter year-over-year, we're up about $12 million. And about $10 million of that is due to the SG&A in new stores and all the things that go around supporting our growth initiatives, things like subsidy preopening, relocation, et cetera. So the lion's share of that increase is due to new locations. Obviously, as we grow comps as well, sales commissions will go up, and you'll see SG&A climb from that perspective, too.","Brian W. Nagel - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Got it. Maybe a quick follow-up. On subprime, it was another -- it was a decent driver of your sales here in Q1. I know you addressed, to some extent, this in your prepared remarks. But of course, we saw a strong subprime business in the fourth quarter. I think you had commented or you talked about that some of that was driven by -- it's kind of a seasonal strong business, but you're persistent in Q1. I mean, is there something shifting with that subprime business now that we're going to see that to be a contributor to your business throughout the year?","Thomas W. Reedy","I think as we've talked about it, there has been a shift in the behavior of our third-party lenders. We've kind of given more attractive offers to our customers because they become more comfortable with the CarMax origination channel. They've seen better performance in our portfolio, and they're willing to go out there and give our customers more attractive offers. What we thought -- if you look at fourth quarter versus first quarter this year, as I mentioned, the -- coming out of the fourth quarter last year, we did see a step-up in their activity, and that continued into the first quarter. And if you take a look back at them -- FY '10 and FY '11, what we saw was about a 1-point drop in Q4 versus the Q1 subprime penetration. And this year, it was relatively flat. So we did see a step-up in their activity, and it continued in the first quarter. As far as going forward, that's going to depend on our partners' experience. But at this time, we have no reason to believe that there's any reason it should change.","Thomas J. Folliard","And the only thing I'll add there, Brian, is you know how our credit flows, and the customers who qualify with these providers have gone through every other credit channel in our store. And at that moment, they're about to leave without buying a car, so we're pretty convinced that this is almost 100% incremental business. And because of the fact that we subsidize them, because of the fact that customers have access to any piece of inventory at CarMax, I think we're giving these folks a fantastic deal. And if our lenders continue to get more comfortable with the experience they have with this origination source, then it's fine with us if they continue to offer more credit to our customers.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Sharon Zackfia of William Blair.","Sharon Zackfia - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","I wanted to talk through a couple of the things that are perhaps within your own jurisdiction. So obviously, comps are composed of traffic and conversion. And so can you walk us through maybe any initiatives or thought processes on improving one or the other? And I'm also curious as to whether or not you're seeing your web traffic decelerate. I'm wondering essentially if consumers are kind of opting out of the traffic because they're not happy with the inventory or the pricing or something like that.","Thomas J. Folliard","So I'll first talk about overall traffic and conversion and the things that we're doing to try to improve both. We're constantly tweaking our advertising program and trying to figure out what the right mix is of spending on TV and spending on the Internet and spending on radio. We have tried to manage that along with units sold so that we're not overspending related to the number of cars that we're selling. With flat comps, we're going to manage that down a little bit. If comps went up, we'll probably spend a little bit more. But in terms of the mix of advertising, I feel we're pretty comfortable with it. We have a new ad agency, new in the last year or so. We just came out with a brand new set of [Audio Gap] have a new campaign called Start at CarMax. We're very pleased with how that came out. I think with any advertising program like that, you're going to see the results over a longer period of time, not so much on a short period of time. In terms of execution in the stores, I mean, pretty much everything we're working on is to try to improve our conversion. When we're trying to take costs out of reconditioning, that's to improve our conversion and improve the offer to the consumer and improve quality. We've talked lots about improved training programs in the stores and training and development for not just our sales consultants but our sales managers as well in our stores. We've upgraded our on-boarding process, and we're bringing in a new sale consultant on board. We're providing much more of an extensive program than we have in the past because at the end of the end of the day, it's still a sales job. You still have to build forward with the customer. You still have to overcome objections. I feel like we're making some good progress there. I mentioned in my opening remarks that our traffic was down slightly. When you subtract out appraisals, we've said that appraisal-only volume has really spiked. And you've seen it in our numbers, particularly in wholesale, over the last couple of years. And so for the first quarter, if you took that out, despite the fact that traffic was down slightly, our conversion would have been up slightly. But if there is no one thing, no one button you can push to change conversion, I think it's something we'll be working on for as long as we're in business. And the last question you asked was about web traffic. I'll let Tom give you the update there.","Thomas W. Reedy","Yes. Web traffic continues to be up year-over-year, and comp market is up in kind of the middle teens -- lower middle teens.","Sharon Zackfia - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Is that consistent with the trends you were seeing in web traffic throughout last year? Or is it decelerating?","Thomas W. Reedy","I wouldn't -- it's consistent with last year. There's no difference there.","Thomas J. Folliard","We continue to see growth in web traffic throughout.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli of RBC Capital Markets.","Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Question about wholesale. I mean, I understand the difficult comparisons. I understand the calendar shift. All that makes sense to me. But 2 questions, I guess. One, why would you have a lower buy rate given the way you run that program? And two, are we at the point where you would expect wholesale units to roughly track used retail units?","Thomas J. Folliard","Well, first, the difficult comparison is worth rementioning because going up 52% and then 32% means that our volume of wholesale doubled in 2 years in the same quarter, and we were able to deliver that same volume. The lack of a Tuesday is significant. It's a couple of percentage points, and we think we would have been flat had we had that extra Tuesday. I have no idea if we're at a point where they'll track. They happen to track this quarter. We've said all along, we thought that both the margin was somewhat unsustainable and that those -- the growth that we've seen in wholesale, we didn't expect to continue. And we have said that we believe over time that they'll, in general, move together, and I still believe that. I wouldn't take this quarter and say because they pretty much exactly matched up that we're going to see that going forward. There's too many other variables involved. And the other question you asked on buy rate, remember, we could have bought at 40% if we wanted. But our margins would have dropped the whole bunch because the only way you can do that is make higher offers. And since we don't know which ones we were or weren't going to buy, we'd have to make higher offers across the board. So if we raised all of our offers by $500, I'm sure our buy rate would have been significantly better, but our margin also would have also been much lower. So there's always a balancing act. There's probably no -- we're always trying to optimize it, but there's probably no exact right answer to that question.","Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","So what was the buy rate this quarter then and what did that compare to?","Thomas J. Folliard","It was only -- it's only down slightly. I mean, we've been running around 30%, and we were down, I think, 0.5 point or 1 point. So it's not like it's a big number.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Matthew Fassler of Goldman Sachs.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Kind of a 2-part question. Sharon asked you about some of the controllables related to traffic among other things. Just if you could talk a bit to the diagnostics of why you think traffic in particular is under pressure and where do you think the supply issue is something that shows up on the traffic side or if it typically shows up in conversion. Is there a function of people looking for the kind of car and not finding it? Is that supply dynamic kind of spreading, if you will, into traffic? And then a second -- or the second part of the question, if you will, this is the third or fourth quarter in a row where your ASPs have outperformed the Manheim index for the comparable period. So you're up more than the index, which is now under pressure. I'm sure there could be lots of reasons for that related to mix, but if you could shed some light on your pricing trend versus the market, that would be great.","Thomas J. Folliard","That was a long question, Matt. First one on traffic, we don\u2019t get too wrapped up in one quarter of traffic being slightly down. I talked earlier about advertising being a long journey. And we have continued to spend, and we've continued to invest in both our TV and our radio and our Internet advertising and search engine advertising and continuing to develop our website. And another driver of traffic is just continuing to give a great experience to the customer. When they walk in the door, still our biggest source of customers when we ask comes from word of mouth, and we think our stores are doing a great job there. So we think we're doing all the right stuff. I think -- you asked about supply being a traffic driver. Yes, I think it has some impact. If historically we -- as I said, our sweet spot has been more in the 1- to 3-year old cars. There's a lot less of those cars out there available. I talked about the fact that the lack of supply has driven our prices up. And you mentioned that in part 2 of your question. Our margins really haven't moved that much. If you look at it, $100 or $200 where as our average retail. If you go back to November of '08, it has gone up about $3,000. That's actually a direct result of the lack of supply. So yes, I think it has some effect. I think some consumers look at pricing and just decide to not get out there and buy right now. And I think until we see some movement in the supply and the SAAR gets back up to historical levels, then we're probably going to be looking at this for a little while.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And as you think about your pricing versus the market, is your relationship to the market pretty much where it\u2019s been?","Thomas J. Folliard","Yes, I haven't seen that. And we don't compare to that. So I couldn't give you an answer on why we're different than the index. And I don't know if the -- their index is over a broader set of inventory compared to what our index is.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of James Albertine of Stifel, Nicolaus.","James J. Albertine - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Very quickly, I just wanted to touch on sort of the new store productivity. You called out -- I think you mentioned some details in the prepared remarks. But considering the lack of the late model supply and that if you look at new store productivity over time, actually it's been improving. Is there something that's changed from the cost standpoint? So I had seen an analysis that goes back to -- way back to 2003, so maybe asking if you can provide an updated sort of look at what the new store investment sort of budget is going forward and how it's changed pre- and post-recession?","Thomas J. Folliard","Yes. It probably -- it hasn't really changed that much in total, again, because there's lots of different variables in there. If you go back to pre-recession and what we would spend on a combination of the land and building, those numbers really haven't moved dramatically when you size the land and the building and max it out to what we were doing before. So for the same-size building, similar piece of land in a similar-priced market, our prices are going to be -- the cost of building a store is going to be pretty close. What has changed is our profitability of the company and profitability per car sold. So kind of the sales hurdle required to deliver a good return is lower than it used to be. And when I talk about our new stores performing slightly above their sales expectation, obviously, when we decide on an investment and we build a store, we expect it to sell a certain amount of cars and then deliver the right amount of profitability to deliver return. And the point we're making in the prepared remarks was that we have restarted growth going back 3 years ago. We opened the 3 stores that were already sitting there and built, Cincinnati, Dayton and Augusta. We opened 5 stores last year and 3 stores this year. So that's 11 stores that we've opened since coming out of the recession. And just as a group, they're slightly above our sales of expectations, which -- obviously our sales expectations are built around what we need to sell to deliver a return.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman of Credit Suisse.","Simeon Gutman - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Latching on to an earlier question, I think Brian asked regarding subprime. If comps were flat but the subprime penetration went way up, I'm trying to figure out what that means for what's happening at the prime or semi-prime levels as far as volume growth and then if there's anything to diagnose about the consumer in that segment.","Thomas W. Reedy","I think as you kind of articulated, Matt, pretty straightforward. And as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we are seeing credit quality a little bit down through the door and our Tier 1 approval rate, meaning CAF, is a bit down from last year. So subprime is picking up the slack. And so we are seeing some pressure there.","Thomas J. Folliard","But we're still delivering. When a customer walks in the door, more than 85% of our customers are having access to credit, and that's across the board, Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3. As I mentioned earlier, we are very proud of what we're able to do for the subprime customer. I think that nowhere do you get a better deal than you do at CarMax if you haven't followed that credit profile. And obviously, we would like to do better with Tier 1 and Tier 2. I talked about a lot of the factors around why we think sales were a little slow for the quarter or flat for the quarter. And I think those variables are still there. We need to see the economy pick up. We need to see unemployment move down. We need to see some more movement in the SAAR, and it's going to take some time.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rod Lache of Deutsche Bank.","Dan Galves - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","It's Dan Galves in for Rod. I just wanted to ask about the used retail margin per unit. It came down throughout fiscal 2012 each quarter and then jumped back up to basically year-ago levels in Q -- in this quarter. What do you attribute that growth back to last year's levels? And then second question on CAF. The net interest margin seemed to decline a bit in the previous quarter, back up this quarter to pretty high levels again. How do you account for that? And what are you seeing in the current securitization market in terms of cost of funding?","Thomas J. Folliard","I'll talk about margins, and Tom can talk about the interest margin question. But our margins have been relatively consistent. Sometimes -- when you look at our margin, I know we're down $20. And I've said all along, we can't manage margins that closely. So if we're within $20 or $50, it's pretty flat. And this quarter was, for us, pretty flat to last year. And first quarter is historically a pretty strong margin quarter for us. So we didn't really look at the year and say that -- and feel like our margins had been declining throughout the year. They've been pretty close.","Dan Galves - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So there's some seasonality there?","Thomas J. Folliard","There has always been a little seasonality around margin. And Tom will talk about interest margin.","Thomas W. Reedy","Dan, I can talk to interest margin. If you remember, the interest margin is the combination of the APR, our funding costs and market influences, which drive kind of both of those. And we don't control the funding costs. And APR, we're going to do what the market takes. As we mentioned, we have been taking back volume that we used to pass off to our third-party lenders. And that volume is at lower credit volume, thus at higher APRs. So that's active there. You've seen some impact in rising APRs over time because it's going to take a while to get through the system. But at the same time, we've been aggressive in making sure that we're providing good offers to our high-FICO, high-credit customers. And so there's some offsetting factors going on there. As far as the securitization market, we just -- as I said, we priced the deal a couple of weeks ago. It went as good as can be, probably stronger than the past deal. Cost of funding is priced 5 basis points tighter if you take a weighted average spread on the deal. So the average coupon on the bond is about 1.03%, something like that. So still very strong. Still seems like there's a lot of access to the market. We went out with $750 million deal and ended up pricing a $940 million deal with tighter spreads.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, got you. And there's no help you can really give us on kind of net interest margin going forward, whether it's up from this quarter's level or down, it's just tough to call?","Thomas W. Reedy","It is tough to call because, as I said, there's a lot of moving pieces, and we're just going to try to optimize what's best for CarMax over the long run.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Clint Fendley of Davenport.","Clint D. Fendley - Davenport & Company, LLC, Research Division","A question here on the wholesale. I'm wondering, for the 10 new stores that you're planning to open this year, how many you would anticipate would be wholesale sites? And I'm wondering, if a new store also serves as a wholesale site, what is the typical timing for when you would begin running the auctions after a store opening and just any incremental costs involved in that.","Thomas J. Folliard","Yes. I don't know off the top of my head of the 10 that we're opening how many will have auctions in them. We don't run auctions at any of our satellite stores. So if you look at the mix of stores for the year, if you take out the satellites, in terms of the ones that will run auctions, when we're looking at going into a new market, we factor in wholesale as one of the factors that we use to determine how much land we need to buy, how big a building we need to buy. So it's all built in to the economics. When we talk about our CapEx plan for a year, we're factoring in what our wholesale capacity needs are when we're going and building new stores. And we only run auctions at about 55% to 60% of the locations that we have, and we shift the other cars from, say, a satellite store to a hub store. In terms of when does a new store start running an auction, it all depends on its volume. It all depends on how quickly they buy wholesale cars. Oftentimes, we'll start an auction in a new location by running once a month. And then as the volume picks up, we'll go to every other week and then ultimately get to weekly in the sales. So we're pretty analytical about it. We're well aware of what the shipping costs are to move from one to another, and we also don't want to let cars sit around for too long. So there is no exact answer. It's very much dependent on volume. But as I said, when we're -- as we're building these stores, the fact that we run an auction and that we need acreage to have these cars is factored into our decision making.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt Nemer of Wells Fargo Securities.","Joshua Dolin - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","It's Josh on for Matt. As we look at the stores that are going to be rolling out for the next 12 months, can you give us any color on what store of the future feature is going to be carried out to those and which stores will have them or how many will have them?","Thomas J. Folliard","Yes. I think our -- the next set of stores that will be what we call next-gen, one will be in Des Moines, and 2 in Denver. We have Fort Myers and Naples also coming this summer. Those did not get the package because of the long build time. And the -- but a couple of important things to note, a lot of the things that we hope to be able to learn, we think, are transferable back into the existing chain without spending a whole bunch of capital. So there's some technology advancements in the stores, and some of those things are pretty modular and can be put back. But there's a lot of different customer service things. We've separated out the appraisal area completely. We can roll that back into the stores without a bunch of capital. Simple things like we allow customers to test drive cars on their own, which we just have not done to this point. That's obviously easy to do in all of our stores. All of our cars are unlocked. Customers have access to browse the lot and go in and out of cars. For security reasons and for making sure that they have a sales consultant with them. We haven't done that before. That's also pretty modular and can be rolled back. Our sales consultants and sales managers are using iPads to try and help with delivering a better customer experience. That's another thing, obviously, we can put back into existing stores without a bunch of capital. So it's awfully early. We only have 1 store opened. We're pleased thus far with the results and with what we're learning. But in terms of how quickly will we get into the rest of the chain, it's just still a little bit too early.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rick Nelson of Stephens.","N. Richard Nelson - Stephens Inc., Research Division","I'd like to ask you about the health sufficiency rate. What happened in the quarter and compared to the prior year?","Thomas J. Folliard","Well, Rick, we don't have that one handy. While they're looking for the numbers, I would guess it's relatively flat since sales were flat and our buy rate was relatively flat.","N. Richard Nelson - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Got you. And if the number is coming up, if I could ask, I know you like to talk about market share on an annual basis, but any commentary as to what you think happened in the latest quarter maybe in the various buckets, the 1- to 3-year-old cars, the 5-plus cars.","Thomas J. Folliard","Yes. Rick, just because of the historical volatility around market share numbers, we're only going to talk it about annually. So we gave our share numbers at the end of the year, and we'll give another update at the end of this year. The self-sufficiency was up slightly for the quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Armstrong of CL King & Associates.","William R. Armstrong - CL King & Associates, Inc.","Just to touch on an earlier question a little bit, obviously we've seen recent indications, various indications that used car prices are softening a little bit. To what extent are you seeing that? And in your view, do you think that's sustainable?","Thomas J. Folliard","Well, I think our prices were relatively flat in terms of our total ASP year-over-year. So...","William R. Armstrong - CL King & Associates, Inc.","In terms of wholesale price, the price that you got, that you're seeing in the market?","Thomas J. Folliard","No. In terms of -- I'm saying our average retails are relatively flat. And you're asking...","William R. Armstrong - CL King & Associates, Inc.","Well, I mean your...","Thomas J. Folliard","The wholesale and retail, so it's a result of that. And I have seen some softening largely in that the last couple of years. Particularly at this time of year, we've seen pretty big appreciation in the wholesale market, and we're not seeing that as much as we have in the past. But if you backed up pre-recession, what we would normally see coming out of the spring is a pretty steady depreciation throughout the second half of the year, which is obviously going to have an impact on pricing. And we don't know if that's going to happen this year, but that would be what we would consider more of a normal curve of how pricing should flow. That's also driven by how many new cars are sold and how many new cars are sold each month. And although SAAR has been moving pretty steadily, it was down in May compared to what it was in April. I think if we see a steady climb in the SAAR throughout the next couple of years, then we may get back to what we would consider more of a normal depreciation curve.","William R. Armstrong - CL King & Associates, Inc.","Got it. Do you think that the -- what looks like will be an increase in off-leased vehicles entering the wholesale market beginning next year, do you think that will have an appreciable impact on supply and on your vehicle cost?","Thomas J. Folliard","The supply, total supply, is going to be driven by total SAAR, not the percentage of which -- not the percentage of new cars that are leased. If there's a bigger percentage of new cars that are leased, it makes -- our ability to acquire that inventory is a little bit easier because the cars are more organized. They come back through leased companies, and they show up at auction pretty consistently. But in terms of the total supply, the percentage of cars that are leased over the long haul really doesn't have any impact. It changes the timing a little bit. It changes where we have to go buy cars. So again, I don't think pricing is going to be driven by the percentage of cars that are leased. I think it's going to be driven by the total number of new cars sold in the U.S.","William R. Armstrong - CL King & Associates, Inc.","Right. And are you seeing any impact that you're able to quantify at all on new car dealers holding on to a greater percentage of their trade-ins and re-retailing them rather than putting them out in the auctions?","Thomas J. Folliard","No. I mean, we haven't seen an impact in terms of our sourcing ability. And what you've -- what we've heard from lots of the new car dealers is that they're actually keeping older stuff, older stuff that they historically would have wholesaled. A lot of that stuff does not meet our retail standards, and that would fall into our wholesale area, which as you have seen, has grown substantially over the last couple of years. So what we've seen and what we've heard in terms of behavior from other dealers about keeping stuff and selling stuff at retail, it feels like it's been more driven by selling stuff that they normally would have wholesaled.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Neff of Akre Capital Management.","John H. Neff - Akre Capital Management, LLC","Just one here, and that is you sort of mentioned earlier that subprime lenders are getting more comfortable with CarMax's origination channel. I was just wondering if you could sort of describe what they were less comfortable with prior and why that's waning.","Thomas W. Reedy","What -- I think what they've seen is the performance of our portfolio. That's the biggest evidence that you can give. And they've told us -- both our subprime and Tier 2 lenders have told us a similar set of assets generated out of CarMax performs better than one generated elsewhere. And if you think about what are the risks to an auto lender, it's the collateral, and it's the information you're getting about the customer. And our business model provides a very elegant origination channel in that we know the collaterals work because we bought it. So there's no obscuring of that. It's very clear. And we have a transparent process, so the information about the customer is very solid. So when the lenders start looking at the risk they have embedded in the auto lending practice, they don't have to factor anything in for, perhaps, a disconnect on what value of the asset is or the information from the customer.","Thomas J. Folliard","And we bring all our cars up to the same quality standard. It doesn't matter what tier a customer buys them. Whether they're Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3, subprime, the quality standard's all the same. And that's another thing. We've heard loud and clear from our providers is that the quality of car that we sell, you're more likely to pay if your car is still running.","Okay. Seeing no further questions, I want to thank everyone for your support and your interest.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks there will be a question-and-answer session.","Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Katharine Kenny, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. ","Katharine Kenny","Thanks Kim, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our fiscal 2018 fourth quarter earnings conference call. On the call today are Bill Nash, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Tom Reedy, our Executive Vice President and CFO.","Before we begin, let me remind you that our statements today regarding the company\u2019s future business plans, prospects and financial performance are forward-looking statements that we make pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.","These statements are based on management\u2019s current knowledge and assumptions about future events that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. In providing projections and other forward-looking statements, the company disclaims any intent or obligation to update them.","For additional information on important factors that could affect these expectations, please see the company\u2019s annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2017 filed with the SEC.","Thank you in advance for asking only one question and a follow-up before getting back in queue. ","Now I\u2019ll turn it over to Bill.","Bill Nash","Thank you, Katharine. Good morning, everyone. I\u2019ll be in today\u2019s call with our quarterly results than I\u2019ll turn it over to Tom, who will be financing and later I will update you on our initiatives. Our used unit comps for the fourth quarter decline by 8% and total used units fell by 3.1%. This is driven by lower traffic and relatively flat conversion. Remember that in the fourth quarter, we were facing our toughest year-over-year comparison. We are disappointed with the decrease in our quarterly comps, which we believe it\u2019s partly due to macro pricing factors that resulted in a softer sales environment. ","Although used vehicle pricing has fallen since October 17th, valuations were still significantly higher than in last year\u2019s fourth quarter. The increase in CarMax\u2019s average selling price in the fourth quarter was due to growth in our average acquisition costs and would have been higher absent the changes in our sales mix. At the same time, new vehicle pricing appears to have fallen further with [indiscernible] still higher than last year. These dynamics, which vary over time lead us to believe that during our fourth quarter, the pricing spread between new and late-model used vehicles was pressured which we think adversely affected our sales. ","Despite the softness in our fourth quarter, we are encouraged by the fact that the used market has historically been self-correcting and we believe that off lease supply that continues into the market should drive used prices lower. For the calendar year, our data shows that we were able to grow our comp market share by almost 7%, the largest increase in 4 years. Our website traffic grew in the fourth quarter by 16% as we continue to enhance our website and SEO capabilities. Gross profit per used unit once again remained consistent at 2,147 compared to 2,134 in the fourth quarter of last year. ","Our wholesale units grew by 9% year-over-year in the fourth quarter due primarily to the growth in our store base and the continuation of a higher buy rate. The buy rate was supported by the higher used vehicle valuations. Gross profit for wholesale unit of $946 was similar to the $938, we reported in last year\u2019s fourth quarter. The decrease in other gross profit was primarily driven by lower unit sales, which impacted EPP and service. In regard to service, we also saw some compensation related pressure due to the fact that approximately one half of our discretionary bonus was allocated to service. ","Before I turn the call over to Tom, let me cover our sales mix and SG&A expense. As a percentage of our sales, zero to four-year old vehicles decreased to about 76% versus 77% in the fourth quarter last year. Large and medium SUV and truck sales were slightly above 27% down about a 0.5% from last year\u2019s fourth quarter and up from 26% in the third quarter. ","On SG&A, expenses for the quarter increased approximately 6% to $409 million or year-over-year increase of $207 per unit. Several factors impacted SG&A expense including the opening of 19 stores since the beginning of the fourth quarter of last year, which represents an 11% growth in our base and a decrease of $9 million or $0.47 per unit related to share-based compensation expense. ","In addition, as we discussed in the past, our SG&A expense growth continues to be affected by our investment in technology platforms and digital experience. However, this quarter\u2019s deleverage was largely due to our comp sales decline. ","Lastly, while Tom will review how tax perform impacted quarterly results, let me briefly address our strategy on the use of cash flows created by the reduction in our effective tax rate. Our goal is to continue to invest in our associates and in our company and drive higher shareholder returns. ","As we mentioned in our press release, we paid a one-time discretionary bonus to eligible associates which was about 80% of our population. For FY \u201819 we implemented additional associate benefit options and we\u2019ll be evaluating more enhancements in the future. We also plan to invest incrementally in our business including our digital and technology capabilities. While this thing will put pressure on pre-tax income growth in FY \u201819, we would still expect 70% to 85% of the tax benefit to impact our bottom-line. These investments don\u2019t change our current outlook on SG&A leverage. We continue to estimate that we would begin to reduce our SG&A expense per unit at the higher end of our long-term guidance of mid-single-digit comps.","Now, I will turn the call over to Tom.","Tom Reedy","Thanks, Bill. And good morning, everyone. In the fourth quarter we saw some of the same year year-over-year trends in sales mix by finance channel that we\u2019ve seen in recent quarters, specifically some decline in Tier 2 originations, growth in Tier 3 and modest expansion in the percent of sales where customers paid cash or brought their own financing. ","The allocation of sales across our lending channels was largely driven by the mix of credit applications. Tier 2 accounted for 15.4% of sales compared with 18.2% last year. Third-party Tier 3 grew to 11.7% of sales -- used unit sales compared to 9.4% last year. And CAF penetration net of three-day payoffs remained flat at 42.8% versus 42.9% of last year\u2019s fourth quarter.","CAF net loans originated in the quarter were flat at 1.4 billion. While unit sales were lower, we saw an increase in the average amount financed commensurate with the growth in CarMax\u2019s average selling price. ","CAF income increased 22% to 101 million. This was due to result of a lower loss provision and the 9.4% growth in average managed receivables, partially offset by a slight compression in the portfolio of interest margin. ","Total portfolio of interest margin was 5.6% of average managed receivables compared to 5.7% in both the fourth quarter of last year and the third quarter of this year. For loans originated during the quarter, the weighted average contract rate charged to customers increased to 7.9% compared to 7.4% a year ago and 7.7% in the third quarter. ","Our ending allowance for loan losses was 129 million or 1.11% of ending managed receivables. That\u2019s flat sequentially from Q3 and down from 1.16% in the fourth quarter of last year. ","Before I turn the call back over to Bill, let me make a few points about tax and about capital structure. As you saw in the release, the revaluation of our deferred tax asset was 32.7 million which is significantly lower than our early forecast. This was largely the result of deliberate tax fining actions. Between the December when tax reform enacted and the end of our fiscal year, we identified and executed on a number of opportunities to optimize tax savings related to the change in tax law.","For future quarters, we expect our effective tax rate to be around 25%. Remember, as we have seen in the past, there has been variability around that estimate due to state taxes and other items such as the adaptation in fiscal 2018 of the FASB guidance regarding share-based comp concession. We would expect this potential variability to continue in the future. ","Regarding capital structure, during the fourth quarter, we repurchased 1.9 million shares for $128 million. For the full year, we repurchased 8.9 million shares at a cost of $574 million.","As of the end of the year, we have approximately $1 billion remaining in our authorization. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Bill.","Bill Nash","Thanks Tom. During the quarter we opened four stores, two in new markets for CarMax, [indiscernible] South Carolina and [indiscernible] and two in existing markets, Boston and Denver. During fiscal 2018, we opened 15 stores and had 188 stores open at the end of the year. ","In the first quarter of fiscal 2019, we planned to open three stores. Our store in the Greenville North Carolina market opened last week and is a new market for CarMax. The other two were opened in Dallas and Miami both of which are existing markets for us. ","During fiscal 2019, we once again plan to open 15 stores, 10 of which will be in what we define as small markets as MSA\u2019s with a population of 600,000 or less. We also plan to open between 13 and 16 stores in fiscal 2020. ","Now I want to update you on some of our strategic initiatives. During the fourth quarter, we completed the full roll out of our new enterprise wide customer relationship management or CRM platform to all stores. The new CRM platform enables a more seamless and personalized car buying experience by delivering a unified view of our customer shopping and selling history across all locations. ","We are also testing an extra [ph] pick up feature in our Charlotte North Carolina in Lynchburg Virginia stores. This option allows the customer to do virtually everything from home and complete the purchase at the store. The expatiated pickup can take us as little as 15 minutes but it's all driven by customers interest in reviewing information about the vehicle for completing the test ride.","In addition, we completed the roll out of our new 360 degrees in terracotta featured to all stores. As part of the roll out, we also updated our photo software in all stores which will dramatically improve our ability to quickly innovate our photo capabilities in the future. ","And finally, we rolled out our new mobile appraisal platform for buyers to nearly stores this quarter. The platform enables our buyers to be more efficient which has reduced appraisal time.","We are very pleased with the progress we\u2019ve made on both advancing our technology capabilities for associates and our digital experience of our customer, not only for the quarter but for the year. This coming year, we will continue to focus on meeting the customer on their terms, whether it's in the store, online or a combination of the two.","Customers want flexibility and control in their shopping and buying experience. Our associates, our national footprint, brand strength, infrastructure, inventory scale and our continued investments in technology and digital capabilities position us to continue to leave used car industry. ","At this time, we\u2019ll be happy to take questions. Kim?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Your first quarter comes from Matt Fassler from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. ","Matt Fassler","My question relates to the dynamic focus in the macroenvironment and it's really -- have you ever seen the reactions [Technical Difficulties].","Bill Nash","Hey Matt your question broke up a little bit but I think you were asking about the macro pricing environment and kind of what we think about, as I said, obviously first-of-all we \u2018re confident about a tough year-over-year but a big factor of that is the pricing environment. I think it really hits on two sides, it's not only that our acquisition price went up on all inventory, but also I think that there was pressure on the spread as I mentioned in my opening remarks, I think there was pressure on the spread between a late model used car and a new car, but because of our acquisition price going up and new car prices coming down in relative terms year-over-year. ","If I look back over the last two years, we've been seeing prices all of last year we saw our acquisition prices going down. The first two quarters of this year, we saw our acquisition prices going down. Third quarter, we saw a little bit of an uptick and then we saw significant uptick in the fourth quarter. I think this is one of those things we have seen in the past what it goes through like I said in my opening remarks, is the wholesale market is pretty much self-corrected. It takes a little bit of time but it will end up correcting itself. ","The other thing I would just say is from a comparison stand year-over-year, we've lack some big technology improvements the biggest being on finance. Last year we saw a larger supply of affordable large and medium SUVs which we haven't seen year before. So, I think there is a lot of noise that's basically going on there.","Matt Fassler","Can you hear me a bit better now? If we look for clues for improvements, should we be more focused on used car pricing so that we can follow that or focus on what we [Technical Difficulties].","Bill Nash","I think really what we should be focused on is just the overall wholesale environment and what is doing to prices across the board, are the acquisition prices going down or they going up. New car certainly plays and its part of that when you talk about the spread. So, it will be interesting to see as we go forward. Although it seems like incentives have started to come down a little bit, they are still higher than they were a year ago. ","Operator","Your next question comes from Scot Ciccarelli from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. ","Scot Ciccarelli","Good morning, guys. Can you help us better understand some of the various pressures on gross profit in the other category for the quarter specifically on the service revenues et cetera?","Bill Nash","Sure, Scot. Like I said, on the service side, we had a little bit of headwind. I mentioned one for Thank You bonus, a big chunk of Thank You bonus went right to the service line. So, it was overcoming that. We also saw an increase in some health and welfare fringe benefits that went into that that line up as well. And then of course just the impact of lower use sale and the deleveraging by not selling as many cars also was an impact. ","Tom Reedy","Hey Scot, and to give you a little additional color too. I mean the way that we are accounting for this service business is that we have like kind of a standard cost and fee to each car. And we have to cover our overhead which is pretty much fixed and based on the staffing that we have. If we have a reduction in the cars versus our expectations, it doesn't cover -- that line item is not going to cover all of the overhead that we've got buried in there. Also, with regards to kind of compensation and health and welfare it's a very big piece of the overall P&L for service and some changes and it's a relatively small profit lines from a P&L perspective. So, swings in that part of the service line will have a more dramatic impact on the overall profitability there and then they do for the company overall reap all of the SG&A. ","Scot Ciccarelli","And then I guess the mix on the lending tier 2 to tier 3, that's pretty much a direct flow through from revenue down to the profitability, that's 100% flow through that $5 million. ","Tom Reedy","Yeah, I mean as we've talked before. Every tier 2 that swaps through the tier 3, you lose $300 in commission that we get from Tier 2 and it turns into paying out a $1,000, so there is roughly a $1,300 swing and everything you see move out of Tier 2 and into Tier 3. We\u2019ve also seen growth in other which represent zero versus something paid in Tier 2.","Operator","Your next question comes from Sharon Zackfia from William Blair. Your line is now open.","Sharon Zackfia ","I appreciate the color on the full year market share, and I know that shorter periods are kind of harder to discern. But I\u2019m just wondering, if you believe, you\u2019ve seen any signs of competitive infringement over the past few years or anything that would kind of impede the longer-term unit growth runway or market share runway?","Bill Nash","No. From a competition standpoint, we believe our prices are absolutely competitive and part of that is just by the continued large volume of vehicles that we sell in any given location. I mean we\u2019re still averaging for the year over 330 vehicles per location. And that being said, we also monitor our competitive pricing both regionally and locally. And Sharon as you know, we\u2019re constantly testing every quarter raising prices, I\u2019m sorry taking our margin and maybe lowering it, raising it. We\u2019re doing pricing test all times to see elasticity on the impact that it has on sales. And what I would tell you is that we\u2019re obviously trying to sell as many cars as we can, but to also optimize total gross profit dollars. So, we feel very comfortable on the competitive landscape at this point.","Sharon Zackfia ","Can you also give us an update on where your aggregate market share is at this point and where is your top market share now? Is that Richmond or Charlotte? And where does that stand?","Bill Nash","Yes. So, our top markets are going to be our oldest markets, because they\u2019ve obviously been through the most buying cycles. So, it\u2019ll be your older markets, the Richmond market, the Charlotte market some of these older markets. I think you\u2019re asking about the national market share how do we stand there?","Sharon Zackfia ","Right. Relative to kind of where you are in those oldest markets.","Bill Nash","Okay. Nationwide, we obviously gain market share. Market share on the national actually was a little bit higher gain. I think 7% was the comp, national was a little bit higher than that. National was still about, when you look at zero to 10, we\u2019re still around 3.3% in the comp markets were more like 4.5%, 4.6% and then in our most mature markets, we\u2019ve talked about before, being at above 10%. ","Operator","Your next question comes from Brian Nagel from Oppenheimer. Your line is open.","Brian Nagel","The question I have, Bill I just want to dive a little bit deeper [indiscernible] the first question was asked is with regards to the pricing dynamic now and you\u2019re calling out that being sales the headwinds here in the fourth quarter. But just looking at how do we make sense of the various costs for example. Because there's clearly a larger supply of all these vehicles now hitting the market, which should be, it should weigh upon pricing. We go back to your third quarter conference call, I think we talked about post-hurricane this dynamic being an issue. But it sounded like it has started to normalized or abate somewhere early in the fourth quarter. So, I guess, the question I\u2019m asking is, what\u2019s behind all this, what\u2019s happening out here? And then is there still a hurricane, if you\u2019re and give us more specifics on how we should think about, when this this dynamic should abate?","Bill Nash","Sure Brian. So, as I think about the supply. Like I said earlier, if you go back all through last year and through the first two quarters of this year, the added supply of let\u2019s say of leased cars coming into the marketplace absolutely benefited us from an acquisition cost. Our acquisition cost all of last year and for the first two quarters of this year were down, which we would expect to see when you have a higher supply of vehicles. There was the third quarter dynamic where you had this big push on inventory demand because of the hurricane replacement. So, in the third quarter we saw our acquisition prices start to tick up in the third quarter that continued into the fourth quarter. And remember, we were buying inventory during that period and we were buying inventory that will get us through a couple of months ahead of time. So, do I think that the -- we\u2019re kind of through the inventory anomaly that was post hurricane, I do think we are through that but prices still have to recover. While they are depreciating, they still haven\u2019t gotten back to where they were a year ago. ","Brian Nagel","Okay. And then as far as my follow-up and I understand it\u2019s difficult. But is there a way to isolate what specific impact this had on your comps and I guess another way to think about that is, is it -- is there a group of -- given the vast way of cars you sell, is there a group of cars that are just proportionately skewed to this?","Bill Nash","No, I mean when we look at it, it\u2019s basically broad-based. Acquisition cost is up for pretty much everything. So, I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s skewed to one group or another. And I think that\u2019s also just reflected in our wholesale performance and having a higher buy rate, more units in wholesale because it\u2019s reflective of trickling down the expenses up on everything. ","Brian Nagel","Is there any quantification of the impact on Q4 starting the comps?","Bill Nash","Yes, I mean it\u2019s hard to say of the 8% -- negative 8% ex-amount. It\u2019s hard to say because it really trickles down into so many different things because for example not only is everything more expensive but last year we saw a little bit of a tailwind because there was more affordable large and medium SUVs. Well now everything is up. So, there\u2019s an impact on that. So, it\u2019s hard to actually quantify certain specific percent. But I personally believe it\u2019s been a large headwind.","Operator","Your next question comes from Seth Basham from Wedbush. Your line is open.","Seth Basham","Thanks a lot, and good morning. When you look at this quarter\u2019s comp, was there a bigger deterioration in comp traffic or conversion relative to the last fiscal quarter?","Bill Nash","So, our conversion was basically flat. We had a larger decline in traffic when you think about it from quarter-to-quarter. So, I would say more of it was on the traffic than the conversion. ","Seth Basham ","Got it. And when you think about conversion, it did slow somewhat. What do you think the drivers are of the slower conversion this quarter, is it simply flapping the roll out of things like pre-approval of financing online, are there things that you can point to from a conversion standpoint? ","Bill Nash","Yes, it\u2019s interesting because we\u2019ve been having some incremental conversion each quarter, here recently, and this one was a little softer. If you look website traffic for us, it\u2019s up again double-digit and a lot of that growth has been driven by SEO which generates leads just like paid advertising. I think when you look at the leads any specific [indiscernible] converts the same whether its SEO or SEM but what you have to look out on a quarterly basis is the quality of those leads, some leads convert a little bit better than other leads and I think during the fourth quarter we saw an increase in leads that don\u2019t necessarily correlate as high as some other more vehicle specifically. So, what do I mean by that? In the fourth quarter, we saw more appraisal leads, appraisal leads don\u2019t necessarily convert as high to sales as say a vehicle appointment leads. ","So, in any given quarter, you can have a mix in the lead types and I think that probably plays into a little bit of the where we landed in conversion this time which I also think is highly impacted by some of these more macro pricing environments.","Seth Basham","Got it, okay. So, continuation from last quarter in terms of the quality of the leads deteriorating a little bit in terms of the absolute growth in digital online leads, are you still doing double digit?","Bill Nash","Yeah, we\u2019re still doing double digits but it's not as big double digits as what we\u2019ve seen in the past. And I think that\u2019s probably because we\u2019re lapping over some investments and some roll out and some things and I also its partly because of what we\u2019re seeing from a pricing standpoint.","Operator","Your next question comes from Michael Montani from MN. Your line is open.","Michael Montani ","Hey good morning thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to ask first off if I could, can you just discuss a little bit the credit and lending environment and in particular if there is any incremental tightening either from cash or Tier-2 partners or if you are more still in the motor cycling tightening that I think again around three quarters ago?","Tom Reedy","This is Tom, I can kind of walk through. With regard to cap, we talked about some tightening last year and early this year but we\u2019ve been pretty much consistent in our lending behavior since then. Obviously, we\u2019re looking at rates that we all heard now with the increase in the benchmarks, but that\u2019s something we\u2019re doing on an ongoing basis. ","As I mentioned, generally the shift in mix and the lending environment has been a result of the kind of the nature of the volume of applications coming through the door. I can comment a little bit on Tier-2 and 3, Tier-2 is down year-over-year about 2.8 points one is we have seen the application volume is down across the board, but most heavily in that kind of middle range. And we\u2019ve also seen some deteriorating and conversion which we have in kind of sales to applications if you look at in that Tier-2 space.","I think some of that\u2019s the nature of the applications they\u2019ve been seeing and some of is lender performance in that space. We\u2019ve been talking about weakness in the last several quarters with at least one of Tier-2 lenders. I also think that in Q4 of last year we have been doing a little bit by some lender testing by other Tier-2 folks. ","So, you know year-over-year in the fourth quarter I think Tier-2 was probably a bit of a headwind from us based on those factors. Tier-3 continues to perform well and we\u2019ve seen consistent over the course of this year at least since early call it April year-over-year improvement in their sales applications so in the quality of their activity for us and I think they\u2019ve also benefitted from some trickle down from Tier-2 not proving us strong. ","But overall, I would describe the environment in our stores as robust as ever, they\u2019re significantly more than 90% of customers are getting approval coming the door and, in the Tier, -2 phase I\u2019d also mentioned that we've introduced another lender of course the year. And that is that Chase Auto. ","Michael Montani ","Okay, great. That's helpful color. And if I could just follow up on two fronts. One is if you can provide an update on the home appraisal initiatives that you all have been doing as well as home delivery? And then the other question was just around finding that right downs between GPU and share. Because some of the data we have seen it looked like there was a modest growth to the market for used car units, but it came at a really heavy cost in terms of GPU when we think about some of the franchise dealer peers. And you all have always been -- think a little bit more disciplined in terms of balancing that. So here is the question was are you comfortable kind of continuing to sacrifice some shares if need to be in order to maintain or hold the GPU?","Bill Nash","Okay so on the first couple of points, online appraisal and home delivery. So online appraisals we continue to test in 10 stores. We're actively working on different presentations to the customer and we're continuing to learn some different things. So, I don't really have an update for you on that at this point. ","Home delivery, I tend to think about home delivery on a more broader view which is alternative delivery, home delivery being one of them. We've been focused on building out the capability to enable not only home delivery but things like expedited delivery and as you heard, we've started to test expedited delivery in some stores. So, I'm pleased with the progress that we're making on both of those fronts. ","As far as the GPU and share. Look, I talked a little bit about it on earlier question. We want to maximize the sales and maximize -- we want to maximize sales but we also want to maximize total gross profit dollars. And could we have sold some additional cars if we lowered our margins and lowered our prices the answer is yes. Do we feel like net, net it would have netted out more total gross profit dollars, no. But that being said, we're continuing every quarter, we test that elasticity and we're doing test. So, it's not that we're opposed to changing up the GPU as long as it produces more as long as it produces better financial results and total gross profit dollars. ","Operator","Your next question comes from Matthew Ziehl from Oppenheimer Funds. Your line is open. ","Matthew Ziehl","Yes, hi, thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to ask if there was any weather related and I guess it would showed up in geographic in the fourth fiscal quarter related to winter weather we got back to normal to and at times nasty winter. Did you noticed any meaningful difference in comps between [Sunbelt] and more northern markets that's weather could have some impact and maybe had an aggregate impact?","Bill Nash","Sure Matt, yeah, we obviously had lots of weather during the quarter. But like we were said in the past, weather generally once you get through the weather, you eventually went back those sales we don't think that it was any type of driver on where we ended up on comps. Because generally the only impact that would impact as you had a big weather events in a lot of stores at the very end of the quarter. And we did not see that. So, while there was impact on weather, we felt like, like we're always do that you generally get those sales back once the weather has passed. ","Matthew Ziehl","Okay, thank you. And just following up just to not the beat the horse too much on the gross profit question, you actually had your GPU tick up this quarter and it was a bit surprising that you\u2019re willing to forgo so much sales without even giving up any gross profit. its saying all or nothing 200 bucks or 300 bucks like some of your public competitors have. But it does seem a little surprising that, that you\u2019re willing to hold the line so hard on gross profit than it actually kicked up this quarter. Is that, how, maybe I don\u2019t understand, how you do your testing and how real time it is. But is it possible that you\u2019re actually surprised at the end of the day by how much sales were down and maybe your testing methodology of testing elasticity isn\u2019t quite as real time or rapid feedback as you need it to be?","Bill Nash","No. First of all on the slight tick-up, that\u2019s within the noise range for us. That\u2019s not [indiscernible] we\u2019re going to make even more. That\u2019s just within the noise range. And again, I go back to, I feel very comfortable with our testing methodology and because we do it every quarter and we can see the results real time. So again, if you ask me if there was a surprise that we gave up so much sales, I just don\u2019t think that -- I don\u2019t see that. ","Operator","Your next question comes from [indiscernible]. Your line is open. ","Unidentified Analyst","I guess, what surprised me this quarter was looking at the used car sales data from Edmonds for the industry looked like the number was up 3% year-over-year for December, January and February. So, given the lift there and then companies paying out employee bonuses including yourselves means people have more money in their pockets for purchases including cars. So, in light of those tailwinds, I was surprised to see the same-store sales coming where they were. Can you sort of walk me through what I might be missing there?","Bill Nash","Yes. So, I can\u2019t speak to the Edmonds data. What I can speak to is, we look at market share on a 12-month period, because what we have found is that the market information is lagging. And it takes a couple of three months for it to catch-up, that\u2019s why we reported on 12 months calendar year basis since we have a better understanding. And we used pocked data, which is DMV data. So, what I would say is what we seen is for the calendar year at least that the overall used for market was fairly flat. So, I can\u2019t speak to the Edmonds for the last couple of months. Nor, I\u2019m not sure how accurate it is on such looking at it on such a short basis. ","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. And I\u2019m sure, it\u2019s hard to extrapolate, but have you seen anything as far as employees with the bonuses and coming back to your stores or just given the commentary you\u2019ve had on traffic that it\u2019s maybe not so much?","Bill Nash","I wouldn\u2019t have anything that would call it out. ","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. And just one more. You\u2019re opening up 15 new stores, 10 in small markets. Maybe you can talk a little bit about plans to drive same-store profitability given sort of the emphasis on driving profitability in stores versus the actual store count?","Bill Nash","Yes. So, we are opening up 15 stores this year. And I\u2019ve talked about this before. While we still have plenty of runway to continue to open up stores. We want to continue to try to push comp growth in our existing stores. We want to try to get more out of the existing boxes that we have and we feel like a lot of these strategic initiatives that we are working on will help to enable that. So, when we think about growth, we think about market share and how do we continue to gain market share. And while adding stores is one component of that, equally important is continuing to make sure that we leverage the existing footprint that we have.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Murphy from Bank of America. Your line is open.","John Murphy","Good morning, guys. Just a first question, I mean given all the volatility or sort of spike up in used vehicle pricing, I mean Bill do every consider may be going a little bit slightly older in the age spectrum in these periods of time we get a little bit further away from since competition with new vehicles, try to help same-store sales, I understand you\u2019re very focused on GPUs and managing those but is there an opportunity to may be just drop six months or a year in the age spectrum?","Bill Nash","Well, John, we will put out there on the front lot whatever the customers are looking for. We sell up to 10-year-old cars. Retail, we also have a huge wholesale business. So, we want to make sure that the cars we put out there obviously meet our quality standards. If they don\u2019t, we put them in wholesale. So, when I think about old vehicles, I kind of have to think about it and the aggregate of both retail and wholesale because I think as we look at some of the competitors out there, and they add lighter model used cars, that\u2019s really kind of something that we have been doing but we do it through it through the wholesale channel. So as customers want that eight, nine-year-old car, then we\u2019ll absolutely go and source it. But the pricing dynamic that you saw whether its light model used car or if it\u2019s an eight or nine-year-old, it still exists and the price is still up. So that\u2019s a headwind no matter which piece of the inventory you are looking at.","John Murphy","Okay. And then just a quick second question and follow-up. Our understanding was there was a huge stocking of inventory out of the rest of the country into Texas and Florida post the storms and that really created this weird dynamic where there was excess inventory in those markets and not enough in other markets. So, for the supply of used vehicle pricing, it really just you need those vehicles to flow back out of those markets. It doesn\u2019t seem like that\u2019s happening that quickly and pricing is remaining fairly high. So I know you kind of answered this question before, but I mean do you see that kind of dynamic in your stores and the options your buyers are going to where those vehicles are flowing out, we\u2019re getting this adjustment that was kind of back out towards the end of last year, and just trying to gauge when this normalizes because doesn\u2019t seem it\u2019s normalized quite yet?","Bill Nash","Yes, I don\u2019t think inventory availability in our stores was a cause for concern for us. I agree I think there was a big influx of vehicles that went down there. We certainly supported our stores by moving inventory down there. But inventory has still been available around the country, so I don\u2019t think that that is a big factor. I do feel like we managed inventory very well this quarter given the softness in sales that we saw, inventory only grew slightly and that was really just to support the growth of the new stores. ","Operator","Your next question comes from James Albertine from Consumer Edge Research. Your line is open.","Derek Glynn","Yes, hi. Thanks for taking my question. This is Derek Glynn on for Jamie. I just had a follow-up on some of your initiatives. So, you had the logistics in place and the technology backbone to enable home delivery, your expedite pickup, if you decide to roll this out across your store base, how quickly could you scale this, what would that roll out basically look like? ","Bill Nash","Not really prepared at this point to talk about timing on that. I agree with you, I think we have an unbelievable logistics network that we continue to improve or continuing as I think about the investments we\u2019re making in the business, I think that\u2019s another area that we continue to invest in, in our transportation and our systems. What I would tell you is you know, we move a lot of cars, we\u2019re moving close to 2 million cars a year, moving cars is not an issue for us and moving cars and getting them to individual homes, that is not an issue for us. We want to make sure that when we rolled this, it's the product that we want out there representing CarMax which is why we have been so focused on building out the capabilities. So, I\u2019m not ready to talk about the full roll out on this but we\u2019ll talk more about that in future quarters this year. ","Operator","Your next question comes from David Whiston from Morningstar. Your line is open. ","David Whiston","Thanks, and good morning. Question on the small market expansion, are you noticing any real difference in the customer demographics there versus your legacy markets in terms of the credit income and the expectation either on service or also on back to John\u2019s question on the age of the vehicle they\u2019re looking more?","Bill Nash","No, we haven\u2019t noticed anything that would be worth calling out and the main reason that we talked about the small markets just to give you an idea of the size of the store and therefore the volume but we have not noticed any noticeable difference on customer demographics. ","Tom Reedy","I\u2019d add a little color there. I mean we see differences in every market that we go to, Boston is different than Atlanta is different than Houston et cetera and we contemplate those differences in demographics in our estimates of how we can sell cars there and the small markets are no different. They\u2019re going to vary a little bit between themselves but in our models, we will contemplate those factors and make sure that we\u2019re investing the right amount of money to get the returns we need.","David Whiston","Okay. Just one more question on buybacks, obviously you had a soft quarter now and there is a lot of uncertainty in the macro environment. My question is if you get a rather noticeable sell-off in the stock in fiscal \u201919 are you willing you accelerate your buybacks to be more aggressive?","Tom Reedy","So the answer is yes, we\u2019re not going to share, we don\u2019t have any view at this point on what we would do and when we\u2019re continuously looking at that and as you know as we talked about in the past we take a programmatic approach to the buyback program targeting a certain target range for leverage to the extent we have more cash flow and need to manage to that level. We\u2019ll see a pick up, we took our real place so that our programs automatically buy more when the stock is looking at a lower value and buys less when it\u2019s a bit rich but we have the opportunity to do additional volume if we see fit and if that ever comes to fruition we\u2019ll obviously tell you about it. ","Operator","Your next question comes from Chris Bottiglieri from Wolfe Research. Your line is open.","Chris Bottiglieri","Hi, thanks for taking the question. I just want to focus on the expense a little bit, if you maintained your mid-single digit algorithm despite the announced reinvestment, simple as we put back in the core algorithm. I want to get a sense as that just a lapping investment like smaller store growth on versus lease on something else, then I have a follow up?","Bill Nash","Chris actually a function while we are continuing to invest, it\u2019s really a function of being very disciplined and making sure that we\u2019re taking waste out of both our SG&A and our cost of goods sold. We\u2019ve been focused on and I talked about our focus on that really for the last year and half two years. On the SG&A side, we\u2019ve really been focused on strategic sourcing and procurement, staff utilization on the cost to good sold side, we have been focused really on parts and labor efficiencies. And as I look at those two buckets over the last couple of years we've taken tens of millions of dollars out of there. And I think in addition that, knowing that we're doing some incremental investments I've talked about in the past now allowing at all to be incremental and being disciplined on what we're spending our discretionary money on as we continue to advance the organization forward. So, I think it's a combination of things. ","Chris Bottiglieri","That's helpful. And then, just want to step back in the mid-single digit algorithm. Can you just spend on the flexibility out there, obviously taking some cost out? But wanted to get sense how much of that's tied to like store growth and how much that's tied to like growth initiatives that you have. Just like what it could have to be in the mid-single digits and how do you think about that long term. ","Bill Nash","That's just the guidance that we basically have given. As we continue to grow we've always said it's going to take in that mid-single digit range. Although it's a little bit higher right now given the strategic investments. I would expect that overtime, as we have more stores and our new growth store growth becomes less of the percent of the store base. We should to be able to leverage less than that. What I would tell you is that time is not right now because we're investing back into the organization and into the future of the company. ","Operator","Your next question comes from Brian Nagel from Oppenheimer. Your line is open. ","Brian Nagel","Hi good morning again. So, I wanted to just go back again just pricing dynamic in the environment. What we're seeing in our channel checks if there is maybe a dislocation with regard to residual values and the off-lease vehicles going back to market. So, the question I have is, are you seeing that, is that interpreting to this pricing environment that you're highlighting. And if so, how does that came at the pace at which that they --?","Bill Nash","Yeah and I assume when you're talking about the dislocation of the residual value you're talking about the cars that coming back and surprisingly they're not worth what they originally thought that were going to worth is that what's you're talking about?","Brian Nagel","Yeah that's exactly what I'm talking about. ","Bill Nash","Yeah, I don't want to say I told that so. Back when we saw the high lease penetration, everybody is getting the leasing putting residual value on a vehicle is a tough thing to do. And as history repeats itself these cars come back, they're not worth what people thought they're worth. For us because we're not taking those cars in right from direct from the deal manufacturers buying those from the auction, they're going to do for what they're worth. They may hold on to them hoping that they'll bring more, but ultimately, they're going to end up selling it. So, we're buying them, we don't necessarily have to worry about what they have them and what they have to get out them. We're going to pay what we're willing to pay. So, I think while it may be impact some of the publicly traded retailers, that dynamic does not necessarily impact us. ","Brian Nagel","And from a bigger perspective, you've stepped back [indiscernible] you guys are not in well positioned to that. But could residual issue also be leading to even artificially higher prices in the marketplace with which you have to compete against, and then this has actually slowed down the pace of those cars eventually making their way to CarMax. ","Bill Nash","Yeah. Like I said, we've seen increased supply coming in for the prior six quarters before the third. I don't see we're supposed to have to a step up. And having to pay more on these vehicles to acquire them. If they do I actually think that's a good thing for us. Because our acquisition prices are going to be higher than what our acquisition price is through the auction line. So, I think that's actually a plus for us. ","Operator","Your next question comes from Jonathan [indiscernible]. Your line is open. ","Unidentified Analyst","I don\u2019t mean to beat the dead horse on GPU, but can you be very specific for a 1% change in comp sales? How many dollars you think that takes at the moment and how that has changed over some period of time?","Bill Nash","No. I\u2019m not going to be specific and tell you what 1% of sales which you have to do, from a pricing standpoint. And again, we look at this every quarter and surprisingly, it\u2019s been fairly consistent. The ratio has been fairly consistent but that\u2019s not to say that it doesn\u2019t change from time-to-time and we continue to evaluate every quarter. ","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. I turn the call back over to Bill Nash. ","Bill Nash","Thank you. I want to thank everyone for joining the call today.

Thank you.","I would now like to turn the call over to Katharine Kenny, Vice President, Investor Relations.","Katharine Kenny","Thanks you, Amy, and good morning, everyone. Happy holidays. Thank you for joining our fiscal 2019 third quarter earnings conference call. I\u2019m here today with Bill Nash, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Tom Reedy, our Executive Vice President and CFO.","Let me remind you that our statements today regarding the company\u2019s future business plans, prospects and financial performance are forward-looking statements that we make pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are based on management\u2019s current knowledge and assumptions about future events that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations.

For additional information on important factors that could affect these expectations, please see the company\u2019s annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2018, filed with the SEC.","Lastly, let me thank you in advance for asking one question getting back in the queue for more follow-ups. Bill?","Bill Nash","Great. Thank you, Katharine, and good morning, everyone. In the third quarter, used unit comps fell by 1.2% compared to a positive 2.7% in the prior quarter. This is driven by lower traffic largely offset by better conversions. Total used units grew by 2.3%. We are pleased to report a 10% increase in pre-tax income. This is a testament to the strength of our diversified business model. While we are disappointed to report negative comps in the quarter, they were materially affected by the dynamics in the six Houston-area stores following Hurricane Harvey.","Remember, the hurricane positively impacted our results in the third quarter of last fiscal year. If we exclude the impact of the Houston market this quarter, the company experienced positive comps of 2.3%. Our website traffic grew in the third quarter by 17%. On average, we saw a volume of about 20 million visits per month. Our retail gross profit per used unit remains stable at $21.33 compared to $21.48 last year.","Once again, we had a strong wholesale quarter with units up 10% compared to last year\u2019s third quarter. This was a result of the growth in our store base, and an increase in our buy rate. Our gross profit per wholesale unit was similar year-over-year, $949 this quarter compared to $933 in the prior year period.","Other gross profit increased by over 16%, again, driven by higher EPP revenue and improvement in our third-party finance fees. EPP revenue is expanded by 11%, primarily as a result of provider cost decreases that we discussed previously. During the quarter, we did not recognize any additional extended service plan revenue associated with the new accounting standards.","Before I turn the call over to Tom, let me cover our sales mix and SG&A expense. As a percentage of our sales, zero to four-year-old vehicles decreased to about 77% versus 81% in the third quarter of last year, but were similar to the second quarter. Total SUVs and trucks accounted for about 45% of our sales, up from 42% this time last year.","On SG&A, expenses for the quarter increased 2.5% to $410 million or a year-over-year of $5 per unit. Several factors impacted SG&A expense, including our continued investment in technology platforms and digital initiatives and the opening of 19 stores since the beginning of third quarter of last year, which represents an 11% growth in our store base. These are partially offset by a decrease of $7 million or $42 per unit related to share-based compensation expense.","Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Tom.","Tom Reedy","Thank you, Bill, and good morning to everyone. During the quarter, we saw slight decline in year-over-year credit applications. Our Tier 2 lenders continued to deliver strong performance accounting for 18.3% of used unit sales compared with 15.4% last year. Q3 penetration was 9.3% compared to 10.8% last year. During the quarter, we made some changes to the routing of Tier 3 apps. An overall conversion of these applications, which is how we judge performance, ended up in line with last year's third quarter.","CAF penetration net of three-day payoffs was consistent with last year\u2019s third quarter at 44%. Our net loans originated in the quarter grew by 3.4% to $1.5 billion due to our sales growth and the increase in the average amount financed. CAF income increased 6.7% to $110 million. This was a result of the 8.4% growth in average managed receivables, partially offset by the continued slight compression in portfolio interest margin. Total portfolio interest margin was 5.6% of average managed receivables compared to 5.7% in both the third quarter of last year and this year's second quarter.","The provision for loan losses was $41 million compared to $38 million in last year's third quarter. This increase is in line with our growth in average managed receivables. Our loans originated during the quarter. The weighted average contract rate charged to customers was 8.5% versus 7.7% a year ago. And this number was consistent again with the second quarter. The allowance for loan losses was 1.12% of any managed receivables similar to last quarter and to last year's third quarter as well.","Lastly, I'll touch on capital structure. During the third quarter, we repurchased 3.7 million shares for $254 million. And as you may have seen in the 8-K we filed in October, CarMax's Board of Directors also authorize a $2 billion expansion in the current repurchase program.","Now, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Bill.","Bill Nash","Thanks, Tom. During the third quarter, we opened four stores in new markets for CarMax, Wilmington, North Carolina; Lafayette, Louisiana; Corpus Christi, Texas; and Shreveport, Louisiana. In the fourth quarter, we plan to open another five stores. Two stores open earlier in December, one in Buffalo, which is the new market, and one in Melbourne, Florida, which we opened this week. This is our fourth store in the Orlando market, and our 200th store overall. Later in the fourth quarter, we will open two more stores in new markets, Montgomery, Alabama; and New Orleans. We will also open our third store in the Portland, Oregon market.","Early this month, we announced the launch of our new omni-channel experience in the Atlanta market. Atlanta is our oldest large market and has a high CarMax brand awareness and market share. In addition, we see an opportunity to reach more customers within the perimeter of the city by offering alternative vehicle delivery options.","Our extensive testing and research has shown us that customers' expectations are changing. Buying a car is still a complex process, and customers are looking for an experience that give them more control and independence in buying and selling a car. However, they also want advice and guidance at any point in the journey. That is why we've developed the omni-channel experience that delivers upon this unmet customer need.","The launch in Atlanta provides an experience that is flexible, convenient and fully personalized. In addition to our great in-store experience, customers can complete some or all the car buying process from home, including finance, appraisal, and paperwork. They can have their vehicle delivered directly to home or work and test drive before buying. There's no requirement for customers to purchase prior to having the vehicle delivered.","Customers can also receive help from informed CarMax consultants both in-person at our stores or through our customer experience center via phone, text or e-mail. Last quarter, we shared that we opened our first center in Raleigh that now supports our Atlanta area customers. Consultants in the center are available to help customers find their ideal vehicle, navigate financing and provide any support needed until they are ready to either go to the store for pickup or schedule a home delivery.","We also introduced a new express pickup option at all Atlanta-area locations giving the customer the ability to save time by completing most of the process online and then finalizing their purchase at the store in as little as 30 minutes. In December, we opened our first standalone CarMax Express in Atlanta, which serves as an additional convenient location for test drives, appraisals and express pickup of vehicle purchases.","Finally, we launched a completely new website experience for Atlanta. The new online experience provides a modern and fresh brand look and includes enhanced, simplicity and flexibility for shopping and buying that easily transitions to a home delivery or in-store experience.","We are excited to put the customer in the driver's seat. This experience is a unique and powerful integration of our own in-store and online capabilities. Keep in mind, we will continue to improve both the customer and associate experience in Atlanta and use these learnings to inform how we rollout into other markets.","As we previously announced, we anticipate having the omni-channel experience available to the majority of our customers by February 2020. To expand omni-channel, we anticipate opening additional customer experience centers. We're currently in the process of planning the next locations, while taking state regulations into consideration.","In terms of cost implications, we will continue to invest, but still expect to leverage SG&A at the upper end of a mid-single digit comp range. While there are incremental costs and inefficiencies in the near term, we've also identified potential cost savings through process changes and other improvements that can help offset these expenses over time. We believe that no other company is in a better position to deliver the best experience efficiently and profitably. While it is early, we are pleased with the feedback on omni-channel from both our customers and associates, has been very positive, and that the experience is highly representative of the CarMax brand.","Let me remind you, we got into this industry in 1993 in order to provide an exceptional customer experience. We have never wavered from this commitment, which is why we've led the industry for more than 25 years. It is absolutely a part of our DNA. We believe we have a clear advantage to continue to lead the automotive industry and delivering a truly integrated and seamless experience both online and in-store. This advantage is enabled by continuing to leverage our strengths, including our skilled and knowledgeable associates, our national footprint and transportation infrastructure, our inventory scale and merchandising capabilities, our continued investment in technology and digital capabilities and our industry leading brand. All of these factors combined will allow us to deliver an unmatched experience that we believe will be the future of car buying.","Now, we'll be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","At this time we'll be conducting our question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer. Brian, your line is open.","Brian Nagel","Congrats on the launch in Atlanta.","Bill Nash","Thank you.","Brian Nagel","So I wanted to ask my one question. I just wanted to focus on the comps trend. And you gave us a nice color there with regard to the impact of the Huston boost last year. So the question I have is -- the one when we look at Huston, could you help us understand better when that happened? How that -- when that happened in the quarter? Was there also some type of benefit in the prior quarter? And then recognizing you don't give or provide guidance. But as we look into the fiscal fourth quarter, we're now cycling pass a negative eight. So how should we think about the trade rate a bit -- the trend of business against that negative eight. So is it as simple as that is now is a very easy comparison? Or is it something that other servicing corpse we should think about when modeling against that number? Thanks.","Bill Nash","Yes, Brian, let me first -- so let\u2019s talk a little bit about Houston. So if you remember last year, in the third quarter, we did recognize and call out that the comps were driven by the performance in the Houston market. And truthfully, we feel like we did an unbelievable job leveraging our strengths, our infrastructure, our transportation network to get vehicles down there to customers that needed them. And we facilitated through reductions in transportation and a lot of free transfer. So that obviously gave us a boost last year. That\u2019s why we -- and we called it out last year, we call it out again this year. I think one of the things I didn\u2019t have in my opening remarks is that, I think it\u2019s still interesting to notice. We\u2019re still experiencing a very unusual pricing environment. And really, since the Hurricanes, prices have been elevated. And it's started in last year\u2019s third quarter, if you remember. But even as recently this quarter that we just finished, there are some interesting pricing dynamics that in part of the quarter, we saw some flat to maybe a slight appreciation, which you normally don\u2019t see this time of year. So I think there\u2019s some pricing dynamics that are coming into play, which also impacts the new versus late model used car gap, which has been fairly consistent. It\u2019s little bit up, little bit down. I would say from what we can tell is fairly consistent. So I think those factors are playing into what we\u2019re seeing right now as well.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli from RBC. Scot, your line is open.","Scot Ciccarelli","So Bill, you guys are launching your digital strategy or omni-channel strategy in Atlanta. And I would think that should help level of point view [ph] again some of your online competitors. But how do you expect to improve CarMax's pricing or positioning from a value perspective through the marketplaces like CarGurus. I mean, they have -- CarGurus, if you look at them, they have something like 5.5 million vehicles on their site, lot of dealers are using them. And if you do a scan of kind of CarMax vehicles through CarGurus window, if you will, CarMax doesn\u2019t show up as with a lot of great deals and good deals the way they segmented. And how do you guys plan to or do you plan to try and address that challenge, if you will?","Bill Nash","Okay. Scot, yes, let me first just talk a little bit about our pricing. I mean you follow us for a long time. We\u2019re very focused on the price and how it compares to all the competitors. I mean, after all, you can\u2019t sell more than 700,000 cars a year with uncompetitive prices. And we look at those pricing in a bunch of different ways with this mark-to-market versus competitors versus wholesale prices. And we\u2019re constantly doing some pricing elasticity test.","Now in regards to CarGurus, there\u2019s lots of vehicle listing services out there. And I think those sites have made it easier for dealers to get their cars out there and view that. And I think they made it easier for consumers to search. Absolutely, they\u2019ve done that. We use some of the listing services to complement our website, which is really kind of an economic exercise for us if that gives us the right ROI. The one thing on the listing site is they aren\u2019t always good, maybe for research, for example, being able to compare the quality of the car. So I think that scenario where we can continue to make sure that we do a better job calling out not only the quality of our cars, but the value adds of the options that we have and change up our messing a little bit and change up our merchandising the way we have it on the website, and continue to work with the listing companies to help call out the quality because not every car on those listing sites -- they're all very different. And so -- at times it does make it difficult to compare because the quality of the car just may not be the same.","Scot Ciccarelli","So specifically, how do you plan to change that or change whether it's on the marketplace or like -- is it a pricing change? Is it some sort of messaging or marketing like, I guess I'm just curious in terms of broad picture, how do you plan to change it?","Bill Nash","Yes, as far as the pricing change, look, like I talked about earlier, we're looking at prices all time, we think we're very competitive. There's a lots been written about our pricing highlights to the competitors. And what I would encourage folks to do is if you go out and do the analysis and make sure that you truly do an apples-to-apples comparison, not just look at make model but look at make model trim with the options and mileage stands, what you'll find is that we're very competitive. In a lot of cases we beat competitors and in some cases we're less than competitors. And the difference that you're talking about is not that significant. But as far as getting that price perception out there, I think we can do at a combination of ways in both how we merchandise our vehicles on the website and calling attention to whether it's options that are on certain cars and what value that adds or reconditioning that we've done to the car was specific value-adds of what's been put into that car. So I think it's going to be also -- it also be a combination of how we advertise the quality message in addition to working with some of the listing agencies that we work with to figure out how to call it out a little bit better.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sharon Zackfia with William Blair. Sharon, your line is open.","Sharon Zackfia","I guess I wanted to ask a question about the kind of a longer-term algorithm for CarMax, which I think, historically had kind of been based on that 4 to 7 comp. And I think you just mentioned earlier that you need to be kind of at the higher end of the mid-single digit to leverage SG&A. But when I look over the last five years, you guys only kind of hit that 4 to 7, maybe once or twice on an annual basis. Is there something happening where you think 4 to 7 is not the right number going forward either investments being made in the business, where you think there is a reacceleration and sustainable comp going forward? I'm just trying to reconcile the last five years with that longer-term guidance?","Bill Nash","Yes, Sharon. So if you go back to FY '17 and FY '18, and both those years -- half of the quarters were in that range, in the 5 to 8 range. We saw it slow down last year when you get to the third quarter with the hurricane in the marketplace spike. I still believe at longer-term, that's absolutely a target that we should be shooting for. And I think things like making sure that we have the best experience and put the customer in the driver seat with things like omni-channel, I think will help to continue us to get there.","Sharon Zackfia","Can I ask a follow-up for that? I mean, do you feel like -- so oftentimes when you see the comps flow like that or you're hitting the target half the time, the competitive gap may have narrowed vis-a-vis the others. And I know on imagery, maybe you're a little bit behind on the internet you're catching up there. Are there any particular areas of focus that kind of lighten that gap for CarMax relative to the competition again?","Bill Nash","Yes, look, I think in any given quarter, I mean, the competition is absolutely robust. It's been robot for a while. Look, we're in a great industry, and we would always expect competition and now certainly is no different. I think sometimes the competition is rational, sometimes it may be a little irrational. As far as specific things, I think, our whole investment that we've been doing over the last couple years is both in our website, in our associate systems, in the experience that we're giving to the customer. That's what we've been focused on to continue to make sure we lead the industry. And I would say that's what our near-term focus is on because we do see customers wanting a better experience. We have a great in-store experience and the folks -- and make sure we're all clear. The majority of our customers still want to come into the store at this point. But we're seeing the trend where a lot of customers want to do more and be equipped and empowered on their own, but they still want the help. They just want it on their terms and their timing and that's what we're really focused on.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Craig Kennison with Baird. Craig, your line is open.","Craig Kennison","Question is on your advertising message. With the omni-channel rollout underway, does CarMax need to change its advertising message to tell that story? And specifically, what are you doing in Atlanta with respect to advertising to get that omni-channel message out?","Bill Nash","We absolutely need to change up the advertising a little bit, and we have done that. We started the new advertising campaign recently in Atlanta. And what we're focused on is making sure that the consumer understands that all the greatness that they know about CarMax up to this point is still there that we have an even better offering. So the real idea of putting the customer in the driver's seat, whichever way is their way is the way that the car buying will be. And that's what the focus has been on Atlanta, drawing the strengths of our stores, drawing the strengths of the digital technology that we've been investing in and drawing the strengths to our knowledgeable and skilled associates. So yes, the answer of your question is we have changed it up and I would expect that to continue to evolve over time.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line Seth Basham with Wedbush. Seth, your line is open.","Seth Basham","My question is around CAF. If you can provide some color Tom, on what's happening with Tier 3 and the declining penetration there that will be helpful.","Tom Reedy","Yes. So as I mentioned in my prepared comments, Seth, one thing we've got to keep in mind is with Tier 3 performance it's a combination of both what they're doing with the applications they see and the nature of the applications that they see as well, because they're -- after CarMax takes a look at it and Tier 3 takes a look at it, they're seeing whatever manages to move down to their space. And so as I mentioned on the call, we've seen some very strong performance as it relates to conversion of the applications viewed in the Tier 2 space, which is a good thing for us, because, as you know, we make significantly more money on the Tier 2 sales than we do in the Tier 3. And they're more likely to converting into sales because in general, the terms are a little bit better. So that's very positive for us though. What that sometimes it relates to is we're promoting customers from the Tier 3 space into the Tier 2 space meaning the Tier 3 sees a little bit less that there may be a little bit less robust mixed than they normally do. So they have, I would say, different pool to work with depending on what's going on with Tier 2. And this quarter, as I mentioned in the call, overall conversion was consistent with what we did last year, which means of the applications they saw they converted alike amount to last year just means that the nature and quantity that they saw didn't quite get there. So overall, between Tier 2 and Tier 3, we're very happy with our lending partners and the performance and they're doing good bias.","Seth Basham","That's helpful. And as a follow-up, looking at your loan loss performance, that was pretty good this quarter better than we expected. Or during on some of your securitizations 2018-2, I'm just sorry, 2018-3, returning to the elevated delinquency trends, are you concerned at all about the trends that we\u2019re seeing there?","Tom Reedy","No. I think if you look at the most recent venues, it\u2019s too early to make any judgment. But, overall in the portfolio, you\u2019re right, the delinquencies are little harder than last year, but we seen losses consistent to a little bit better. So as we\u2019ve talked couple -- we\u2019re trying to originate a portfolio that has accumulative net loss somewhere in the 2% to 2.5% range. We\u2019re very comfortable that we\u2019re trending within that range, and that\u2019s the goal and make sure it's financeable in the securitization mark. Feel good about all of that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Montani with MoffettNathanson. Michael, your line is open.","Michael Montani","Just wanted to ask on the other overhead costs bucket, there was 15% increase there. So I wanted to understand a little bit better, was that driven by the multi-channel initiative in Atlanta? And if that is the case, how should we think about that evolving over the course of the year as you guys expand more rapidly into other markets?","Bill Nash","Yes, Michael. That increase is directly tied to our initiatives whether it\u2019s the omni-channel it\u2019s also some work we\u2019re doing on the platforms. It\u2019s really the thing that we\u2019ve been talking about for a period of time. And as far as going forward, like I said, we were going to continue to invest and the SG&A leverage point that we talked about in the past is still where we think we need to be in order to leverage that.","Michael Montani","Can you share anything maybe to that end about the early learnings that you\u2019ve had in Charlotte and potential comp list that you would have seen from some of the initiatives there? How should we think about that as we look to Atlanta for validation of the strategy?","Bill Nash","What I would tell you is Charlotte is not a good example to draw comparisons because the Charlotte offering is very different than what we have in the Atlanta offering. So, for example, one big thing is, it was a totally different website experience. Atlanta, we have a whole new website experience, which allows the customer progress. We didn\u2019t have that in Charlotte. Charlotte has really been the test market for us where we\u2019ve done a lot more things manual behind the scene. So, and in the early days, we really were just kind of pushing some folks over there so we could operationally figure it out. So I think we really don\u2019t have a good comparison to go off of at this point. And look, it\u2019s obviously very early in the rollout to Atlanta. But as I said in my remarks, our customers and our associates like it. Conversion on ones that we have done on delivery is higher than what you see in conversion in the stores, which is to be expected, finance penetration is roughly the same as you see in the store. So we\u2019ve seen some things early, but again, it\u2019s very, very early.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of James Albertine with Consumer Edge. James, your line is open.","James Albertine","At the risk -- and I understand to your prior comments, it\u2019s very early, but when we think about the white paper some time ago and the -- so trajectory of CarMax as a growing brick-and-mortar strategy, clearly, you\u2019re learning now very rapidly about the benefits of omni-channel. If we think, maybe a little bit longer term, maybe kind of 3 to 5 year outlook, are we at a point now what we can say that CarMax can grow perhaps even faster with digital or omni-channel presence as opposed to primary focus on brick-and-mortar? And in so doing, is there a line of sight to an SG&A per unit level as steady-state that can be lower and a CapEx rate at steady state that can be lower relative to your brick-and-mortar strategy as you continue to gain share via omni-channel?","Bill Nash","Yes, James, what I'll tell you is, first of all, omni-channel can only be enabled with our brick-and-mortar strategy. You have to have a great network of stores. If you don't, you really can't bring omni-channel a like-for-like, which is putting the customer in the driver seat. I think it's a little early on the SG&A side, like I said in the opening remarks. I think here in the near-term, we're going to be a little inefficient on the omni-channel, because we want to get it right. We want it to be a great customer experience, we want it to be a great associate experience, but we've also identified cost levers that we can pull that will offset those costs. So what I'm telling you is we need to learn some more to be able to definitively say, hey, is this going to be a cheaper cost structure or not? But we're encouraged by the progress that we've made, and we're encouraged by the progress we think we can still make.","James Albertine","If I can follow-up on that point, and I know you've never put a line in the sand and we've always kind of talked about, everyone has got their own sort of estimates. Is it 300 stores at maturity? Is it something greater or is it something lower? Maybe, can I push you to make a comment to the extent that may be the algorithm, as you're learning about omni-channel? So as your omni-channel accelerating -- you're favoring the under versus the over, right? So ultimately at maturity, you're going to need fewer stores over time. Is that a fair comment at this point?","Bill Nash","Well, I think the longest time we said we're going to open 200 to 300 stores, if you remember. Well, you can take 200 off, since we just opened that this week. As far as the upper end, I'm cautious on saying what the end state is. Look, I think we can add -- we have plenty of potential to add additional stores. I would just caution to say -- let's better understand the omni-channel. It would be great to be able to deliver more units out of existing footprint. So if our digital initiatives allow us to leverage our stores in ways more efficiently than we have in the past that could ultimately cut down or maybe some smaller footprint stores, I think that's a win. So I guess my short answer is we have room to continue to grow stores. But we also want to make sure we're growing market share in the most effective way possible. We've said we're -- we've already announced we'd open between 13 and 16 stores while, obviously come back in the fourth quarter update that will be in that range. But let's give omni a little bit more chance to see what we can do in existing market.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Murphy with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. John, your line is open.","Aileen Smith","Good morning. This is Aileen Smith on for John. Another question on the omni-channel initiative. I realized it maybe early days on this. But can you give a little bit of color on the economics you expect for the omni-channel model? Should we be thinking about this business once it reaches the sustainable level on scale as gross profit per unit for vehicles sold through omni-channel is being similar to vehicles sold through the physical footprint? And how do you --SG&A and other expenses compare across those according to your estimates?","Bill Nash","Yes, I think, obviously it's a little early. I think on the omni-channel, we have opportunities to optimize our staff. I think we have opportunity in transportation, I think we have opportunity in the compensation, our store roles. So while there are some incremental expenses right now on the actual delivery of vehicles, like I said earlier, we had the opportunity to pull on some leverage to offset them. And I don't see any reason at this point where GPU has to change. It has to change. But again, we're -- it's early on in the process. And keep in mind, we've only had this for a partial month of the quarter.","Aileen Smith","Yes, absolutely. And just a quick follow-up to that. On optimizing the staff and transportation some of the other things you mentioned and the target that you'll get a majority of your markets, this rolled out by February 2020. Should we be thinking about that as the timeline where some of those efficiencies are realized or is this a longer dated dynamic?","Bill Nash","We're actively working on it right now. It'll be right in tandem.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Healy with the Northcoast Research. John, your line is open. ","John Healy","Bill, I just wanted to ask just your view on markets outside of Atlanta for the omni-channel offering. I know you guys have said February 2020 that you would have the rollout completed. So over the next 15 months, how fast should we expect additional markets to come online? And as you enter into new markets like Buffalo for instance, will you be watching omni-channel simultaneously with the brick-and-mortar store? So just trying to understand kind of the pace from here.","Bill Nash","Yes. So I just wanted to -- I want to clarify something. So we will have the majority of our customers being able to experience it by February 2020. As I said in the opening remarks, one of the things that we need to continue to do is expand our footprint on customer experience centers. We're actively looking at that right now for the next locations. And part of that is going to be dependent on state regulations. So for example, there are some states if you're involved in the selling activity, which your customer experience consultants are, they would require those folks to be licensed in the state, further complicated, if some of those states have requirements that those people physically come and get their license in those states. So that's an example of things that we're working through right now to figure out, okay, how many CTCs do we need, where the next CTC is going to be? As far as your question that we're going to roll it out with the new stores, we did not roll it out with Buffalo, we did not roll it out with Melbourne. We're going to roll it out in a very systematic way that makes sense for us. And we'll have more information on that next quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rick Nelson with Stephens. Rick, your line is open.","Rick Nelson","Curious if you do anything different from a pricing standpoint when you launch in the Atlanta market and to try to drive share and mind share?","Bill Nash","Yes. Rick, we're constantly doing pricing tests all the time. And I would say the Atlanta just falls in that bucket with everything else that we're doing when we look at doing pricing test.","Rick Nelson","And you chose Atlanta because you mentioned it's an older market, high market share. Are those the types of markets that we should expect just to rollout to going forward?","Bill Nash","As far as the order, again, it's a little early to tell. The other thing that's interesting about Atlanta is that we have six stores that are pretty much in the suburbs of Atlanta. So we kind of surround the perimeter. And we certainly looked at as a good opportunity to say, okay, can we get better penetration inside the perimeter of Atlanta? And I think this is a good -- a good test to be able to do that?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Seth Sigman with Credit Suisse. Seth, your line is open.","Seth Sigman","I wanted to talk a little bit about the shift in the business that you\u2019ve seen over the last couple of quarters with zero to four being lower again in Q3, and obviously a little bit worse in Q2. I know, you noted, that\u2019s where you\u2019re seeing some of the impact from that new versus used pricing gap although that\u2019s been the case for a few quarters now. So I\u2019m just curious, are there any other factors that could be driving that maybe the hurricane from last year? Does that have a disproportionate impact on zero to four? So you can address that. And then just the second part of the question is around pricing. And what do you think is still driving that gap, and if there\u2019s any signs of sort of normalization of that depreciation cycle? Thank you.","Bill Nash","Yes, Seth. So if you look at our average selling price, it went up again. And that\u2019s because our acquisition price is up. Now, I did know in my opening remarks that we had a bigger percent of customers moving into the older vehicles, which would inherently take your average selling price down. But it wasn\u2019t enough to lower the sales price plus we had additional increases in higher class cars, which is why the pricing went up. There\u2019s a lot going on in the market right now. There\u2019s a lot of noise. I think some of the dynamics we're saying still some carryover from. And again, this is just my belief, is carried over from some of the conversation around tariffs, what\u2019s going to happen to pricing, and there\u2019s just a lot of things going on in the news. And I think consumers are thinking about monthly payments and thinking about if I\u2019m going to buy a car, how much do I want to get into? So again, it\u2019s dynamics that we\u2019ve seen in the past and we\u2019ll continue to work through them.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Armintas Sinkevicius with Morgan Stanley. Armintas, your line is open.","Armintas Sinkevicius","I was curious when we start to see the omni-channel starts to flow through the financials that probably shows up in same-store sales growth as you drive better penetration in your existing markets. For the model to meet your return hurdle rates, what sort of impact should we thinking about for same-store sales? And then also, what\u2019s the cost to launch a new market for omni-channel versus a new market in a brick-and-mortar fashion? And what do you have to open up for an omni-channel market to be launched? Is it -- you mentioned the customer experience center, but is it thing sort of proximate transportation in that sort of thing? That would be helpful.","Bill Nash","Yes. So first of all, the omni-channel experience. This is all about the customer and putting them in the driver seat. We\u2019re doing this because this is where the customer is going, and this is where we want to make sure we get ahead of. So I don\u2019t really think about as the incremental cost is doing it. I think about it as, hey, we want to be the best when it comes to serving our customers. And I\u2019m sorry, what was the second part of your question?","Armintas Sinkevicius","The second part was what we\u2019re trying to -- you sort of expecting to or what sort of impact do we see those as same-store sales to meet the hurdle rate on return side for the omni-channel experience?","Bill Nash","Yes. I think the way you should think about success in the short-term for Omni, first is it's getting this experience everywhere and evolving it to make sure that the best experience for both our customers and associates. That is the near-term goal. And then, in tandem, we want to execute it the most effectively, efficiently that we can. So we\u2019re going to be working on that. Now, all of this obviously is to increase market share over time. But I really don't want to get any more specific at this point given that we just haven't had much experience with it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Colin Ducharme with Sterling Capital. Colin, your line is open.","Colin Ducharme","Questions have been answered. Thank you.","Bill Nash","Thank you, Colin.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Whiston with Morningstar. David, your line is open.","David Whiston","I know I'm probably little early in asking this. But I'm just curious with some of the chatter going around in the financial prospect perhaps due to the withholding law change the tax refunds maybe a bit disappointing. Are you considering -- how are you factoring that in the planning? What kind of inventory levels you want in March and April?","Bill Nash","Yes. I think that's the big question is where are the tax refunds? We're obviously going to follow that very closely. I think we have shown over time that we manage our inventory very, very well and can meet the customer needs. And I would say, I think we're in a great position. But we're also looking at the same things that you are to better understand how my tax refunds impact the upcoming quarter and the quarter beyond.","David Whiston","And as a follow-up on the current sourcing environment, are you having any issues with perhaps quality late model vehicles not ever making it to auction because they're selling -- staying at the dealer level as they come off lease?","Bill Nash","No. We are not having any issues with obtaining inventory -- quality inventory.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Chris Bottiglieri with Wolfe Research. Chris, your line is open","Chris Bottiglieri","Consider a very ambitious rollout target to cover all the markets next few years given Atlanta appears to be your first real attempt at this. So I was hoping if you can maybe walk us through the mechanics in the market conversion. Just help us understand where you see down at the market level to even allow last mile delivery or online retailing? And then what are the bottlenecks of the corporate size to all these capabilities?","Bill Nash","Yes. So one of the things we've talked about already is the CEC, the customer experiences centers. We have to stand those up. That really takes we call e-Office shifts out of the stores. So right now, the sales consultant that works in our stores works both the e-Office and they work on the floor. They have shifts for both our customer experience centers take to e-Office shift out. As far as the delivery fees, we obviously have vans that are taking the vehicles out. The way we rollout Atlanta is probably going to be a little bit different from that perspective as far as how we staff those and leverage associates in the existing stores. We're the first rollout to get it out there. Now, we're really fine tuning what the future rollouts will be. And truthfully, I think we'll get better and better and more efficient as we as we do more.","Chris Bottiglieri","And then, I guess, separately, it's very early you expect to see more dynamic. I guess, what gave you the confidence in the first place such as -- such an aggressive target for the rollout rather than maybe proven that it works before setting that? I guess how much flexibility is there on that timeline? Thank you.","Bill Nash","Well, keep in mind, we've been testing and talking to consumers for the last couple years. This is something that just didn't happen overnight. And it's one of the reasons we've taken the time that we have to really understand what the customer wants. And that's what this is about. It's all about where the customer is going, what they're looking for. So I do feel that it's an aggressive rollout given the new capability that you're going to introduce, but I also feel that it's very doable.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer. Brian, your line is open.","Brian Nagel","So as my follow-up, I wanted maybe show up two questions -- two quick questions together. But first up, with regard to expenses, as we've talked a lot about it in the call, the ongoing reinvestment in the company, if I'm not -- if I'm correct here in the fiscal third quarter look like expense growth slowed. So I just and I can't recall if you discussed it in the prepared comments. So any color around that that's right in third quarter whether that means this trend going forward? And then my second question is just on the buyback and not that long ago you announced pretty substantial additional buyback. Your stock with the market has been hit here. How are you thinking about philosophically towards fulfilling that buyback? Thanks.","Bill Nash","Yes. So Brian, on the expenses slowing the third quarter. So keep in mind, when the sales down you are going to have a little bit of hiccup from variable, because you won't have as much variable. But in addition to that, we feel good because we've gotten -- we've rolled out -- we've been focused on SG&A as well as cost to good sold, we've done some staffing optimization, so there's some good guys in that as well. So not only we continue to invest all along I've said, there's going to be incremental expenses we're going to invest, but it shouldn't all the incremental. We should challenge ourselves to find offset. So I feel good about that. As far as buybacks, look, we think it's a great way to give back to the shareholders. We, just as Tom talked about earlier, have authorization to do some more. And we'll continue to do that.","Tom Reedy","Yes, Brian, we've talked about this before. We structured the program to get a little bit more aggressive when the valuation is down, and a little bit more conservative looks like the valuation is high relative to what our research. And as you can see during the quarter, we brought back more than we did in Q2 for that very purpose. So we're aware of -- very aware of what our stock price is doing. And we -- as we plan to buyback programmatically, that's kind of the way the guardrails work. We also have the ability to do additional as we see it be the right thing.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Colin Ducharme with Sterling Capital. Colin, your line is open. ","Bill Nash","Hello?","Colin Ducharme","That was on mute. Just kidding. I did think of one. Bill, I had a quick question for you. What metrics are you going to be using over the ensuing months to help you throttle the cadence of the omni-channel rollout? Thanks.","Bill Nash","Sure, Colin. So I think we're going to be looking at variety of metrics. We're looking at how well it's received by our customers. I think we're going to be looking at how well we do on conversion? How it impacts the store performance? The expenses, how efficiently we can do it? What are the levers? There isn't any one single, because this is such a new thing. We have a whole host of different things that we're going to be looking at over the ensuing months to make sure that, one, we're giving the best experience; two, we're doing it the most efficiently; and three, that we're ultimately driving market share.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session.

My name is Victoria, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the CarMax Fiscal 2018 Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you.","I would now like to turn the call over to Katharine Kenny, Vice President, Investor Relations.","Katharine Kenny","Hi. Good morning and thank you for joining our fiscal 2018 second quarter earnings conference call. On the call with me today as usual are Bill Nash, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Tom Reedy, our Executive Vice President and CFO.","Before we begin, let me remind you that our statements today regarding the Company\u2019s future business plans, prospects and financial performance are forward-looking statements that we make pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are based on management\u2019s current knowledge and assumptions about future events that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. In providing projections and other forward-looking statements, the Company disclaims any intent or obligation to update them.","For additional information on important factors that could affect these expectations, please see the Company\u2019s annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2017 filed with the SEC.","Before I turn the call over to Bill, let me thank you again in advance for asking only one question and a follow-up before getting back in the queue. Bill?","Bill Nash","Thank you, Katharine, and good morning, everyone.","We are pleased to report another strong quarter. As always, I will talk about the quarterly results including the impact of Hurricane Harvey, then I will turn the call over to Tom to review financing after which I will comment on our initiatives as well as share some information on Hurricane Irma.","Our used unit comps for the second quarter increased by 5.3% and total used units grew by 11.1%. Used unit comps continue to be driven by strong store execution as well as enhancements to the online customer experience, both of which support an increase in conversion. The impact of higher conversion on comps was partially offset by the effects of lower store traffic.","As you may recall, Harvey hit Houston during the last week of our second quarter. CarMax\u2019s first priority will always be the safety and wellbeing of our associates. We have approximately 1,000 associates in the Houston area and while all of them are safe now, many were affected by the hurricane. We supported them with financial assistance through our Associate Disaster Relief Fund and provided them pay for the regularly scheduled shifts while the stores were closed. In addition, we sent emergency supply to Houston as soon as possible to support associates and their families. All six of our stores in the Houston market were closed for the last 5.5 working days of the quarter. Five of the Houston stores reopened on Friday September 1st with relatively little damage. Our Gulf Freeway store remained closed until Friday September 8th.","We estimate the impact to our comps to these closures was small and as we said in the past, weather can delay sales but we generally expect to make them up in future periods. This event reminded me once again of the incredible value of our national footprint and our nationwide transportation network. We have been able to leverage both as damaged vehicles needed to be removed and replaced with vehicles from other markets to quickly support the needs of our customers.","Now, I\u2019ll update you on some more of the numbers. In the quarter, we were pleased to see website traffic growth of 17%, which we believe was partially result of our efforts in SEO. Gross profit per used unit remained consistent at $2,178 compared to $2,160 in the second quarter of last year. Our wholesale units grew slightly in the second quarter. The growth in our store base and an increase in buy rates were offset by the continuation of lower appraisal traffic. Gross profit for wholesale unit increased to $950 compared to $870 in last year\u2019s second quarter, largely due to a favorable depreciation environment in this second quarter.","A few other topics and I\u2019ll turn the call over to Tom. As a percentage of our sales mix, zero to four-year old vehicles increased to 80% versus about 76% in last year\u2019s second quarter. As a percent of sales, large and medium SUVs and trucks rose to 27%, which is similar to last quarter but up from about 25% in last year\u2019s second quarter.","On SG&A, expenses for the quarter increased almost 11% to $405 million. This represents a year-over-year reduction of $9 per unit in SG&A. Several factors impacted SG&A growth including the 12% or 19-store increase in our base since the beginning of second quarter of last year, higher variable cost due to our increased sales, and an increase of about $16 million in our accrual for incentive pay. Remember that last year, we disclosed the measurable reduction in SG&A related to incentive pay. These were partially offset by an $11.4 million decrease in share-based compensation expense which was largely due to comping over the $10.9 million retirement related expense for our former CEO, recorded in last year\u2019s second quarter.","As we previously discussed, we continue to invest heavily in technology and digital initiatives to improve the customer experience. SG&A expense was in line with our expectations in the second quarter but recall that the first quarter saw the benefit from favorable expense timing, some of which could materialize later in the year. Lastly, during the second quarter, we opened three stores, one in the Hartford market, one in San Francisco and one in Salisbury, Maryland. During the third quarter, we plan to open five stores, one will open in Tyler, Texas, which is a new market for us, the other four stores are in current markets including Philadelphia which we just opened a couple of days ago, Las Vegas, San Francisco and Seattle.","Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Tom.","Tom Reedy","Thanks, Bill. Good morning, everybody. CAF net penetration was 43.5% compared to 45.3% last year\u2019s second quarter. We continue to see overall growth in credit applications, but more pronounced at the high and low end of the credit spectrum. Remember, last year, we were seeing measurable growth in credit applications at the higher end of the credit spectrum and a decline in application volume at the lower end.","Tier 2 financing represented 16% of sales compared to 17.5% in last year\u2019s second quarter, and third-party Tier 3 grew modestly to 9.6% of used unit sales, this compared to 9% for the same period last year. We also continue to see growth in sales where customer paid cash or brought their own financing; that was up to 25.4%, as you can see in the table in the release.","CAF net loan originated during the quarter rose 7.5% year-over-year to $1.5 billion. This was due to CarMax sales growth and an increase in average amount financed, partially offset by the lower penetration. CAF income increased 12.5% to $107.9 million, driven by the 10.6% growth in average managed receivables and a lower loss provision. This was partially offset by slight compression in the portfolio interest margin.","Total portfolio interest margin was 5.8% of average managed receivables compared to 5.9% in the second quarter of last year, but consistent with what we reported in the first quarter. The loans originated during the quarter at the weighted average contract rate charged to customers was 7.6% compared to 7.4% a year ago and 7.8% in the first quarter.","The ending allowance for loan losses at about $130 million was 1.15% of ending managed receivables, up from 1.08% in the second quarter of last year but down sequentially from the 1.18% in Q1. As you remember, we were seeing unfavorability in losses over the course of last year.","This quarter\u2019s loss experience is directly in line with our expectations. Losses in Q2 were not affected by Hurricane Harvey and the provision does not include any potential loss experience from weather events as the impacts are unknown at the current time. With regard to our capital structure, during the second quarter, we repurchased 2.5 million shares for $157 million.","Now, turn it back over to Bill.","Bill Nash","Thanks, Tom. We continue to be focused on driving what\u2019s possible through both execution and innovation. We are in a unique position to combine the state-of-the-art online experience with the exceptional customer service our associates are known for. Whether in store or online, we want to give our customers the tools and support to find the perfect car, purchase that car and then receive that car all on their own terms.","Last quarter, we gave you an update on the test of our online appraisal tool. This is a new online tool that allows customers to receive an appraisal value for the vehicle by submitting information online. We rolled out this product to the rest of our Charlotte market stores this past quarter and in the third quarter we plan to expand to more stores in the Midwest.","We\u2019re receiving great feedback from our customers and sales team about this new offering. The purpose of this test is to further learn about the customer demand for online appraisals and to ensure a great experience that is scalable across all stores. We\u2019ll take the learnings from this next round of test to continue to enhance the product and determine when it should be rolled out to more of our stores.","We also shared with you last quarter the progress we\u2019re making in digital merchandising, which is how we showcase our vehicles on carmax.com. In addition to the rollout and improvement of indoor photo studios, we\u2019re expanding our capabilities by offering 360 degree interior photos with zoom capability. We\u2019re now testing this product in vehicles at seven stores. These are just a couple of examples improvements we\u2019re working on.","We will continue to build out our e-commerce capabilities and equip our associates with the right tools to make the entire car buying process simple and seamless, both online and in our stores, and we truly feel that no one is in a better position to do that than us.","Before I open up the line for questions, let me give you a brief update on the impact of Hurricane Irma. We\u2019re pleased to report that all of our stores are open for business. We closed 28 stores, primarily in Florida and Georgia for varying lengths of time in September. And as we previously discussed with weather events, we would expect to realize those sales later.","Now, at this time, we\u2019ll be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Sharon Zackfia with William Blair.","Sharon Zackfia","Hi. Good morning. Just a question on the work you\u2019re doing on the visual, the photography online. I know, you\u2019re kind of in different processes and you just talked about another test that you\u2019re working on. How are you assessing the impact of those tests as it relates to either traffic to the store or conversion? And then, assuming that these are going well, how long would it take to kind of implement better visuals online across the entire system?","Bill Nash","Good morning, Sharon. Yes. So, on those, both the photo booths and the 360 photos, we assess the success of those by clicks on the websites on those particular cars. So, obviously, not all of our photos are done in photo booths. And so, we look at the success, the number of clicks we see on those cars, as well as the conversion of those vehicles compared to other inventory that doesn\u2019t utilize those capabilities. As far as the time that it would take to roll it out, I talked about last quarter, the photo booths, at the time, we already had 16 open; this year, we\u2019re on schedule to get 19 more of those open. And then for the 360, we\u2019ll see. Right now, we already have it in seven stores, and we\u2019ll see how it goes, and we\u2019re still working on the equipment, that kind of thing. So, stay tuned. I can\u2019t really tell you, okay, next quarter will be this number and that number, because we\u2019re still looking at the experiences. We want to make sure, when we roll it out more widely that it meets what we would expect from a CarMax standpoint from exceptional experience.","Sharon Zackfia","And can I just a quick follow-up? So, the photo booths in particular is the rollout pace based on the expense of it or based on you just not being sure of the ROI of it?","Bill Nash","No. I think the rollout is -- we can only handle so many different projects in any one given year, while there is an expense associated with it, that\u2019s not the reason why we aren\u2019t rolling them out quicker. So, we can only -- I mean, we\u2019re adding an additional 19 more this year on a base of 16. It just takes time and resource to get those built.","Tom Reedy","Yes. Sharon, we\u2019re also thinking it up a little bit with just planned rehabs of the stores. ","Bill Nash","Yes. So, on the remodels, we\u2019re doing 10 more full remodels. We\u2019d like to work to photo booths into that and then we go and we choose certain other markets to go back and put the booths in.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer.","Brian Nagel","So, I have couple of questions with regard to the hurricanes. I appreciate the color you gave in your prepared comments. As far as recognizing that you don\u2019t provide guidance, just looking back at history, is there any parameters you can give us to help us understand what type of demand benefit that could come as a result of storms we\u2019ve seen recently, either in Texas or Florida or elsewhere? And then, the second question. You mentioned some of the -- I think you mentioned inventories in prepared comments. Was there damage to cars, vehicles in your inventory and would there be some type of charge that we\u2019d see as a result of that?","Bill Nash","Okay. So, Brian, I\u2019ll talk about the first part. You hit it on the head. We\u2019re not going to provide guidance. What I will tell you is that we are prepared with inventory; we\u2019re prepared, if there is an inflow and extra inflow of vehicles being bought, we\u2019re in great shape to handle that in the markets that were impacted by hurricane. Believe it or not, if you look at that historically, we had the benefit of not having big catastrophic events like this that often. I think the last time, we cited something like this was probably back with Wilma and Rita where we actually talked about it in the call. But, I would just tell you, we\u2019ve positioned ourselves so that we\u2019ll be able to meet any demand that surfaces. As far as were there -- any vehicles were damaged. We had about a 1,000 cars that were damaged that had to be gotten rid of, basically scrapped. And I will let Tom talk a little bit about the expense.","Tom Reedy","Yes. Brian, we\u2019re relatively fortunate in the Houston market, as Bill said, we had a significant number of cars damaged or destroyed but fortunately we do carry insurance for that type of event. And between our deductibles and then out of pocket for property and vehicles that weren\u2019t covered, we had about 1 million bucks of expense in the quarter. So, similar to other kind of catastrophic events that we\u2019ve seen in the past, but that\u2019s about the ballpark we have in there for property.","Brian Nagel","Got it, helpful. And then my follow-up question, with regard to on the finance side, looking at the recent securitization data, the table you provided, it seems as though you\u2019ve been able to recently lift your lending rates. So, the question I have there is I guess to confirm that but also how should we think about the rates which you are charging customers going forward, is this kind of the beginning of the trend, any customer pushback at all in that?","Bill Nash","Yes, you are correct. We talked about this last quarter and I think at the end of last year -- at late last year, we did raise rates pretty much across the board. I think this is the first securitization deal, 2017-3 where you are actually going to start seeing the impact of that and I think you can see the impact in that -- in the spread, if you look at that versus other recent deals. As far as where rates go. I am going to answer that the way that I always answer this for the last seven years, which, our ability to preserve that margin is going to be driven by the market and what\u2019s going on with other lenders. We are constantly looking at how we feel about our competitiveness versus other offers out there. We test rates up, we test rates down. We try to make -- we watch our 3-day payoff rate, we watch conversion of the stores. So, it will be an ongoing analytical exercise.","To the extent rates go up, you could imagine we\u2019ll test increasing, I mean if the [cost of funds][ph] go up, we\u2019ll test increasing APRs, but if it\u2019s going to be detrimental to sales or make us uncompetitive relative to what other competitors are doing, we\u2019ll have to take that into account.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt Fassler with Goldman Sachs.","Matt Fassler","Thanks a lot. Good morning. My first question is actually a follow-up to a point that you just made. So, to the extent that your CAF penetration was down a little bit and the so called other category financing was up by about 250 basis points in terms of penetration, is that a function you think of pricing? Clearly, your pricing in the totality of what CAF is doing is working on a unit basis. But, I am sort of wondering, is it penetration function of that? And also, we did note that the APRs on the new loans while favorably year-to-year did tick down slightly from where you were in Q1. So, if you kind of put that together for us, please?","Bill Nash","Yes. So, I will just kind of run through what we saw coming in the door. As I mentioned, we were barbelled in the credit profile of the customer coming in applying. That means we saw the greatest growth at kind of 700 plus FICO range. So, those folks tend to be the ones that are going to be CAF or can arrange their financing elsewhere. So, Matt, I think some of what we saw was due to just the nature of the volume coming through. We did use some tightening in the quarter that may have impact in last year\u2019s fourth quarter but that may have impacted a bit. But we look very closely at how competitive we think our rates are. Our offers, particularly at the high end I think are still very competitive. And we also track that 3-day payoff rate which is good indicator of whether people like the offers they get from CarMax. That rate is up modestly year-over-year, less than a point, and it\u2019s actually down a little bit sequentially from last quarter. So, I wouldn\u2019t read into that. We\u2019re seeing a lot more people paying off the loans. When I look at it, I just think we\u2019ve got more people that are bringing their own financing to the table whether it\u2019s cash or something else, when they show up to buy the car.","Matt Fassler","And then, my follow-up relates to the Tier 3 piece, up slightly year-on-year. Should we kind of view this now as sort of a reasonable baseline that high-single digit level in terms of sustainable level of Tier 3 penetration?","Bill Nash","Yes. I don\u2019t -- we\u2019ve talked about this before when Tier 3 was significantly higher. It is a business that we look at as incremental. So, I don\u2019t know what the right baseline is? I\u2019d like to see going forward just kind of nice growth across the credit spectrum, because I think that implies the healthy economy and healthy demand environment. But this year\u2019s number is up slightly. As I said, we\u2019re seeing some volume increase in applications down in the spectrum. And remember, last year, we were seeing significant declines in that Tier 3 volume, and last year\u2019s number is a weak number. And this was actually the first quarter where we\u2019re comping over that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets.","Rob Iannarone","Hey, guys. Rob Iannarone on for Scot. Congrats on a good quarter. I was just wondering, you commented that conversion was up and there was a partial offset from the traffic. I was wondering if you can provide any order of magnitude around that. Is it consistent with what we\u2019ve seen in recent quarters?","Bill Nash","Yes. I mean, traffic was down a modest amount, which offset some of the conversion. It\u2019s been similar to recent quarters. ","Rob Iannarone","Great. And just kind of on a different topic. When you think about the online appraisal and other online initiatives including SEO, can you update us on what kind of click through rates you\u2019re seeing?","Bill Nash","Yes. Let me talk a little bit about SEO, because I think we\u2019re really pleased with the growth that we\u2019ve seen there. In the second quarter, our non-brand SEO traffic continued to grow significantly; it was up nearly 250% from a year ago. And on the SEO, what we\u2019ve really been focusing on is really three main things. One, we want to produce more content that links to other site, so putting articles out there to get picked by the folks, so that back linking is very helpful in the ratings. We\u2019ve added in the quarter a few hundred thousand new pages and we continue to add them. So, last quarter, I talked about having a page -- we used to have a Ford F-150 page and we said Ford F-150 Raptor. Now, we\u2019ve got a Ford F-150 Raptor 2016, 2017. Again, the more pages you have, the relevant you\u2019re in the searches.","And then, we also are pleased, we\u2019ve been able to add content and put the content in there. So, Google can actually and the search engines can actually read it and see what we have, which also helps us. So, we\u2019ve been very pleased with what\u2019s been going on with SEO. And we\u2019ll continue that work. And we think there is a lot of opportunity still there.","The other thing I would just say on the earlier piece on the traffic, again, while that store traffic number\u2019s gone down, we really look at it more holistically. And we think about the store traffic, we think about web traffic, which I talked about earlier and the great growth that we\u2019ve had there. We also continue to see double-digit growth on leads, which is great because that gives us something to execute on. So, we feel very good about the momentum that we have when it comes to having possibilities to interact with the customers and turn them into sales.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Craig Kennison with Baird.","Craig Kennison","Yes. Thanks for taking my questions. And this is getting back to the hurricane. With respect to Harvey and all of those flooded vehicles, what controls you have in place to avoid buying any lemons for example?","Bill Nash","Yes. Well, similar to like Katrina, there are going to be a lot of flood vehicles out there. And all of the damaged cars that we had, we actually took them and sold them through. We did not sell them through auctions; we sold them through salvage auctions. Our systems are way more advanced today than they were back at the time of Hurricane Katrina. We know, for example the cars that were on our lot, we\u2019ve got them on our system. So, if they ever pop up somewhere else, we\u2019ll know not to purchase them. Now, they should all be marked salvage, so they shouldn\u2019t pop up somewhere else. But the same thing for other vehicles, other vehicles that are marked salvage, we know that information and then when we\u2019re at auctions or if they come to our appraisal lane, our systems will alert our buyers to the fact that hey this vehicle was at some point salvage.","The other thing that I would tell you is -- and this is where our more than 1,000 skilled buyers come into play, there could be some cars out there that slipped through the cracks and didn\u2019t get salvage, not our vehicles but ones that come in our appraisal lane. And our buyers are skilled and trained to be able to identify those vehicles. There is telltale times that they can look for and I think that\u2019s a huge competitive advantage to make sure that we don\u2019t end up buying any of those that might fall through the cracks of the data analytics.","Craig Kennison","Thanks. And my follow-up is on the extended protection plan growth, you\u2019ve seen I think more rapid growth in that category than even your car sales growth. And curious what\u2019s driving that and if there is a change in consumer behavior, or you\u2019re changing the way you are marketing that to consumers?","Bill Nash","Yes. I think the way to characterize it is that that number is going to move around a little bit every quarter because like the CarMax Auto Finance business, we put a reserve on that thing for returns. And then, some quarters you might see mildly favorable return experience, some quarters mildly negative; the last couple have been mildly favorable. So, there is a little bit of a tailwind on that number due to the return reserve percentage. But in general, it\u2019s grown with the pace of growth of sales. And that\u2019s how I think about it over the longer term.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Murphy with Bank of America.","John Murphy","Good morning. Just sort of a multipart single question here, so I\u2019ll try to keep it simple. You talked about lower store traffic, but I\u2019m just curious if you wrap it together with the 17% increase in website traffic, if you think in total your eyeballs or interaction with consumers were flat to up. As we think about that in the context of your online appraisals where you being kind of ticked off with the consumer spending more time online as opposed to coming into the showroom?","Bill Nash","Yes. I think the way you should about it is we do know, first of all, 9 out of 10 of the customers buy from a start their search online and interact with us on the digital properties. I do absolutely feel like customers are coming to the stores more prepared. So, for example, they know that they\u2019re going to need a step; they bring it with them versus coming in and having to leave. Certain things like that would actually cause your store traffic because we count it by being braced would actually cause it to go down or innovation like the online finance prequalification. There may be some customers that go online and realize I can\u2019t afford a new used car and it keeps them from coming into the store where they would have come in before, sales consultants would have spent time with them only to find out that they weren\u2019t eligible to buy a car. So, in some senses, I would expect because of our innovation, the traffic would go down, as we continue to innovate and make more of the functionality available online. So, again, I\u2019m pleased with where we are, if I think about the touch points that we have with customers, whether it\u2019s in the store or whether it\u2019s online.","John Murphy","And then, maybe just a follow-up, when we think about it, I mean, it does sound like that may eat into year ability to bid on vehicles in the appraisal lane there and you may need to source more auctions. Do you think that may be the case, and as we think about profitability from sourcing vehicles on trading or appraisal versus the auction, is there a big delta in GPU there?","Bill Nash","We\u2019ve talked about our appraisal lane vehicles history have always been more profitable than the offsite. As far as, I think, if I understand your question, really asking about the online appraisals and how we think that\u2019s going to manifest itself. Is that the question?","John Murphy","Well, I\u2019m just trying to understand, because it seems like, your ability to convert appraisals or what are the online or in store from the consumer versus what you\u2019re be doing at auction going forward might shift. I\u2019m just curious, if that\u2019s the case.","Bill Nash","Yes. I don\u2019t mean -- we\u2019re not intending that shift. I mean, we think that the online appraisal offering is just another way to reach out to customers that maybe we wouldn\u2019t have gotten before and also enhance the customer experience, so folks know what their vehicle is worth, prior to coming into the store, prior to selling it. So, the way I look at it is it\u2019s really an extension to generate more appraisals. Look, we had 11% growth in sales. When you have double-digit growth in sales like that. You\u2019re going to have to obviously rely on offsite. I would tell you, I think there is a lot of good offsite buys out there. It\u2019s the number of year to four year all cars coming into the auction lanes is higher than it has been in the past and I think it will continue to be that way. So, I don\u2019t see a real change in the dynamics. I think we\u2019ll continue to go after as many appraisal buys as we can and then we\u2019ll supplement with whatever need through outside channels.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Levin with Deutsche Bank.","Mike Levin","Talked about rolling out the online appraisals to the Midwest. Just wanted to see, if you give a little bit of color around what sort of traffic uplift you\u2019ve seen in the test markets. And how you\u2019re expecting that to play out with the larger rollout?","Bill Nash","No. It\u2019s too early to talk about that Mike, at this point. I mean, like I said in my opening remarks. It seems to be well received by customers; our sales folk, sales teams are very pleased with it, but it\u2019s too early to tell which is another reason why we\u2019re going to roll it to some additional stores.","Mike Levin","And just want to see if you can give a little bit of color from your perspective on what you\u2019re seeing in the kind of just overall used pricing environment following all the storms, what you\u2019re thinking about in terms of scrappage coming out of Harvey as well as Irma?","Bill Nash","I think for the longest time, people have said that the sky is falling, when it comes to used car pricing and there is going to be a big drop in used car prices. While we are seeing some acquisition prices more favorable, like this quarter our ASPs actually went up, and that\u2019s the combination of acquisition price going down a little bit, but then our mix impacting it to go up. So having more zero to four-year old cars, having more large SUVs and trucks. I think what we\u2019ll continue to see is we\u2019ll continue to see more late model cars entering into the marketplace. It\u2019s hard to tell, what the two storms, this is lots of different numbers, I think anywhere from 0.5 million to 1 million cars. And you go to wonder of that, how many of them are actually going to be replaced. So, I think, it\u2019s little early to tell us as far as what impact this is going to have on the overall market. I will tell you -- and I mentioned in the opening remarks, the depreciation environment has absolutely been more favorable. It\u2019s more representative of what we saw two years ago, which is one of the reasons why our wholesale margin is up over last year. So, I think it\u2019s little too early to tell us as far as the storms go as to what impact it\u2019s going to have on values.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities.","Seth Basham","Thanks a lot and good morning. My first question is just on digital leads. You talked about continued double-digit growth, but is that figure accelerating or decelerating?","Bill Nash","It\u2019s pretty consistent with what\u2019s it\u2019s been the last few quarters. That\u2019s double-digit and it\u2019s a little bit more than the website traffic growth that we saw.","Seth Basham","Got it. And as you think about the quality of those leads, how would you asses them relative to last few quarters, are they improving or not based on the types of leads that you are getting?","Bill Nash","Yes. I think the quality of the leads is very similar to what we have seen over the last few quarters. So, there is no real big difference there.","Seth Basham","Got it. So, as you go forward and you roll out some of these other tools, like appraisals as well as a soft credit pull associated with pre-approval of financing, how do you expect those things to trend?","Bill Nash","Look, I think any time we get a lead is an opportunity for us to execute better. So, I would love for us to be able to have those leads convert at even higher. And again, I think our job is to make sure that we continue to put experiences out there and functionality out there and continue to train our associates on how to maximize those leads. So, that\u2019s what we are focused on.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of James Albertine with Consumer Edge Research.","Derek Glynn","Yes, hi. Thanks for taking my question. This is Derek Glynn on for Jamie. I just want to get an update on home delivery. And broad strokes based on what you\u2019ve seen in that past couple of quarters, are your efforts inspiring more confidence in home delivery as a service or is it perhaps reaffirming apprehensions you may have had before embarking on the testing?","Bill Nash","Yes, no, look, we are pleased with where we are on home delivery at this point. I would remind you. I mean, we want to make sure that the customer can find the right car, take it out, buy that car and then we deliver it on whatever terms they want to receive that car. Home delivery is one of those ways. And expedite delivery in the store is another one of those ways. And I think the big success in home delivery at this point is the additional functionality that we\u2019ve learned about and progress. So, for example, online appraisals, you need to be able to do that for home delivery. And as you see, we are continuing to move forward with online appraisals.","We want to make sure that when we expand home delivery, it meets up to the exceptional customer experience that we would expect and that our customers would expect. We have not expanded beyond the Charlotte market right now. We are evaluating where to take it next. But what I would also tell you is, we\u2019re progressing that with capabilities so that wherever we go the next experience is going to be even that much better. So, I am pleased with where we are in home delivery, and I am pleased with all the functionality that really enables home delivery, so that we can use it in other things.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Rick Nelson with Stephens.","Rick Nelson","Thanks. Good morning. A question on CAF and provision, which has been growing more than the charge-offs, we noticed every quarter since 2012; this quarter that growth was less than the charge-offs. Curious, if that says something about your expectation for future losses or just...","Bill Nash","Yes. Rick, what it says is that I think as I mentioned in my prepared remarks that we\u2019re seeing losses that are more in line with our expectations. And remember, last year, we were in environment where losses were kind of moving in unfavorable manner from us. And as we are look into provision, we were having to play some catch-up and getting the allowance to the level that it needed to be, based on the migration of those losses. So, I think we\u2019re more of in an environment now where we\u2019re booking we\u2019re absolutely booking the loans at a higher expected loss than last year. But we\u2019re not -- we haven\u2019t been seen that migration of bad performance and we\u2019re not playing -- the last two quarters are not playing catch-up.","Rick Nelson","My follow-up is on the weighted average contract rate, 7.8% last quarter, 7.6% this quarter. Is this due to origination shifting up the credit spectrum and curious, if you in fact are getting better pricing on loans of similar quality?","Bill Nash","As I mentioned, all the pricing changes that we made were over the course of the fourth quarter of last year. So, if you look at sequentially versus last quarter, we\u2019re behaving essentially the same in our underwriting decisions and our pricing decisions. So, I would attribute that then to kind of the credit quality coming in the door. And as I mentioned that the highest credits, what we\u2019re seeing that -- where we\u2019re seeing the largest growth this quarter, and that would translate into lower rates because those folks are going to qualify for better rates.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Armstrong with CL King & Associates.","Bill Armstrong","Hi. Good morning, everyone. Just kind of following up on Rick\u2019s question. So, your allowance actually went down sequentially to 1.15%, and that\u2019s the first decrease we\u2019ve seen in a couple of years. Anything in the mix of customers that you\u2019re seeing or any other commentary you can provide us with on why that went down?","Bill Nash","So, I think, as I said, we have seen a higher mix of customers, but if any, we\u2019re looking at the performance of the portfolio and recent trends. As we mentioned last quarter and at the end of the last year, we made some changes to the way that we are calculating our loss allowance to make it a little bit more reactive to current trends. And like I said, last year we were chasing unfavorability; this year, it\u2019s been little bit more consistent.","Bill Armstrong","Okay. And then, my follow-up question has to do with your wholesale gross profit per unit, benefiting from a more favorable depreciation environment. I\u2019m not sure how to interpret that, and how your spreads between what you paid and what you fill them for benefited from that?","Bill Nash","Yes. So, like I said, it\u2019s a little bit representative of what happened a couple of years ago where the depreciation ramped. Normally, you see depreciation throughout the year. The slope of that ramp was pretty much muted. So, there wasn\u2019t a lot of depreciation. And we\u2019re wanting that doesn\u2019t proactively speculate or whatever on what vehicles are worth. But when there is less depreciation in vehicles off their value, that\u2019s typically not what normally happens this time of the year. So, when there is a favorable environment where there is not a lot of depreciation and the value holds up there, the dealers are willing to pay more money, and that\u2019s what drove the prices up.","Bill Armstrong","Okay, great. That\u2019s kind of what I thought. But, yes, thanks for the clarification. Thank you.","Bill Nash","Sure.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley.","Adam Jonas","Hey Bill, hey Tom. So, a strategic question for you guys. Amazon seems to have a rather aggressive definition of their total addressable market. They don\u2019t seem to roll anything out including kind of auto or auto related retail. And of course, your management team and your Board are following Amazon\u2019s moves very closely, I\u2019m sure. One could argue the combination of Amazon\u2019s digital commerce platform and technology buying power could make a really formidable combination with your best-in-class ecosystem. I\u2019m just wondering if you view Amazon as emerging competitor or potential partner? Could CarMax be Amazon\u2019s Whole Foods of automotive retail?","Bill Nash","I don\u2019t know. I mean, you\u2019d have to ask Amazon that. I mean what we\u2019re focused on is regardless of who the competitor might be, I think we\u2019re focused on making our business better and we\u2019re focused on continuing to be a leader in late model used cars. All the initiatives that we\u2019re working on I think point us in the right direction. I feel really good about where we\u2019re going and that\u2019s what our focus is right now.","Adam Jonas","Thank you.","Bill Nash","Yes.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Whiston with Morningstar.","David Whiston","Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to go back to online appraisal. Do you have any timeline on when you want that rolled out nationwide, say by end of calendar 2018? And then, my follow-up would be, after that what is the next big additional focus for you?","Bill Nash","On the online appraisal, like is said in my opening remarks, we\u2019re putting it into some of the stores in the Midwest and the purpose of doing that is one, to make sure that it\u2019s a great experience and it\u2019s what we want to do. There\u2019s going to probably some enhancements that we\u2019re going to want to make. And we\u2019ll at that point determine what the next step is and what the roll out. So, I can\u2019t tell you what the timeframe is. As far as when that will be rolled out, it depends on how this next test goes. And I am sorry. What was the second part of your question?","David Whiston","Once you\u2019re either done rolling it out or completed what you want to do on online appraisal, what will be the next big digital focus for you?","Bill Nash","We probably have 15 different product teams that are working on digital enhancements, everything from SEO to improving the financing. I mean, some of these things like finance online for example, but we made some big strides in this last quarter, putting out a new application that\u2019s more mobile friendly, it\u2019s easier and to accurately enter all the income sources that helps educate consumers about the value of co-applicants; it has an enhanced calculator. Some of these things that we\u2019re doing, they\u2019re going to be product teams and things that we continue to work on. In other words, there isn\u2019t an end in sight. We need to continue to evolve and we can continue to make them better. So, some of these things, online appraisals, I think that\u2019s one that will continue to evolve, even when we have it rolled that everywhere, it doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re done. So, I think there is a lot of different things that we\u2019re working on that will provide both, near-term, mid-term and long-term results for the organization.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Bottiglieri with Wolfe Research.","Chris Bottiglieri","Thanks for taking the question. Hoping to refresh understanding of the support you\u2019re getting from your comp support from store growth. So, I was just wondering if you could remind us what your store rent is for new stores, what percent of target maturity do you do in year one, and how quickly does that ramp between years two and five?","Bill Nash","So, as we\u2019ve said all along, we\u2019re going to open up between 13 and 16 stores, this year we\u2019re doing 15 stores. We\u2019ve said we\u2019re pleased with how all of our new stores are performing; they\u2019re meeting our internal growth rate. Outside of that, there is not a lot of color to add.","Chris Bottiglieri","And then, 200 to 250, is that still the right number to think about in the 100 small format?","Bill Nash","I\u2019m sorry. What was the number?","Chris Bottiglieri","200 to 250, I think have I in my note within the 100 small format stores?","Bill Nash","I think what we said over time is you think about 200 to 300; 200, you can obviously drop from the equation; I think 300 still a good target to think about. But it\u2019s -- I can\u2019t tell you what the end game is going to be, because the customers\u2019 expectations are continuing to change, our business changes, continues to evolve; we\u2019re looking at different things. We\u2019ve got a lot going on in the digital space. So, I don\u2019t know where the cap is. I also don\u2019t think that we found a 100% of our store delivery methods. We probably have some things and ways to reach customers that we don\u2019t reach them today. So, it\u2019s really hard to put a high-end number on what that could be.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We do have a follow-up question from the line of Seth Basham with Wedbush.","Seth Basham","Hi, follow-up question on hurricanes. Historically, after these events, have you guys been able to increase your market share in markets where they have occurred?","Bill Nash","Yes. Like I said, earlier, Seth, we, believe or not, we haven\u2019t had a whole bunch of, even like with Katrina, we didn\u2019t have any stores down in that market. So, we haven\u2019t had a lot of experience there. I think the last time, we cited something was again back with Wilma and Rita and we did see an impact on extra sales from that. But like said earlier, we\u2019re prepared, if there are going to be incremental sales coming in for replacement vehicles, then, we will be prepared to service those customers. And we\u2019ll talk about it -- we\u2019ll talk about it in the third quarter, what we actually saw.","Seth Basham","Fair enough. And then, one other question is related to innovation technology spend that you guys have; obviously ramped that in recent years. How do you think about the piece of that into your next fiscal year?","Bill Nash","Yes. I think -- I don\u2019t really want to talk about the fiscal year, next year\u2019s fiscal year at this point. I think all along this year, I\u2019ve told you that this is going to be a heavy year on spend there. While it\u2019s not all incremental, we should reprioritize some of our existing SG&A. We\u2019re putting a lot of money back into the business so much so that I\u2019ve told you guys in the past that normally say 5% comps we\u2019ll have as leverage. We\u2019ve said mid-single-digits. I think it\u2019s going to be higher end of mid-single-digits for this year. And depending on how much progress we make this year and what opportunities we see out there will dictate what we do next year.","Operator","There are currently no further questions.","Bill Nash","Okay, great. Before we close, I definitely want to take a moment to thank the more than 24,000 associates we have across the country. These hurricanes have absolutely been challenging these last few weeks. And I\u2019d tell you, I\u2019m once again reminded why our associates are true differentiator for CarMax. Their determination, their spirit, their support for each other, for our customers, for our communities through these challenging times has truly been inspiring. I\u2019ve never been more proud to work with them and I really want to thank them for what they do on a daily basis. It truly is incredible. And I want to thank you for joining our call. I want to thank you for your support. And we will talk to you next quarter.","Operator","Again, thank you for your participation. This concludes today\u2019s call.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session.","Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Katharine Kenny, Vice President, Investor Relations.","Katharine Kenny","Good morning. Thank you, Tiffany. Thank you all for joining our fiscal 2020 first quarter earnings conference call. I'm here as usual with Bill Nash, our President and Chief Executive Officer and Tom Reedy, our Executive Vice President and CFO.","Let me remind you that our statements today regarding the company's future business plans, prospects and financial performance are forward-looking statements that we make pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are based on management's current knowledge and assumptions about future events that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations.","In providing projections and other forward-looking statements, the company disclaims any intent or obligation to update them.

Thank you. Bill?","Bill Nash","Thank you, Katharine. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today. Before I get started, I do want to take a moment to personally thank Katharine who many of you know is retiring at the end of July, so this is her last call. Katharine has run a very successful IR program for us over the past 13 years and I'm sure that you all agree that she will be deeply missed. Katharine, we wish you the best in your retirement. I hope it exceeds your expectations.","I'd also like to introduce Stacy Frole, who similar to Katharine has a very strong IR background. And as many of you already know, Katherine and Stacy have been working closely together over the last months to ensure a smooth transition in Investor Relations' communications. So, welcome Stacy and again, congratulations, Katharine.","Katharine Kenny","Thanks Bill.","Bill Nash","For today's call, I'll start with our first quarter highlights. I will then turn the call over to Tom to discuss our financials in more detail before providing an update on our omni-channel rollout, which continues to perform very well. Then we will open it up for your questions.","As you read in earnings release this morning, we are pleased to announce a very strong start to fiscal 2020 with net earnings growth up 11.8% and EPS up 19.5%. We achieved a 9.5% increase in used unit comps and a 13% increase in our total used units sold. This strength in retail is the result of a combination of many factors, including our solid execution, which was supported by enhancements to the customer experience; a robust lending environment; and a delay of February tax refunds into our first quarter. Conversion for the quarter increased year-over-year, while store traffic remained relatively unchanged. Our website traffic grew 15% from a year ago.","Gross profit per unit for the quarter was consistent with prior year at $2,215. We continue to drive efficiencies in our inventory management systems, allowing us to maintain margins while offering attractive prices.","In addition to strong retail sales in the first quarter, we reported higher wholesale units with volume up 6% for the quarter versus a year ago. This was the result of an all-time record buy rate as well as the growth in our store base year-over-year.","Gross profit per wholesale unit was $1,043, an increase of 3.1% compared with last year. This strong wholesale performance likely benefited from the delay in tax refunds as well. As a percentage of sales, zero to four-year-old vehicles decreased less than 1% to 76% versus 77% in the first quarter of last year. Total SUVs and trucks accounted for about 46% of our sales, up from 43% this time last year.","At this point, I'll turn it over to Tom.","Tom Reedy","Thanks Bill and good morning everybody. For the quarter, we saw strong performance in other gross profit, which increased 11.6%. This was largely driven by an 11.2% increase in EPP net revenues, reflecting the combined effects of strong used volume growth along with increased penetration and margins, which were partially offset by an increase in the cancellation reserve. Also remember, in last year's first quarter, EPP revenues included $4 million related to the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard.","On the SG&A front, expenses for the quarter increased 11.7% to $490 million. Factors impacting our SG&A spend included the opening of 18 stores since the beginning of the first quarter last year, which represents a 10% growth in our store base; higher variable costs associated with our strong sales growth; a $14 million or $46 per unit increase in share-based compensation expense; as well as continued investment in technology platforms and digital initiatives.","SG&A per used unit was $2,183, a $26 decrease year-over-year. We're pleased to show leverage in the midst of substantial investment and the $46 per unit increase in share-based compensation. While the quarter did benefit from some timing differences, we were able to offset a portion of the growth spend with efficiencies and will continue to focus our efforts on this.","Our provision for income taxes benefited from the impact of stock option settlements by $3.1 million. This translates to an 89 basis point reduction in our effective tax rate for the quarter.","Now, I'll turn to CAF and customer finance. In the quarter, we saw higher application volume and strong performance across all credit tiers. Tier 2 accounted for 20.3% of sales compared with 17% last year, while Tier 3 accounted for 11.5% versus 10.9% a year ago. CAF penetration net of three-day payoffs was 41.4% compared with 42.9% in last year's first quarter. While we saw increased allocations across the board, it was definitely more pronounced in the Tier 2 and Tier 3 space.","Year-over-year, CAF net loans originated grew by 9.7% to $1.8 billion as the increase in used cars sold was somewhat offset by the decrease in CAF net penetration rates. For loans originated during the quarter, the weighted average contract rate charged to customers increased to 8.9% compared with 8.4% a year ago and 8.7% in the fourth quarter.","CAF income of $116 million was up just slightly compared to the first quarter last year. The impact of growth and average managed receivables was offset by a $7 million increase in the provision for loan losses and a slight compression in portfolio interest margin. This margin was 5.6% versus 5.7% a year ago and 5.5% in Q4.","The provision for loan losses was $38 million in Q1 versus $31 million in the prior year period. The increase arises from portfolio growth along with some unfavorable loss experienced versus our expectations, which translates into a related increase in the overall allowance for losses.","The allowance at $147 million represents 1.14% of ending managed receivables versus 1.13% in Q1 of last year and 1.10% in Q4. While the allowance has increased a modest four basis points sequentially, it remains well within our range of expectations given our origination strategy and portfolio mix.","As we discussed last quarter, we are committed to enhancing shareholder value through continued investment in our associates, our business and our capital structure. During the quarter, we opened three stores, two in new markets, Waco and McAllen, Texas; and our second store in Memphis, Tennessee. Earlier in June, we opened our Atlanta customer experience center. Over the next 12 months, we're anticipating opening 14 more stores and two customer experience centers.","During the first quarter, we repurchased approximately 3 million shares for $205 million. Since starting the stock buyback program in 2012, we have returned more than $4.6 billion to shareholders and we have $1.9 billion remaining in current authorizations.","Now, I'll turn the call back over to Bill.","Bill Nash","Thank you, Tom. As we look towards the future, we continue to believe the unique and powerful integration of our in-store and online capabilities provides us with a significant competitive advantage. And as consumers continue to do more online, it's important that we provide them with the ability to shop on their terms anywhere, anytime.","While we are still in the early stages, we are very pleased with the results in our Atlanta market. The strong performance we saw last quarter carried over into the first quarter. Once again, we saw double-digit comps and the Atlanta market continues to outperform the overall company in both comp sales and appraisal buys.","Our finance penetration is similar to the rest of the company, while max care penetration is slightly lower. Home delivery continues to experience high conversion, although it remains a small percentage of our overall sales in Atlanta.","As I mentioned last quarter, we believe our unique omnichannel experience could be more efficient than our current model. We do anticipate some inefficiencies in some of our operations in the near-term, however, we know that we will be able to improve as omni markets mature and our customer experience centers become fully utilized.","We continue to enhance our omnichannel capabilities and experiences for both our associates and customers based on their feedback and reactions. We remain confident that we are moving in the right direction and our omnichannel experience will be one of the key drivers of comp sales and market share growth going forward.","Here are some specific updates on the progress of our rollout. The Atlanta customer experience center, or CEC, just opened this month, and we will be opening one in Kansas City in late July. We are also in the process of working on a third location, which will open later this year. Over time, the three large CECs will each staff more than 300 associates.","Having spent some time in our new Atlanta CEC, I'm convinced that this is the right solution for continuing to improve our customer experience. The technology is state-of-the-art and integrates well with our store systems. Our associates are excited and well-positioned to focus on progressing the customer online and providing an exceptional experience.","With the opening of the Atlanta CEC, we rolled the omnichannel experience to the majority of our Florida stores earlier this month. Later this quarter, we will continue the rollout to new markets, including those in North Carolina and Virginia. We remain on track to provide our omnichannel experience to the majority of our customers by the end of fiscal year 2020.","As I've said on prior calls, to bring omni to life, we're leveraging the strength of the CarMax model that we've built over the past 25 years along with new technology and digital capabilities. This is an experience that we can tailor to each individual customer. This is the future of car buying. We're off to a great start, and we're excited about the future.","And at this point, we'll be glad to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]","Your first question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital. Your line is open.","Scot Ciccarelli","Good morning guys. Hi. So, I guess I was hoping you might be able to shed a little bit more light just regarding the inflection that we happened to see this quarter. I mean we had a couple of quarters that might've been -- I guess, a lot of people would term them as relatively underwhelming 3Q, 4Q. And obviously, we're still early in the Atlanta rollout, so you can't just point to omnichannel as what caused the inflection here. So, if you can provide any more color on that, I think that'll be fantastic for the group. Thanks.","Bill Nash","Sure Scot. So, in my prepared remarks, I talked a little bit about tax rate funds lending environment, but let me give you a little bit more color. On the improved execution, we highlighted conversion. The store did a phenomenal job not only on the face-to-face conversion, but getting folks on the website into the store. So, we had great conversion success. Our buyers did a phenomenal job on vehicle acquisition this quarter. Shipping logistics, we had some efficiencies we picked up there. And anytime, as we've said in the past, when we pick up these efficiencies, we generally are passing them along in price reductions.","We had some improvements in the customer experience or our digital initiatives. The main things there -- I don't know if you've noticed, we have a new website that we have rolled out everywhere nationally and that's based off some feedback we've been learning in the omni markets. We have some new -- a new search experience. We have some new improvements on our search experience. It's really focused on speed and navigation.","And then I think a couple of other factors that played into this. We felt like the supply -- overall auction supply was up a little bit, which is a good thing for us. And I think that was also reflected in a little bit of movement in the new used car gap. So, it really is a whole host of different factors, none of which -- not any individual one was the majority of the lift. ","Scot Ciccarelli","So, if I were to try and break out kind of like the tax refunds because that's obviously a temporary phenomenon, what was the -- how would you estimate the impact of the tax refund shift?","Bill Nash","Yes, like last quarter, I mean, we thought we probably missed out on about a week's worth of tax refunds last quarter, so that's what we expected rolled into this quarter.","Scot Ciccarelli","Got it. Okay. Thanks guys.","Bill Nash","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.","Brian Nagel","Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my question. Congratulations on a nice quarter.","Bill Nash","Thank you, Brian.","Brian Nagel","So, first off, Katharine, congrats on the retirement. It's been -- definitely been a pleasure working with you all these years, so congratulations.","Katharine Kenny","Thanks Brian.","Brian Nagel","And Stacy welcome.","Stacy Frole","Thank you.","Brian Nagel","So, I want to -- my question -- my one question, I want to maybe follow up a bit on Scot's question. But if you're looking at the significant inflection higher here in used car unit comps from Q4 to Q1, now you did talk about in the prepared comments some of the shifts in the credit metrics.","So, the question I have is to what extent -- as you look at the improvement in used car unit comps, to what extent did either and seemingly more engaged group of lending partners or what -- in what appears to be maybe a little more -- a little looser credit extension on the part of CAF helped used car unit comps?","And then along those lines, I mean, to the extent CAF -- it was -- what we see in CAF, was that more of a conscious decision on the part of management? Or was that just a reflection of what was happening in the marketplace?","Tom Reedy","Yes. So, Brian, I'll hit your questions. One, the CAF has not changed its origination strategy material at all. We're always testing, but as far as the quality and structure of the portfolio we are originating, it's been very consistent.","When you see shifts in the mix, particularly about where -- how much CAF penetration is, that's usually a -- it's generally a byproduct of the mix of customers coming in. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we did see application volume up for all credit qualities, but it's definitely more pronounced at the lower end. And so in general, that's going to favor the Tier 2 and Tier 3 folks as far as their attach rate.","Now that said, we've seen very solid performance from our partners, both in the Tier 2 and Tier 3 space. I wouldn't say it's any different from what we've seen in the last -- saw last quarter and maybe in the third quarter, but Tier 2 definitely improved over the back half of last year.","So, on a year-over-year basis, we're seeing stronger conversion. And Tier 3, if you remember, in the third quarter, we shifted some of the allocation of apps across our partners. And so because of that, we're seeing conversion higher year-over-year. But from a kind of sequential perspective, I think they're all performed about the same as earlier this year and firing on all cylinders and we're happy with their performance. Did that hit everything, Brian or I think--","Brian Nagel","Yes. No, that definitely helps. So, I guess to sum it up, though, I mean, as we look at -- and again, as we all try to make sense of what is clearly a significant acceleration in comps in just over the last few months. Credit was not -- any shifts in credit would not -- what you're saying is that there's -- nothing dramatic happened at the credit side to help that?","Tom Reedy","The only thing I would say is the strength of Tier 2 is -- would definitely be a help on -- vis-\u00e0-vis last year because as you would imagine, as you go down the credit spectrum, a customer who gets a CAF offer is much more likely to convert to a sale than a customer who gets a Tier 2 offer, and that's more likely to convert than a customer who gets a Tier 3 offer.","So, they're -- with the fact that Tier 2 is seeing more volume and there's -- they're incrementally a little bit stronger year-over-year, you would expect that some of those that they approve that would've gone down to Tier 3 probably wouldn't have turned into sales. But you can't -- there's so many moving parts that you really can't quantify it.","Bill Nash","Yes. Brian, and I was just reiterating, if you think about all the different factors, there was no one factor that was the majority of the lift.","Brian Nagel","Got you. So, let me just -- and sorry to belabor this. But okay, I'm a Tier 2 piece then, so is there -- can we get any more color on what changed there? And then how -- as we think about now the balance of fiscal 2019, how should we view or think about the sustainability of that?","Tom Reedy","I think what I just said a little earlier, over the back half of last year, we saw our lender performance -- so we define lender performance by what percent of applications that they see convert into a sale. So, we saw that conversion increase over the back half of last year and its remained stable since. And obviously, also, there's more customer volume in that space, which favors them as well that we don't control.","Brian Nagel","Appreciate all the details. Congrats and thank you.","Tom Reedy","Thanks Brian.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Armintas Sinkevicius with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Armintas Sinkevicius","Good morning. Thank you for taking the question.","Bill Nash","Good morning.","Armintas Sinkevicius","When I think about the commentary around Atlanta, double-digit comps again back-to-back quarters now, and you continue to roll out the initiative. How should I think about how that compares versus a -- the traditional model? In other words, as you roll out these stores, how should we be thinking about the lift that you would get from the omnichannel initiative using Atlanta as the template?","Bill Nash","Yes, I guess the only thing I can confidently tell you is that every time we go into a new market, the lift is going to be different. And remember, when we rolled out Atlanta, we -- it wasn't only the new experience and the new alternative delivery methods, but we had some new advertising, we had some expanded free transfers, we had some pricing tests, so a whole bunch of things.","As we roll out into future market, the only thing I would tell you is that we'll be consistent among future markets is that we'll offer the new experience, the new website experience, the new alternative delivery methods, and we'll absolutely step-up and advertise it.","But beyond that, we'll be looking at each individual market and deciding what's best at the time. So, it's really hard to take one market and kind of extrapolate that over all future markets.","Armintas Sinkevicius","Okay. And then just one other one on the SG&A side. How should we think about the timing of the SG&A spend here in the second and third quarter? You're opening up customer experience centers. How much of that is you're starting to see efficiencies at your store level? Or are we opening in the customer experience centers first and then there will be some natural attrition at the store level and also the cost of the grand openings there? Just any way we can contextualize the SG&A that would be helpful.","Bill Nash","Yes. So, first of all, for this quarter, as Tom talked about earlier, we had some leverage. Now, there was a little bit of timing and the advertising spend that we would expect to pick up, but as far as the CECs are concerned, we're still ramping them up. We -- I wouldn't say we've really realized much in the way of efficiencies between our CECs and our staffing and the store because we're going through a transition period where we're getting the staffing in the store line up appropriately as we ramp up the CECs. So, I think the optimization from the CECs, we have yet to see that.","Armintas Sinkevicius","Okay. I appreciate it.","Bill Nash","Sure.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sharon Zackfia with William Blair. Your line is open.","Sharon Zackfia","Hi good morning. And I just want to say, it's nice to see Katharine go out on a nice high comp there. So, have a good retirement, Katharine.","Katharine Kenny","Thanks.","Sharon Zackfia","Yes, I guess the question around the CECs, kind of following up, when you presumably roll out omnichannel across the whole country -- and I'd be interesting in what the timing is on that. I know you said the majority of markets by next February, but kind of what the plan is for the rest? I mean how do you visualize how many CECs are necessary across the country to deliver this experience?","And then when we think about those startup inefficiencies, is it really just the labor of those 300 folks at the CECs that's causing kind of that three or four-month inefficiency that I think you've alluded to in the past?","Bill Nash","Yes. So, Sharon, we think -- we believe at this point, I talked about the three big ones. We just opened up the first of the three big ones; we have two more that we're going to be opening of this year. We're going to -- I think we feel really good about those three handling the bulk of the country. There will be some probably one-off small locations due to state regulations, i.e., if you have to be in the state to do a selling activity. The CEC is considered selling activity, so you would have to have a location in those states. But I would think about those three as being the major ones that will lift the omni.","As far as efficiency, like I said last time, we would expect to take at least one person out of the store for every person that we add in the CEC. Now we've chosen to do that just through normal attrition. So, there will be some inefficiencies by design in the early couple of few months rolling it out because the day we turn on omnichannel, our stores are overstaffed because they no longer have to staff to handle e-Office leaves and calls and progressing customers that way.","So -- but I think for the most part in most locations, we can work through that over like a two or three-month period. And we're making sure that we take care of our associates during that time period.","Sharon Zackfia","Okay. Thank you.","Bill Nash","Thank you. Sharon.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Craig Kennison with Baird. Your line is open.","Craig Kennison","Hey good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Katharine, you will be missed.","Katharine Kenny","Thank you.","Craig Kennison","So, lots of focus on the omnichannel and disruption in retail channel. And that makes sense to me, good reason for those questions, but there's also disruption unfolding in the wholesale channel. We've got more dealer-to-dealer digital platforms that are emerging there. How are you thinking strategically about the wholesale market and whether there's an opportunity to be as disruptive there?","Bill Nash","Yes, it's a great question, Craig. And I think a lot of times people overlook the wholesale, but it's a huge business for us. And I think it's a huge competitive advantage. Just like with our retail customers, we want to make sure we give our wholesale dealers a great experience as well, and so we're testing different things. For example, we've tested some online selling.","Keep in mind, though, our average vehicle is still 10 years old, over 100,000 miles. There are a lot of dealers who'd still want to come and look at that, but I think we're in a great position to continue to move and make changes in that space just like we are at retail.","So, it's one that we haven't really focused on in this call here, but it's another one of the initiatives. We have several things that we're working on to improve that part of the business as well. ","Craig Kennison","Thank you.","Bill Nash","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rick Nelson with Stephens Inc. Your line is open.","Nicholas Zangler","Hey, guys. How's it going? This is Nick Zangler on for Rick. Congratulations to Katherine. Rick definitely sends his best in that regard. I wanted to just dig in a little bit on the Atlanta market quickly. The unit sales performance, obviously, double digits again. I'm curious if you'd be willing to share whether the spread or the lift, I guess, was maintained in this quarter versus last.","Obviously, last quarter you implied double-digit comps. The total company did at 2.8%. Was that spread that we saw -- I mean, obviously, a 9.5% this quarter? Was the spread maintained within that market?","Bill Nash","Yes. Nick, what I would tell you is we talked about the double-digit comps last quarter; we have them again this quarter. They did increase a little bit even over last quarter. So, we feel really good about that.","Nicholas Zangler","Okay, great. And just your general thoughts on tariff implications on demand for used vehicle unit sales. You believe that this could potentially be even a tailwind as used vehicles are perceived to be more affordable going forward. Thank you.","Bill Nash","Yes, it's hard to tell at this point, Nick. You probably know as much as we do. That's one that we'll stay close to. Obviously, we're a little bit less reliant on anything coming in from outside of the states. So, theoretically, you would think that's a good thing, but it's too early. I don't know. I don't know the answer to that.","Nicholas Zangler","Great. Thank you very much guys.","Bill Nash","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Murphy with Bank of America. Your line is open.","John Murphy","Good morning guys and congrats Katharine. We look forward to staying in touch. Just -- maybe just one question and it's kind of got slightly two parts. But if we think about what's going on with the CECs in your omnichannel efforts here, Bill, it appears that the business will get more asset-light over time and you might need less stores to cover areas and your current stores might become that much more productive.","As you think about sort of the future, I mean, not just this quarter but the future, I mean, how far do you think you can go with these CECs into new markets without maybe a physical presence or a physical presence that may be significantly lower than it has been in the past?","And then also, when you think about GPUs in this new world order, can GPUs maybe be significantly lower because the asset intensity might be that much lower and you may still put up the same returns or even much better returns over time?","Bill Nash","Yes. So John, the way I think about it, first of all, we feel like -- and I said this in my earlier remarks, we feel like we have a huge competitive advantage with the infrastructure that we've built over the last 25 years. We think our stores are a huge benefit that will allow us to do this omnichannel experience.","Now to your question, how do we think about the future and how do we think about physical store growth in the future? We want to continue to grow sales and we want to continue to gain market share and I think it's going to be a combination of adding some additional stores, but it's also going to be leveraging our existing footprint and reaching customers in ways that we haven't been able to reach in the past.","And if that means that we get really good at servicing customers that we couldn't service before and it ends up -- if you look at the runway of stores, we have plenty of growth for physical stores. But if you -- if a few stores at the end of that runway get lopped off because we're reaching more customers out of the existing infrastructure, we'd be thrilled with that.","So, -- but I do think it's still going to be a combination of the two. As far as the GPU goes, for us, omni rollout and the omni experience is a separate, distinct decision versus GPU and what we charge customers. We don't think that the two are necessarily related. And at this point, we would -- we don't think that there's any reason why we can't continue to progress the omni experience and still maintain our GPUs, but those are two different decision points.","John Murphy","But there's no early read of saying, hey, maybe this that Atlanta rollout that we've seen so far and what's going on in Florida, we might be able to reach 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50% more customers because of this omnichannel approach. And I would certainly never suggest that you're existing stores are stranded asset, that's -- I think that's silly. I think they're still going to be very productive.","But I mean as you go forward, could you -- I mean, would you think about opening material-less stores? I mean it just seems like that's a real opportunity here that you will still use your physical footprint but you may be able to be much more efficient. Is there any early read in what that might be?","Bill Nash","Yes. No, it's way too early to know what kind of lift we can get out of our existing infrastructure. But keep in mind; we only have 206 stores at this point. They're all strategically located. We have some areas where we have holes; it would be beneficial to have stores. So, again, I go back to it's going to be a combination, and we'll see how much of a lift we can get by being able to continue to improve the omni experience.","John Murphy","Great. Thank you very much.","Bill Nash","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities. Your line is open.","Seth Basham","Thanks a lot. Good morning and congrats Katharine, we'll miss you. My question is around free transfers.","You talked about that being a driver of improved sales in Atlanta. Can you talk about how many free transfers increased in the quarter on a year-over-year basis, for example and whether or not you're rolling out additional free transfers to other markets?","Bill Nash","Yes. Free transfers, while we opened it up, it's just not that significant of a factor. And as we roll forward in new markets, we'll make a decision within each market that we roll out. It's not necessarily a play that we'll do every single place.","Seth Basham","Got it. And then as a follow-up, thinking about the very wide new to used car spread that we're seeing right now, how much do you think that boosted comps? And do you think it's sustainable?","Bill Nash","Well, our data shows -- I think you said very wide, I mean, it's improving. I think we saw some improvement in the latter part of the fourth quarter. I think that improvement has continued. But I would say it's certainly isn't at places where it's been in the past. So, while I think the trend is good, it's just -- I cited it as a thing because I do think it's improving, but again, I don't -- it's just one of the many factors.","Seth Basham","Thanks.","Bill Nash","Thanks Seth.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Bottiglieri with Wolfe research. Your line is open.","Jacob Moser","Hey guys, it's actually Jake Moser on for Chris. Thanks for taking the question.","Bill Nash","Good morning.","Jacob Moser","Good morning. So, I know you said it's a low percentage today, but I'm curious for more color on the uptake of home delivery in Atlanta and how that is trending and where you're think it might get to over time. And then for your recent launches in Florida, are you using the same home delivery process where you have effectively a mobile office with two employees?","Bill Nash","Yes. So, as far as home delivery, Jake, it's too early to tell where we think that can go over time. We'll continue to monitor that, but we really don't have any detail update at this point.","As far as the home delivery process, the one difference in Florida versus the Atlanta, in Atlanta, we went in with a separate home delivery team. In Florida, we're leveraging -- and as we roll forward, we're going to leverage the existing store associates. We have a new position in the stores, and they'll be responsible for home deliveries as well as express pickups.","And just as a reminder, express pickup allows a customer to do everything online, essentially, but still come into the store, take a test drive, learn about the options, that kind of thing. We've done some of those in less than 30 minutes, especially when the customer doesn't really want to do the test drive but just learn about the options. And so those folks will be the ones that handle that.","As far as going out, yes, at this point, we still have two associates that will go out. One has the mobile appraisal office -- I mean, the mobile business office, the other will take the inventory unit that the customer is interested in.","Jacob Moser","All right. Great. Thanks for taking the question.","Bill Nash","Sure.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Whiston with Morningstar. Your line is open.","David Whiston","Thanks. Good morning. I know we had a really awesome quarter here, so I actually want to look at it the other way and just say what, as a management team, are you guys maybe not satisfied with? Or what are you pushing people internally when you address people at the store level or the corporate level? What could you guys actually be doing better right now?","Bill Nash","Yes. Well, first of all, the store team is doing a phenomenal job. If you think about all the change that we're going through as an organization, it really does impact every single associate, and the store teams have risen to the occasion. They're excited about it. They're glad that we're continuing to evolve. They're glad we're continuing to meet the business. And so we feel really good about that.","Now, I think we have lots of opportunity as we continue to roll this out. We still have a lot of inefficiencies here and we've talked about that in the past, some of them are by design and some of them are just because we've opened up new capabilities. And so what we're excited about, our first push is really get this omni experience out to our consumers.","But equally important is it's got to be a great experience for the customers, it's got to be a great experience for our associates. We want to make it as profitable as possible. We want to have the most efficient system available. So there's lots of things that we're focused on with the overall long-term growth to continue to grow sales and market share.","So, to be honest with you, I feel great about where we are and I feel great about the opportunities that we have to continue to improve it.","David Whiston","Thanks. And just one follow-up there on your comment. When you said a lot of inefficiencies, were you referring to the whole enterprise or the omnichannel rollout?","Bill Nash","Well, I think the efficiencies that -- the inefficiencies I talked to are specifically about omnichannel. But I think we have opportunities to continue to look for waste in other parts of the organization. We're never content to kind of be settled with where we are. We continue to push on SG&A, looking for efficiencies there. We continue to look for efficiencies in our reconditioning process. We look for efficiencies in buying logistics. So, I think there's opportunity throughout the whole organization, but I was speaking earlier specifically to the inefficiencies in omni.","David Whiston","Okay. Thanks. And Katharine, congratulations.","Katharine Kenny","Thank you.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]","Your next question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital. Your line is open.","Scot Ciccarelli","Thanks guys. Just following Katharine's rule about one question here, so back in the queue. Will, we know there was some debate in the marketplace last quarter regarding what the two-year stack was in Atlanta. So, I guess I was hoping now that we're back in a public forum, if you can help us understand what you've seen on two-year stack basis in Atlanta, specifically where you have the omnichannel rollout, of course, both last quarter and then in this quarter? Thanks.","Bill Nash","Yes. Scot, first of all, thanks for getting back in the queue. You just made Katharine smile on her last earnings call that you actually followed the rules. Yes, so this quarter, positive two-year stacks just like last quarter. I don't think we talked about it last quarter, but we had positive two-year stacks last quarter as well.","Scot Ciccarelli","Can you tell us whether this quarter was higher or lower than what you saw in 4Q?","Bill Nash","This quarter was higher.","Scot Ciccarelli","Got it. Thanks. And my goal is always is to make Katherine happy. So, there you go.","Bill Nash","Thank you, Scot.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities. Your line is open.","Seth Basham","Thanks. One follow-up question for me. It's just around CAF. Obviously, you experienced some higher than expected loan losses in the quarter. We've noticed some deterioration in trends for selling more recent securitizations. In response to that trend, did you plan on tightening terms for any of your loans? Did you do that this quarter with the lower penetration rate? Or how are you thinking about that going forward? Thank you.","Tom Reedy","Yes, the penetration rate this quarter was purely a result of the mix coming through the door. And as I mentioned, the allowanced as it is, is quite a comfortable spot. Obviously, it represents our best estimate of what future losses will be. And so losses trend to that rate. We're very comfortable that we're still originating a highly financeable, highly profitable portfolio, so I wouldn't foresee any changes. Obviously, caveat that with the future is the future and we'll continue to monitor it and adjust as appropriate to the extent it is. But at this point, we're very comfortable.","Seth Basham","Thank you.","Operator","There are no further questions in queue at this time. I turn the conference back over to our presenters.","Bill Nash","Thank you, Tiffany. Listen, I'm sure you can tell from our comments today, we're proud of our results and what we're working on. We're excited about the future. The results we discussed today and this goes back to one of the questions that was asked, the results of today are really the product of our associates. It's their hard work, dedication to an exceptional customer experience, desire to innovate and their unwavering commitment to our values, that's the reason we're successful. And so to all of our associates, thank you for what you do every day. It's absolutely an honor to work side-by-side with you. And for those of you on the call, thank you for your interest.

Thank you for joining our fiscal 2019 fourth quarter earnings conference call. I'm here with Bill Nash, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Tom Reedy, our Executive VP and CFO.","Let me remind you that our statements today regarding the company's future business plans, prospects and financial performance are forward-looking statements that we make pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Bill?","Bill Nash","Great. Thank you, Katharine. Good morning everyone, and thanks for joining us. Today, I'll start with the fourth quarter highlights. After that, I'll turn the call over to Tom and he will discuss SG&A, investments in consumer finance, and then I'll share an overall update on our omni-channel rollout, which has been very well received, and then, as always, I'll open it for your questions.","Starting with the fourth quarter results, I'd like to reiterate what I said in the earnings release. We are pleased with our double-digit pretax earnings growth, even after adjusting for the discretionary bonus we paid last year to eligible associates. We achieved this in the midst of continued investments in our business and our associates. This is a testament to the strength of our diversified business model and ongoing focus on operational efficiencies.","Used unit comps grew by 2.8%, compared to a negative 8% in the prior year's fourth quarter. They were driven by strong conversion, partially offset by lower store traffic. While we were pleased to report positive comps this quarter, we believe they were affected by delays in the February tax refunds relative to last year, continued higher acquisition prices, and a robust competitive environment.","Total used units grew by 5.6%. As you know, we track market share data on a calendar year basis, and report it once a year in the fourth quarter. Our data indicates that our share of zero to 10-year-old vehicles in our current comp markets fell from approximately 4.5% in 2017, to 4.4% in 2018. While this is disappointing, the decrease in share occurred earlier in the year and started to reverse in the second-half of the year when we saw share gains. ","This year's decrease was in comparison to an almost 7% growth in comp market share in calendar year 2017, which was our largest increase in four years. Our website traffic grew in the fourth quarter by 13%. Our retail gross profit per used unit remains stable at $2166 compared to $2,147 last year.","As we've shared in the past, there are two primary factors that impact our decisions around gross profit per unit. The first is ensuring that our prices are competitive in the marketplace. Second, we focus on optimizing total gross profit dollars by balancing margin per vehicle and unit sales. We are confident in our price competitiveness, but as always, we will continue to monitor and test pricing elasticity.","Wholesale units grew by 3.7% compared to last year's fourth quarter, and gross profit per wholesale unit grew to $977 this quarter, compared to $946 in the prior year period. Other gross profit was a strong contributor to the quarter, increasing by almost 42% or $32 million. As we mentioned earlier this year, we secured provider cost decreases related to EPP revenues. We used a portion of these funds to improve the margins, and the remainder to selectively reduce prices which drove increased penetration.","Service margin benefited from comp sales growth as we were able to leverage service overhead, and third-party finance fees benefited from the shift in our sales mix by finance channel. This explains the majority of the increase. The remainder relates to a positive adjustment to our EPP cancellation reserve as a result of our annual model update, and a discretionary bonus of approximately $4 million that we paid to our service department associates in last year's fourth quarter.","Before I turn the call over to Tom, let me discuss our sales mix and store openings. As a percentage of our sales, zero to four year old vehicles decreased to about 72% versus 76% in the fourth quarter of last year, and 77% in the third quarter. Total SUVs and trucks accounted for about 46% of our sales up from 43% this time last year.","During the fourth quarter, we opened five stores, which included three stores in new television markets, Buffalo, Montgomery, Alabama, and New Orleans. We also opened stores in our existing television markets of Orlando and Portland, Oregon. During the first quarter of fiscal \u201820, we plan to open three stores one of which we opened earlier this week and represents our second store in the Memphis market. We will also open two stores in Texas, which are new markets, Waco and McAllen.","Tom?","Tom Reedy","Thank you, Bill. Good morning, everyone. On SG&A, expenses for the quarter increased 5% to $429 million. Factors increasing SG&A expense in the fourth quarter included the opening of 19 stores since the beginning of the fourth quarter of last year, which represents a 10% growth on our store base. Our continued investment in technology platforms and digital initiatives, and an increase of 33.9 million or $19 per unit related to share-based compensation expense. SG&A per unit was 2,380, a $17 decrease year-over-year. We are pleased to show SG&A leverage as it demonstrates that we are able to offset some of the growth in spend with efficiencies and staffing optimization.","I'll remind you that within the comp and benefits line, prior year amount included roughly $4 million of the discretionary annual bonus that was paid to eligible associates last year. Also the timing of our advertising spend last year was weighted towards the end of year, which accounts for the relative lack of growth in advertising dollars this fourth quarter.","We continue to invest in three primary areas, our associates, our legacy systems, and our digital initiatives. For associates, this includes a variety of wage adjustments and healthcare plan enhancements. Our associates are vital to our success, and maintaining a very competitive compensation and benefits program is key to attracting and retaining the best talent.","In order to execute our omni-channel vision we must continue to upgrade our legacy operating systems. While this spending won't offer short-term return it is critical to our future competitive position. We will also continue to invest in digital initiatives. We are developing and implementing tools that help our associates be more efficient and effective. In addition, we continue to introduce online enhancements to improve the customer experience.","Now moving over to CapEx, we expect to spend 350 million for fiscal 2020 that's roughly $50 million above FY 2019 and the spend includes a shift in some spending originally planned for fiscal 2019. The 13 FY 2020 stores plus planned acquisition for future openings and three customer experience centers.","Looking out to fiscal 2021, we are in a position to open a similar number of stores as we are targeted in the last few years. However, our business model is clearly evolving and we will continue to evaluate both the number and type of locations we need going forward. Finally, we plan to support shareholder returns by continuing to invest in our capital structure.","During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 4.4 million shares for $270 million. For the full year, we returned 903 million buying back 13.6 million shares compared to about 9 million in FY 2018. While maybe stating the obvious the return on this investment shows up in the difference between net income growth and EPS growth roughly 6.5 percentage points for the fiscal year. We have over $2 billion remaining in our current stock repurchase authorization.","Now moving to capital and financing results. Our third-party lending partners continued their strong performance. Tier 2 executed especially well year-over-year accounting for 19.5% of used unit sales compared with 15.4% last year, while Tier 3 represented 10.7% of sales compared to 11.7% last year. Their performance is measured by sales applications continues to be very solid.","CAF penetration net of three-day payoffs was 42.1%, down marginally from last year's fourth quarter. CAF net loans originated in the quarter grew by 4.5% to $1.5 billion. The modest decline in penetration slightly offset our sales growth and the small increase in average amount financed.","Capping up, income increased $2.6 million to $104 million. This was result of the growth in average managed receivables partially offset by the continued slight compression in portfolio interest margin. Total portfolio interest margin was 5.5% of average managed receivables compared to 5.6% in both the fourth quarter of last year and this year's third quarter.","For loans originated during the quarter, the weighted average contract rate charged to customers was 8.7% versus 7.9% a year-ago and 8.5% in this year's third quarter. ","A provision for loan losses at $42 million grew in line with the portfolio and the allowance for loan losses was 1.10% of any managed receivables consistent with both last year's fourth quarter and with the third quarter.","Now I will turn the call back over to Bill.","Bill Nash","Thank you, Tom. As you all know we've been laying the groundwork and building towards the development of a new experience for the past couple of years. To launch it successfully, we took a number of steps including forming our product organization, upgrading our technology and then leveraging these to construct new digital capabilities and online consumer experience offering.","These investments are essential to our vision for the future. Spending for FY 2020 like in FY 2019 will represent a step up in investment. So we believe we will acquire comps in the range of 5% to 8% to leverage SG&A similar to our thinking for FY 2019. We expect the amount of growth in the spending to slow in FY 2021 and taper after that. We will continue to look for opportunities to reduce ways and reprioritize spend which contributed to our ability to leverage this fourth quarter.","Now let me talk a little bit more about Atlanta and our omni-channel rollout. Please remember that Atlanta is one market and we've only had a few months of experience to evaluate.","With that said, we are very pleased with our performance. In conjunction with the launch of omni-channel, we introduced a number of other elements including increased free transfers, a new Web site, a new advertising campaign and pricing test.","In the fourth quarter, we achieved double-digit growth in both comp sales and appraisal. This increase was beyond what we would have expected to gain. We are also pleased with the high conversion on home delivery sales although it represents a very small percentage of overall sales at this point.","In comparison to our stores in the Atlanta market, our home delivery finance penetration is similar while MaxCare penetration is little lower. Keep in mind, I normally don't give market specific details nor do I plan to change this practice going forward. But given the interest in this new initiative I wanted to give a little more context. We also know that we will be less efficient in some of our operations in the near term as we roll out the omni-channel experience. Some of these inefficiencies are by design and some are simply those related to starting up a new capability.","As a result, our sales in the Atlanta market are a little less profitable per unit compared with other markets at this point. We do believe that we will be able to improve on this as we continue to roll out omni-channel and as our consumer experience mature. We also believe this unique experience could be more efficient than our current model.","We have a strong track record of operational excellence and we are confident in our ability to optimize. Most importantly, after seeing the results so far in Atlanta, we are even more confident that this is the right direction. We believe that the omni-channel experience will be one of the key levers that helps drive comp sales and market share growth going forward.","Now, let me let me talk about the next steps. This fiscal year we expect to open three CECs or Customer Experience Centers across the U.S., each will have an average staff of 300 associates and will serve multiple states. Our experience in Atlanta suggests that we will be able to offset these additional associates with a reduction in sales consultants in omni-channel stores which will be realized through normal attrition. So first CECs will be in Atlanta and we'll open early in the second quarter as it supports the next phase of our omni rollout, which will include Florida stores. We also expect to open the second CEC site in Kansas City later in the second quarter, and we are currently working on the third site. As we previously said, we plan to bring the omni-channel experience to the majority of our customers by February, 2020.","As I've often talked to you about before, we are leveraging the strengths of the CarMax model that we've built over the last 25 years to deliver this new experience. Strengths that include our skilled and knowledgeable associates, our national footprint and transportation infrastructure, our inventory scale and merchandising capabilities, our continued investment in technology and digital capability, and our industry-leading brand. These strengths are not only critical, but essential to delivering an omni experience, an experience that's tailored to every single customer. An experience that is unmatched and we believe will be the future of car buying.","Now, we'll be happy to take your questions. Kim?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Sharon Zackfia from William Blair. Your line is open.","Sharon Zackfia","Hi, good morning.","Bill Nash","Good morning, Sharon.","Sharon Zackfia","Thanks for the color on Atlanta. I guess just a multifaceted question to keep in line with Katharine's rules around Atlanta. Could you give us some color on what the comp trend was before omni-channel? So, it's helpful to hear about the double digits, but I don't know if Atlanta was like similar to the overall company prior to that, just so we can understand the amount of improvement you saw when omni-channel rolled out. And then secondly, could you give a little bit more color around that discussion about Atlanta being a little bit less profitable on a per car basis. Are you talking just gross profit per car or all-in on a per car basis? And ultimately, do you think omni-channel is similar to your current model in terms of profitability?","Bill Nash","Sharon, you're really pushing Katharine's\u2026","Sharon Zackfia","Well, she's retiring soon, so.","Bill Nash","Let me talk about the comps. First of all, I'm not going to go into any real detail on the comps, but I'll give you a little color, in that we have a control group obviously that we look at. And we're very pleased with the lift that we saw beyond the control group. As far as the profitability, when I talked a little less profitable, that is all-in, so that's looking at SG&A, that's looking at margin. Truthfully, on the SG&A pressures, as I addressed in my opening script, we feel like we can at least offset those, and we feel like this model could be more efficient. And as far as any type of margin pressures, those are two different, whether you roll omni out and have decided to do something different margin, those aren't dependant one on -- or the other.","Sharon Zackfia","Yes, thank you.","Bill Nash","Sure.","Operator","Your next question comes from Brian Nagel from Oppenheimer. Your line is open.","Brian Nagel","Hi, good morning.","Bill Nash","Good morning, Brian.","Brian Nagel","Nice quarter as always. I want to follow-up on Sharon's questions, I'll try to put mine all under one as well. But with regard to Atlanta and that double-digit comp, can you talk about what, of all the facets, if you will, of the omni-channel effort in Atlanta, were you able to isolate what are the most important facets that's helping to drive that comp? And to what extent is that improvement in sales reflective of you speaking to or connecting with potentially a new customer for CarMax?","Bill Nash","Yes, so Brian, the different facets, when we implement, for example, advertising or we do something different on free transfers, we know kind of what we would expect to see. We have some expectations of what we would see. And when you look at each one of those individually, add it up, we saw a lift beyond what we would normally expect to see. So, I think that's something when you look at the sum of the parts it's more than any individual component. And what was the second part?","Brian Nagel","I'm sorry. With regard to is it a new customer, is it just helping to drive that comp, is it a customer that maybe CarMax in the past would not have connected with?","Bill Nash","Yes, at this point it's hard to tell. And the only thing I would say it we've seen some instances on home delivery that we probably are picking up some customers that maybe we wouldn't have because they physically couldn't have gotten into the store. But this experience is much more than just home delivery and I think it's a better experience for the customers.","Brian Nagel","Got it. Thanks.","Bill Nash","Sure.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Craig Kennison from Baird. Your line is open.","Craig Kennison","Great. Thank you for taking my question. Bill, you had mentioned that you had a modest share decline on the year. That's a bit of a surprise given you opened 10% more stores. What do you think caused you to struggle early in the year, and then what changed to reverse it?","Bill Nash","Well, hey, Craig. Just to clarify. I talk about comp growth, nationwide market share actually went up a little bit, but the comp markets went down a little bit. And as I said in my remarks, we saw those declines earlier in the year, and then we started to -- saw a reversal towards the latter half. And I think we've been in an unusual pricing environment the whole quarter, really starting off in the first quarter of this year. And different organizations manage through that differently. Some may give up margin for sales, for example, and our pricing elasticity tests wouldn't support that. The other thing is I just think that it's been a competitive environment overall.","Look, this is a good business to be in. And I think the new cars are under a little bit of pressure. And so I think we have some new entrants, I think we have -- there's some more advertising. There's just more general noise overall in the marketplace. So, I think those are both contributing factors, especially early on as we saw different competitors pull different levers.","Craig Kennison","Thank you.","Bill Nash","Sure.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rick Nelson from Stephens. Your line is open.","Rick Nelson","Thanks. So, Bill, can you talk about three CECs that you're going to roll out 300 associates per CEC. Are you going to be able to pull out a like number of associates out of the stores or how do you see that affecting expense?","Bill Nash","Sure. We absolutely expect to pull out a like number, at least a like number. Again, what we've seen so far in Atlanta, if you think about the way we staff a store currently, we staff it for what we call e-office shifts, shifts where people take phone calls and follow-up on e-leads. We no longer have to staff that. So, we will get to the appropriate staffing levels in each store through normal attrition. So we would expect to offset the store staffing with what we have in the CECs. And I think over time this will be a more efficient model, because if you think about it, we have more than 7,000 sales associates across the country. And we're currently asking them all to be part-time e-office sales associates. And some like it, some of them don't, some are good and some aren't so good.","So, I think by leveraging folks that are very skilled at this, this is all they focus on, over time will give us even more leverage.","Rick Nelson","Great, thanks. And good luck.","Bill Nash","Thanks, Rick.","Operator","Your next question comes from Scot Ciccarelli from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Beth Reed","Good morning. This is Beth Reed on for Scot. I wanted to ask about online marketplaces, like CarGurus. I know you guys have kind of indicated that changing up your merchandizing on these sites and better advertising your quality message could help improve the price perception, because in many cases it doesn't seem like you're getting the credit you should be getting for your reconditioning processes. So just wondering, one, how big of an impact do you think this is having on your sales? And then, two, any color you can give around specific initiatives, if any, and timeframe to improve your \"Value ranking\" on these listing sites would be helpful. Thank you.","Bill Nash","Sure, Beth. First of all, we feel good about our prices. That being said, we're always making sure that we've got a good price perception. We want to make sure that the customers understand the value of our cars. So there's really four focus areas that we're working on, one of which you alluded to. But first, we're focused more on the quality message and transparency on our Web site, and we're already doing this. As a matter of fact, we rolled out a new Web site nationwide at the latter part of the quarter. We're also focusing more on quality and transparency in our non-Web site advertising, so TV, banners, retargeting things like that. The third thing, which is what you alluded to, is we're working with third-party listing sites to get the credit for our quality standards and the reconditioning that we do.","Most third-party Web sites, they don't factor any type of quality or condition into their algorithms. Or if they do, it's not on a consistent basis. So, I feel really good about all those things, we're making great progress. And it may be a factor, but I just don't think it's -- to your other question, I just don't think it's had a major impact on overall comps.","Beth Reed","Okay, thank you very much.","Bill Nash","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Seth Basham from Wedbush Securities. Your line is open.","Seth Basham","Thanks a lot, and good morning.","Bill Nash","Good morning, Seth.","Seth Basham","Bill, can you just give us an update on what your internal research has shown in terms of the price perception out there of your cars relative to the industry? And then secondly, on your price test in Atlanta, and otherwise, what you're learning from those?","Bill Nash","Okay, the first part of your question on just the research, what our research would tell you for example on like a car groves, our most recent research would tell you that the majority of our cars are either fair, good, or great and that's without any -- at this point without any credit for the quality. I am sorry, what was the second for your question?","Seth Basham","The pricing tests?","Bill Nash","Oh yes, the pricing tests that I noted, that's part of our normal pricing tests that we do all time. Look, we can drive more sales absolutely just by lowering our prices, but again is that balance of optimizing our total gross profit, total gross profit dollars while also making sure that were competitive in the marketplace and competitive in the marketplace doesn't mean on short-term periods like quarter to quarter. We're looking for structural changes where we may not be competitive we just haven't seen that so we feel really good about where we are in price and what we're seeing on our pricing test as far as normal elasticity.","Seth Basham","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Armintas Sinkevicius from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Armintas Sinkevicius","Hey, good morning. Thank you for taking the question. I was curious about how much you had spent on marketing in Atlanta and how you plan \u2013 how much you plan to spend going forward. And then just separately any comments on the phasing of the launches for the omni-channel initiative through the course of this year?","Bill Nash","Okay so marketing in Atlanta, Atlanta is what we call high awareness market. If you think about we spent is in conjunction with this it would have been normal to like a geo proven to be going into Atlanta. Which is a step up obviously then what we are paying going forward as far as what will spend in additional market every market is going to be a little bit different because it depends on the awareness of what we were previously spending there.","As far as the phases of rollout like I said, we will get the second CEC opened early in the second quarter and in conjunction with that we will start rolling out two additional stores with Florida stores being first. Beyond that we'll update you next quarter the cadence of the other stores the stores we already did by the end of the quarter as well as the future stores.","Armintas Sinkevicius","Okay, and just so I am clear that the marketing you've been spending at Atlanta, does that amount to essentially what you're planning to spend on a run rate basis or will that step up as you sort of work through maybe the various kinks with all of the Web site and the market et cetera?","Bill Nash","No I think you should think about a more holistically as part how much we spend in advertising on a per-unit basis. And if you look at year-over-year I would expect FY 2020 -- there maybe a little bit of an increase in the per unit advertising expense overall because we do want to support our omni-channel rollout. So I would expect a little on a per unit basis going forward.","Armintas Sinkevicius","Got it, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Murphy from Bank of America. Your line is open.","John Murphy","Good morning, guys.","Bill Nash","Good morning.","John Murphy","Just wanted to touch on one stat just to make sure had these number straight Bill. I think you mentioned the zero to four portion of your sales was down at 72% versus 76% last year and 77% in the third quarter. I just want to make sure I have that right and if we think below that sort of what the percentages are, and really as you look at the market I mean as vehicle quality has improved so dramatically in the last decade. Could you consider going down a little bit further in the age spectrum because the quality of the vehicle is going to be still really what you want to deliver to the customer nearly new used vehicle. And just really sort of tip of the iceberg might be much, much larger for you over time as you down age spectrum?","Bill Nash","John, you do have those percentages right, the 72 versus the 76. And look the beauty of this business model as we can sell what the customers are looking for. And this quarter we saw consumers that were interested in a little bit older vehicle. I think part of that is because of the pricing. Keep in mind we're lapping if you look at year-over-year this fourth quarter versus last year's fourth quarter. We have the largest step up in mixed adjusted acquisition price its more than $500.","If you look at the quarter this year, we still had a little bit of an incremental bump up on that one that we had last year. So prices are still expenses so I think what you're seeing is probably people just from affordability standpoint moving down. But you're obviously right we'll be able to secure vehicles and sell them if that's what consumers are looking for.","John Murphy","Bill, just to want follow-up, I mean is the beauty of that, that you know that you might be able to have lower acquisition prices in the future with this high-quality product and still have the same dollar grosses and have a much more capital efficient business model?","Bill Nash","Well, if we would -- if we continue to have older vehicles, our overall average selling price, you're absolutely right, would go down.","John Murphy","And grocers which stay about the same, right, just based on your focus, and what\u2026","Bill Nash","Absolutely.","John Murphy","Okay. Thank you. Thank you very much.","Bill Nash","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Whiston from Morningstar. Your line is open.","David Whiston","Thanks. Good morning.","Bill Nash","Good morning.","David Whiston","Just question with new vehicle sales coming down, is that all positive for you right now is it greatly helping you do two more awfully supply and more budget conscious consumers you were just talking about? Or do you think also consumer confidence is down marginally versus a year ago?","Bill Nash","No, I think. I mean, if I look at the new car, I think it's been a pretty, pretty flat year for overall new car sales. I think we've proven that in years where it goes up a little bit, years where it goes down a little bit, we've been able to have success on both sides of that. And as far as I can tell, consumer confidence is still very, is still very strong.","David Whiston","Okay, thank you.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Chris Bottiglieri with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.","Chris Bottiglieri","Hi, thanks for taking the question. Given the comparisons on a tier basis to the Atlanta's comp performance outperform the rest of the surveys by a similar amount as it is on a one-year basis. Then I guess, thinking through that, is there any other reasons why investors shouldn't extrapolate Atlanta's comp trend to the rest of the store base given your intentions to roll it out to all stores this year? Thank you.","Bill Nash","Yes, Chris. Atlanta is one market and every single market is going to perform differently and the reason I say that is because we have experienced a lot of different markets and you just look at the core business each market performs a little differently, so I don't think you can extrapolate what we see in this market versus what we're going to see in other markets which is why I say, \"Hey, remember this is this is only one market.\" And again, on the double-digit comp increase, we feel really good about that, we feel like it's a lift to bubble, we expected when we also compared to the control group. So we -- and it's not all due to omni, as I, said earlier is there's a lot of different elements playing into that.","Chris Bottiglieri","Got you. Okay. And then just quickly, if you're able to -- well, I'll hop back and want to recap just real, I'll hop back in. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from a line of Seth Sigman from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Seth Sigman","Thanks. Hey, guys. I wanted to follow up on the expense growth. So the 5% to 8% comps you need to leverage SG&A, I guess you said that similar to 2018, you also discussed being less efficient in the short-term, right? so how do I reconcile those two and if there are some levers that may be limit the negative impact from the investments, can you just sort of help us understand that? Thanks.","Bill Nash","Yes, I think that you know the guys on the five-day was really to help clarify a little bit of what we are saying because we were saying high mid-single digit. We put a little range on there and I think we put the range on because it just somewhat depends on how much we get done and then also how much we can continue to offset through re-privatization and savings.","Seth Sigman","Okay, I'll hop back in. Hold on. Well I mean may be on the same point if you could give us a sense of the timeline of the investments throughout the year to the extent you can particularly with the CC is rolling out in the second quarter just how do we think about the cadence of maybe expense growth throughout the year.","Bill Nash","Yes, it's -- I'm not going to give any guidance on how I think it's you know. We just have to wait and see, it's going to be distributed throughout the year, as I said, well, there is going to be some additional expense. They're going to be some in the second quarter; you're picking up some there. So I think you got to think about it on the whole year because there could be a little timing from one quarter to the, to the next quarter.","Seth Sigman","Okay, thanks.","Bill Nash","Okay.","Operator","Your next question comes from a line of Chris Bottiglieri from Wolfe Research. Your line is open.","Chris Bottiglieri","Hi, thanks for taking the question. So it's quick question, you -- can you may just walk us through what it takes to convert an omni-channel market, I think you're in three markets today. My guess is you'll probably plan to get to 100 to 200 markets over the year in February. Maybe you can just walk us through kind of like what it takes to actually take your legacy store model and convert it to omni-channel like what are the -- what are the technology steps, the training steps or whatever else it takes to convert the market, it would be helpful? Thank you.","Bill Nash","Okay. First of all, Chris, thanks for getting back in line for the second question. Listen, on the omni, there's two big things that have to be accomplished. I mean, we've been setting the groundwork. As I said in my opening remarks from a technology standpoint, that kind of thing, but in addition to that, we have to get our customer experience centers open, because obviously, that's a critical part of the whole omni-channel experience. So that's one of the things that we have to continue to work through, we feel good about the plan, we feel very strong about our ability to get to what we've learned out there, which is by February next year having this offer to the majority of our customers.","The other thing is that there is this, we've got 25,000 associates, and as Tom talked about earlier, they are the key differentiators for us. So this is going to be obviously a big change for them. They're excited about it. And they have been super helpful as in helping us figure this out, as we've rolled it out, what we have today is better than what we had, and when we first rolled out in Atlanta, and that will continue to improve as we go forward. But we have to make sure that they understand, there's a lot of change management and what does it mean for them and how it's going to impact them and give the ability, give them the ability to adjust for that change. So those are the big things in addition to a lot of the groundwork that we've been laying and just everybody is clear.","This is an iterative process. This omni-channel experience is an experience that can be every customer that's out there, it's not meant for one segment versus another segment, it's -- we should be able to serve every single customer and give them an unbelievable experience. And that requires a lot of things that we already have. So for example, the importance of our store, I can't overstate how important is that we have a physical presence, and that we continue to have a physical presence, and increase that physical presence because as we go forward, so we're leveraging a lot of things that we that we already have.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ali Faghri from Guggenheim. Your line is open.","Ali Faghri","Thanks. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question, just on the tax refunds, you called it out as a headwind in the fourth quarter based on your historical experience. You expect to get some of those loss volumes back in the first quarter as those refund levels normalize?","Bill Nash","Yes. So the way I think about that is the same way I think about whether it's a timing and generally will, will work itself back out. And as I look at February, I think probably by our best estimate, there was about seven about a week that we didn't see a tax refund benefits, just because they were delayed and coming out really until the last part of the quarter.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. I'll now turn the call back to Bill Nash.","Bill Nash","Great. Thank you. Listen, thank you all for joining the call today. I really appreciate your support and your interest in CarMax. I also got to thank our more than 25,000 associates. Tom has talked about this, I've talked about it, they are the true differentiator for CarMax. Our associates are the ones that are bringing this new customer experience to life. I want to thank you all for what you do every single day, and we will talk again at the end of next quarter.

I would now like to turn the call over to Katharine Kenny, Vice President, Investor Relations. ","Katharine Kenny","Good morning and thank you for joining our fiscal 2019 first quarter earnings conference call. I am here today with Bill Nash, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Tom Reedy, our Executive Vice President and CFO.","Before we begin, let me remind you that our statements today regarding the company\u2019s future business plans, prospects, and financial performance are forward-looking statements that we make pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are based on management\u2019s current knowledge and assumptions about future events that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations.

Before I turn the call over to Bill let me thank you in advance for asking only one question and getting back in the queue for your follow-up. Bill.","Bill Nash","Great, thank you Katharine and good morning everyone. Our used unit comps for the first quarter were negative 2.3% against another tough year-over-year comparison. The comps were driven by lower traffic and better conversion and represented a significant improvement from the previous quarter. Total used units grew by 1.6%. While used vehicle valuations were still higher than in last year's first quarter the year-over-year change in our mix adjusted vehicle acquisition cost was more favorable in the first quarter than in the fourth quarter. ","Industry data indicates some signs of recovery in the used vehicle market place since a slow down at the end of last year. These signs include improving supply at auction and more normalized depreciation. Our website traffic grew in Q1 by 16% similar to the previous quarter again due to website and SCO enhancements. Gross profit per used unit remained consistent at 2,215 compared to 2,212 last year. We had another strong wholesale quarter with units up 9.6% year-over-year. This again was due to our buy rate which rose to a multi-year first quarter high and to the growth in our store base. As I said in the past when used vehicle prices are higher we can offer our customers more for their vehicles which supports our buy rate.","Our gross profit for wholesale unit was flat at $1,012 in both periods. The decrease in other gross profit was driven by lower service profits again negatively impacted by our lower used unit comps. Remember as we said last quarter as lower unit volumes we would expect service overhead to delever. We also experienced a reduction in third party finances due to shift in sales by finance channel. These were partially offset by increased EPP revenue. EPP revenue grew with sales but also benefited from provider cost decreases which created an opportunity for some margin enhancement and $4 million related to the new revenue recognition standards. ","Before I turn the call over to Tom let me cover our sales mix and SG&A expense. As a percentage of our sales zero to four year old vehicles decreased to about 77% versus over 78% in the first quarter last year. Large and medium SUV and truck sales were almost 28% up about a 0.5% from both last year's first quarter and the fourth quarter. On SG&A expenses for the quarter increased about 9% to 438 million or a year-over-year increase of $143 per unit. There are several factors that impacted the SG&A expense including the opening of 18 stores since the beginning of the first quarter of last year which represents a 10% growth in our base, an increase of $9 million or $43 per unit related to share based compensation expense and our continuing investment in technology platforms and digital initiatives. Now I will turn the call over to Tom. ","Tom Reedy","Thank you Bill and good morning everybody. In the first quarter our sales by finance channel were primarily a result of the mix of credit applications we received. While application volume was slightly down year-over-year, we did see some growth at the very high and low ends of the credit spectrum. We experienced growth in CAF and Tier 3 originations. Tier 2 fell due to a combination of application volume and a change in the year-over-year lender behavior which we discussed last quarter. Tier 2 accounted for 17% of sales compared with 19% last year. While we experienced some tightening by Tier 2 last spring performance has been relatively stable since that time. ","Third party Tier 3 represented 10.9% of used unit sales compared to 10% last year and CAF penetration net of three day payoffs grew to 42.9% compared to 41.9% in last year's first quarter. CAF net loans originated in the quarter grew by 8% to 1.7 billion versus 1.5 billion last year. This was due to growth in the average amount financed which was in line with the increase in CarMax's average selling prices. And the growth in CAF penetration rate on top of the modest increase in CarMax unit sales.","CAF income increased 5.7% to $116 million. This was due to a combination of the 8.7% growth in average managed receivables and the continuation of modest compression in portfolio interest margin. Total portfolio interest margin was 5.7% of average managed receivables compared to 5.8% in the first quarter of last year and 5.6% last quarter. For loans originated during the quarter the weighted average contract rate charged to customers increased to 8.4% compared to 7.8% a year ago and 7.9% in the fourth quarter, a reflection of our response to the current interest rate environment.","Ending allowance for loan losses was 134 million or 1.13% of ending managed receivables, up slightly sequentially from the fourth quarter but down from 1.18% in the first quarter of last year. Moving to capital structure during the first quarter we repurchased 3.3 million shares for 207 million and now I'll turn the call back over to Bill. ","Bill Nash","Thanks. During the first quarter we opened three stores, one in Greenville, North Carolina which was a new market for us and then two in existing markets, Dallas and Miami. In the second quarter of fiscal 2019 we plan to open another three stores. Our second store in the Albuquerque market which is in Santa Fe opened earlier this month. The other stores will open in Macon, Georgia which is a new market for CarMax and in our existing Oklahoma City market. You will note that there has been a decrease in non-com store contribution relative to recent quarters. This was due to a change in mix and the timing of store openings. ","As I mentioned earlier our website traffic continues to grow but we are improving the customer experience and growing leads through a variety of enhancements. This quarter for example we continued to make improvements to the speed and technical performance of the site. In addition we expanded and improved our personalized vehicle recommendations throughout the site. We also released the capability for customers to search based on the desired monthly payment. We continue to leverage our new CRM system. We're testing new ways to communicate with customers such as text thoughts, messaging, and appointment alert reminders. This allows us to improve the shopping experience and connect with the customers on their terms.","As you know over the last couple years we placed a great deal of focus on the development and testing of new customer experiences such as finance pre-approval, home delivery, online appraisals, and the new expedited pick up test. Many customers have now tested each of these products both individually and in various combinations. These tests have allowed us to learn how to best build the features to meet their needs. In addition we continue to improve the features as consumer behaviors and expectations change. Our next step is to combine all these pieces into a comprehensive e-commerce experience that is comparable to our in-store experience. Because customers are now able to do more digitally before they come to the store we're also empowering our associates with new tools and training to leverage the customer's digital progress making it simpler, easier, and faster for them to complete their purchase. In the next few quarters we plan to take this comprehensive experience to new markets and learn how to best operationalize it in a scalable way. We will provide more information on these tests in future quarters. ","Now we will be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. And our first question this morning comes from Matt Fassler from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. ","Matthew Fassler","Thanks so much and good morning. My question relates to credit, you spoke about the increase in the rates you are charging for CAF at retail both year-over-year and sequentially. In addition to the fact that we've got kind of a firm underlying used car price, can you talk about what impact that might be having on demand to the extent that it raises the effective price of the car bit more than the underlying tech market would? ","Bill Nash","Good morning Matt. You are talking about the impact of the interest rate rise may have on the demand for the used cars?","Matthew Fassler","Exactly. ","Bill Nash","Yes, so well I think it's a factor. I believe that the bigger factors -- the used car consumer is interested in monthly payment and bigger factors that drive the monthly payments are the purchase price, the down payment, and the term. The small movements in credit rate don't have as significant impact as those other three items.","Matthew Fassler","Are you seeing -- given that the average price seems like it's still rather firm and the market is still tight, are you seeing any change in the other two or is it potentially impacting mix in any way? ","Bill Nash","No, we are not seeing any market change in regards to that.","Matthew Fassler","Got you, thank you so much. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Nagel from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. ","Brian Nagel","Hi, good morning. ","Bill Nash","Good morning Brian. ","Brian Nagel","Congratulations on this quarter. My question with regard to the used car business, so clearly there was a significant pickup acceleration in fiscal Q1 and Q4 now Bill in your prepared comments you talked about I guess less, you mentioned less pricing pressure. So the question I have is, was that it, as you look at this quarter and going from a negative 8 to negative 2 call it was the absolute primary factor less pricing pressure, if not what were the other factors and as I think about the pricing dynamic, I guess this is maybe a somewhat of a follow up to Matt's question but how does that progress through the quarter and how should we think about it so far here in fiscal Q2?","Bill Nash","Okay Brian, good question. So I think the best way to talk about this is first start talking about what I talked about in the fourth quarter. So in the fourth quarter we had higher acquisition prices, we talked about the spread, it was unfavorable between late model used and the new. We obviously had a tough comparison. We also talked about, there was a post election talk from the prior year. We also saw there was a more supply to prior year on large SUV, more affordable ones. So there was a litany of things but certainly the higher acquisition price in that spread was a major call out. And what I would tell is it is still -- there's still a large spread year-over-year on acquisition although it is trending in the right direction. I also think that if you look at the Consumer Price Index it looks like new cars are holding their value, have started to hold their value again better than used cars which started in this quarter. So I think both of those helped this quarter. And again we're still continuing to work on a lot of our initiatives and make progress on it so we have another quarter of that and that I think helps to benefit. And then there's other known things like what competitors are doing, how they're pricing that kind of thing. So, again I think this quarter there's a lot of noise similar to last quarter but some of the trends, some of the more macro trends are trending in favorable direction of course.","Brian Nagel","Got it, thanks for all the detail. ","Operator","Our next question is from Craig Kennison from Baird. Please go ahead. ","Craig Kennison","Hey, good morning and thanks for taking my question. You mentioned lower traffic and better conversion as more activity moves on line, that's been the trend. I'm curious about any updates to changes in your store staffing model that you're experimenting with and whether there's any opportunity to broaden any of those experiences to -- or experiments to change your cost structure there? ","Bill Nash","It is a good question Craig. In previous calls I've talked about some of the waste initiatives that we've been looking at and we've been focused on stuff that goes right into cost of goods sold and we've also been focused on stuff with SG&A and under SG&A one of the things we've been focused on is better workforce utilization. And we've made changes over the last year on how better to leverage our workforce and with technology advancements we will continue to make sure that we're taking steps to better leverage our work force. So, that's still work in progress at this point.","Craig Kennison","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sharon Zackfia from William Blair. Please go ahead. ","Sharon Zackfia","Hi, good morning. I have one quick question and then a real question so Katharine forgive me. The one quick question was just on the marketing spend, it looked relatively flattish year-over-year. I didn\u2019t know if that was timing or if marketing is just going to be more constrained this year in general? And then secondarily I'm just wondering if on the delivery pilots you are doing or anything related to e-commerce if the credit characteristics of the customer are any different than your in store customers?","Bill Nash","Okay Sharon on the marketing spend there was some timing there so I think the way you should think about that is it'll be similar when you look at it on a year-over-year basis, it should be similar on a per unit basis. So there was some timing at play there. On the delivery pilot you were asking have we seen any different mix in our credit customers? ","Sharon Zackfia","I'm just wondering if the credit characteristics of that customer are materially different at all from your in store customers?","Tom Reedy","Yeah, generally as you look at this over time Sharon there has tended to be a little bit more skewed towards lower credit as you'd expect. People are less desiring to see heftier value saved. We don\u2019t have any -- it is not big enough a break at this point to talk about anything in that pilot. I mean things are -- it is too new because this is different. ","Bill Nash","Yeah and I think that what comes speaking to is more relevant to the pre-approval process not necessarily the whole delivery experience. I mean we're seeing where customers are -- the customers that would take us up on it are looking for convenience and\/or they just can't physically for whatever reason get to the stores. But as far as the overall mix of customers that take that versus coming to the stores we haven't seen any big difference at this point. ","Sharon Zackfia","Okay, thank you","Operator","Our next question comes from Scot Ciccarelli from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. ","Scot Ciccarelli","Good morning guys. I know you guys don't do a whole lot on the forecast side but based on everything you see are there any reasons, logical reasons in your view why used vehicle values would not assume a more normalized depreciation curve now that we're call it closing in on a year away from the all those lost vehicles from the flooding last year?","Tom Reedy","Yeah, you know Scot I would like to speak to this. In this first quarter like I said in my opening remarks we did see a more normalized depreciation curve although it is starting at a much higher price point just given what happened at the end of last year with the hurricanes that kind of thing. So -- but as far as going forward I would be expecting -- I don't know, I just know that in the first quarter we've seen a return to a more normalized depreciation.","Scot Ciccarelli","Understood, okay, thank you. ","Bill Nash","Hey Scot I do think that we would expect to continue to see the supply of vehicles from everything we understand. That's why vehicles will still continue to roll into the auction lanes which obviously will have an effect on acquisition prices. ","Scot Ciccarelli","That makes sense. Okay, thanks guys. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Seth Basham from Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead. ","Seth Basham","Thanks a lot and good morning. My question is around online lead growth as I had asked about in recent quarters could you give us some commentary on whether or not you continue to have elevated [ph] lead growth online and the quality of those leads? ","Bill Nash","Yeah, Seth we do continue to have double-digit lead growth. Our website traffic right now, the majority of the growth is being driven by SCO which we've obviously talked about several quarters now. And the improvements that we're making there as far as the lead quality it is similar to last quarter. The mix is similar so there was no real change in the mix of leads. And the leads, specific types are performing like they have in the past whether they come online or whether they come through the store.","Seth Basham","Got it and just as a follow up to that then if you're talking about a similar level of lead growth and similar level of quality what drove the improved conversion this quarter in your view?","Bill Nash","Well, we did have more actual traffic. Web traffic this year and then I think the stores continue -- I talked in our opening comments about the training and the tools that we're giving associates to better enable them to progress the customer. So I think it's a combination of store execution but I do think it's also increased traffic coming to the website.","Seth Basham","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mike Montani from MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead. ","Unidentified Analyst ","Hi, thanks this is Gail Alexio [ph] on for Mike. I was wondering if you can please help us understand maybe how you think about getting the comps to accelerate with the multichannel initiatives that you have in place, maybe discuss the home delivery and appraisal, and what you learn from the pilot and how you see the bullet as to roll that out further?","Bill Nash","Well, a lot in that question. Look, we are focused on driving comps. You know we are continuing to grow store base so we will grow the business that way. But we're really focused on continuing to leverage our existing footprint and reach customers in ways that we haven't previously been able to reach. So I think the initiatives that we've been working on will help us leverage our infrastructure in ways that we haven't and we should be able to continue to drive mid single-digit comp growth across the enterprise. So we feel good about that. ","Unidentified Analyst ","Okay, thanks and maybe have you considered accelerating market penetration because there are still 40% of the country where you have no presence while maybe some of your competitors are pretty rapid at growing their footprint nationwide? ","Bill Nash","Yeah, so it is going to be a combination. We are very comfortable at the pace of which we're opening new stores in this 13 to 16 range because it also allows us to focus on the execution of the business. But we also feel like we can increase market penetration just through our existing footprint for the reasons I cited in the earlier question. So we're focused on both.","Unidentified Analyst ","Okay, thank you. ","Operator","Our next question comes from John Murphy at Bank of America. Please go ahead.","John Murphy","Good morning guys, maybe kind of just to follow up that, I'm just thinking about the sort of installed base of stores and the online efforts, just curious if you think that there may be markets above and beyond sort of the smaller markets that you're getting into in the winter, you're talking about that might be much larger than the 600,000 MSA and just curious is there kind of a strategy here to going to smaller markets or is it just where the opportunity is right now and that as we go one, two, three years out large MSA's might make sense? And also as we think about the store base is there a potential over time to maybe call some inefficient stores and leverage your online efforts a lot more to create greater productivity in markets? ","Bill Nash","Yeah John, well this year we're opening up more stores and the small MSAs that's just a function of the property that we've got. You'll see us still opening up stores in larger markets to your point really reaching about 70% of the population and there's a lot of large markets that we can continue to add additional stores. So, while there have been more in small markets -- will be more in small markets this fiscal year it's a more a factor of timing and you'll see us going, continue to put more stores in larger markets in the future as well.","John Murphy","And then just in the existing store base as the base develops over time would you ever consider in some markets shrinking the store base because you might be able to get a lot more efficient with your online efforts? ","Bill Nash","Yeah, at this point I don't see the need to do that and we obviously evaluate all our stores. We're pleased with all of our stores. You know we haven't -- we've never had to shut one, the performance has been good and keep in mind we just opened up our 192nd store so it's not like we have hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of stores or thousands of stores. I feel really good about where the stores are placed and being able to leverage those in that infrastructure which I think is really important when you're looking to sell large volume vehicles like we do.","John Murphy","Great, it is very helpful. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Healy from Northcoast Research. Please go ahead. ","John Healy","Thank you. Bill, I wanted to ask a little bit about the wholesale business. In the last few quarters that business has done exceptionally well in terms of units and we're just trying to understand -- I know you mentioned the buy rates are up but how are you guys growing that business as much as you are with the call it the traffic in the stores and is there decoupling there that's kind of more permanent and how should we think about the wholesale business kind of growing more long-term for you guys and I used to think it was just more related to kind of the comps and measuring the traffic but just trying to think about that business for the next couple years? ","Bill Nash","Yeah John, the way I think about wholesale, over the long period of time wholesale and retail should grow I would say roughly similarly. Now you've seen -- you have covered this long enough that you know that in certain quarters one maybe up, one maybe down or over multiple quarters. Certainly wholesale has been. Performing very nicely which is a benefit to the diversified model when retail sales may be down wholesale may pick you up a little bit. And what I would tell you is that I think it's a factor of one, one of the things I said in the opening remarks is obviously with prices at an all time high that certainly helps us because we can continue to put more vehicle, I mean more money on the customers vehicles which bumps that buy rate up. But I would also tell you, it also goes to the execution and the improvements that we've made on making sure that we can react quickly to market, making sure that we understand the market factors quickly. So there's an execution piece at the store level where I think they're doing a better job than they have ever done. So, I don\u2019t think you should think that hey, this is always going to outgrow the retail. I think I still have the long-term view that over the long-term both of that will grow about the same.","John Healy","Fair enough and just along that lines when you look at that customer that's come in are they -- is there any change in converting them at the purchasing car with you guys, is it a similar ratio or has that evolved over the last year or two any different than we've seen in the past? ","Bill Nash","No, that's pretty similar.","John Healy","Thank you so much and great quarter. ","Bill Nash","Thank you John.","Operator","Our next question comes from James Albertine from Consumer Edge. Please go ahead. ","James Albertine","Good morning and thanks for taking my question and congratulations as well. If I may on the EPP comment that you had earlier just want to unpack a little bit what you think is driving the lower provider costs and if you can shed a little bit more detail or light on the accounting adjustment, I don't recall you mentioning the same adjustment in the fourth quarter, just want to understand kind of what's going on there with in terms of the recognition of revenues in that business? Thanks. ","Bill Nash","Yeah sure Jamie. And as you might imagine they're a bit intertwined. The reason that we're able to get some cost reductions from our providers on the EPP revenue is that those plans have been exceeding their expected performance from a cost kind of benefit perspective for the last several vintages I guess is the way to describe it which means that there's room to either decrease the pricing or take a little bit more margin. This quarter we realize some cost benefits, we believe we are able to take a little bit more margin for the shareholders and not impact penetration which turned out to be the case. And so that's where that growth arose from. As far as the accounting it is arriving from the new revenue recognition standard which has a very immaterial impact on our core business accounting but it does have some impact on extended planned revenues. So our vendor agreement that I referenced before provides for payments to CarMax. If the long-term performance of those plans exceeds certain thresholds and certain of those plans and certain of those vintages are exceeding this thresholds. ","In the past when those payments came to us we just recorded them as when we received a check, but under the new accounting standard we have to estimate the amount that we expect to receive, record it as receivable and then true it up each quarter based on the circumstances at the time. So that $4 million that you see represents the true up of that receivable from what we learned during the quarter, during the fourth quarter. I mean I am sorry during the first quarter. And we also -- we added a minor receivable of about $13 million after tax on the balance sheet for recognition of this phenomenon if you will.","So the 4 million like our loan loss reserves we will have to evaluate just on a go forward basis and we'll plan to disclose any material adjustments to that expected receivables so investors can discern which revenue relates to activity in the current period versus payments that we are getting from prior vintages. I think that will just make it a little bit more clear. But it is real dollars, it's money that we expect to collect on a cash basis, just relates to plans that are already out there and in place.","James Albertine","Thank you for the detail. If I may just a clarification on the performance that you noted, it was a little bit better than the providers and yourselves perhaps we're expecting, is there any mix related driver to that -- I am just trying to get a sense of\u2026 ","Bill Nash","I don't think it's a mix related thing, I think it's just that an overall performance is better than they had apprised to. ","James Albertine","Got it, understood, thank you again.","Operator","Our next question comes from Armintas Sinkevicius from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. ","Armintas Sinkevicius","Good morning, thank you for taking the call. The recent performance for Carvana has been pretty incredible and I know you've invested quite a bit in the customer experience capabilities, so just curious if you could compare and contrast their approach versus the capabilities you have and if you decided to go down that path, a similar path that they have gone down what are some steps you have to do to adjust the business model or tweaks because it seems like you have many of those capabilities already in-house?","Bill Nash","Like I said in my opening remarks we've been testing different pieces of the capability whether it's online finance, online appraisals and we've been doing it somewhat in isolation, somewhat in combination and now our focus is really bringing all that together in a comprehensive e-commerce package that we can roll out and continue to adapt it as the customer's expectations continue to change. So we feel really good about all that and I think it complements our existing base and our infrastructure. It allows us to provide, certainly gives us an advantage to deliver exceptional customer service whether it's online, whether they want to do a mix of the online versus in-store, or if they want to come all into the store. I don't want somebody to have to hit our website and then immediately have to decide right then I want home delivery or I don\u2019t want home delivery. I want the customers progress on their terms and if part of the way through this you don\u2019t home delivery, I want it to be an easy smooth transaction. So we are going to let the customer drive the process, however, they want to drive it versus okay we've got one solution for one type of customer and that's what we're focused on.","Armintas Sinkevicius","Got it and what has been your experience with regards to the transportation of vehicles as far as the cost benefit there? ","Bill Nash","Well, I would tell you we are probably one of the biggest transporters of vehicles. We probably move close to 2 million cars a year. So we're very familiar with transportation. I think we have an excellent logistic system which we're heavily focused on continuing to make that even better through investments and I think that it has been and will continue to be a big differentiator for us.","Armintas Sinkevicius","Thank you. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Rick Nelson from Stephens. Please go ahead. ","Richard Nelson","Thanks and good morning. Tom, can you tell us if you are seeing any difference in website traffic or store traffic in markets where you are competing with these online home delivery concepts? ","Tom Reedy","Yeah Rick, so what I can tell you is if I look at the large markets where competitors are making headway I would tell you we're also making headway. So there's no direct correlation to any type of impact. We just don't see it. So again we feel good about where we are in those markets.","Richard Nelson","Thanks and good luck. ","Operator","Our next question comes from David Whiston from Morningstar. Please go ahead. ","David Whiston","Thanks, good morning. I just want to get a little more understanding on the big picture of what went on this quarter because you're saying your comps are down due to macro pricing factors which I assume means having new vehicle incentives but used pricing was also up, so can you help me reconcile that and then kind of related maybe is there high use demand in certain vehicle segments that's skewing these pricing upward? ","Tom Reedy","No, I think what we have is a bit of a carryover from the spike in prices from last fall. So you have a starting higher price. We saw normal depreciation but you're starting from the higher pricing. When I say normal depreciation cycles, the year actually starts off with some appreciation because of sales that generally happen at tax time. So, that is different than what we saw last year's first quarter where it was more of a flat environment, you didn't really any appreciation. So you have a little bit of a double hit on the acquisition cost and that you still have the residual left over from what we experienced in the fall, added to that you have some appreciation that we saw from the normal seasonal appreciations\/depreciation. So, that acquisition price that you mix adjusted, it is a little bit more favorable than it was the first quarter. So that's trending in the right direction. The other thing that I cited was the spread between new and used that had gotten smaller. New cars last quarter with their incentives had actually lost more value than used cars which is kind of atypical. During this quarter we started to see where that looks like that's turning back to normal where the new cars hold their value a little bit more. So there's a lot of noise going on with this for the quarter.","David Whiston","Is it fair to say you're expecting pretty sharp fall offs as soon as this quarter is over due to the hurricane tailwind going away? ","Tom Reedy","But it's hard to say. I mean I would have thought that it would have happened a little bit quicker but considering that we had a normalized appreciation and depreciation cycle it's really hard to say. I would say to my comment earlier we think supply is going to continue to increase. If the supply continues to increase then that will continue to lower the prices of used vehicles.","David Whiston","Okay, thank you.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from Brian Nagel from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. ","Brian Nagel","Hi, good morning again. So my follow up question also on the used car business, we noticed continued decline in that Tier 2 penetration, recognizing that some of this is out of your hand and this reflects the market conditions. But you have recently made changes to your lending group within that pocket, so how should we think about that co-order sales going forward?","Tom Reedy","Are you referring to Tier 2? ","Brian Nagel","That's correct. ","Tom Reedy","Yeah, I think we are always looking at that group. We think that we believe there's a value in having a portfolio of lenders and some of the experience we had last year and into the first quarter of last year is evidence why it's important to have a group of lenders. But as I mentioned in my prepared comments we did see a deterioration in performance. We defined performance as sales volume to the applications that that group sees or those lenders see. And so we do see deterioration performance after the first quarter of last year. Since that time it's been pretty consistent. In fact modestly better than it was in recent quarters. So on a go forward basis I can't tell you how our partners are going to behave, it's going to be depending on the marketplace and what they're seeing in their portfolio. Obviously we'll continue to pay attention to it, we will continue to try to manage and optimize it but things have been pretty stable in the last three quarters. ","Bill Nash","Brian, you still there. Well, I think we lost Brian. Operator are there any more questions. ","Operator","We have no one in queue at this time. I will turn the call back over for any closing remarks.","Bill Nash","Well listen before I close I do want to take a moment to recognize Cliff Wood who has been our Chief Operations Officer.

We appreciate it.","Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Bill.","Bill Nash","Thank you Katharine, and good morning everyone. In the second quarter, we were pleased to return to positive comps. Used unit comps grew by 2.1% compared to 5.3% in the prior year quarter and were driven by better conversion, partially offset by lower traffic. Total used units grew by 5.8%. ","Our industry continues to experience an unusual depreciation environment. In this quarter, our mix-adjusted vehicle acquisition costs remained high and were only somewhat lower than what we experienced in the first quarter. This contrasts with the prior year second quarter when our mix-adjusted vehicle acquisition costs were significantly lower year over year. ","Our website traffic grew in the second quarter by 19%, up from 17% in the previous year\u2019s second quarter and 16% in the first quarter. On average, we saw volume of more than 20 million visits per month.","Our retail gross profit per used unit remained stable at $2,179 compared to $2,178 last year. We had a strong wholesale quarter with units up almost 15% year-over-year in the second quarter. This was a result of higher appraisal traffic, the growth in our store base, and an increase in our buy rate. Our gross profit per wholesale unit decreased by about $30 to $919 in the second quarter compared to $950 in the prior year period. ","Other gross profit increased by over 12%, driven by higher EPP revenue and improvement in third party finance fees. Like last quarter, EPP revenue grew with sales and benefited from provider cost decreases and approximately $4 million related to the acceleration of revenue recognition under the new accounting standard adopted at the beginning of this fiscal year. These were partially offset by lower service profits. ","Before I turn the call over to Tom, let me cover our sales mix and SG&A expense. As a percentage of our sales, zero to four-year-old vehicles decreased to about 77% versus 80% in the second quarter of last year, but similar to the first quarter. Large and medium SUV and truck sales were about 27%, almost exactly the same as a year ago and down slightly since the first quarter. ","On SG&A, expenses for the quarter increased about 12% to $454 million, or a year-over-year increase of $126 per unit. Several factors impacted SG&A expense, including the opening of 18 stores since the beginning of the second quarter of last year, which represents a 10% growth in our base, a $7 million or 18% year-over-year increase in advertising expense which is largely due to timing, an increase of $6.5 million or $28 per unit related to share-based compensation expense, and our continuing investment in technology platforms and digital initiatives.","Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Tom.","Tom Reedy","Thanks, Bill. Good morning everyone. Unlike the last two quarters where we saw modest declines in the volume of credit applications, we experienced growth in applications across the credit spectrum in the second quarter. During the quarter, we continued to see strong lender performance in Tier 2 which accounted for 17% of sales compared with 16% last year, but we saw weaker performance in the third party Tier 3 space which represented 8.8% of used unit sales compared to 9.6% last year. ","CAF penetration net of three-day payoffs was modestly higher than last year\u2019s second quarter at 43.9% compared to 43.5%. Our net loans originated in the quarter grew by 8.8% to $1.7 billion due to our sales growth, an increase in the average amount financed, and the slight increase in CAF penetration rate. CAF income increased 1.6% to $110 million. This was a result of the 8.6% growth in average managed receivables partially offset by an increase in the provision for loan losses and the continued slight compression in portfolio interest margin. Total portfolio interest margin was 5.7% of average managed receivables compared to 5.8% in the second quarter of last year, but flat compared to the first quarter. For loans originated during the quarter, the weighted average contract rate charged to customers increased to 8.5% compared to 7.6% a year ago and 8.4% in the first quarter. ","The loan loss provision for Q2 was $40 million compared to $33 million in the prior year period. This arose from the growth in the managed receivables as well as fluctuations that are often experienced with quarterly loss provisioning. The ending allowance for loan losses was 1.13% of average managed receivables, flat sequentially from the first quarter and down from 1.15% in the second quarter of last year.","Moving to capital structure, during the second quarter we continued to return capital to shareholders and repurchased 2.3 million shares for $171 million. ","Now, I\u2019ll turn the call back to Bill.","Bill Nash","Thank you, Tom. During the second quarter, we opened three stores: two in existing markets, including Santa Fe, which we include in the Albuquerque market, and Oklahoma City, and one in a new market Macon, Georgia. In the third quarter of fiscal 2019, we plan to open another four stores, all in new markets for us. They include Wilmington, North Carolina, which will actually open today; Lafayette, Louisiana; Corpus Christi, Texas; and Shreveport, Louisiana. ","As I\u2019ve done before, let me update you with some of our individual product initiatives. We recently rolled out our alternative vehicle delivery options to a second market. These options will allow customers to complete most of the vehicle shopping and purchase process from their homes after which they can decide how they want to receive the car. In addition to the Charlotte market, this is now available in all three stores in the Raleigh market. It includes our expedited or express pickup service, which kicked off in Raleigh in August, and our home delivery service, which launched in early September.","In addition, we began testing an online appraisal estimator in 10 stores in August. After answering just a few questions, the online estimator provides customers with the opportunity to quickly receive an approximate offer on their vehicle. While the offer is an estimate, it is based on actual CarMax appraisal data.","Also, we now have a customer experience center. This call center provides customers and test markets with support at any point along the way throughout the progression of their shopping and purchase journey. These consultants can work with the customers until they are ready to either go to the store for pickup or schedule home delivery. ","Last quarter, I talked about how we are working to combine all of our online products together into one comprehensive offer. We are building a full omni-channel experience that enables customers to seamlessly move across the online and in-store experience with ease. Customers want the flexibility and independence to do much of their shopping and buying online. Given the complexity of a vehicle purchase, they also often want the help and assistance of our expert store associates at various points along the journey. We believe our ability to provide this integrated experience across both online and in-store is unique in the automotive industry. Because of our skilled and knowledgeable associates, our national footprint, brand strength, infrastructure, inventory scale, and continued investment in technology and digital capabilities, we believe we will have a clear competitive advantage to lead the industry in delivering this experience to our customers. ","Later this year, we will bring this integrated omni-channel experience to a major market. This will help us learn how to best operationalize all of our offerings and scale them across the entire organization. We will provide you more information on this in the future.","Now we\u2019ll be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions]","Your first question comes from Scot Ciccarelli from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Scot Ciccarelli","Good morning, guys. Bill, given the success of one your online-only competitors out there, can you help us understand what the impediment has been to rolling out the alternative delivery and full digital capabilities maybe faster than what we\u2019ve seen so far? I know it\u2019s in the works, but just wondering if you can help us understand kind of the \u2013 maybe what the process impediments have been to rolling that out thus far.","Bill Nash","Well Scot, it really goes back to this experience that I\u2019m talking about, this omni-channel experience. We want to make sure that we can connect all the different pieces, and so for example, the alternative delivery, whether it is home delivery or the express pick-up, that\u2019s only one small piece of the whole equation. We want to be able to combine that with all the other tests that we\u2019re doing. The other thing that we want to do is we want to make sure that our sales consultants are trained on how to continue to progress the customers in a different way than they do today. ","So, I\u2019m actually pleased with the progress that we\u2019ve made over the last couple years. It\u2019s a big change for the organization, there\u2019s a lot of technology involved, and I think we\u2019re on the right track. So, I\u2019m excited about it. ","Scot Ciccarelli","Maybe if I were to rephrase the question a little bit then, if you roll it out to this major market that you\u2019re expecting in the back half and you like what you see, how quickly could it be rolled out from that point into other markets?","Bill Nash","We\u2019ll wait and see on that, Scot. I mean the plan would be once we get it into market, we\u2019ll obviously want to iterate quickly on that, and so that\u2019s what our focus will be. Our first focus is to get in the market, and the second one will be to iterate it quickly from there, because I think what you\u2019ll see is the first version of it will not be the end state. ","Scot Ciccarelli","Okay, got it. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Sharon Zackfia with William Blair. Your line is open.","Sharon Zackfia","Hi, good morning. I guess a follow-up question on the omni-channel paradigm. As you think about that going forward, and I know you\u2019re still early, can you talk about what the targeted margin profile would be for a car that would be delivered versus picked up? Are you looking to maintain that gross profit per car, or how do you think about that? Secondarily, I don\u2019t think you\u2019ve ever given any metrics in Charlotte about the number of customers that actually choose to get delivery or inquire about delivery. Is there any metric you can give us on what you\u2019re seeing in Charlotte?","Bill Nash","Okay, on the first question, Sharon, it is a little early to talk about the cost profile and the structure. We\u2019re still learning. As I\u2019ve talked about, we\u2019ve got a call center there opening up. I think there\u2019s opportunity and we\u2019re testing different opportunity on compensation structure, so I think there\u2019s a lot of things that we\u2019re continuing to work through, so I can\u2019t really give you any guidance on that at this point. ","As far as the number of customers, you\u2019re correct - we haven\u2019t talked about that, but the majority of customers by far still want to interact with our expert sales consultants and still want to come into the store at some point. The key is that we want to make sure that we individualize each customer\u2019s journey and help them at the points that they need help so that it\u2019s not one size fits all.","Sharon Zackfia","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Matt Fassler with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Matt Fassler","Thanks so much, and good morning. I\u2019d like to ask a question on CAF. So, the interest spread, I think essentially stabilized sequentially. I know that the last securitization, I saw a little bit of a better spread than the prior one, but generally speaking the spreads on your securitizations have been coming down as the pace of increasing your cost of funds has moved a little bit faster than the average rate you\u2019ve been able to charge, even as that\u2019s been moving higher. How is it that that spread was able to stabilize as you\u2019re still essentially mixing towards, I think, those lower spread securitizations?","Tom Reedy","Matt, it\u2019s stabilized quarter over quarter, but it\u2019s still a little bit down versus last year. In general, as I\u2019ve talked about, we in reaction to interest rate increases immediately start testing, so you\u2019re naturally going to see a little bit of a lag, I think, in our ability to increase rates in response to benchmarks rising. But if I look back at what benchmarks have done over the last year, they\u2019re up a little over 100 basis points, and if you look at what we\u2019re charging customers in this quarter versus a year ago, it\u2019s up a little under 100 basis points, so I think we\u2019ve been successful in migrating rates up. We\u2019ve kept an eye on the three-day payoffs, which have been very stable this year. When we first starting increasing rates, we saw a little bit of a tick up in that, but I think it\u2019s normalized now.","You know, the reality is it just takes some time to respond to rate increases. We\u2019re not going to preemptively increase rates on a prediction that rates are going to go up, so I think we\u2019ve done a pretty good job of moving things up, but in an increasing rate environment, you\u2019re naturally going to see a little bit of lag there.","Matt Fassler","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.","Brian Nagel","Hi, good morning. Nice quarter. My question centers on the used car business. Clearly with a two-one comp, like you said Bill in your prepared comments, it returned to positive comps, but what\u2019s encouraging there is even on a stacked basis, it\u2019s stronger on both two and three years. I want to understand better from your perspective what\u2019s happening in the overall environment. You talked a bit about used car pricing - it sounds like that\u2019s still a headwind, so maybe elaborate further on that, and then, are there other factors out there that are helping drive better sales, and how do we think about the sustainability of those factors for the back half of this year? Thanks.","Bill Nash","Yes Brian, I\u2019ve been here a long time and it\u2019s a very unusual market right now. As I\u2019ve said in my opening remarks, acquisition costs are still, when you look at a year-over-year basis, much higher than they were a year ago, and we had a little bit of an offset on acquisition prices because our inventory that we sold skewed to be a little bit older, but it wasn\u2019t enough to offset the increase in acquisition prices. At the end of the first quarter, we were starting to see--although your starting point of prices was higher, at the end of the first quarter we were starting to see depreciation trends more normalized. It really stopped after the end of the first quarter. Second quarter, we\u2019ve seen unusual depreciation curves - in other words, normally you\u2019d see continued depreciation during this time of year, and we just really didn\u2019t see that. It\u2019s very different than in past years - it\u2019s been very flat.","I think there\u2019s probably, and this is just my belief, some of what\u2019s driving that may be anticipation of tariffs on new cars and people speculating and trying to buy up used cars; but to be honest with you, I don\u2019t really know why that is. New car prices are obviously still as high as ever and they continue to go up, so as far as the outlook going forward, I would think at some point we would start to see depreciation trends more normalize, even if your cost is at a higher starting price. I would think that we\u2019d start to see it more normalize, especially as continued inventory comes in off of the lease increases that we\u2019ve seen over the last few years.","Brian Nagel","On that, so with the hurricane [indiscernible] we recently saw hit the east coast, could that further exacerbate the pricing dynamic within the used market?","Bill Nash","It\u2019s hard to tell. I think the industry so far is saying that this is not from a destruction of automobiles, this is not to the magnitude of, say, Harvey was. I think I saw some estimates of maybe 20,000 vehicles or so, so I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to see to the magnitude that we did a year ago.","Brian Nagel","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities. Your line is open.","Seth Basham","Thanks a lot, and good morning. My question is on the hurricane impacts on sales. Last year, I think you had some negative impact on your sales at the end of the second quarter and some positive impact in the third. How do we think about that from a year-over-year perspective this year, considering Hurricane Flo? Can you give us some color there, please?","Bill Nash","Yes, so as far as the hurricanes last year, you\u2019re right - it really impacted us only the last week of the quarter, so the real impact is next quarter. As far as Flo goes, we\u2019ll talk more about that because it happened in the third quarter, but I will tell you we did have a period of time where we had several stores shut down, but we as an organization fared very well from a property standpoint. The stores and the inventory, we did not see some of the impacts that we saw last year.","Keep in mind, when we have these weather events, generally it\u2019s the timing and then we\u2019ll get the sales back afterwards.","Seth Basham","Did you pull forward the opening of the Wilmington store to capitalize on potential demand in that market?","Bill Nash","Actually, we delayed the Wilmington because it was supposed to open up pretty much right in the mix of the hurricane prep, so we delayed it, which is why it\u2019s opening today.","Seth Basham","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Armintas Sinkevicius with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Armintas Sinkevicius","Good morning. Thank you for taking the question. I can appreciate, having been done in Virginia, the capabilities that you have in-house and continue to develop, and that you can transport cars the same way as Carvana can. I\u2019m curious - what do you think it will take for the market to realize that your capabilities are similar? Do you think it will be the launch of the bundled offers? Just curious on your thoughts there. ","Bill Nash","I don\u2019t know, I mean, we\u2019re focused on making sure that we deliver this omni-channel. We understand that customers want to do more online, and like I said earlier, the complexity that\u2019s involved with used cars, we feel like there is points in that process where the customer wants assistance, so that\u2019s our focus. Our focus is on right now delivering the omni-channel, and we\u2019ll see how the market responds after that.","Armintas Sinkevicius","What are your market shares in the Carvana markets, and how has that changed?","Bill Nash","We don\u2019t speak specifically to individual competitors. We view our competitive set as much broader than, say, digital type players, and again we\u2019re focused on all competitors. Just like we don\u2019t talk about geographic differences, we won\u2019t speak to competitor differences.","Armintas Sinkevicius","Okay, thank you so much.","Operator","Your next question comes from Craig Kennison with Baird. Your line is open.","Craig Kennison","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Bill, you mentioned rolling out the online appraisal tool in more markets. I\u2019m curious, in those pilots, how accurate have those online appraisals proven to be?","Bill Nash","Actually Craig, let me clarify a little bit. What I talked about in the opening remarks was the estimator - that\u2019s a different tool than what we\u2019re testing. We have several tests going on. One is the estimator, which is the new one, which is just a series of simple questions a customer can fill out, we give them an estimate. In the markets where we\u2019re doing online appraisals, we have several different versions of that, that we\u2019re testing as well. What we\u2019ve found is that we can be very accurate on the online appraisal offers. What we\u2019re really trying to figure out is what\u2019s the best delivery mechanism for those, what\u2019s the best process for individual customers, and how we communicate those offers. With some customers, depending on the vehicles, there may be different solutions, so that\u2019s why we\u2019ve been testing several different things and continue to test several different things.","Craig Kennison","Could you just remind me of the difference between an estimate and an appraisal?","Bill Nash","Sure. The estimate is just what I said - it\u2019s an estimate offer that still has to be brought to the store or leveraged through our online appraisal offer. The online appraisal offer is one that we will back, assuming that the customer didn\u2019t oversee some type of condition that impacts the vehicle.","Craig Kennison","Got it, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Michael Montani with MoffettNathanson. Your line is open.","Michael Montani","Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to ask, Bill, for your thoughts around potential impacts from tariffs, to the extent that we were to see those happen. How do you see that playing out for your business and the industry a little bit more broadly?","Bill Nash","I think we\u2019ll have to wait and see, but obviously the tariffs on new cars would certainly cause the new car prices to go up, and then you\u2019d have to look at what that did to the gap between new cars and late model used cars. I would think that that would widen, which I think would be helpful for our business.","The other thing that we\u2019d have to stay tuned on is really the parts and things that we use in our reconditioning process, so we\u2019re staying close to it and we\u2019ll continue to monitor it as it progresses.","Michael Montani","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from James Albertine with Consumer Edge. Your line is open.","James Albertine","Great, thank you, and good morning everyone. I wanted to ask on the EPP side, if possible. I know there is some cost benefit that you alluded to in the press release, and there\u2019s an accounting adjustment there, a benefit; but wanted to get the sense on the unit side, given the zero to four-year-old mix fell, are you seeing attachment actually increase, because I would imagine that would be a factor driving monthly payments higher and so make the comp performance look even better in that regard.","Tom Reedy","Jamie, we\u2019ve seen pretty darn consistent EPP attach rates over the years, and that was part of the reason we were able to take a little bit more margin with the cost reductions from our competitors in lieu of passing it onto customers in the form of lower prices earlier this year, because we\u2019ve seen that elasticity and it\u2019s come through. We haven\u2019t seen a reduction in our attach rate at all.","With regard to the accounting standard, that\u2019s something that we have to look at every quarter now. We have to put a receivable on the books for those retro payments that we\u2019re entitled to based on the contracts, and every quarter we\u2019ll look at it and we\u2019ll make an estimation of what we believe has changed and what we expect to collect on some of those plans. ","One thing that I think might be helpful to point out, though, is the methodology that we use to predict that receivable includes some seasoning of the plans before they\u2019re going to get put into the consideration set, so that every quarter we\u2019ll be looking at additional plans that have seasoned to the point where they\u2019re worth looking at and making assessments based on that. The thing could move either direction, but one dynamic I think it\u2019s important to know is there are new plans being put into the consideration set every quarter, and in recent years, as I talked about last quarter, we\u2019ve seen over-performance for the vendors in those plans and we\u2019ve been expecting to get a payback.","James Albertine","So just a point of clarification, you\u2019d expect with older vehicles that the attachment rate would fall, I would imagine, and so if we were to, say, see a surge in zero to four-year-old vehicle demand in the coming quarters, being flat now, arguably you might even see an uptick from here. Is that fair?","Tom Reedy","I mean, I don\u2019t have the data in front of me, but I would think the opposite would be, off the top of my head, true. The newer vehicles still have some of their manufacturer\u2019s warranty left on them, and frankly the older vehicles, the EFP is a better value proposition for the customer because it\u2019s going to protect them when they don\u2019t have a warranty. ","James Albertine","Understood. Great, thank you so much.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Murphy with Bank of America. Your line is open.","John Murphy","Good morning, guys. Just a question as we think about the competitive dynamics in the market, and you kind of talked about this a little bit but I wanted to put it all together. Are there any specific markets where competitive is being disruptive, or any markets you can point to that you\u2019re being disruptive? What I\u2019m trying to get at here is there is an increasing focus by the new vehicle dealers, there\u2019s obviously some digital competitors that are out there, but at the same time as you launch your omni-channel efforts and kind of really coalesce what you\u2019re doing online and within home delivery, you might be disruptive. I\u2019m just trying to understand the competitive dynamics and if you can give us any examples in markets where you see market share shifts or opportunities. It just seems there\u2019s a lot going on right now, and you\u2019re probably going to be one of the big winners but I think there\u2019s a lot of concern out there.","Bill Nash","Yes John, you\u2019re right - the competition is robust from a lot of different angles, whether it\u2019s digital players, whether it\u2019s brick and mortar players, standalone players, that kind of thing, and we\u2019re focused on all of them. I\u2019m not going to talk specifically about any particular markets because I can tell you, it\u2019s a very complicated analysis when you try to dial into an individual market, looking at all the different competitive sets that are there, what are those competitors doing, what are we doing differently, you have to take into consideration age of our stores. There\u2019s a whole bunch of things that you have to look at. ","What I would just tell you is that we\u2019re really positioning ourselves to be that solution for the customer, allowing the customer to really drive the transaction on their terms, individualize every single customer interaction. That\u2019s what our focus is on and less so about, okay, what\u2019s this one player doing. We think that this omni-channel solution is going to be the future of where customers want to go.","John Murphy","Maybe just a really quick follow-up. When you think about that competition and the ramp-up and the focus on this specific channel in the market, or used vehicles in the market, is the upward pressure on pricing because of that, or is it because of the end market consumer, meaning is there an increasing acceptance that maybe lower grosses by this increasing competition might be what\u2019s driving up the used vehicle pricing in a way that just seems very counterintuitive to supply and demand in normal depreciation curves?","Bill Nash","Yes, the way I think about it, John, is look - I feel very good about our pricing and the competitiveness of our pricing. As you know, we look at it all the time, we test it all the time. I think what happens is because there is a focus from a lot of different areas, there is in any given market probably some confusion out there because a lot of different competitors are advertising, so I think there\u2019s some confusion there. But I\u2019m less worried about the pricing at this point because there\u2019s a lot of different things that we can do to improve our price without, say, changing what our gross profit per unit is. I think more right now, there\u2019s just a lot of awareness out there, or confusion out there of a bunch of different competitors.","John Murphy","Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from Rick Nelson with Stephens. Your line is open.","Nick Zangler","Hey guys, Nick Zangler in for Rick here. More of a strategic question. From your early findings, can you talk about the importance for a customer to physically see a vehicle in person before they commit to a purchase - what\u2019s your view there? Then related, I think the value of delivery in general could be debated, but do you foresee a capability that allows a customer to conduct virtually the entire vehicle transaction online and simply come into the store, verify the vehicle condition and pick it up there, and does the consumer desire that capability as well? Thanks.","Bill Nash","Okay, so on your first question, do they want to see the car? Absolutely, the majority of our customers want to see the car. On your second question, the value of delivery - listen, what you described is what we\u2019re talking about when we say expedited or express delivery. That\u2019s our first attempt into that foray, where the customer can do most everything online and then they come into the store just to test drive it, if they want to test drive it, understand what the options are. Again, the customer will determine how much time they want to be in the store. If they want to be in and out in 15 minutes, they can be out in 15 minutes. If they want to take it for a test drive, obviously it will be a little bit longer than that.","But most of what we see on the customer side is that they still want to see and, in a lot of cases, test drive the vehicle.","Nick Zangler","Great, thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from Matthew Paige with Gabelli. Your line is open.","Matthew Paige","Good morning, and congrats on a nice quarter. I wanted to ask potentially a longer term question. Obviously fully these are a small but growing piece of the U.S. market, but have you learned any lessons or how to make any changes to your CarMax appraisal system to deal with those kinds of vehicles that might have a potentially different depreciation schedule? ","Bill Nash","I\u2019m not exactly sure what you\u2019re asking, Matthew.","Matthew Paige","EVs, I don\u2019t have a historical basis for how your appraisal system likely does other kinds of cars. How have you dealt with new entries into the market?","Bill Nash","Yes, so if you\u2019re talking specifically, let\u2019s say EVs, obviously I think the industry as a whole would have thought that EV sales would have been a bigger percentage as compared to where it is today. That being said, we do get EVs through the appraisal lane, we buy them offsite Because of our data set, because we look at so many cars both in the appraisal lane and offsite, we\u2019ve honed that muscle as well, just like with the traditional cars. So far, even though it\u2019s a small subset, we feel very comfortable in being able to price that type of vehicle, and again because of the data that we have and the number of vehicles that we look at on a weekly basis, we learn very quickly and then we can react to those learnings.","Matthew Paige","Great, I appreciate you taking my question.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Whiston with Morningstar. Your line is open.","David Whiston","Thanks, good morning. My question is on the digital omni-channel and the whole ecommerce platform that you\u2019ve been working on. Have there been some real big challenges in states where the laws are really behind the times tech-wise, and do you think those issues are resolved? If you can just talk about those issues a bit, thanks.","Bill Nash","I think from a regulatory standpoint, there\u2019s a couple different things. Some states still require that vehicle sales occur at the dealership\u2019s physical location and that the customer has to actually visit the dealership - we call that darkening the door. Other states, you have to have a physical location but you don\u2019t necessarily have to have the customer come in and do the transaction in the store, and then other states obviously are more liberal and you don\u2019t have to have either one of those requirements. As we continue to work through this, we\u2019ll obviously make sure that we follow any applicable laws, and again our goal is to meet the customer on their terms and we\u2019ll do that in a legal way.","David Whiston","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jacob Moser with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.","Chris Bottiglieri","Hi everyone, this is Chris Bottiglieri at Wolfe Research. I had a couple questions--well, one with a follow-up, to follow Katharine\u2019s rules. Given the store traffic was challenged but you saw higher appraisal traffic, can you maybe just connect the two? Are you starting to see the [indiscernible] improve or some of your digital efforts driving increased appraisal traffic, if you could talk about that?","Bill Nash","Yes, I think the appraisal traffic is probably a combination of things, whether it\u2019s some of the stuff that we\u2019re doing - marketing online. I also think it\u2019s a very favorable pricing environment where, as I talked about earlier, acquisition prices are higher, we can put more money on people\u2019s vehicles, and when you can do that, that certainly helps your buy rate. On the opposite side, if there\u2019s a depreciating market, that generally hurts your buy rate a little bit. So I think a lot of it is based off the environment that we\u2019re in, in addition to a lot of other things that we\u2019re working on.","Chris Bottiglieri","Got you. As a follow-up, I assume it\u2019s connected, can you just give an update on your self-sufficiency ratio and how that\u2019s been trending more recently? ","Bill Nash","Sure. Self-sufficiency, we\u2019ve typically talked about the range, 40 to 50%, and right now we\u2019re in the lower end of that range.","Chris Bottiglieri","Got you, okay. Thank you for the help, appreciate it.","Operator","Your next question comes from Sharon Zackfia with William Blair. Your line is open.","Sharon Zackfia","Hi, just a follow-up question. I know market share data is hard to get until you get to an annual basis, but how do you feel like you\u2019re likely to shape up this year? Do you feel like you are continuing to gain share in the marketplace? Then secondarily, there\u2019s been a lot of discussion about disruption in the marketplace, and you\u2019ve been a disruptor over the years as well. I guess I\u2019m curious if you\u2019ve seen anything particularly in Atlanta, which is where Carvana\u2019s oldest market is.","Bill Nash","Okay, you\u2019re going to be disappointed, Sharon, on both of your questions. The first one on the market share, to your point, when you look at it in the short term, it\u2019s not as valid, which is why we look at it on an annual basis. As you probably recall, last time we reported on it, it was last year\u2019s calendar year which we saw one of our biggest comp market share gains that we\u2019ve seen in a while. I don\u2019t have any updates on that front at this point.","The other thing as far as disruption in a specific market, again I really don\u2019t want to get into talking about any individual markets or, for that fact, any individual competitor. Our competitive set is huge, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re focused on. We\u2019re focused on overall competition.","I know neither of those answers are satisfying to you, but that\u2019s what I\u2019ve got for you.","Sharon Zackfia","All right, thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from Michael Montani with MoffettNathanson. Your line is open.","Michael Montani","Hey guys, just wanted to follow up on maybe an alternative revenue channel and just get your thoughts here. When you think about the growth and maturation we\u2019re seeing from Uber and Lyft and then some of the partners they have, like a hire car or a fare, I\u2019m just wondering if you can provide any updates or thinking about the potential growth opportunity in that channel, just because it would seem potentially to be substantial.","Bill Nash","Michael, what I\u2019d say is, look - I think that this is an exciting time to be in the automotive industry just outright because of so many different things that are changing. I think there\u2019s lots of opportunities for CarMax, and I would tell you, I wouldn\u2019t take anything off the plate at this point. We\u2019re constantly looking at the business and how we can continue to improve, as well as make sure that we plan for the future as the business changes. ","I would just tell you, we\u2019re pretty much open to a lot of different options, and we\u2019re working with some different strategic partners trying to do different things. When we have something material to talk about, we\u2019ll talk about it at that point.","Michael Montani","Got it, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Matt Fassler with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Matt Fassler","Thanks a lot. Thanks for having me back on. I have a couple follow-ups on the numbers. The first relates to ASP. Your new car ASP--I\u2019m sorry, your used ASPs were up slightly year-on-year, and that would be consistent presumably with what we saw in the market broadly. Your wholesale ASPs, I guess were under a tad of pressure--not pressure per se, but just down a little bit. What was going on in the wholesale ASP realm in terms of mix that was different from what was transpiring in the market more broadly?","Bill Nash","Yes, if you mix-adjust the wholesale, our prices--because it is a stronger market, our prices actually went up, but we did have a mix shift where we had more older cars which generally will bring the price down as well as the mix, we had some more compacts come through which will change the pricing as well. You have different factors going in different directions.","Then on the used side, again acquisition price was higher and it was partially offset by the shift into older vehicles.","Matt Fassler","Understood. Then the follow-up relates to your other overhead spend. There\u2019s been a lot of talk on this call about innovation, and presumably a lot of the things you\u2019re doing, presumably the way that manifests in the P&L in any given quarter is the other overhead line, and I think you alluded to that in your press release. That spend was up 24%, which is as big as it\u2019s been since late \u201916, and about as big an increase as you\u2019ve typically had. ","I know you don\u2019t guide on a go-forward basis, but should we expect that this line item remains a big focus for you as you potentially accelerate some of the innovation on your end?","Bill Nash","Well, keep in mind a couple things. The total SG&A was up. Part of that was because of the advertising and the timing of the advertising. In the other category, where we do have some investments in our strategic initiatives, I\u2019ve said all along this year that we\u2019re continuing to invest and put back into the business, and I think some of the increase that you saw there - there\u2019s some consulting, there\u2019s some contracting, there\u2019s software as a service - some of those things will stick around, some of those things will go away as certain projects come to completion, that kind of thing. So I think there is some timing in there, but again this is a year that I\u2019ve said all along that we\u2019re going to continue to invest in the organization. ","Matt Fassler","Totally understood. Thanks so much.","Operator","Your next question comes from Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Scot Ciccarelli","Hi guys. I don\u2019t think you had enough CAF questions just yet, so I had one. I think during Tom\u2019s brief remarks earlier, he referenced weaker performance in the Tier 3 space. I guess I was wondering, is that just referencing the mix being down a touch, or did you actually see tighter lending standards there? ","Tom Reedy","No, I guess I wasn\u2019t clear enough. As I mentioned in my prepared comments, we saw application volume up pretty much across the spectrum in all credit grades. It may have been a little more robust in the middle space where the Tier 2 is, but it was up across the board. The degradation in Tier 3 resulted--you know, it was a combination of increased volume but a decrease in the performance by the lender, so we\u2019ve seen conversion in the Tier 3 space over the course of the quarter actually deteriorate, and that\u2019s--","Scot Ciccarelli","So if it deteriorates during the quarter, does that suggest maybe that will continue as we roll into third quarter, then?","Tom Reedy","Well, we\u2019ll see how that progresses. We\u2019ve talked about--we\u2019ve got a number of lenders in there, it\u2019s one in particular. We\u2019re looking at our alternatives and as third quarter materializes, we\u2019ll tell you how it went. But obviously we\u2019re looking at it carefully.","Scot Ciccarelli","Understood, thank you.","Operator","Again that\u2019s star, one if you would like to ask a question. ","Your next question comes from Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities. Your line is open.","Seth Basham","I also have a question on CAF for you, as it relates to the lending outlook, the tightening that we\u2019ve seen at the subprime level. Do you think that\u2019s indicative of something we might see on a wider basis going forward, and as it relates to your CAF portfolio loss rate performance specifically, how would you characterize that right now? We\u2019re seeing it tick up a little bit more than historical seasonal averages. Would you expect it to maintain the current level, or do you expect it to increase a little bit going forward?","Tom Reedy","I\u2019ll start with your second question, Seth. We\u2019re not seeing anything in our Tier 3 lending that is surprising us, so--obviously it\u2019s a different animal than what we do in the prime space and a different customer relationship, different expected losses, but we haven\u2019t seen anything there that has given us any pause. As I mentioned, it\u2019s really performance by one lender, so I can\u2019t speculate on whether it\u2019s something that could be global in the future. That\u2019s why we have multiple partners, because different institutions have different credit committees, they get different leadership at different points in their evolution, and they can change their mind about how they want to behave.","Seth Basham","Okay, thank you.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. I will turn the call back over to Mr. Nash for closing remarks. ","Bill Nash","Thank you, Jamie, and thank you all for joining the call today. As Katharine mentioned when she first started out, it was our 25th anniversary as a company last week, and that truly is a testament to our associates. I\u2019m once again reminded why our associates are a differentiator for CarMax, and it\u2019s because of the way they live our values with each other, our customers, and the communities.

As always, I hope you remember to ask just one question and a follow-up before getting back in queue.","Thank you, and I\u2019ll turn it over to Tom.","Tom Folliard","Thanks Katharine. Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining us today. As you saw, we had a great third quarter. Total revenues grew 16% to $3.4 billion, net earnings grew 22% to $130 million, and earnings per share have increased almost 28% to $0.60. Used unit comps grew by 7.4% for the quarter and total used units rose by 14%. Gross profit per used unit increased $23 compared to last year to $2,172. Total wholesale units were up 10% and gross profit per wholesale unit was up $40 to $927. Other sales and revenue rose by over 30% partially due to an increase of $13 million in extended protection plan revenues. This expansion reflected the growth in unit sales offset by a somewhat lower penetration rate. Also impacting October sales and revenues growth was a $2.5 million improvement in third party finance fees.","CAF income grew 7% to approximately $90 million, and I\u2019ll turn it over to Tom to give you some more details. Tom?","Tom Reedy","Thanks Tom. Good morning everybody. In Q3, CAF income grew 7% compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2014, and average managed receivables grew 18% to $8 billion. CAF weighted average contract rate - that\u2019s the rate charged to customers - was flat to last year\u2019s third quarter at 7%, and this rate has been relatively stable for the past eight quarters. The allowance for loan losses grew to $80 million, which represents 1% of managed receivables and is consistent with last year. At 41.8%, CAF net penetration was up slightly compared to last year\u2019s third quarter in part due to our subprime test, which was not in place last year. Net loan dollars originated in the quarter rose 20% to $1.2 billion due to a combination of the retail unit growth, higher penetration, and an increase in the average amount financed.","As you know, from time to time we test additional third party lenders and if we determine they add sufficient incremental value, we roll them out across our system. During the quarter, we moved Allied Financial out of the testing phase to become our fifth Tier 2 lender. Finally as you probably noticed from the press release, our treasury department has been quite busy this quarter. We closed a three-year, $300 million private term loan. We added $300 million to our unsecured revolver capacity, bringing it to a total of $1 billion, and added $200 million to CAF\u2019s warehouse facility for a total of $2.3 billion.","Now back to Tom.","Tom Folliard","Thank you. In regards to our mix, during the quarter despite the decrease in oil prices, we didn\u2019t see a significant increase in our sales of SUVs and trucks compared to last year. We are starting to see some growth in sales of zero to four-year-old cars, which we\u2019ve been talking about for a while, compared to last year - they\u2019re now about 75% of sales, but that percentage is about the same as what it was in the second quarter. ","SG&A for the quarter increased approximately 11% to $317 million. This growth is primarily due to the addition of 20 stores since the beginning of the third quarter of last year. If you remember, in the second quarter we were on top of about 18 new stores. On a per-unit basis, SG&A decreased $52 to $22.43 compared to $22.95 in the third quarter of fiscal 2014. ","During the third quarter, we opened four stores, two in new markets for CarMax, Tupelo, Mississippi and Reno, Nevada, and two in existing markets, Portland, Oregon and Raleigh, North Carolina. In the fourth quarter, we\u2019ll open one more store in our new market in Cleveland, home of Katharine Kenny.","Katharine Kenny","Woo-hoo!","Tom Folliard","Store traffic was up once again in the quarter and our web traffic also continued to expand. For the third quarter compared to last year, average monthly web visits grew over 17% to nearly 14 million. Business to our mobile site continued to represent approximately 30% of total visits while visits utilizing our mobile apps represented another 15% of the total.","With that, we\u2019d be happy to take your questions. Operator?","Question and Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions]","Your first question comes from the line of Matt Nemer from Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open.","Matt Nemer","Good morning everyone, and congrats on an outstanding quarter. First question I wanted to ask about is whether the Auto Trader and the Cars.com addition or re-launch is maybe one of the factors that\u2019s driving your traffic, and I\u2019d love to hear about anything else that you think is driving the traffic in the stores and on the web. Obviously it seems like it was very strong.","Tom Folliard","The first, Matt, a little background there. If you remember last year, throughout the whole year we had decided to no longer list our cars on Cars.com and AutoTrader.com, and we had 12% comps last year, 17% share gain, and one of the better years we\u2019ve ever had in the history of the company. The reason we stopped the first time is because we weren\u2019t making a good return on our investment. What we\u2019ve started back with the two of them is just a test, and the test is to determine whether or not we can make a good return on the investment. So it was a test during the quarter. I don\u2019t have a lot to report, but my guess is it had very little impact. ","Matt Nemer","Okay, then just a quick follow-up. The gross profit per unit has been extremely consistent over the last couple of years, and it ticked a little bit higher. Just wondering if you\u2019re starting to see--if you feel like you\u2019re getting--your ability to increase prices isn\u2019t impacting your unit sales, and that\u2019s kind of why that\u2019s starting to drift, and could we see that continue? Thanks.","Tom Folliard","I view $20 as flat. If we were $20 down, we would have viewed it as just as good and just as consistent a performance, so it\u2019s not an exact science to manage this margin across this number of sales at this price point, so I\u2019d view that as just relatively flat and I think it just shows that we\u2019re getting better and more analytical each and every year and each and every quarter at managing our inventory and managing to our targeted margin. Despite some depreciation that we saw in the third quarter, which I think was pretty apparent in some external sources, we were able to manage our margins pretty tightly once again and deliver a 7.5% comp, so I\u2019m pretty proud of what we\u2019ve accomplished but we continue to work on it every year, and I think we get a little better each year.","Matt Nemer","Great. Nice work, and happy holidays.","Tom Folliard","Thanks. You too, Matt.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Nagel from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.","Brian Nagel","Hi, good morning. Congratulations on a really nice quarter. My first question, and it may be a follow-on to Matt\u2019s question too, but there\u2019s been a lot of chatter amongst investors with respect to declines in used car pricing and what impact that could have on CarMax. You saw some of your competitors have troubles; you obviously did not. Bigger picture, how are you thinking about it as you\u2019re looking at maybe the used car market now following a more normal pricing trajectory? How is that affecting, if at all, the CarMax business model?","Tom Folliard","You know, we\u2019ve been at this for a while, Brian, and the fall is a time when we always see depreciation. We\u2019ve had some anomalies going into the recession and coming out of the recession, but in a normal year you expect some appreciation in January through the spring, and then we expect some depreciation throughout the rest of the year all the way through December. I think we\u2019ve proven that we can manage in all kinds of different volatile environments, and this one is not as volatile as we\u2019ve seen in the past, so we view this as--I don\u2019t want to say it\u2019s business as usual, but it\u2019s normal depreciation that we see during the third quarter if you look at a 20-year history and say what does an average year look like. So I just think it\u2019s something that we\u2019re getting a little bit better at every year, just as I said to Matt on the last question.","Brian Nagel","That\u2019s helpful. My follow-up question would be on the buyback. It wasn\u2019t that long ago you and your board introduced a pretty significant buyback plan for CarMax, and we did see buyback activity step up somewhat here in the third quarter. Any guidance you can give us how we should expect you to execute on that buyback as we going into 2015 and beyond?","Tom Folliard","You know, Brian, I think the announcement that you saw from management and from our board was really just an authorization and a further commitment to delivering capital back to shareholders with a rather lengthy expiration date on it, so that it gave us the flexibility to continue to run the program that we\u2019ve been running. We could go a little more aggressively if we wanted, but it\u2019s just what it says - it\u2019s an authorization, it has a two-year limit on it, but I think it\u2019s a nice show of confidence from our board in our ability over the next few years to continue to run a good business and put ourselves in a position to keep delivering capital back to shareholders through the buyback. ","Brian Nagel","Got it. Thanks and congrats again.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Murphy from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","John Murphy","Good morning, guys. A follow-up question on used car pricing, or to Brian\u2019s question there. Tom, there\u2019s a lot of concern that used car pricing might fade, yet all the data from you and the public dealers is actually positive on transaction prices. Is there the potential here that we\u2019re seeing some supply increase but demand actually increasing faster than that supply is increasing, and we might be in an environment where pricing stays relatively stable even as supply is increasing, which is really kind of a Goldilocks scenario for your business?","Tom Folliard","You know, that\u2019s impossible to tell. Our average retail was actually down in the quarter compared to the second quarter of this year by $300, so I think that reflects a little bit of depreciation. As I\u2019ve said before, we don\u2019t spend a lot of time trying to figure out what\u2019s going to happen a year from now. It\u2019s pretty irrelevant to us running our business day-to-day, and we turn our inventory quick enough that I think we\u2019re able to respond to whatever volatility the market has to offer. But I do think we\u2019ve seen some improvements in the economy. We saw a nice tick-up in the SAR. We\u2019ve always said whenever we see new car sales in the up-tick, that that shows that people are willing to get out there and buy a car and sign up for a loan, and I think that\u2019s good for us, it\u2019s good for the consumer overall in terms of their activity. But it\u2019s really difficult to predict what\u2019s going to happen in the future.","John Murphy","Okay, and then just sort of a follow-up question here on SG&A. Typically we think there\u2019s leverage in the model at about a 7.5% positive same store sales comp, but as the store base gets larger, is it possible that that comes down over time and might get closer to 5%? I\u2019m just trying to understand how you think about leverage on SG&A as the store base gets larger.","Tom Folliard","Yeah, that\u2019s possible. We\u2019ve never given a precise number because we\u2019re not sure what that number is. You never know what kind of incremental investments you might make at any given point in time. This is the most stores, the most new stores, so stores that are the most SG&A inefficient, that we\u2019ve ever carried, which is 20 during the third quarter, and we were still able to leverage by $50 on a per-unit basis our total SG&A with the 7.5% comp. So there\u2019s a combination of factors that are going to allow us to either leverage or not, so it happened to work out this quarter. I couldn\u2019t give you an exact number, but it does make sense logically that unless we dramatically accelerated our growth rate, that we\u2019d be able to leverage a little bit better as the base gets bigger.","John Murphy","Thanks a lot. Great execution.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brett Hoselton from Keybanc. Your line is now open.","Brett Hoselton","Good morning. I was hoping you could talk a little bit about CAF profitability, specifically how do we think about a rising interest rate environment negatively impacting CAF profitability? How do you think about your cost of funds, what might be the best representative rate that you use or something like that, and is there any way that you can kind of say look, if we saw 100 basis point increase in that cost of funds, that would represent some sort of a dollar amount headwind to that $90 million that you made in the third quarter? How can we kind of quantify that?","Tom Reedy","Well first off, I\u2019ve got to remind everybody, we\u2019re going to run a market business and kind of our APRs are going to be driven by competition and our cost of funds are going to be driven by what we can achieve in the marketplace. As far as what to look at for cost of funds, you can look at our securitization deals and the benchmarks in those, and that gives you kind of a good estimate of where we\u2019re locking down long-term financing. As far as profitability, we believe over time we can manage to a reasonable profit, at least to a market profit. In fact, if you look back at 2007, early 2008 to our securitization that we did back then, we were running at a very similar spread between APR and cost of funds then as we are today, and interest rates were 400 to 500 basis points higher than they are today. So we don\u2019t believe a higher interest rate market precludes a finance company from making the kind of returns that we\u2019ve been making recently; however, as you migrate towards higher interest rates, APRs are typically sticky upward and downward, and there might be a little bit of lag time for the market to adjust to rates rising, so you might see some compression in that as things are moving. We\u2019ve benefited from that when rates have fallen, we\u2019ve felt the pressure as rates are rising; but overall, I think we can manage a market rate of return on the business.","Brett Hoselton","Okay. And then I apologize, Katharine, I\u2019m just getting a lot of questions about rising used vehicle--or excuse me, declining used vehicle growth or used vehicle prices. Obviously they haven\u2019t declined recently, but the general expectation is that used vehicle prices are going to decline, so getting a lot of questions from investors as to is that a net positive or a net negative for your firm? I think that we believe that it\u2019s a net position for you, but can you explain why you see that as a net positive, because I think you believe that as well.","Tom Folliard","You know, I\u2019ve kind of answered that a couple of times, which is whatever the market delivers, we\u2019ve done a pretty decent job of navigating through it. I\u2019m always a believer lower prices are better for the consumer, and we turn our inventory quick enough that we can manage margins in a declining environment, but I\u2019m also not a believer we\u2019re going to see this giant decline in car prices because there\u2019s some tidal wave of supply coming our way. I think things tend to find a way to equal out.","Brett Hoselton","Fair enough. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Scot Ciccarelli","Good morning guys. I was looking for clarification real quick. Did you say Allied was added to the Tier 2 or Tier 3?","Tom Reedy","Tier 2, Scot. ","Scot Ciccarelli","Okay. Obviously subprime bounced back--subprime penetration bounced back sequentially from what we saw last quarter. Can you help us understand a little bit more about that, because obviously we had seen some deterioration in that trend over the prior last few quarters, and is that just a function of guys like Santander becoming more aggressive? Was there any other changes that might have happened on the subprime side, just to help us think about what happens in the future?","Tom Reedy","You know, I can\u2019t really speak to if there\u2019s been any changes. What I can speak to is we have seen over the past several months relatively stable behavior from our subprime lenders. We saw the big correction last year as they adjusted their behavior, but if we look at conversion of customers that were given acceptances, I think it would be fair to say that the behaviors have been relatively consistent over the last several months. As to where that goes going forward, we want them to run a good and sustainable business, and we\u2019re going to encourage them to do that, and things will shake out the way they do.","There\u2019s really nothing beyond that I can really say about the bounce back, other than we feel like we\u2019ve been in a pretty stable place for the last several months.","Tom Folliard","Hey, it\u2019s only a point and a half or two in terms of percent of sales, so it\u2019s not--it wasn\u2019t anything significant, Scot.","Scot Ciccarelli","Right, no I understand. One thing that I think had been mentioned previously is there\u2019s been a blending of some of the, let\u2019s call it top tier subprime customers where some of the Tier 2 lenders have kind of moved into that portion of the customer base. Any feel for what the impact is or any way to kind of size the impact of Tier 2 getting a little bit more aggressive on the down side?","Tom Reedy","I think the easiest way to look at it--the way we look at it is we\u2019re moving customers from a bucket where we\u2019re paying a discount to our lenders to one where we\u2019re receiving a premium from them, so there\u2019s a significant shift in profitability. Just like the Tier 3 lenders, we\u2019re encouraging the Tier 2 lenders to run a business that\u2019s sustainable for them over a long time. I think we\u2019ve seen their credit appetite increase over the last several quarters - that\u2019s been a good thing for us, and the reason we manage a large stable of lenders there is so that we can get the best offers for CarMax customers on an ongoing basis.","Tom Folliard","But Scot, it\u2019s also difficult to quantify very specifically because of the way we run our credit. We run a waterfall of credit. It goes from one tier of lenders down to the next, down to the next. If it gets picked up in the middle, then the bottom tier never see the application in the first place. So it\u2019s not as easy as it sounds to say, oh, we got half a point or a point and a half from this or that; but to Tom\u2019s point, anything that gets picked up on the way down is a positive, and we have a bunch of lending partners and we\u2019re grateful for all the relationships that we\u2019ve built over the years, but they all run their own models and we hope they run them profitably and they can stay with us for a long time.","Scot Ciccarelli","All right, got it. Thanks a lot, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Craig Kennison from Baird. Please go ahead.","Craig Kennison","Good morning. Thank you for taking my question as well. Tom, you mentioned the drop in oil, and that seems like good news for most of your customers, but I also imagine it signals some tougher times in oil-based economies. Just wondering if you\u2019ve seen that dynamic play out at all in some of those markets.","Tom Folliard","Not that I know of. The way I look at that is you remember that the CarMax customer is the average American consumer, and the average American consumer has a little more spending money at this gas rate than they had before, so I think that\u2019s a positive for people\u2019s outlook, for their budget, for their wallet, for their consideration when they\u2019re looking to sign up for a loan for a few years. I think on the new car side, you saw it really impact the mix, and although we haven\u2019t seen it impact the mix as much, we were probably already a little more heavily skewed to SUVs and things like that in the first place. So we haven\u2019t really seen an impact on mix much, but I think the American consumer having a little more money to spend is a good thing.","Craig Kennison","And is CAF or are your lending partners at all looking at markets like Texas or other oil-based markets and saying, you know what? We\u2019ve got to score that customer differently because their incomes may actually change?","Tom Reedy","We haven\u2019t had any discussions with them along that front. Like Tom and I said, we\u2019re going to encourage them to run a business that makes sense for them, and we\u2019re going to do the same; and if we have something to talk about on that front, then we will.","Tom Folliard","There\u2019s volatility in gas prices. I\u2019m not sure if you\u2019re a lender, you want to assume that this is where gas prices are going to stay for the next five years.","Craig Kennison","Got it. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Fassler from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Matthew Fassler","Thanks a lot, and good morning. I\u2019ve got one follow-up to someone else\u2019s question and then one of my own. On the subprime piece, can you talk about whether the mix of your Tier 3 providers has changed meaningfully over the course of the past year, and whether that might have contributed at all to the moderate decline in subprime penetration?","Tom Reedy","No Matt, the mix has been very consistent over the past year. The only change has been that, as you know, CarMax is running a test and took a little bit of that volume starting this year, a very small part of the volume, and we are not behaving any differently or more aggressively than our partners.","Matthew Fassler","Got it, and then secondly, your wholesale profitability, while it was not off the charts, it was very good and showed a bit of a pick-up year-on-year in the rate of growth in wholesale margins. Any comments on what\u2019s driving your ability to continue to extract more in terms of gross profit per vehicle through your auction process?","Tom Folliard","Similar to what I said on the retail side, Matt, it\u2019s $40 up, down, pretty close. It\u2019s just good management. As you know how we run our auctions, the car sells to the top bidder, and we adjust our prices weekly as we sell through our auction. We\u2019ve had great execution in our stores, we\u2019ve had great attendance from our dealers who come to our auction and support our pricing each and every week, and I think we just continue to do a good job running our auctions. But as I said before, if we get pretty close on the margin, we consider that to be good, so it was slightly up but that\u2019s essentially flat for us.","Matthew Fassler","Understood. Thanks so much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rod Lache from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Rod Lache","Thanks. Good morning everybody. On that improvement in conversion that you mentioned in your release, is that a function of the types of customers that you\u2019re seeing coming through the door, lender behavior, or is it something else? I would imagine that if trade-in volumes moderated a little bit, that would not have necessarily helped.","Tom Folliard","No, you know, conversion for us is really a team effort. It\u2019s a combination of buying the right cars, having the right inventory at the right store at the right time, doing a great job reconditioning, having high quality cars. We\u2019ve done a lot of training with our sales force to be able to execute and help customers overcome objections, whether it\u2019s on the trade-in or their financing or what car they want to buy. Financing is obviously access to financing, and the rate that they receive is another piece of conversion. The search engine we have on our website, I just think over time we expect to be able to continue to improve conversion, but it\u2019s very difficult to point to one specific area. But as it relates directly to finance, we didn\u2019t have anything significant change in the quarter to contribute to that. As we said in the press release, our comps were driven partly by an increase in traffic and partly by an increase in conversion, and that\u2019s what I would expect over time for us, is to be able to improve both of those marginally over time.","Rod Lache","Okay, and just really quickly, I was wondering if you had any other follow-up comments on the CAF test in subprime. What are some of the takeaways and adjustments you\u2019re making, and what is sort of the trajectory we should be expecting from here?","Tom Reedy","Yeah, it\u2019s still a bit early. We\u2019re seeing the first vintages that we originated kind of across a six-month time frame, and we really need to go through a full tax season, a full cycle with this product before we can make any conclusions. So what I can say is that we have not seen anything negative and unexpected that would lead us to dial back or not continue to test. Like I said, we\u2019d like to get through tax season and continue through the test that we have, and figure out where we go from there at the end of the year. We\u2019ll probably have something to say about where we\u2019re going because we\u2019re likely to use up that initial $70 million during the quarter.","Rod Lache","Great, thank you. Congratulations.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ravi Shankar from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","[Ravi Shankar]","Good morning everyone. This is [indiscernible] in for Ravi. Just to follow up on the subprime pilot program, you initially set out to do $70 million through the end of last quarter. If you can provide some color as to what prevented you from deploying the entire $70 million?","Tom Reedy","I think we\u2019ve said we were going to run a test for $70 million. I don\u2019t think we gave any guidance on how long it would take. We\u2019ve been doing a bit of it every quarter and we\u2019re continuing to test it as we go; and as I said, next quarter I think we can give you some more visibility to where we\u2019ll go from beyond that initial 70 test.","[Ravi Shankar]","Thanks for the clarification. Then on competition, you\u2019re planning to expand your presence in the Denver market with, I think, a couple more stores in addition to a couple already there. Sonic recently launched their EchoPark stores in that market and are looking to add more stores as well. Wanted to get your thoughts on what the initial share and pricing response has been like, and where do you see it going?","Tom Folliard","We really don\u2019t have anything to report there. They\u2019ve been open for a very short window of time. We\u2019ve been open for a couple of years with two stores. Denver has always been a very attractive market for us. We\u2019ve owned real estate there for a number of years. We have a couple more stores coming in the next 12 to 18 months, but they were coming anyway, and then we have an additional store down in Colorado Springs. But their store has been open for only a month or two, so nothing to report at this time.","[Ravi Shankar]","Thanks so much.","Operator","Again if you\u2019d like to ask a question, please press star then the number one on your telephone keypad. Your next question comes from the line of Rick Nelson from Stephens. Please go ahead.","Rick Nelson","Thanks, good morning. I\u2019d like to ask about the other segment revenues. The growth in extended protection plan revenue really accelerated this quarter. If you could comment there, that\u2019d be helpful.","Tom Reedy","If you remember, last year we had a significant adjustment in the extended protection plan reserve, and so the reason you see a significant increase this year year-over-year is really because last year was impaired a bit. If you back out that adjustment, it\u2019s more like a 9% increase in those other revenues, and that comes from a combination of the extended protection plans, an improvement in the mix between subprime and non-prime, which means we have less discount that we pay to the subprime providers, and kind of relatively flat service income. But the reason that\u2019s such a big step-up was because last year was down.","Rick Nelson","Thank you for that. Also, you opened 13 stores last year, 10 the year before. Any color on as to how those stores are coming into the comps and how big a driver they are to the nice comp you reported this quarter? That\u2019d be helpful.","Tom Folliard","Well, it\u2019s awfully early in their life, but if you look at the size of the base, one year\u2019s worth of openings impact on comps, the first year that those stores become comp stores is very, very little. But obviously over time, they\u2019ll add to the total sales. You look at our total increase of 14% - half of that is coming from new stores and half of that is coming from the existing stores with the 7% comp. But we\u2019re on a pretty steady opening pace. You mentioned we opened 10 the year prior, 13 last year. We\u2019ll get another 13 open this year and we\u2019re still on that 10 to 15 store pace for the next couple of years, and lots of great places for us to go build stores, lots of markets that we\u2019re going back in and adding new stores. ","Rick Nelson","Thanks a lot, and good luck.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Armstrong from CL King & Associates. Please go ahead.","Bill Armstrong","Good morning. The only question I have left is on the EPP penetration rate. It was lower a little bit. I was wondering if you could expand on that, and maybe I don\u2019t know if you would disclose what the actual penetration rates are this year versus last year and why they are down.","Tom Reedy","Yeah, it is down a couple points. It\u2019s not down significantly. As we discussed early in the year with the change in the reserve, we were going to make some changes to pricing to recover that additional reserve, and we also talked about the fact that our partners continually are having us change prices on their product in order to preserve their business, based on the experience they see in the portfolio. There have been price changes based on their needs as well, so what we\u2019ve seen is some price changes and we\u2019ve seen a little bit of a degradation in penetration, but I think we need to see where that\u2019s going to shake out over the course of the year because penetration is also highly dependent on people\u2019s performance in the stores and the initiatives that we have around selling that product.","Tom Folliard","But our penetration is around 60%. We\u2019re really proud of our execution. I think our store teams do a great job of working with customers and showing them the value of buying an extended service plan, and our providers do a really good job of managing that through the life of the car. So we think we offer a great product and our customers realize the value in it, and we do as good a job as anybody out there in selling this product and then delivering a great experience for the customer after.","Bill Armstrong","So it sounds like the decline in penetration is more an issue of pricing rather than execution?","Tom Folliard","Yeah, and as Tom said, we talked about that at the beginning of this year.","Bill Armstrong","Yeah, okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of David Whiston from Morningstar. Please go ahead.","David Whiston","Thanks, good morning. Looking at your cash flow statement and ignoring the increase in auto loan receivables, and then just doing an adjusted CFO minus CAPEX and free cash flow as a percentage of revenue, and for the nine months \u201914 versus nine months \u201913, it\u2019s down quite a bit, which looks to be the increase in inventory. So obviously we\u2019ve got a lot more inventory supply coming online. Do you think over the next 12 months you\u2019re going to continue to have a lot of decrease in working capital from inventory accumulation?","Tom Folliard","We\u2019re going to manage our inventory in line with what our sales expectations are, and then also with the fact that we are continuing to build stores and we\u2019re building them all over the place, and we\u2019re building at a pace of about a store a month or a little better than that. So oftentimes--a lot of times, you look at our inventory and some of it is just based on timing - when is the next store being opened, are we reconditioning those cars in another market, getting them ready for that other store. But even if you look at our inventory reported at the end of the quarter, about half of the unit increase is in our existing stores, which delivered a 7.5% comp, and about half our unit increase in represented in our new stores. So our inventory will go up as our store base goes up and our comp sales go up, but it won\u2019t necessarily--it\u2019s not going to exceed that to any great degree.","Tom Reedy","I think there\u2019s a bit of seasonality in that as well. Q3 was a significant inventory build as we\u2019re coming into the tax season, so you\u2019d need to look at it over a more spread out period, I think.","David Whiston","Okay. Last question - I know in the past you\u2019ve talked about starting from scratch on targeting inventory mix weekly, but I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a lot more IT in the company over the past few years. Are you really at the point where you\u2019re sourcing, maybe even changing your sourcing habits daily or several times a day?","Tom Folliard","No, not really. It doesn\u2019t move that fast. Weekly is pretty fast, especially with the size of the investment in each individual car. Remember that half of our cars right now are coming from appraisals that we\u2019re buying directly from the consumer, and you really need a week\u2019s worth of data at least before you can make a decision about what to do the following week. So we\u2019re pretty comfortable with the way we\u2019re managing it right now. I think what has gotten better and better for us each and every year is the ability to apply that data to a buying model that is very, very store-specific, and then the other benefit that we\u2019ve gained over the last several years is as our brand gets stronger, the more cars that are on our website, the better the pictures, the better the search engine, the more accessibility the customer has to inventory in other markets, and that\u2019s about a third of our sales, are cars transferred at the customer\u2019s request, so it\u2019s another way for us to leverage that inventory. But I think hopefully we\u2019ll continue to get better at this.","David Whiston","You said transfers are a third of sales?","Tom Folliard","Roughly, yeah - right around 30%.","David Whiston","Okay, thanks.","Operator","We have no further questions in the queue. I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Mr. Tom Folliard, CEO.","[end of Q&A]","Tom Folliard","All right, thank you very much. I want to thank all of you for joining us today on the call. I also of course want to thank all of our associates for everything they do every day, especially around the holiday season.

Thanks for joining our fourth quarter and year end earnings conference call. On the call with me today are Tom Folliard, our Chief Executive Officer; Bill Nash, our President; and Tom Reedy, our Executive Vice President and CFO.","Before we begin, let me remind you that our statements today regarding the company\u2019s future business plans, prospects and financial performance are forward-looking statements that we make pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Thank you. Tom?","Tom Folliard","Thank you, Katharine. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. We had very solid year in fiscal 2016, where total revenues grew to more than $15 billion and we sold over 1 million vehicles total both in retail and wholesale for the first time ever, about 620,000 used cars and about 395,000 wholesale cars, while still \u2013 while also delivering double-digit EPS growth for the year.","Some key drivers for the year. Used unit comps increased by 2.4%. Total used units grew a little over 6.5%. Wholesale units grew by 4.9%. CAF income, up 6.7% to more than $392 million. Net income for fiscal \u201816 up 4.4% to $623 million and EPS up 11% to $3.03. Proceeds from our legal settlement benefited our fiscal 2015 net income by $12.9 million or $0.06 a share. Our data for the year indicates that for calendar year 2015, we increased our share of the 0 to 10-year-old used vehicles by approximately 1%. And we continue to focus on returning value to our shareholders through our stock repurchase program. During the year, we bought back 16.3 million shares at a cost of $971 million.","For the fourth quarter, used unit comps increased by 0.7%, driven by an improvement in conversion and total used units grew by 4%. Our total web traffic increased by 11%. Total wholesale units, up 2.3%. CAF quarterly income grew by 2.2% to $92 million. Net income for the fourth quarter declined by 1.5% to $141 million and EPS rose 6% to $0.71 a share. Remember that the impairment-related charge in this quarter reduced our net income by $5.2 million or $0.03 a share. While in the previous year\u2019s fourth quarter, net income was increased by the adjustment to capitalize interest expense of $4.2 million or $0.02 a share.","I will now turn it over to Tom Reedy to give you some details around CAF. Tom?","Tom Reedy","Thanks, Tom. Good morning, everybody. As Tom mentioned, CAF income grew by 2% compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 and average managed receivables grew by 14% to $9.5 billion. For loans originated during the quarter, the weighted average contract rate charged to customers was 7.5%, up from 7.2% in last year\u2019s fourth quarter. Total interest margin declined to 5.9% of average managed receivables compared to 6.3% in the fourth quarter last year and 6% last quarter.","For the quarter charge-offs and loss provision were in line with our expectations. The year-over-year increase in loss provision reflects both the favorability we commented on in last year\u2019s fourth quarter and the growth in receivables. Our ending allowance for loan losses at $95 million was 0.99% of managed receivables compared to 0.97% in last year\u2019s fourth quarter. CAF net penetration was 41.7% compared to 40.9% in last year\u2019s fourth quarter. This increase reflects the mix of applications in the stores, where we continue to see growth at the higher end of the credit spectrum and less volume at the lower end.","Net loan dollars originated in the quarter rose 7% year-over-year to $1.3 billion, that\u2019s due to combination of growth in CarMax sales and our higher penetration at CAF. Percent of CAF penetration attributable to our sub-prime test was similar to last year 0.7% versus 0.6% of the sales in the prior year. As mentioned in the press release, we are comfortable and plan to continue to originate these loans at the same pace, a targeted volume of 5%, as CarMax\u2019s overall Tier 3 sales. Tier 3 financing, as a percent of sales, was 15.1% compared to 17% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 largely due to the reduced volume of lower credit applications I mentioned earlier.","In Q4, we continue to experience a year-over-year decline in the number of credit applications across the lower end of the credit spectrum and moderate growth at the high end. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 3 million shares for about $156 million. For the fiscal year, as Tom said, we repurchased 16.3 million shares. And since inception of the program, we repurchased 46.4 million shares. At the end of FY \u201816, we had 1.4 billion remaining under the current authorization.","Now, I will turn the call over to Bill.","Bill Nash","Thanks, Tom. Good morning, everyone. As a percentage of our sales mix this quarter, 0 to 4-year-old vehicles increased to approximately 77% compared to 75% in the fourth quarter of last year. Midsize, large SUVs and trucks, as a percentage of sales, were flat approximately 24% in both this year and last year\u2019s fourth quarter, which is up slightly from 23% in the third quarter. SG&A for the fourth quarter increased about 1% to $334 million. This growth reflects the 10% or 15-store increase in our store base since the beginning of the fourth quarter of last year largely offset by a decrease of $14 million or $97 per unit in share-based compensation expense. During the fourth quarter, we opened 5 stores, 3 were in new markets, 2 in Boston and 1 in Peoria, Illinois. We also opened our sixth store in Atlanta and a third store in St. Louis. In the first quarter, we expect to open 2 new stores in new markets, Springfield, Illinois and our first store in San Francisco.","Before I turn it back over to Tom, I want to take a minute to talk about how it\u2019s an exciting time for CarMax. Looking back over the past 23 years, we couldn\u2019t be more proud of the progress that we made. Our store base has grown to 158 stores, and as Tom mentioned earlier, we sold over 1 million vehicles this fiscal year for the first time ever. Our customers continue to give us high marks for excellent customer service and we have a world class culture. We continue to execute our growth plan and currently plan to open 15 stores in fiscal 2017, while also focusing on returning value to our shareholders through our share repurchase plan, but we are never satisfied. And for those of you that have followed us for a long time, you know that this is the case.","For our customers, we have to be able to meet them where and how we want to do business. Nearly 90% of our customers have visited one of our digital properties prior to the purchase. And by the end of fiscal 2016, over half of our total visits came from our mobile site or mobile applications. We need to ensure that these customers receive the same superior customer experience online that they have always received in our store. We are currently in the process of rolling out a new adaptive and more personalized website redesign and we expect it will be fully rolled out by the end of this month. We will also continue to test different components of the selling process online to better understand our customers\u2019 needs. We are also never satisfied with our execution. We will continue to focus on becoming more efficient and reducing waste throughout the company.","We will continue to equip our associates with the tools that they need to make their job easier. Let me give you two quick examples of enhancements that we are developing. One is a mobile appraisal platform. Remember, we appraise more than 2 million vehicles a year. And this will help our buyers reduce our appraisal time and increase accuracy. Another example is an improved transportation system that will help us realize efficiencies when moving the millions of vehicles that we ship annually. It is this kind of continuous improvement that has driven our success in the past and that will support our innovations in the future. Tom?","Tom Folliard","Thanks very much, Bill and Tom. And with that, we will open it up for questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.","Brian Nagel","Hi. Good morning.","Tom Folliard","Hi Brian.","Brian Nagel","First off, Tom, congratulations on your retirement, it\u2019s becoming and Bill, congratulations on the new appointment.","Tom Folliard","Thank you, Brian.","Brian Nagel","The question I have, I wanted to just talk about gross profit for a minute. Clearly, that\u2019s been a big focus of investors in light of what some of your competitors have been talking about declining gross profits, now we look at the numbers you reported, the results you reported today, so gross profit was down slightly, I don\u2019t know Tom, you probably say it\u2019s the noise with the $39 year-on-year, which...?","Tom Folliard","I am.","Brian Nagel","I answered that question first.","Tom Folliard","What\u2019s your next question?","Brian Nagel","The bigger question is, if you look at the drivers of that, kind of the puts and takes behind gross profit, have those changed at all and are you seeing any type of pressures out there that maybe, within your gross profit in the used vehicle space, that maybe more, maybe reflective of some of the pressures that others are seeing and you are handling those better?","Tom Folliard","I mean, I think it\u2019s an overall inventory management process for us. And I think starts with the by having the right car in the right place at the right time. And that allows us to be able to deliver an exceptional value to the customer. And some of what I talked about last quarter, we talked some big SUVs are a little expensive, so we didn\u2019t buy them. We didn\u2019t buy as many. And that allows us to manage our margin, I think very efficiently. We transfer cars that customers requests. It\u2019s about a third of our sales. So that allows us to turn our inventory quickly. I think our turns help us manage our margins pretty well. And it also allows us to continue to test the margin variability. We are big enough now that we can test pockets and markets and different types of product all across the country and learn a lot about price elasticity. And then that\u2019s reflected in the ultimate margins that we achieve and the sales that we get. So I am very pleased with the quarter and with the results and a positive comp based on one of our tougher comparisons last year. And yes, I think we can get better at this as time goes along. I think we are better at managing our inventory and our margins than we were a few years ago. And with continued use of external and internal data and training and development of the process, I think we will just continue to get better at it. So I am pretty pleased with the progress that we have made and the results we have been able to deliver.","Brian Nagel","Thank you very much.","Tom Folliard","Thanks Brian.","Katharine Kenny","Thanks Brian.","Operator","You next question comes from the line of Sharon Zackfia with William Blair. Please go ahead.","Sharon Zackfia","Hi, good morning.","Tom Folliard","Hi Sharon.","Sharon Zackfia","I guess a question that we get asked a lot, so I will throw it at you. There seems to be some thought process that perhaps the new car dealers have figured out a way to be more aggressive on their gross profit per car target and make it up in some other part of their business and therefore become more of a competitive threat to you kind of by undercutting prices, I am just, the pervasive thought on Wall Street at this point and I am just wondering if you have any commentary, any context you could give us on that?","Tom Folliard","Well, I think the biggest thing to look at is just our results and our volumes. During the quarter, our average stores sold around 340 cars a month per store. That\u2019s across the entire chain, including new stores. If you look at used car sales, our used car sales compared to the \u2013 I am only going to use the public new car deals as an example here, there are many more franchise deals, as you know. But we sold more used cars during the year than the next four competitors combined. So I feel like our consumer offer is clearly resonating with consumers and we are able to grow our business year-after-year. We once again comped our stores by 2.5% for the full year, a very good number for a company of our size. And I think given the choice consumers still, after they shop around, pick us more often than not. So I think the results speak for themselves. If you look at franchise dealers total for the year, used car sales were up by 2% across all the franchise dealers. And I think you have to look at it on a broader scale and not just focus on the publicly traded auto retailers because they are very small sliver of used car sales in the U.S.","Sharon Zackfia","That\u2019s perfect. Thank you.","Tom Folliard","Thank you, Sharon.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Scott Ciccarelli","Good morning guys. Looking for an opinion, so why do think you guys are seeing a dip in credit apps at the low end of the spectrum?","Tom Folliard","Scott, I am not sure that we really know, but I am not sure that that\u2019s not good for us. If you look at our mix of sales in Tier 3 in this quarter, we were down 2 points, so we are 17% of our sales last year\u2019s fourth quarter, 15% this year\u2019s fourth quarter. As you know, that\u2019s been less profitable slice of business for us. It\u2019s one that we are very comfortable being in, one that I have said in the past, I think we provide the best possible deal for customers in that credit segment and we are very happy to be able to deliver a great consumer experience and a high quality car to those customers. But if you look at a base from which to grow your business, if you had a little higher credit profile, it\u2019s not the worst thing. You have been around long enough to know that, that percent of sales for us was at one point is non-existent and it\u2019s gone from two to I think as high in 1 year as 19 might have been our highest full year. So we are down a couple of points for the year. You could argue that, that loss of credit apps, volume of apps hurts comps by a little bit, which it does, but it doesn\u2019t hurt profits by as much at it hurts the comp. So we continue to build our brand. We continue to advertise to get any consumer that want to come to CarMax, but it\u2019s not that bad if it shifts a couple of points in the other direction. But in terms of explaining the volume of applications, it\u2019s very difficult to do.","Scott Ciccarelli","Got it. And just for context, is the Tier 2 guys still kind of dipping down, because that was something that you had suggested previously, where the Tier 2 guys were scooping up some of the stuff that would historically have fallen into the Tier 3 bucket?","Tom Reedy","Yes. Scott, I think that\u2019s \u2013 I would say that we continue to see some pretty aggressive behavior from our Tier 2 lenders. And that combined with the lower number of low credit applications both of those impact Tier 3\u2019s ability to get customers, right. I mean, the byproducts of that is what they are seeing might be a little bit less than what they are seeing before. Tier 2, by the way is down slightly this quarter year-over-year as well. But \u2013 and as you saw cap was up and other meaning people will bring financing to the table, was up a couple of points also. So that just goes, falls right in line with the fact that we are seeing higher credit quality through the door that, that others up even more than CAF.","Tom Folliard","And I think Scott, some of the shifting you are referring to is a reflection of our partners who are fantastic partners getting more and more experience with the CarMax origination channel and being more comfortable with how they originate. So that\u2019s nothing but good for us.","Scott Ciccarelli","Got it. Alright. Thanks a lot guys.","Tom Folliard","Thank you, Scott.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Craig Kennison with Baird. Please go ahead.","Craig Kennison","Good morning. Thank you for taking my question as well. It\u2019s on the wholesale business, wholesale volume growth decelerated to about 2% or 3%, are you seeing any impact at all from some of these emerging peer-to-peer remarketing channels or is there another dynamic at play?","Tom Folliard","I don\u2019t know, I have said and it has been true over time that I think wholesale will grow approximately with sales over time. But it would never be exactly attached. If you look at over a multi-year window that has been true, it\u2019s very difficult to evaluate where \u2013 we had a buy rate of around 30% for the quarter. So that\u2019s about \u2013 that\u2019s as high as it gets for us. And we are very pleased with that. Some of the peer-to-peer stuff you are referring to are still very, very small, particularly compared to our size and then vary only in a few markets. So we haven\u2019t seen any impacts of any statistical significance that we could attribute directly.","Craig Kennison","And as a follow-up to Bill, you mentioned the mobile appraisal platform you are piloting or starting soon, do you think that will drive volume at wholesale as well?","Bill Nash","The intention of the website isn\u2019t necessarily drop wholesale volume other than highlight the appraisal process. So if we highlight the appraisal process, inherently that will end up driving some wholesale traffic.","Craig Kennison","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Matthew Fassler","Thanks a lot and good morning. I want to ask you about the performance of your new stores, I know that our ability to measure them is not perfect, but it seems like the volume productivity per unit for the vintage that\u2019s opened over the past year is down. Is there something about timing that would make a difference? Is there something about the markets that you are entering that would make a difference, because it just seems like anyway you slice that the used vehicle units per average new opening are a bit lower than they have been in years past?","Tom Folliard","Remember, we have small format stores mixed in there too, which are a fraction of what some of our biggest stores are. And also as a percent of our opening, I mean, as a percent of our stores that we are opening each year, the last few years that number is actually going down, because we have been consistent at that \u201814, \u201815 number. So this year, the amount of stores we opened as a percentage of the base has gone down. So, you would expect the percentage of units delivered from the new stores to go down unless we increase the number of stores that we build and we change the profile of the size. What I would tell you is that we are continuing to open stores, because they are delivering a great return. And remember that we have very long models for sales, 30 plus years. And we have some stores \u2013 we have a whole batch of stores now that are less than 5 years old and are still on their growth curve. So, we are pleased with the performance of the new stores, that\u2019s why we keep opening them and we think they are delivering a great return. But mathematically, it\u2019s not going to deliver as much to the total, because it\u2019s less of the base. And then remember some of our big old stores are very big.","Matthew Fassler","I guess, I follow up by saying that even if you adjust for store size which we do and you adjust for the role that newer stores have in the mix as a percent of the base, you do all the math, it looks like this less vintage from a unit perspective was a little off. So, if you think about some of the new markets like Boston and you just tell us what you see, it is the unit count kind of in like sized stores different from it had been? And if you think the trajectory in some of those markets is going to be different, why would that be the case?","Tom Folliard","Well, I haven\u2019t looked at. We really \u2013 we look at it on a \u2013 when we build the store, do we think its on pace to deliver a great return and we are comfortable with the stores we have been building. Boston has been open for 4 or 5 months. We would never make any determination on any market after 4 or 5 months having done this for 23 years. I can just say we are pleased with the openings and that\u2019s why we keep building them.","Matthew Fassler","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of James Albertine with Stifel. Please go ahead.","James Albertine","Great. Thanks for taking the question as well. I wanted to understand I don\u2019t think I heard a comment about it, apologies if I missed it, comment around traffic for the quarter. And what I am trying to get at here is as your online traffic grows, how do you think that impacts consumer\u2019s decision to visit stores or multiple stores? And do you think and in fact, there could be some cannibalization going on as it relates to them? Thanks.","Tom Folliard","Well, there is \u2013 I didn\u2019t mention traffic specifically. I did mention that our comps for the quarter were driven by conversion. So, our traffic through the door was down slightly and our traffic \u2013 and our conversion was up slightly delivering a 0.7 comp for the quarter. In terms of the goal of the website and the goal of driving traffic, it\u2019s twofold. One is to drive just raw traffic and the other one is to improve the likelihood of the traffic that shows up to buy a car. So, if a customer \u2013 as Bill mentioned, if a customer wants to do more of the process from home, they have those tools available on our website that can be more prepared when they show up. And to be honest with you, it doesn\u2019t matter to us whether we get a few less customers who are a lot more likely to buy or more customers that are just as equally likely to buy. So, it\u2019s very difficult to measure that, but it\u2019s kind of a multifaceted goal with the website. People are doing a lot of research online. There is a lot of data out there that\u2019s telling you that people are visiting less stores than they used to before they buy a car. So, it\u2019s really, really important that our website provides a great education for the customer and when they show up, they are more likely to buy. So, that\u2019s kind of the goal of the website is to educate and then to deliver customers to the store and hopefully, they are more likely to buy.","James Albertine","I appreciate that color. If I may, just a follow-up on that topic. Do you envision a point at which the entire transaction will be possible online? And as it relates to that, is there anything that you are seeing either among competitors or among your own consumers and what they are telling you they desire that would accelerate spending around online versus your anticipated spending maybe a quarter or a few quarters ago? Thanks.","Tom Folliard","Well, Bill mentioned enhancements to the website and continuing to improve our mobile experience for our customers. So, if you look at where we are spending our dollars, there is no doubt, it\u2019s shifting towards mobile, it\u2019s shifting towards the website, because that\u2019s where our customers are, that\u2019s where we need to make sure that we meet them however they want to be met. And we want to make sure that they have the capabilities to do parts of the transaction or all of the transaction online. I will tell you that the average customer at CarMax has a trade in. The average customer at CarMax needs a loan, has to go through a finance process, sometimes has negative equity, and it\u2019s not as easy to do a $20,000 transaction that is multifaceted, which oftentimes includes appraising the car that they are driving and do the entire transaction online. I am not saying that we won\u2019t do that and we won\u2019t have those capabilities, but that\u2019s a sliver of the customers that we actually deal with. And what we are really, really good at in our stores is helping people find the right car that they need and the budget that they can afford, matching them up with the right credit offer, making sure we give them a fair offer for their trade in, which almost always requires looking at the car and making a fair offer after you have assessed its condition. So, we are going to continue to drive towards giving the consumer more and more capability to do whatever they want to do online and it may someday include consummating the whole transaction, but there is a large segment of customers who really can\u2019t do the whole transaction online due to those other pieces that I mentioned.","James Albertine","That\u2019s great color as always. Thanks so much and I will get back in queue. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Montani with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Michael Montani","Hey, guys. Good morning. I just want to ask about the comp side of things and what it is maybe that you are seeing out there that can help the comps to continue to sequentially accelerate. When you think about the 0.7 is definitely better than what we are looking for is encouraging. But do we need more used car price declines from Manheim or how should we think about the leverage that is in place to get to 4% plus?","Tom Folliard","Again, that\u2019s a \u2013 there are multiple things that go into stores comping and the comp base. Remember, we continue to build stores that back into existing markets, which hurts comps. We continue to \u2013 as Bill mentioned, we continue invest in our website to drive more customers to our store. We continue to advertise to build our brand. I feel like everything that we do as a company, working on efficiencies, trying to lower our cost, trying to keep our prices competitive will deliver comps over a long period of time. I think we have shown the ability to grow a very big base of business over a very long period of time and I expect to be able to do that in the future, but there isn\u2019t really one button that you push to drive comps. I talked earlier about margin management and inventory management and having the right car in the right place at the right time. All of those things contribute to comps and those are things that we are focused on as a company to continue to improve.","Michael Montani","Okay. And just in terms of the quarter where we saw the GPUs come down a little bit, but the comps accelerate a bit, I mean, how should we think about that trade-off then going forward? How would you describe the fourth quarter on those two metrics and the balance thereof?","Tom Folliard","With the first question, we have managed our margins pretty consistently over a period of time. I think the margins were down $39ish for the quarter year-over-year. That\u2019s within our level of ability to manage. So, I have always said we would \u2013 we tried to do as much price testing as we can and we try to balance margin and sales. And we are pretty pleased with the results for the quarter, but that\u2019s how we will continue to look at it going forward.","Michael Montani","Alright, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brett Hoselton with KeyBanc. Please go ahead.","Brett Hoselton","Good morning, Tom and Bill and Katherine and thank you very much or I mean congratulations on your retirement and Bill, your promotion.","Tom Folliard","Thank you.","Bill Nash","Thank you, Brett.","Brett Hoselton","I wanted to ask you about gross profit per unit. So at my family\u2019s dealerships, we are going to do over 5,000 used cars this year. I can tell you if you pickup the phone and you called anybody at our dealerships today, they would look forward to or will be very pleased if the Manheim Index went down. They would be very pleased, because that means our cost for goods sold would go down. Therefore, the gross profit would likely go up, because of spread between new car prices and used car prices would increase and the volume will go up because of simple price elasticity demand. And so higher gross profit, higher volume equals better total gross profit. That is a simple idea, simple argument that for some reason. My question to you is the only thing that kind of argues against that is that if I look back at your results historically, it appears as though during periods of time, when gross or when the Manheim Index inflected somewhat, your gross profit per unit actually went down a little bit, which has kind of counted what happens at our dealerships. And I am wondering, do you have any idea or first of all, what\u2019s your sense or what\u2019s going to happen to your gross profit per unit and your volume when the Manheim Index or if the Manheim Index goes down? And then secondly, can you explain what appears at least to my mind to be a bit of an anomaly that took place kind of in that before the last downturn?","Tom Folliard","I am not really sure where you ended up there, but our margin\u2026","Brett Hoselton","Let me simplify it.","Tom Folliard","I will just say I will answer it. Our margin dollars have been very consistent. When the Manheim Index goes down and we can buy cars cheaper, we want to give our customers a better deal. So we have chosen whether it\u2019s right or wrong to not increase our margins when our prices go down because we want to give our customers a better deal. And we are building our business over a very, very long period of time and we want them to leave and say, why I got a really fantastic deal. The next time I buy a car I want to buy it from CarMax. So you can argue with our motives but when our \u2013 when our ability to buy a car is cheaper, we have chosen to pass those savings onto our customers as opposed to taking it into margin. That\u2019s just what we have done. The biggest example I can give you is during the recession, our average retail price dropped by over $2,000 in three months and we kept our margins and we bought cars cheaper over that period of time by that same amount and we chose to keep our margins flat. That\u2019s just the decision that we made. I think we gave a whole bunch of customers a great deal and hopefully made customers alike. That\u2019s how we have chosen to run our business. It doesn\u2019t mean that we will do it exactly that way going forward. But when we have the ability to buy cars cheaper, we pass those savings onto our customers.","Brett Hoselton","Okay. So maybe the quite simple question would be if the Manheim Index were to go down by 1%, 2%, 3%, 5%, or something along those lines, you do not anticipate that your gross profit per unit is going to go down, you probably will maintain that and just simply increase your volumes, is that conceptually how you think about the\u2026?","Tom Folliard","Now, every market condition has different variables and we evaluate all of them and we try to make the decisions that are in the best interest of our customers and our shareholders. So I can\u2019t tell you exactly what\u2019s going to look like going forward. You can look at our history. And we watch depreciation go up, down, Manheim Index go all over the place and we managed our business very consistently through that time. And each time we see a downturn or an up-tick or appreciation or depreciation, we evaluate all those variables and we try to make the best decision we can.","Brett Hoselton","Yes. So I guess maybe asking it in a different way, you do not anticipate making less gross profit when the Manheim Index goes down?","Tom Folliard","I just answered that question.","Brett Hoselton","Great. Thank you so much, gentlemen.","Tom Folliard","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Rod Lache with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Mike Levin","Good morning, guys. It\u2019s actually Mike Levin on for Rod.","Tom Folliard","Hi Mike.","Mike Levin","Congratulations again, Tom on your retirement.","Tom Folliard","Thank you.","Mike Levin","I think over time, your guys sales have correlated much better with new car sales versus used cars and we are looking at expectations for new car SAAR in the U.S. moving forward, most people are expecting sort of a flat towing demand environment, just wanted to kind of get your thoughts around how you think about CarMax\u2019s growth within that sort of plateauing SAAR?","Tom Folliard","Well, I have always \u2013 I have said this before that I think that largely, we move directionally with SAAR, but it\u2019s not an exact science. And making a forward-looking prediction on SAAR is something that\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s not something that we really do. And what we focus on is trying to deliver the best deal and the best consumer offer that we can each and every day. And I can\u2019t really comment on what\u2019s going to happen over the next 12 months or 24 months depending on movement in SAAR. I think it\u2019s nice to see new car sales back up to where they were pre-recession. If you actually track new car sales and correlate it with population growth, I think the SAAR is still pretty low. So there are lots of different estimates about what\u2019s going to happen over the next year. We are just going to try and do the best job we can based on the conditions that we see.","Mike Levin","Great. And then just within some of the pool data we have seen losses, delinquencies, tick-up slightly, just wanted to kind of get your thoughts on where we are in terms of credit availability or things beginning to tighten and how \u2013 when rates are moving up, how do you kind of see that impacting both the CAF business and your ability to finance your customers moving forward?","Tom Reedy","Right, I guess I can only speak specifically to what we have seen through year end. And if you are asking about CAF portfolio where there is nothing going on there that we see that caused us any concern. It\u2019s been pretty much business as usual. With regard to the partners, the reason we have a number of them because we want to keep a broad spectrum of credit available to our customers. We continue to see greater than 96% of customers who submit an application and get some kind of approval in our stores. So the way I would characterize, it\u2019s greater than 90%. The way I would characterized our availability through the fourth quarter is as good as ever. And as Tom mentioned, we pick a long-term perspective with our partners. We would try to be a good partner. We believe we have developed an origination channel that is spirit to others as far as originating loans for new cares, for used card and new cars, use the transparency and the integrity of the channel. It\u2019s proven out in the past that our partners have seen better performance on their pool rigidly out of CarMax than elsewhere. We have seen in the past that they preferred to allocate capital to us when times have gotten tough. And as we look forward, we would hope that our work in our long-term relationships and the integrity of the channel would make it such that we continue to see that kind of preference for CarMax.","Tom Folliard","I think \u2013 does that answer question about availability or...","Mike Levin","Yes, I think so. I will hop back and get back in queue.","Tom Folliard","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Murphy with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Liz Suzuki","Good morning. This is Liz Suzuki on for John. Just looking at the different buckets of SG&A, what portion is generally associated with existing stores or just new stores and what is typically comprised by advertising and stock-based comp, just trying I think going forward about how we should think about operating leverage backing out the impact of stock-based comp and new stores openings?","Tom Folliard","Liz, I don\u2019t know that we have divided it, that we have talked about it that way before. So I am not sure I can answer that. But what \u2013 can you ask the question again?","Liz Suzuki","Sure. Yes. I was just thinking about like what percentage of SG&A is generally associated with new stores if you are opening 15 or so per year versus your existing stores and just trying to think about leverage going forward?","Tom Folliard","Yes, I can\u2019t give you the exact percentage, but \u2013 because I don\u2019t have it handy. But there is no doubt that new stores on a per-unit basis are significantly SG&A inefficient compared to existing stores, because they are new, because they have higher advertising expense to start, because they are not mature. So if you think about the newer stores, there is no question that they are much more inefficient from an SG&A standpoint on a per unit basis than the older stores. And when you want \u2013 you talk about leverage. We have always talked about while we are growing the business, while we are spending the CapEx that we are spending to build 15 stores a year, we need a few points of comps to leverage SG&A at that growth rate. I don\u2019t know if that provides the color you are looking for.","Tom Reedy","Yes. Liz, another way to look at it is, if you look back over time and you see the growth in SG&A, around half I mean coming from new stores and the rest is coming from...","Tom Folliard","Of the growth.","Tom Reedy","Of the growth itself, yes.","Liz Suzuki","Okay, it\u2019s really helpful. Thank you.","Tom Folliard","Okay.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Armstrong with C.L. King & Associates. Please go ahead.","Bill Armstrong","Good morning gentlemen. Just a question about SUV inventory availability, the expectations are that we are going to see more vehicles coming into the market from off lease and other sources as we move through the year and maybe price starts to come down, as you are going through the options, are you seeing any indication of that yet and to what extent can you maybe source maybe a little bit more through consumers, any leverage you may be able to pull there?","Tom Folliard","I can only comment through February. And SUVs have always been a big percentage of our mix. During the quarter, as Bill mentioned, mid-size and large SUVs were around 24%, roughly a fourth of our sales. I think as I have said before with the high volume of off lease product that means there is going to be a high volume of off-lease product coming back into the market at some point. And I think that there is an opportunity or a chance that, that will create some great deals and some great opportunities to buy, which will allow us to then turnaround and give great deals to our customers. But that\u2019s no different than any segment of our inventory. We are very opportunistic. We turn our inventory very quickly. And we try pass on the best deal we can possibly can to our customers. So it\u2019s still a fourth \u2013 it was a fourth of our sales during the quarter. If we see lease volumes, lease turn in starts to pick up, which I would expect they will like they always do when you see such a high percentage of new cars that are leased, we will be the ones that are standing there able to take advantage of that and provide great deals to our customers.","Bill Armstrong","Are you seeing any significant change in the mix that you are sourcing from consumers versus wholesale?","Tom Folliard","No I mean you know that a lot of \u2013 a big percentage that we buy comes directly from consumers and the rest comes from auctions and other. So when you see a 24% mix of SUVs, that\u2019s probably about the same from both.","Bill Armstrong","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Seth Basham with Wedbush. Please go ahead.","Seth Basham","Thanks a lot and good morning.","Katharine Kenny","Good morning.","Tom Folliard","Hi Seth.","Seth Basham","My question first relates to the balance between market share and profitability. If you could benchmark your results against the industry according to NADA, well, I appreciate that you gained market share overall for the year. The last couple of quarters it appears that you have lost market share, particularly a benchmark against comparable stores. As you think about balancing that relative to profitability going forward, what do you favor, do you favor maintaining market share or taking a little bit of hit on profitability?","Tom Folliard","That\u2019s a good question and it\u2019s a tough question. I think to use the word optimal is the way I would go and I am not really sure of what that is. I will tell you, I don\u2019t know where you get your data, but we have never been able to get market share data that was accurate on any short-term window of time. I am not even sure how accurate it is over a longer period of time. It is so fragmented nationally. There is 40 million cars sold annually, roughly a third are sold from customer to customer and it\u2019s very challenging to figure out share. I think just the fragmentation alone makes it very, very difficult. As big as we are and I noted some of those numbers earlier, we are a tiny share of 0 to 10-year-old cars nationally, somewhere in the 2% range. So, I don\u2019t know that focusing on share is the right place to spend your energy, because it\u2019s so difficult to ascertain what share actually is. And again, the business is so fragmented you could be as big as we are and have just a fractional share. Even in the markets that we are in of 0 to 10-year-old cars, we think it\u2019s around 5, but remember too that for us, we self select out of a bunch of inventory that\u2019s included in the denominator. We don\u2019t retail anything over 120,000 miles. So, there is a lot of cars that are 0 to 10-year-old over 120,000 miles. We still make an offer on those cars. We buy them and we sell them through our auction. That doesn\u2019t count a share. But we sold 400,000 cars last year that don\u2019t count in share. They just happen to go through our auctions. So, we are evaluating how to think about this going forward, Seth. So, it\u2019s a very good question. But there is such fragmentation I don\u2019t really know how to think about it.","Seth Basham","Okay. I guess\u2026","Tom Folliard","We are just trying to optimize our sales. We are trying to grow our business. We are trying to comp our stores and deliver a great return for our shareholders.","Seth Basham","Okay, fair enough. Just as a follow-up, if you look at your profit per unit, obviously, it declined pretty substantially relative to the last few years on a year-over-year basis. You may see that as noise, but do you see that as a driver potentially to boost your sales going forward and would you be more willing to see further declines in order to boost your sales?","Tom Folliard","I am sorry, Seth, did you say gross margin?","Seth Basham","Gross profit per vehicle.","Tom Folliard","Yes. I mean, it was down \u2013 as I said it was down less than $40 and that\u2019s within our kind of our ability to manage. And as I have always said, we will do what we think is in the best interest of our customers and our shareholders. And I can\u2019t really tell you what we are going to do with margins going forward other than we have been pretty consistent with it over the last several years.","Seth Basham","Thank you.","Tom Folliard","And been able to deliver comps at the same time, so...","Seth Basham","Thanks, guys.","Tom Folliard","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paresh Jain with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Paresh Jain","Good morning, everyone. I had a question about GPU as it relates to source of inventory. When we think about the retail inventory channel, it looks like you probably saw as much from auctions as you do to through in-store places, but the auction channel being a lot \u2013 relatively a lot less profitable. So, a lot of this increase in off-lease supply expected to show up at auctions or franchise dealers. Is that a way for you to offset any GPU pressure resulting from it?","Tom Folliard","Well, a lot of those cars also show up in the auction too remember. So, a lot of customers who are coming off a lease will shop at our store and if we make them an offer that gets them out of their car and makes them a little bit of money a lot of times, because we see a lot of lease trade-ins come to our store in the form of appraisals. So, I can\u2019t give you an exact answer, but what I can tell you is, our percent of cars that we sell, that we retail which we call self-sufficiency has been in the low 30s and it\u2019s been as high as I think the low 50s. And it moves around over time depending on a whole bunch of different variables. And what we have gotten, I think pretty good at, is being able to manage our margins despite the fact that we expect some movement there. So, I can\u2019t predict exactly what\u2019s going to happen when leases \u2013 when lease volumes at the auction pick up, but it\u2019s not just lease volumes at the auction. Remember, it\u2019s all these cars coming back into the marketplace in a number of different ways.","Paresh Jain","Understood. I will get back in the queue. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rick Nelson with Stephens. Please go ahead.","Nick Zangler","Hey, guys. This is Nick Zangler in for Rick. Just building off that question, earlier you mentioned that some trucks, crossover SUVs were too expensive to buy last quarter. Are you still finding that to be the case? I mean, obviously, this product category continues to be in high demand. And just given that, are you able to get the truck crossover SUV inventory that you want?","Tom Folliard","As I said, it\u2019s a fourth of our sales. I mean, it\u2019s a huge chunk of sales. And I would say the answer is largely yes. I talked about it last quarter. I thought it would have had a fractional impact on us and I was mostly focused on larger SUVs that were just very, very expensive, but if you look at the Manheim Index through from then to now, prices have come down a little bit. But we are always going to try to do what we think is the best value for our customers. But I mean, it\u2019s a huge chunk of our sales.","Nick Zangler","Yes. And given that \u2013 but do you attribute any of the traffic decline to having to a lack of truck SUV inventory, I guess?","Tom Folliard","It\u2019s almost impossible to do that, but I would say no.","Nick Zangler","Okay. Alright, great. Thank you very much.","Tom Folliard","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Whiston with Morningstar. Please go ahead.","David Whiston","Thanks. Good morning. Going back to the off-lease topic for a moment, what about on the dealer side? I know that made a lot more emphasis on trying to retail rather than auction themselves and I know they can\u2019t corner the market, but are you concerned that it could cause you guys to not get quite as much as the overall inventory over the next few year as you normally would in this part of the cycle?","Tom Folliard","I can only go by what\u2019s happened in the past and it has never inhibited us before.","David Whiston","Okay.","Tom Folliard","It\u2019s usually the cars are more organized at the auction.","David Whiston","Okay. And going back to an earlier question on online versus brick-and-mortar, I wanted to look at that more from the perspective of these startups like shifts. They compete more in a non-store front test bring the vehicle to the consumer\u2019s home with the sales associate. I am sure you want to stay more in the brick-and-mortar side with an online experience to get, to drive store traffic. But is this format something that you are just kind of dismissing for now, because they are so small relative to you or do you think that\u2019s a type of the experience you would want to offer your customers down the road with a much larger selection?","Tom Folliard","No, we actually just \u2013 we have recently tested home delivery. So, we have done some home delivery on a very small test in the market. We will continue to evaluate it going forward. Anything that we see anybody doing that we think would benefit our customers. We are going to evaluate whether or not it makes sense for us. As I mentioned earlier, the one thing to remember is many, many, many transactions involved the acquisition of the customer\u2019s existing car. Something we are very, very good at and I think it gives us a competitive advantage. Some of these smaller online players are connecting consumer to consumer without actually taking any of the inventory and whether actually you are taking any ownership of the inventory, we actually think having 50,000 cars online is a huge advantage for us in providing a great selection for customers and a multifaceted selection when they get into their finance options and find out maybe that they can\u2019t quite afford the car that they thought. So, I don\u2019t think anybody is in a better position than we are to deliver more and more of the transaction online and\/or even delivering to someone\u2019s home than CarMax can, because we have the infrastructure in place. As I said earlier, I am not sure how big a piece of our total sales it will be, but we are going to be in a position to do whatever the customer wants us to do.","David Whiston","Very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Irina Hodakovsky with KeyBanc. Please go ahead.","Irina Hodakovsky","Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Congratulations on your retirement, Tom and welcome aboard, Bill.","Tom Folliard","Thank you.","Irina Hodakovsky","I wanted to ask you a little bit of a small details question, SG&A expense. You mentioned you were rolling out in your website through the fiscal 2015 it should be fully rolled out by the end of this month. One would imagine it was probably a bit of a headwind to the SG&A cost. Can we expect an improvement as this initiative is finished and can we expect it to maybe even drive a tailwind?","Tom Folliard","Really, that\u2019s just \u2013 Bill talked about the website we designed, that\u2019s one initiative within our spend. We think we can continue to deliver a great value to our customers and continue to deliver our return to our shareholders and invest at the level that we need to make the improvement that we think are necessary to grow the business. So, if there is significant investment in IT? Yes, but there was the last 10 years also and we expect it to be a big investment for us going forward. As we said, we want to make sure we meet the customer where they want to be met. But we think within our big bucket of SG&A spend we can both invest and deliver a good return for our shareholders.","Irina Hodakovsky","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Matthew Fassler","I am back guys. Thank you for taking my follow-ups. Two very quick questions for you. It looks like your compensation expense per used vehicle unit, even excluding stock-based comp was down a bit, is there any change in comp practices or was incentive compensation a piece of moving the needle there?","Tom Folliard","There is a number of different things, Matt. I think we had \u2013 as you look at this year is a little weaker than last year and so there is less incentive compensation that I have forgotten that, yes.","Matthew Fassler","Any reversals as part of that or just lower accruals over the course of the quarter?","Tom Folliard","It\u2019s just been a weaker year relative to plan.","Matthew Fassler","Fair enough. And then my second and last question, any change in the stance of your sub-prime providers and the standards that they are bringing to the market change? And I know your traffic is down in some of the lower quality credit regions, but in terms of their willingness if you could kind of the standards that they are upholding as they extend credit, I mean, anything you have seen there?","Tom Folliard","Yes, Matt. As I said earlier, I can only speak to what we have seen through year end. And we have been happy with the performance of our Tier 3 partners. They have done a great job for us. I would say that their conversion on applications is a little bit down. But if we look at a like type of credit that they are seeing come through the door that their behavior has been very consistent over the course of the year. So, while we may not see them converting as many people, because their offers might be weaker, that\u2019s more of a byproduct of the fact that what they are seeing is weaker than how their behavior has been. And as far as how they go forward, we want them to run a business that\u2019s profitable and sustainable so that they can support our customers and we will keep an eye for the long-term.","Matthew Fassler","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rod Lache with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Rod Lache","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the follow-up. I just wanted to ask on CapEx, you would say that the 4.50, which is pretty meaningful year-over-year increase, has lot to do with timing of land acquisitions and construction activity. How much of the year-over-year increase can we kind of think of as growth in kind of core CapEx versus timing? And then subsequently, should we think about CapEx being down into fiscal 2018?","Tom Folliard","Yes, almost all of the increase is timing and we would expect to not be aside the following year.","Rod Lache","Got it. So, then maybe that same magnitude come back down to sort of where we have been running and...","Tom Folliard","I mean, we couldn\u2019t give you an exact number, but yes, we don\u2019t expect it to be that number the following year.","Tom Reedy","Yes, I think remember Rod, these deals take a long time to put together and we had a few of the slips from this year into next year that we would have expected to cost the money up on this year. And if things take longer than expected, you might get concentrated in one year versus the other. And if things accelerate, you find opportunities that you need to close on faster the same could be true, but...","Tom Folliard","Yes, and I think that because it \u2013 we are at this 15ish store year pace, you need to really be working on 60ish pieces of property to deliver that. So, when you get a CapEx number from us, it\u2019s our best estimate of the next 12 months. But as Tom said, there is some timing, there is some shifting back and forth, but this differential between the year that we are telling you about which is the upcoming year compared to last year is almost all timing.","Rod Lache","Great. I really appreciate the clarity guys. Thanks.","Tom Folliard","Yes.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Armstrong with CL King & Associates. Please go ahead.","Bill Armstrong","Good morning. My question also was on CapEx and you have been able to over time reduce your overall cost of new stores, reducing the footprint through more efficiency. I was wondering if you could just maybe update us on what the trends are there? Are you still able to get maybe little bit less cost on an average per store basis? How should we think about that when looking for CapEx?","Tom Folliard","The big piece you left out there is the land part of it and that\u2019s not something we really have a lot of control over. But in terms of value engineering our store so that they are both as efficient to build as possible and then as efficient to run as possible, those are the things we are hyper-focused on. But when you look at our openings for the last couple of years and the next couple of years, we are going to do some pretty expensive big metro markets. We have opened Philadelphia, St. Louis and Boston and Denver in the last couple of years. And in the next couple, we have San Francisco and Seattle coming. So oftentimes, in a place like that, the land acquisition price is going to overwhelm the store build in some cases. So, we are really focused on building as efficient as we can, but the answer is I think we are building a more efficient box than we used to, but it\u2019s hard to really discern when you look at the total CapEx.","Bill Armstrong","That makes sense. Thanks very much.","Tom Folliard","Yes.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brett Hoselton with KeyBanc. Please go ahead.","Brett Hoselton","Hey, guys. Just two quick follow-up questions. One, can you provide us with an update of your sub-prime pilot kind of where you are at, do you have a particular direction that you think you are heading at this point? And then secondly, can you provide us with just some very rough examples of where your market share is at in maybe some of your mature markets?","Tom Reedy","I will take the sub-prime. As I said in my comments and in the release, we continue to be comfortable with where we are at and we are going to continue at the same pace with Tier 3 volume, which is about 5% of the Tier 3 volume that we felt throughout the stores. The sub-prime test, we haven\u2019t learned anything that scares us about it. In fact, we believe it\u2019s a profitable business. But there is more to the equation around risk and what we want to do with the company going forward. So, I think the way to characterize it is it\u2019s going to be \u2013 it\u2019s about 1% or less of our total portfolio. But all the reasons that we decided to go into this test are still holding true and we need to continue to get knowledge about this space and these customers and we are going to make sure that we are in a position that we can mitigate risk to the extent we need to. And from that perspective, I think we are comfortable kind of steady as you go.","Tom Folliard","And I am sorry, your second question was?","Brett Hoselton","So, your overall market share across the United States is 1% to 2%, can you provide us as examples of where your market share might be in mature markets?","Tom Folliard","Sure. So again, I talked about the challenges around market share, but it\u2019s about 2%. If you look at it nationally which includes the places that were not. It\u2019s about 5% on average. Remember, our 0 to 10-year-old cars and I talked some about the challenges of the denominator. It\u2019s about 5% in the markets that we are in. And it\u2019s between 10% and 15% in our most mature markets. So, it is no doubt that there is a ramping and a growing over time that\u2019s a combination of comp sales and adding stores into new markets. So, we have seen in our older markets that we can be in the double-digits on share of 0 to 10-year-old cars.","Brett Hoselton","Let me ask you maybe just maybe a broader conceptual question. So, let\u2019s say your mature markets you are in the 10% to 15% range, your next competitor I mean to guess is maybe less than 1% of the market. So, it seems as though you, to be blunt, have an impenetrable near monopoly in your mature markets. Would you disagree with that or would you say that look we really feel very strongly that we have got a very, very strong model?","Tom Folliard","I think we have a very, very strong model. I think monopoly would be a word I wouldn\u2019t use.","Brett Hoselton","That\u2019s fair.","Tom Folliard","But I mean our average numbers speak for themselves. As I said earlier, our average stores \u2013 this is our average, including all of our new stores in the quarter sold about 340 cars a month. The average new car dealer who generally are the next biggest and there is variability by market. There is some places where there is independents that have some significant sales. But generally new car dealers that sell used cars we would consider the next biggest and the average nationally is around 40 or 50 cars a month, so that the size differential is kind of true for us in most places.","Brett Hoselton","Well, again, Tom, congratulations on your retirement. Bill, congratulations. I tell you, Tom, you have built a tremendous franchise here. So, congratulations.","Tom Folliard","Thank you. And really, I really didn\u2019t do anything. I was along for the ride with a bunch of really great people. And I am still going to be here for a little while longer. So \u2013 but listen, that\u2019s all we have today.

Thanks so much. Tom?","Thomas J. Folliard","Thank you, Katharine. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. As you saw, used unit comps for the first quarter grew 17% compared to last year. When you add in our non-comp stores, total growth in used units was 22%. This comp unit sales growth was due to an improvement in conversion supported by the continuation of better execution in our stores and a more favorable credit environment for the consumers.","Total used vehicle gross profit grew by 22% and used vehicle gross profit per unit of $2,216 remained stable with last year. Wholesale unit sales increased by 6%. This was largely due to the growth in our store base and a somewhat higher buy rate. At $979, our wholesale gross profit per unit was virtually unchanged from a year ago.","Extended service plan revenues rose 26%, reflecting not only the growth in used unit sales with an increase in penetration as more customers decided to take advantage of our MaxCare offering.","CAF quarterly income increased 16% to $87 million. Tom will give a little more detail on that in a moment. And all these factors contributed to a record quarter for CarMax with an increase in net earnings of 21% to $147 million and an increase in net earnings per diluted share of 23% to $0.64 a share.","With that, I'll turn it over to Tom to give a little more detail around CAF.","Thomas W. Reedy","Thanks, Tom. Good morning, everybody. In the first quarter, CAF income grew $12 million or 16% compared to our first quarter fiscal 2013, while our average managed receivables increased 21% to $6.2 billion. This portfolio growth was largely driven by strong origination volume over the last several quarters, which was supported by the expansion in CAF penetration, CarMax's sales growth and increases in the average amount financed. The growth in managed receivables outpaced earnings growth as the increase in loan volume was offset by the continued compression and spread between consumer contract rates and our funding costs.","Weighted average contract rate for accounts originated in the quarter decreased to 7% compared to 8.9% in last year's first quarter. Remember, this has been occurring for over several quarters and the rate is down only slightly from Q4, which was at 7.1%. At these levels, finance margins remain strong and we believe our offers continue to optimize overall sales and profits for CarMax.","The allowance for loan losses grew by $14 million or 31% to $61 million, and credit losses in the quarter were moderately better than our expectations. Consistent with experience over the past several quarters, over 90% of our customers received one or more finance offers.","During the quarter, we did see a greater applicant flow at the top and bottom ends of the credit spectrum, which supported higher penetration for CAF and for our third-party subprime lenders.","For CAF, net loans originating in the quarter rose 42% to over $1.1 billion, and net penetration was 41% compared to 36% in the first quarter of FY 2013. We believe this increase in penetration was due to higher applicant flow, higher conversion arising from both more attractive offers and better in-store execution and also greater retention of our finance customers as we observe continued low 3-day payoffs.","Third-party subprime providers accounted for about 21% of our sales in the first quarter compared to 16% in last year's first quarter. We believe this increase is due to combination of factors: The higher volume of applicant flow I mentioned earlier; a higher conversion to sale due to more attractive offers from those subprime providers and to greater execution by our stores' associates; and some shifting of sales from the fourth quarter of last year to the first quarter of this year due to the delay in tax refunds.","Now I'll turn it back over to Tom.","Thomas J. Folliard","Thank you. As far as mix in the quarter, sale of 5-year old and older vehicles as a percentage our total sales remained above 25%, very similar to last year. Sales of SUVs and trucks were also consistent in both periods at about 25% of total sales, as were sales of compacts and midsized vehicles at about 38%. As we've discussed before, our mix of vehicles will vary based on customer demand.","We reported solid overhead leverage for the quarter. Total SG&A increased by 14%, reflecting the 12% growth in our store base and higher variable expenses related to higher sales. SG&A per unit fell by $131 to $2,086 per car, driven by our 17% comp sales.","In the first quarter, our average monthly web visits grew to 11.5 million, up more than 28% compared to last year's first quarter. Average monthly visits to our mobile site represent about -- now represent about 20% of our total visits. And visits utilizing our iPhone or Android app grew to nearly 9% of our traffic by quarter end compared to approximately 6% at the end of the fourth quarter. So those 2 combined, around 30% of total hits now to carmax.com.","During the first quarter, we opened 3 stores, all in new markets: One in Harrisonburg, Virginia; 2 in Georgia, one in Columbus, one in Savannah. Just this week, we opened our fifth store in Houston, so that will be the second quarter, and we plan to open one more store in the second quarter, which will be another store in our Sacramento market.","You may have also seen our press release. We announced 4 planned superstore openings for next year's first quarter: 3 are in new markets for CarMax, including Rochester, New York; Dothan, Alabama; and Spokane, Washington; and we will also open a store in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.","At this time, we'd be happy to take your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question is from the line of Craig Kennison from Robert W. Baird.","Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Given the strong performance you've seen this quarter and the last few quarters, would you or the board consider accelerating your new store growth opening plan?","Thomas J. Folliard","We feel pretty comfortable with the growth plan that we've announced for the next few years. As we've talked about in the past, we tried to pick a growth plan that would allow us to both aggressively grow our store base and at the same time, continue to work hard on improving execution, which -- we've seen some great execution improvements here in the last year or so. We've made great progress on the last couple of years on cost reduction and our reconditioning area. We still think we have a little to go there, so we feel pretty comfortable with the growth pace. We think it's both aggressive but at the same time, allows us to continue to improve the existing business model.","Operator","And your next question is from the line of Matt Nemer from Wells Fargo.","Matthew R. Nemer - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I'm just wondering if, Tom, if you could talk to the factors that you think are driving improved conversion and execution in the store, if there have been any process changes or anything else you can talk to.","Thomas J. Folliard","You know what, it's not really any one thing. We have a really terrific and dedicated group of associates that have worked on training and development for a long time, but I think that's more of a marathon than a sprint. So we've made tons of progress in the stores with specific training for both our sales consultants and our sales managers. And we have more to work with, with the favorable credit environment that Tom mentioned and about 90% of our customers are receiving an offer from one of the lenders, so there's a little more work with there. We have more tenure now in our sales consultant organization in general. We've just been around for a while. Some of our older stores have folks that have been with us for 10 or 15 years. So I just think it's a long, long process, and I think some of our efforts in training and development are really starting to pay dividends.","Matthew R. Nemer - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Or maybe you could -- is there anything you can highlight that's changed in the last quarter or 2 in terms of learnings from the next-gen store that you've sort of rolled out to the older stores?","Thomas J. Folliard","No, there really hasn't been anything that we have rolled back yet. So this is all just again continuous improvement and continuous effort across a very big base of associates. And we're very proud of their efforts and clearly, it's paying some pretty good dividends.","Operator","And your next question is from Sharon Zackfia from William Blair.","Sharon Zackfia - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","A question on CarMax Auto Finance. I guess it's a two-pronged question. I mean, obviously, the penetration there is extremely good at this point. I think in the low 40s, it's probably the highest that I have remembered seeing it. So if you could talk about kind of how high is high for CAF penetration, I mean, how much further can you push that? And then secondarily, this is the first quarter, I think. I know we've been seeing the tightening spreads, but this is the first quarter where CAF income actually lagged in growth relative to revenue. And is there something, as we think about going forward, the impact of those spreads, should that gap widen? It's just we're all retail analysts, so if you could help us think about the finance income component of the equation going forward with the tightening spreads.","Thomas W. Reedy","Sure. I'll give it a shot, Sharon. As far as how high it can go, that's really going to depend on the applicant flow we see coming in the stores and applying for credit. With our current buy box and testing we're doing now, we're very comfortable with the spectrum of credit we're buying. We're not actively pushing super hard to go further downstream. But I would point you back to years past where we had a partner in the Tier 1 or the prime space with BofA when we saw higher than 42% in penetration in Tier 1. So it's really a matter of what the mix is coming through the door as what we can achieve on that front. As far as the tightening of spreads, it's something we've been talking about for a number of quarters. And as we've talked about, it takes a couple of years for the impact of any change in our profitability or behavior to kind of work itself through the system. And so I think it's not a surprise to us that the income growth is lagging, the revenue growth from CAF. In fact, I think we were expecting that as the spreads have tightened. And I would just encourage you to look at what we're originating and you can look at the public deals that are out there, you can see the exact spreads that's in every deal that's out in the public market. You can see what we're originating every quarter with the metrics that we're giving you and get a feel for what the portfolio is doing, and look at it over time and see what will -- what should happen.","Operator","And your next question is from Brian Nagel from Oppenheimer.","Brian W. Nagel - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","I've got a couple of questions I'm going to kind of lump into one. But first off, maybe just an update on kind of where your thinking is at the SG&A leverage point now. Because in the quarter, we saw the sales obviously accelerated very nicely, SG&A spending picked up as well. So maybe as you look at -- if we at the balance for this year, kind of where that leverage point is? And then second part of the question kind of goes back to our prior question, but as we think about the 17% used unit comp here, you called out your conversion is improving, but you also mentioned, I think, in the press release about maybe a benefit from the delayed tax refund. So the question out there is how should we think about the near-term sustainability of that 17% comp, particularly with comparisons getting maybe a little more challenging here over the next couple of quarters?","Thomas J. Folliard","What was the first part again?","Brian W. Nagel - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Leverage point in SG&A.","Thomas J. Folliard","Leverage. We haven't thought differently -- we don't think any different about leverage than we did before. We have aways said that we needed, in a growth mode, mid to high single-digit comps in order to achieve leverage. Obviously, 17% comps is going to provide some pretty good leverage. So our thoughts on leverage aren't really much different than they have been in the past.","Thomas W. Reedy","Yes. I guess one thing to point out though, if you look at the growth in SG&A year-over-year or even this quarter versus last, I think we're seeing a similar amount of dollar spend on new stores and growth than we were last year. And in years past and when we started growing, we were on accelerating plane. So we're at a point today where we're looking back over quarters where we're -- since we're opening a more consistent amount of stores, we're looking it back at kind of less incremental inefficiency seen in years past, so the more similar amount of inefficiency due to the growth.","Thomas J. Folliard","And then just as far as the quarter and impacts from tax returns moving, if you look at the 2 quarters combined, we don't really think it had any impact on our sales, so there's a little bit of shift from first quarter to second. It's really hard to say what's sustainability of comps. What you mentioned is a very good point, which is this quarter had a pretty easy comparison, the back half of the year has much more difficult comparison. So we never really to wrapped up on one quarter comps. We try to look at it over a much longer period of time. So obviously, the back half of the year has much more difficult comparisons. But where we're obviously very pleased with how the quarter came out, again, our stores did a terrific job of executing and we had a pretty good comp number.","Operator","And your next question is from Simeon Gutman from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Simeon Gutman - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Also, a multi-part question. The comp back on the comps, I mean, the growth was superb and we've talked about it a little already about some of the drivers. Can you try to shed some maybe more detail, better credits? I think you said, Tom, that the cars 5 years and older or above 25, but how are they changing beneath that if there are any changes? I think you said better training. And then just part of all that question, I don't think the industry is growing quite as fast as what you put up this quarter. Do you think that there's some brand effect here, the brand is more recognized, that the proposition is just better understood by the market, so the market share gains should accelerate going forward?","Thomas J. Folliard","Well, we don't want to freak out over one quarter. So I mean, we had a great quarter of growth, but it's just one quarter. Again, we're very happy with it, but I wouldn't look at this and say well now we're going to grow 20% every quarter going forward.","Simeon Gutman - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then within the credits here -- I mean, within the age of vehicles with the 5...","Thomas J. Folliard","The age of vehicles, we really didn't see much change. We -- our mix this quarter was very similar to last quarter. There really isn't anything you can look at in this quarter and point to one variable and say, \"Oh, there's the big difference and that's why comps accelerated.\" I think it's a result of continued and long hard work by our store teams to continue to get better at what they do everyday and it's really just starting to pay off. There's no silver bullet in the quarter to say this variable changed dramatically and therefore, we've got an extra x amount of comps. I think it's just a continuation of a great consumer offer. And you mentioned our brand. I do think our brand is getting stronger, but I don't think it's like we flipped the switch on brand awareness in the quarter either. I think, again, that's a very long-term build that we've been working on for 20 years.","Operator","And your next question is from Aram Rubinson from Nomura.","Aram Rubinson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Two quick ones, if possible. One, wondering if you can give us what percent of originations you wrote, kind of at APRs, kind of net sub-3, just trying to get a sense of where you are on that financing equation. And then also just on a waterfall basis for conversion rates, are there things that you can kind of look at from traffic to test drive to trade to credit app and approval of where that waterfall is developing?","Thomas W. Reedy","Sure, I'll talk about the waterfalls. Well, I mean, we look at traffic coming through the door. Obviously, we improve because of conversion not because of the traffic. But we're seeing our associates in the stores do a better job of engaging the customers. We're seeing more test drives per customer. We're seeing more credit apps for customer and we're seeing, as we talked about on the finance, better conversion of those credit apps, both in the CAF space and in the Tier 3 space. And that's partly due to what's going on in the stores because you can't discount how difficult it might be to get a Tier 3 customer done and to accept that offer, to do so more difficult sales, but also because of the attractiveness of the offers that both they are providing and the CAF has been providing relative to past years.","Thomas J. Folliard","Yes. And Aram, it's not something you -- again, it's the same thing you can't point your finger at one thing and say that's what did it. But I think another factor that we haven't discussed yet is our web traffic was up 28% year-over-year. And I think obviously, consumer behavior has been shifting and changing over the years, and people are doing more and more research before they come to the store. They're more prepared when we get -- when they get there. So I think our carmax.com is a terrific website with a great search engine and great pictures and a great way for the customer to educate themself on the brand and what we have to offer and the quality of our cars. And then when they show up at the stores, they're getting a terrific consumer experience. So I think customers -- again, it's just a belief, but I think customers that show up at the store are more prepared and maybe more likely to buy than they have been in the past because our brand is stronger, our website is very strong and people are doing a lot more research before they get there. And then, you top that with 9 out of every 10 customers who applied for credit are getting an approval of some kind from one of our -- from at least one of our lenders, and it just gives our associates a lot to work with, so I think it's a number of different things.","Operator","And your next question is from Matt Fassler with Goldman Sachs.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","My primary question relates to credit. So APR is -- have obviously been coming down both for you and across the market for your competition. And that's been extremely reasonable as cost of funds has been kind of historically low. If you think about your perspective on the history of your credit business, looking at 18 to 24 months, in periods when cost of funds stops coming down or maybe it starts to drift up a little bit, what kind of flexibility does the industry have or does -- or what kind of prerogative does the industry take to drive those APRs higher? Does that happen or does it the world just essentially tolerate a lower spread?","Thomas W. Reedy","I think we'll know when we see it. I can't be predictive about it. But I think in the past, what we have seen is in time periods when rates are dropping, the customer rates had been sticky and not dropped as fast and vice versa. If rates were going up, that the market has been hesitant. Depending on competition and other things going on, it's going to hard to chase them upwards. So if we see rates increasing, you'd expect some additional compression until the market adjusts. How fast the market adjusts and to what extent, it's going to be dependent on factors at that point in time. We've been fortunate recently, but in the past couple of quarters, we've seen a movement in our ability to convert customers by providing more attractive rates, and that equation is good for CarMax. So we're going to constantly be testing that. We're going to make sure that we have a competitive offer for our customers at CAF because we're the only person in this space, and we don't want to sour people on CarMax because of credit. And we'll just continually try to make sure that we're competitive in providing best offers we can.","Thomas J. Folliard","And remember, our consumer offer is unique in that the customer gets like an unfiltered view of the credit offering from the lenders that we provide, so we're really just going to move along with the competition. But I think as a consumer, it's a great environment to fill out a credit application, have it looked up by several lenders and they all operate in a competitive environment. And we have to move along with our -- along with the competition. So when you ask what's going to happen when the cost of funds go up, it's going to be largely dependent on what everybody else does. And we want to sell as many cars as possible and give the consumer the absolute best chance to buy a car from us, and that's always going to be our goal.","Aram Rubinson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","I guess, if there's a direct follow-up, it's what happened last time as best you recall. I mean, we're trying to look at this on our own, but if you think -- I don't know how many years ago it was when you could think of similar situation where maybe [indiscernible]","Thomas J. Folliard","I'll just tell you, Matt, in general, in a rising cost of fund environment, in general, spreads tend to shrink. And in a lowering cost of fund environment, spends tend to widen. I mean, over 20 years, that's what we've seen. If cost of funds go up, we see a little -- we see it shrink a little because rates don't raise as -- go up as fast as cost of funds and it's exactly the opposite on the way down. So that's what we've seen in the past, but we're not making any prediction about what we'll see going forward.","Operator","And your next question is from James Albertine from Stifel, Nicolaus.","James J. Albertine - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","If I could ask a quick question on the inventory side and supplies side of the equation here, I noticed the cash build from the fourth quarter into the first quarter and understanding your comments in prior quarters that there were some opportunities to sort of buy ahead of demand as it were. But I just wanted to get your sort of update on where you think the supply is shaking out from a pricing perspective, as well as a forward look, if you will, on a gross profit per unit and how much you can hold in a sort of declining wholesale price environment.","Thomas J. Folliard","Well, I can only point to our history on that and we've done a pretty good job of managing through both appreciating and depreciating environment as far as keeping our margins stable. Hopefully, we will be able to do that going forward. The first quarter -- I mean, the fourth quarter, I'm sorry, was really a little bit unique and we talked about it some at the end of the last call because the change in inventory year-over-year was driven by some conservatives in the year prior, and then a little bit more aggression in the fourth quarter. But since then, we've been running our inventory levels kind of in line with our sales and where we want to be. So we're pretty comfortable where our inventory is. We're obviously pretty comfortable with pricing as we were able to maintain our margins during the quarter. And the depreciation that we're seeing now in the marketplace, I don't want to say normal because I'm not sure what that means anymore, but it's a little more normal kind of from what we saw, say from '02 to '08 prior to the recession. We always see cars appreciate a little bit in the beginning of the year and then tend to decline, heading towards the end of the year -- end of the calendar year. So I think as supply starts to come back and we see a little bit more of a normal turn, we'll be in an environment that is actually a little smoother than what we've seen in the past. We've seen some massive volatility in both depreciation and appreciation, and we've done a pretty good job of managing through that. So if it's a little smoother, hopefully, it will be easier for us to manage through.","Operator","And your next question is from Rod Lache from Deutsche Bank.","Dan Galves - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","It's Dan Galves for Ron. Just had a question on -- a little bit more detail on the really strong comps in the quarter. Now that you have 5 stores that opened in fiscal '12 that are part of the comp, can you give us a sense of how those are performing, where the same comps for those stores better than the overall?","Thomas J. Folliard","Yes. We don't -- we won't break it out in that much detail, Dan. But what I would tell you is that since we've restarted growth, if you look at the collection of stores we've opened in the aggregate, they're all performing at or above our expectations. So we're very happy with the stores that we've been both building and opening since coming out of the recession, but we don't break it out in that level of detail. Once they become comp, they're into the total average. And as we've talked about before with our model, we expect bigger comps in the early years of a new store, particularly in a new market. It's a little bit of a different equation when you look at adding a satellite store. But if you open up a brand-new store, we're clearly going to expect bigger comps in the first few years as the store gets going.","Dan Galves - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And I just want to clarify that you're basically saying that store traffic was essentially flat year-over-year.","Thomas J. Folliard","Yes.","Operator","And your next question is from Rick Nelson from Stephens.","N. Richard Nelson - Stephens Inc., Research Division","I just want to ask you about subprime at 21% of sales compared to 16% a year ago. How did the delays in the tax refunds effect that and how much opportunity to grow subprime do you see and how much less profitable is? And I think in the past, you've said about $1,000 per unit.","Thomas W. Reedy","I'll take those in order. As far as the shift over year, I think it was pretty minimal. It was a small part of the increase, but it was definitely not as what we saw. Subprime sales carry into the first quarter a little more strongly than we would have expected. As far as how high subprime can go, that is really going to be dependent on behavior of our partners and they're lending behavior and the traffic through the door and the quality of credit with our applicants. We don't influence or dictate how our lending partners are going to approve people or the types of offers they're going to give, so we're dependent on them on a go-forward basis. We've been very happy with the relationships. And I think how high it can go, it depends -- it really just -- it just depends. As far as the profitability, nothing's changed. It's about a $1,000 discount to where we see a traditional transaction.","Thomas J. Folliard","But just as a reminder, Rick, as we've talked about before, at that moment, that customer has been -- has no other alternative for credit, so all of our other lenders have decided not to offer them a loan. So at that moment, that customer for us, we believe, is pretty much 100% incremental. So although the profit might be lower, it's profit that we wouldn't have had otherwise. Additionally, I think we're the best place to buy a car for a credit customer in that category because we don't change our prices based on the fact that there might potentially be a higher repo rate. We deliver an exceptionally high-quality car. We do it in a transparent fashion. And for us, not -- everybody's credit changes over time and those customers become CarMax spokespeople. So we're very proud of the offering that we have and we're happy to provide credit offerings for all spectrums of credit from -- in all different tiers for our customers.","N. Richard Nelson - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Is it fair enough for [indiscernible] -- maybe to bring those kind of some of that subprime business fund to your own books?","Thomas W. Reedy","I think we're happy with the spectrum of credit we're buying today and -- but it's -- to the extent that becomes something that is an opportunity, we'll let you know. We're always looking at what we should be doing different in the business to the extent there is -- are things we should be doing.","Operator","And your next question is from Bill Armstrong from CL King & Associates.","William R. Armstrong - CL King & Associates, Inc., Research Division","To what extent do you think -- when we look at the Manheim index, about 5% lower than a year ago, to what extent do you think lower used car prices may be improving the value proposition that you guys are able to offer to customers and maybe improving your competitive position and perhaps contributing to that conversion rate?","Thomas J. Folliard","Yes, that's a really hard thing to gauge. If you look at our average retail, it's actually not down. So again, we're always kind of buying at the higher end of the used car spectrum, and 5% is not that big a move, particularly in the period of time we're talking about. So I would say, at this point, very little impact, if any.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your next question is from David Whiston from Morningstar.","David Whiston - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","A consumer behavior question for you. There's been some talk on the new vehicle production side of -- eventually the supply chain not being able to keep up with the growth in U.S. demand. So if that were to happen and there were some bottlenecks that were consumers who want to buy new can't, would you expect those consumers to go to a CarMax store to buy used or do you think they would just stay out of the market?","Thomas J. Folliard","That's really impossible to tell, but if you look at the growth in the SAR, it has actually decelerated, so I think the last -- so the last quarter was up 5%, and we've seen double-digit growth there in the last couple of years. So we're not looking at -- it doesn't look to us like new car sales are going so fast that manufacturers can't keep up with it.","Operator","And your next question is from -- a follow-up from Matt Fassler from Goldman Sachs.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","It was great to hear about the increased penetration of mobile. Can you talk at all about whether you're seeing higher conversions from customers who were engaged in mobile and sort of your ability to track the impact that, that might be having on your business?","Thomas J. Folliard","Yes. We really can't. I mean, we can only track it. It depends how much information they give us. Any lead we get, whether it's just regular carmax.com or from a tablet or from a mobile, customers can go and search and do all kinds of stuff without giving us any information. If it translates into a lead where they call the store, they email the store, then it's a little bit more trackable. But I don't know exactly, but I don't think we've really seen a discernible difference between a mobile hit to the website or a regular hit to the website. I just think in general, consumers are going to -- I think obviously that what a touchscreen of some kind, whether it's a tablet or mobile, is continue -- is going to continue to be a bigger percentage of total hits to our website. So we have to make sure we have a great experience for the customer and a great offering for them, and we're very focused on that.","Operator","And I'm showing no further questions at this time.","Thomas J. Folliard","Okay. With no further questions, I want to thank all of you for joining. And I, of course, want to thank all of our associates for all they do everyday, and we'll see you at the end of the second quarter. Thanks.","Operator","And this does conclude today's conference.

I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Ms. Katharine Kenny. Ma'am, you may begin.","Katharine W. Kenny","Thank you. Good morning. Thank you for joining our fiscal 2013 fourth quarter earnings conference call. On the call with me today, as usual, are Tom Folliard, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Tom Reedy, our Executive Vice President and CFO.","Before we begin, let me remind you that our statements today regarding the company's future business plans, prospects and financial performance are forward-looking statements that we make pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Thank you. Tom?","Thomas J. Folliard","Well said, Katharine. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the call. We're very pleased to announced a record year of both revenues and earnings for CarMax. Total revenues grew to nearly $11 billion. Retail used vehicle unit sales increased 10% to over 447,000 cars. We continue to implement our new store growth plan in fiscal 2013 as well, during which we opened 10 stores. That's the most stores we've opened since fiscal 2008. I'll go on to some other highlights, first for the year and then the quarter.","For the year, used units comps increased by 5% compared to 1% in the prior year. Net earnings, up 5% to $434 million. Wholesale units increased by 3% on top of a 20% increase in fiscal '12. CAF income, up 14% to nearly $300 million. Tom will talk more about that in a second.","Also, we've talked about market share at the end of each year. Our data indicates that we increased our share of 0- to 6-year old used vehicle -- 0- to 6-year old used in the -- we increased our share of the 0- to 6-year old used vehicle market by approximately 3% in the markets that we serve to a total of nearly 6%.","Also, more recently, we've looked at our share on a broader basis, since that's where our inventory and sales have moved. And on a 0- to 10-year old basis, we estimate that our share has grown in the markets that we serve by about 6% to a total of approximately 4%.","Now for the fourth quarter, used unit comps increased by 6% compared to 4% in the prior year. Total used vehicle gross profit grew by 12% and total wholesale gross profit grew by 11%. Wholesale units increased by 7% on top of a 13% increase the prior year, largely due to the increase in our store base.","Appraisal traffic did grow modestly and at nearly 30%, our appraisal buy rate was slightly higher than last year's fourth quarter. CAF quarterly income also grew by a strong 15% this quarter.","On SG&A. SG&A for the fiscal year increased 10% from $941 million in 2012 to right at $1 billion in 2013. More than half of the increase was related to new stores and growth. On a per unit basis, SG&A remained flat on a year-over-year basis despite our 10 new store openings.","For the fourth quarter, SG&A increased 9% to $265 million but on a per unit basis, SG&A declined by $53 to 20 -- $2,212 per unit.","Our year-end inventory increased by a little over $400 million compared to the end of fiscal 2012. Approximately 1\/4 of this increase was due to our new stores. The remainder was due to comp unit growth and a faster ramp-up in units in anticipation of tax season this year.","With that, I'll turn it over to Tom to talk about customer finance. Tom?","Thomas W. Reedy","Thanks, Tom. Good morning, everybody. So for the full year, CAF income increased $37 million or 14% to $299 million, as Tom said. This is in line with the growth in average managed receivables, which was up 16% during fiscal 2013. In the fourth quarter, CAF income grew $10 million or 15% compared to Q4 of fiscal 2012. And our portfolio of average managed receivables increased 17% to $5.7 billion. For the quarter, interest margin after the provision for loan losses increased 13%. Our growth in managed receivables are driven -- largely driven by strong origination volumes over the last 2 years, which were supported by the expansion in CAF penetration, CarMax's sales volume growth and the increase in the average amount financed.","Net loans originated during the quarter increased 37% year-over-year, driven by the same factors. As we discussed last quarter, we saw customers respond favorably to our finance offers. That momentum seems to have continued in the fourth quarter, and CAF's net penetration in Q4 was 43% compared to 37% in FY '12. The allowance for loan losses grew by $14 million or 32% to $57.3 million. And as a percent of ending managed receivables, it increased 0.1% to 1%. This increase also reflects the growth in our portfolio, as well as that shift in the credit mix as we return to our prerecession origination strategy. That program of selling loans at CAF historically retained to third-party providers ended last January, it will take some time for the portfolio to fully reflect the change in origination strategy.","Third-party subprime providers accounted for about 15% of sales in the fourth quarter, which is consistent with last year. There's no new news regarding access to financing. It remains very strong with over 90% of applicants receiving at least one approval from CAF or one of our partner lenders.","Now I'll turn it back over to Tom to wrap up before questions.","Thomas J. Folliard","Thank you. I'll just touch on a couple of things before opening it up for questions. I'll talk some about the web and then store growth for the coming year. For our website in the fourth quarter, we achieved a milestone of over 10 million monthly web visits. For the fiscal year, traffic grew over 15% to an average of 9 million visits per month. Visits to our mobile site now represent 20% of total visits to carmax.com, while visits utilizing the iPhone or Android apps represent over 6% of our traffic.","As far as growth for fiscal 2014, we plan to open 13 stores. That will be a record number of openings for us. We're very excited about the variety of superstores that we plan to open and the variety of markets where we will -- that we will enter. Two of our new stores will be small format models. One which we have already opened in Harrisonburg, Virginia and the other we'll open in the third quarter in Jackson, Tennessee. We'll also open 2 stores in new midsize markets in Columbus and Savannah, Georgia. And we'll enter 2 new large metro markets, with 2 stores each in Philadelphia and St. Louis. And then we'll also add a number of stores in some of our more successful markets including Baltimore, Sacramento and Houston. We expect to end fiscal 2014 with a total of 131 superstores.","With that, Katharine, we'll open it up for questions.","Katharine W. Kenny","Thank you.","Thomas J. Folliard","Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question is from Simeon Gutman.","Simeon Gutman - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","So my one question on traffic and conversion. It sounds like conversion's been a bigger driver of the comp the past few quarters; traffic, not as much. And so Tom, as you think about traffic coming back, we speak a lot about sentiment and macro, is it just that or do you think as the volume of some of the late model vintages start to improve, will that be a traffic driver in and of itself?","Thomas J. Folliard","Yes, I think that's a possibility. We've always thought about when we think of -- when we project our -- what we think our sales will be. We always think roughly in terms of comp sales that we'll get about half from traffic and half from conversion. And that's largely true over the long haul. It's not always true in a specific quarter. So in the fourth quarter, it was driven more by conversion than it was by traffic, but we still think over the long haul, we'll get about half from both. But we're extremely pleased with the execution in our stores. We have a lot of initiatives we worked on over the last couple of years with training and other things. And it looks like it's really paying off, and our store teams are just doing a great job executing with the customers that they have.","Operator","Your next question is from Matt Nemer.","Matthew R. Nemer - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","My question is did you see any impact to your business from the delayed tax refund season in terms of the cadence of sales? And then if I could sneak in a quick follow-up which is any competitive response to lower CAF rates from either your lender partners or other lenders that you're not partnered with.","Thomas J. Folliard","So on the first part, we don't really talk about cadence in a quarter, but what I will say is every year, tax season is an approximation. So it happens but it moves around between the end of January and all the way into March. This year, there was a delay, but a lot of times the tax season is going to straddle the fiscal year for us anyway. So Josh, I don't think it really matters. I think at the end of the day, we'll get all the sales that we expect to get, but it's really difficult to figure out without some more time passing and being able to take a look back exactly how it fell, but we sold a lot of cars. In terms of competitiveness to the rate?","Thomas W. Reedy","Yes, I guess, I can speak to that a little, Matt. With regard to the partners, as you know, we get the first look at the customers that are coming through the doors, so they really don't have the opportunity to respond and compete with us in the system unless we've conditioned the offer somehow and it passes down to them. And with respect to other people at the competitive environment in general, I think what we've seen happen and what we've have been doing over the last couple of quarters is we're seeing our better customers being warmer to taking us up on more aggressive rate offers. And as we view that and as the combination of the decrease in the APR they receive plus the increase in sales and the increase in amount of CAF penetration, all combined, we're looking at that constantly to determine what the optimal mix is if that's possible and try to optimize profit for CarMax all in going forward. But it's very difficult to see if there's any kind of competitive response to what we're doing because that world is going on whether we're there or not.","Thomas J. Folliard","And Matt, to Tom's point, I think what we're doing has been working, and we've been sticking with it. So there have been times in the past where lowering rates to our best credit customers hasn't necessarily delivered in terms of incremental sales, whereas now, it's working pretty well.","Operator","Your next question is from Brian Nagel.","Rupesh Parikh - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","This is Rupesh Parikh for Brian Nagel. So our first question, or I guess our only question, has to do with new store productivity. How do openings trended so far for the stores you opened in 2011 and 2012 versus your internal expectations?","Thomas J. Folliard","If you take the total, so since we've restarted growth, our new stores as a group are performing at least at our expectations.","Operator","Your next question is from Mark Altschwager.","Mark R. Altschwager - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","My question is on the subprime piece. It seems appetite for subprime loans has improved quite a bit recently. And I think based on past calls, CarMax's said they're paying about $1,000 for each subprime loan originated by the third-party partners. I'm wondering is there an opportunity to renegotiate that rate or could CAF underwrite more of the subprime loans to lower the percentage going to the third party?","Thomas W. Reedy","I think the rate that we pay to those partners is something that we look at on an ongoing basis, and as we look at our business and the volume of subprime and what we believe the economics they might be achieving are, we'll consider that on a go-forward basis. As far as CAF, we're very comfortable with the book of business we're buying today. That doesn't mean we don't look for ways to expand it on an ongoing basis. We're also doing testing to see where we can pick up incremental business. And to the extent it makes sense, we can -- we will look at it. But at this point, we're very comfortable with what we're buying, with the spectrum of risk that we're buying.","Thomas J. Folliard","And also at the end of last year, we saw some movement with our third-party providers. And as you see, the fourth quarter this year as a percent of sales was the same as last year, so we don't see that same step function that we saw in the fall last year.","Operator","The next question is from Sharon Zackfia.","Sharon Zackfia - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","I guess I know you don't give guidance but with being more aggressive on the prime loans and the rates coming down for CAF of the loans that you're kind of generating, could you give us any idea on how you expect those spreads to progress throughout fiscal '14 and whether or not we should view direct lending income growth lag your retail sales at this point, or is that deferred more into fiscal '15?","Thomas W. Reedy","As far as timing, I can give you an overall feel for what we expect. If you look at the APR or the contract rates that we've given, the origination metrics, you see that it's trended down to 7.1% this quarter. It was 7.7% last quarter, and I think it was 8.7% last year. So clearly, we're trending downward with respect to the APR of the portfolio and what we're originating. That's going to get combined with cost of funds, which has also been trended down over the last year but seems to have stabilized a little bit most recently. And as I think we talked about either last quarter or the quarter before, it does take a couple of years for the impact of any kind of changes to get baked into the portfolio. So I think the expectation would be that as -- if we continue on the same path, you would see a compression in the overall spread of profitability for financing. However, we'd expect to have more volume as well.","Thomas J. Folliard","And it's hard since we've been saying for 2 or 3 years that we expect spreads to shrink and they really haven't. And now they kind of have started to, but we expected that a couple of years ago.","Thomas W. Reedy","Yes.","Thomas J. Folliard","And you see, our total profit per unit earned over the life of the loan has moved dramatically over the last 5, 6, 7 years. We were down around 900 or 1,000 up to around 2,000. We always expected that to settle back in some. And as Tom mentioned, the good news is despite the fact that it's settled back in, some of the rate testing we've done have delivered in terms of some extra sales. But in terms of projecting forward, it's very difficult.","Thomas W. Reedy","Yes. And obviously, our primary goal with the CAF business is to provide a competitive offer for our customers, and we have that first look. And one thing we do know is that we're going to make more money doing it ourselves than farm it off to a partner. So whatever that spread is doing, if it's driven by the competitive marketplace, I think it's better for CarMax for us to be doing it ourselves.","Thomas J. Folliard","The bottom line is, Sharon, it's a great time to buy a car. Rates are cheap, and we have lots of inventory.","Sharon Zackfia - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Can I sneak a follow-up? The more aggressive rates, do you think that's just increasing CAF penetration or you actually think it's incrementally kind of benefiting sales, just to clarify?","Thomas W. Reedy","I think it is benefiting sales. It's not easy to discern exactly how much because, as Tom mentioned, we're executing very well on the stores. It also depends a bit on credit quality coming through the door, which is up a bit year-over-year. So CAF naturally get more customers. But yes, we do believe it's helping sales because the CAF offer is typically a more attractive offer than what you'll get from another partner.","Thomas J. Folliard","And the other factor is 3-day payoff. So at a more aggressive rate, you see less of that, so that ultimately helps net penetration.","Operator","The next question is from Scot Ciccarelli.","Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Another CAF question, actually. We saw subprime flattened out at 15% here this quarter, but CAF continues to increase its penetration rate. What's the right way to think about kind of CAF and subprime trends call it a year or 2 down the road? Is there some sort of guideline you guys are trying to kind of adhere to?","Thomas W. Reedy","No, we don't have a view to the future, and as you know, we don't really talk about where we think the world should be going. But we don't have any indication from our partners that we should expect the change in behavior from them as far as subprime and their aggressiveness. And as I mentioned before, I think we're pretty comfortable with the buy box we're in with CAF. We'll look at that on an ongoing basis, we'll test all the time. And as things evolve, we'll make sure that we're communicating.","Thomas J. Folliard","But, Scot, it's not like we pick a number and say, we're going to get CAF penetration to 42% and then we're going to stop. We're not -- we're looking to optimize total sales and profit. So I mean, if we could do more penetration on CAF and we thought it was a net positive for the business overall and that we could get it funded effectively, we would do that. Right now, we've kind of settled into what looks like prerecession levels. And as we've talked about, subprime lenders have been a little bit more aggressive in the last couple of years, so that's how it came up for the year, but who knows what will happen next year.","Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I apologize for the follow-up here, but with a lot of the press releases that we've seen, or news articles, I should say, about even longer loan terms at least on new cars. We've seen news articles on 97-month leases -- or excuse me, car payments. Could we see CAF because the flexibility that you have actually extend the length of loan terms as well?","Thomas W. Reedy","Again, we will look at the market and what is going on and what we need to do to stay competitive. And to the extent we started feeling competitive pressure or we're unable to satisfy customers by not offering that product, it might be something we consider. At this point, we have not moved the longest term that we'll offer to customers.","Thomas J. Folliard","Yes. Scot, we haven't found that to be a deterrent for sales, or the people aren't asking for a mortgage.","Operator","The next question is from John Murphy.","Elizabeth Lane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","This is Liz Lane on for John. What are the limiting factors for store growth after fiscal '14? Because it seems like you have a solid store growth plan of 13 stores for the year, and after that, you've maintained your outlook of 10 to 15 stores per year. But what if anything would limit that growth towards the lower end of the guidance range as opposed to the higher end?","Thomas J. Folliard","Well, I mean, what -- mostly unknown factors that -- whatever could happen in the economy, unemployment, macroeconomic factors that we don't have any control over. We feel pretty good about the way we're executing our business right now. We feel pretty good about real estate availability and how well our teams have built back up the pipeline. We feel pretty good about our management bench, which we've spent time building up, and we've done it progressively over the last few years as we've, I think, in a very controlled manner, ramped back up our growth rate. So we feel pretty well positioned to continue to deliver the range that we've talked about for the next 3 years. And I don't see any reason why it would go back down to the low end unless something happens that we're not aware of.","Operator","Your next question is from Matt Vigneau.","Matthew Vigneau - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","During the quarter, did you see any shifts in the growth rate for the 0- to 6-year old vehicles or even any shifts within this range? And related, were there any components within mix that had a notable impact perhaps on ASP which look pretty strong?","Thomas J. Folliard","Yes, we only talk about share for the full year because the data, one, is lagged, and two, it's not very accurate on the short term. So I can't really comment on any movement within the quarter. In terms of our mix of inventory, the mix of sales for the quarter, we did see some shifting within like 0 to 4 slightly over towards 0 to 2 away from 3 to 4. But our mix of older stuff, so from, say, 5 to 10, remains pretty stable and pretty high as a total percentage. So I think we're all expecting as supply comes back to pick up sales in a place where we have historically done very well, which is the kind of 0 to 4 bucket, but we've seen more movement in the 0 to 2 than in the, say, 3 to 4. And I think that's just a reflection of how cars have sold over the last 4 or 5 years. And now with the SAAR back up over 15 million in the past year and projected to go up again next year, I think you'll see the benefit of that in later model inventory over the next few years.","Matthew Vigneau - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Great. And anything that drove the strong ASPs within the mix of inventory?","Thomas J. Folliard","No, I think our ASPs were only up a few hundred bucks. That's kind of -- what?","Thomas W. Reedy","4%.","Thomas J. Folliard","4%, I would just consider that a little bit noise. Not mix-related, yes.","Thomas W. Reedy","Yes, not mix-related, right.","Operator","And your next question is from James Albertine of Stifel.","James J. Albertine - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Just to shift gears to the gross profit per unit. It looked like it was relatively flat year-over-year, and I just want to understand as that late model resurgence starts to work its way into next year and then you noted the 0- to 2-year shift, what we should expect from a gross profit per unit basis going forward.","Thomas J. Folliard","Yes, I mean, we've addressed this a bunch on the call. As we shifted older, I think there were some concerns that gross margin per unit would decline because of the shift to older. But as we have talked about, that's not really how margin works. So we're not anticipating some big change in our margin per unit because we shift to newer stuff. Hopefully, we can continue to be a big player in older stuff as well so...","Operator","Your next question is from Ravi Shanker of Morgan Stanley.","Yejay Ying - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","This is actually Yejay, in for Ravi. My question is on acquisition costs and supply and more specifically of rental supply. So the rental industry seems to be moving fairly aggressively towards risk vehicles and in addition, also moving towards selling more directly to dealers and consumers versus wholesaling their cars. What kind of impact, if any, are you guys seeing from this dynamic from both the used and -- or retail and the wholesale perspective?","Thomas J. Folliard","Well, rentals -- the rental industry, when it comes back to market, is generally 1-year-old car with around 30,000 miles on it. There are tons of those cars at the auction. It doesn't really matter whether they go back as buybacks and the manufacturers run them at the auction or they're at-risk cars and the rental car agencies themselves run them at the auction. And despite lots of efforts to do the things that you mentioned, there's still tons of those cars out there at the auction. That being said, that's not a very big percentage of our sales to begin with. So again, that only represents 1-year-old cars.","Yejay Ying - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Got it. And just as a very quick follow-up to that, what are you guys seeing in terms of -- in real time in terms of off-lease supply and just late-model used?","Thomas J. Folliard","Yes, there's been a lot of movement in leasing as a percentage of total sales. And I think you've seen some numbers recently up over 30%, I know Honda and Toyota are both over 30%, of vehicles sold were leased. We won't see the impact of that for 2 or 3 years when they come back off of lease. And I can't really predict what's going to happen in the short term, but what has historically happened as leases as a percent of sales have moved quite a bit over time. And we've seen it over our 20 years in the business. Sometimes that's 30% of sales, sometimes it's 15% of sales. It just means there's a different avenue for us to go and get those cars. So if it's -- if there's more -- if a higher percentage of cars are leased, they're a little bit more organized when they come back to the auction, because usually it's the lease provider that will run the cars. And if they're not off lease, then customers are still going to trade in and out of cars. They'll just be a little bit more fragmented in terms of the way that supply comes back to market.","Operator","Your next question is from Clint Fendley of Davenport.","Clint D. Fendley - Davenport & Company, LLC, Research Division","My one question, I believe you said that your data shows about a 4% total share of all used. I wonder if you could provide any color for how that share might vary across your store base, especially for some of your older stores?","Thomas J. Folliard","Well, we don't get into too many specifics, and we're talking about only 0- to 10-year old cars, so the market is obviously much bigger than that. And when we expand and start and talk about share in 0 to 10, clearly there are many cars that are in that kind of 6 to 10 range that just don't meet our retail standards. So they still count it sales, they're still in the denominator, but they're not in our share growth. And so we saw that percentage, that share of 0- to 10-year old cars for the year grow by about 6% ending at a total of about 4%. If you look at it market by market, we're going to have higher share in older markets. So places like Richmond or Baltimore, Washington or Raleigh or Atlanta, South Florida, places where we've been for a very long time, our shares are going to quite a bit higher than it is in a new market. But it's pretty varied, but in general, the older markets are going to have a higher share.","Clint D. Fendley - Davenport & Company, LLC, Research Division","Is your rate of share growth for some of the older stores significantly different from this 3% average that you've seen across the base?","Thomas J. Folliard","Yes. If you just think about it over the long haul, the way we expect sales to fall, we're going to get faster comp growth and therefore share growth in the early years of a store's life. And then that's going to slow as the store matures. So if we have a store that's 15-plus years old and it's selling up in the Baltimore market or some of our bigger stores, 800, 900, 1,000 cars a month, even a very small percentage gain there is a really, really big deal. So although we expect it to slow as the stores get older, it's still very, very valuable growth for us.","Operator","And your next question is from Rick Nelson of Stephens.","Joe Edelstein - Stephens Inc., Research Division","This is Joe Edelstein, in for Rick. How should we think about your ability to lever as you continue to ramp the new store base? Are we still looking for kind of a mid to high type single-digit comp number?","Thomas J. Folliard","Yes, we still -- I mean, in general, we still are thinking like that, but we're going to invest in the initiatives that we think are most valuable for the business long term. So when you look at the fourth quarter, we had a robust set of openings. We have kind of a difficult comparison when you look at the weighting of new stores are very SG&A inefficient. Yet for the quarter, we leverage our SG&A on a per unit basis by, what was it, $40 or $50. So we're pretty pleased with that, and that was with a 6% comp. So I couldn't tell you exactly, but if we have flat comps, we probably wouldn't leverage. And if we had higher comps, we would leverage a little bit more. But we think we need in the mid single digits to leverage if we're going to be -- continue to be aggressive with both growth and spending on initiatives.","Joe Edelstein - Stephens Inc., Research Division","That's helpful. And just a separate question as a follow-up. Can you give us some detail around the ESP allowance and why exactly that increased? Obviously, the revenues are going up. But is it just simply kind of a step function where you had to allocate more in there which then cost the penny to the quarter?","Thomas W. Reedy","Yes, I can give you a little more color around that. I mean, the ESP product is one that the customer can return. And if they return it, the partner that we -- partners that we deal with has to refund them the money and we have to refund a pro rata portion of the commission that we received. So every time we sell an ESP, we apply a reserve for returns. We look at that reserve on an ongoing basis. And we observed an increase in return activity in recent months and quarters. And it was appropriate to step up the reserve based on the experience that we had. So I wouldn't consider this an extraordinary item. And I wouldn't consider 1 penny material for CarMax, but the fact that it does distort the other gross margin line was the reason that we called it out, and it was about a penny. But it does represent essentially resetting the reserve for ESP returns.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your next question is from Bill Armstrong of CL King & Associates.","William R. Armstrong - CL King & Associates, Inc., Research Division","In terms of supply trends, are you already seeing improved supply in that 1 to -- 0- to 3- or 0- to 4-year-old range or is that sort of more anticipated as we move through the year? And related to that, are you seeing any major difference between the auctions and the appraisal lanes in terms of improvement in 0- to 3-year-old supply?","Thomas J. Folliard","Well, as I said, if look at 0 to 4, we've seen some shifting from 3 and 4 year olds to 0 to 2 year olds. In terms of the 0 to 4 in total, it really hasn't changed much, didn't change much for the quarter, some movement for the year. So it has started some, but again, I think it's going to be more of a delay based on what happens with the SAAR. That's what we've seen so far. In terms of the difference between the auction and the appraisal, I don't really know the answer to that. My guess is it's going to be somewhat similar.","Operator","Your next question is from David Whiston from Morningstar.","David Whiston - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Now that the fiscal year is over, for a past couple of years, your competitors, in particular the franchise dealers and the rental agencies, have been coming a bit more efficient and more aggressive in used retailing. So at this point, do you and the board think that, that threat is stronger and more of a threat to CarMax, or do you think the market is still so fragmented that it really won't affect you guys?","Thomas J. Folliard","Well, if you look at the publics in total, all 6 of them combined, it represents about 2% of 0- to 6-year-old used car sold. So I'd say in general, the market is very fragmented. We are constantly trying to pay attention to any competitive threat, whether it's an organized way from a dealer or it's through kind of third-party providers who provide dealer services. So there's lots of online services that are making it easier for dealers to do various functions like offer financing or offer extended warranties and things like that. And we pay attention to all of them. We are very focused on continuing to improve the CarMax consumer offers so that we're competitive against any threat that we might see regardless of where it comes from.","David Whiston - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","And so related to your point, do you guys need to do increase -- dramatically increase your IT spending for your website or you're pretty happy with the investment level there?","Thomas J. Folliard","We're pretty happy. We've been spending quite a bit on it, and we've done so for several years, and we will continue to going forward. I talked about just the movement at some of our -- where the volume is coming from. Obviously, like everybody else, we're seeing lots of people come to the website via a mobile device, whether it's through our app or just through the mobile website. We have made lots of advancements there. We introduced an app just in the last 6 or 8 months. We just rereleased our Android app, which had some bugs, and we pulled it and we just rereleased that. But the app -- visits through the app are at about 6%, visits through the mobile website are about 20% of our total hits. And we've had some outstanding growth in our website of about 15% for the year. We had 10 million hits for the month for the first time ever, so it looks like some of our investments have been paying off, but we understand that we have to keep making those investments if we want to keep up.","Operator","Your next question is from Efraim Levy of S&P IQ.","Efraim Levy - S&P Equity Research","It's Efraim Levy at S&P Capital IQ. Could you provide some color on some trends in terms of mix, whether it's luxury versus non-luxury, car versus trucks, or brand shifts?","Thomas J. Folliard","Yes, we didn't have much. There's not much to report there. About 25% of our sales are in sport utilities and trucks, just to give you one big number. And that number remained pretty consistent year-over-year. We didn't have a lot of shift in terms of what we're selling.","Efraim Levy - S&P Equity Research","And same for appraisal mix?","Thomas J. Folliard","I'm not sure. Yes, it would be the same for appraisal mix because that's the big chunk of what we're selling so...","Operator","Your next question is from Sharon Zackfia of William Blair.","Sharon Zackfia - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Just a follow-up. I think the other...","Thomas J. Folliard","Sharon, thank you for following the rules and getting back in the queue.","Sharon Zackfia - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","I did ask a follow-up earlier though, so I actually broke the rules before following the rules. But the other SG&A bucket, it actually went down in dollars year-over-year, and I was just wondering if there was any year-end true-up there or anything that you would really call out because it actually was kind of material on a year-over-year basis.","Thomas J. Folliard","I'll let Tom answer that one. That was too much detail for me.","Thomas W. Reedy","The answer is no, there's nothing in there to talk about.","Operator","Your next question is from Scot Ciccarelli of RBC Capital.","Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","We had about 32% inventory growth last quarter and 39% growth this quarter. I know you comment that you're relatively comfortable with it, and obviously sales have been pretty good. But I guess the question is how should we think about inventory growth going forward, and is there kind of direct correlation we can find between inventory growth and sales or is it less scientific than that?","Thomas J. Folliard","It is less scientific but it does change our confidence in how aggressively we would build. And that's really what you saw in the quarter. First of all, about 1\/4 of the growth was new stores so that's pretty easily explained. Comps are up 6% so that's going to take another chunk of it if it was just linear. But last year, second and third quarter, we had negative comps, and normally, we're building for tax season coming through November, December and January. And we were definitely consciously less aggressive last year building inventory. Whereas this year, we were a little more confident. We built inventory more aggressively. So it's kind of a little bit of a double whammy. We weren't as aggressive last year, we were more aggressive this year. So I'd say last year, we were slightly down from where we wanted to be. This year, we were more aligned with where we wanted to be but it makes for a bigger spread right, after you take out roughly 25% for new stores and comps.","Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. So going forward, now that tax season is kind of behind us, do we start to see the year-over-year inventory growth start to moderate going forward?","Thomas J. Folliard","Yes, that will really depend on what happens with sales. And we're also -- another factor for inventory for us is paying close attention to what's happening in the wholesale market, and appreciation and depreciation, it's another tailwind or headwind depending which direction it's going in terms of how aggressive we want to be with building inventory.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]","Thomas J.

The first quarter was a terrific one for CarMax. Total revenues grew 13% to nearly $4 billion, net earnings up 16% to $169 million and earnings per share up 19% to $0.76.","Key drivers for the quarter, used unit comps increased by a little over 3% and total used units rose by nearly 10%. Our ASP was a little over 20,000 for the first time ever, largely due to stronger prices we observed in the wholesale market and as evidenced by our relatively flat per unit margins.","Total wholesale units grew by 10% and gross profit per vehicle unit -- gross profit per Wholesale unit grew by 7% or $67.

Tom?","Tom Reedy","Thanks, Tom. Good morning, everybody. In the first quarter CAF income grew 9% compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2014 and average managed receivables grew 20% to $7.4 billion.","CAF weighted average contract rate, the rate charged to customers was 7.2% versus 7.0% in last year's first quarter. This rate continues to be relatively stable at around 7% for the past six quarters. The allowance for loan losses grew to $75 million. This represents 1% of managed receivables which is consistent with last year.","Credit losses for the quarter were moderately better than our expectations. And CAF net penetration at 41% was relatively flat compared to last year\u2019s first quarter. Net loans originated in the quarter rose 10% to $1.2 billion in line with the growth in the total used unit sales.","Customers funded in the subprime space, those for which we have historically paid a discount, represented about 16% of our sales in the first quarter compared with 21% of our sales in last year\u2019s first quarter and approximately one of this -- one point of this was related to CAF test. Tom?","Tom Folliard","Thank you. SG&A for the quarter increased approximately 8% to $313 million. On a per unit basis, SG&A declined $39 to $2,047 per unit compared to $2,086 in the first quarter of fiscal \u201814. SG&A on a per unit basis benefited from a decrease in stock-based compensation expense of $56.","During the first quarter, we opened up four new stores, three in new markets for CarMax in Rochester, Dothan, Alabama and Spokane, Washington, our first store in the Pacific North West and one in our Harrisburg, Pennsylvania market. After the first quarter ended, we also opened a store in Madison, Wisconsin, another new market for CarMax. It\u2019s the first of four stores we plan to open in the second quarter of this year.","Our comps for the quarter were driven by our growth in store traffic. Our web traffic also continued to expand significantly for the quarter. Average monthly web visits grew to over 14 million, up 25% compared to the same period last year. Visits to our mobile site represented approximately 30% of total visits while visit utilizing our mobile app represented another 13% of the total.","And with that, operator, we will open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Brian Nagel, Oppenheimer. Your line is now open.","Brian Nagel - Oppenheimer","Hi. It\u2019s Brian Nagel from Oppenheimer. Good morning.","Tom Reedy","Hi Brian.","Brian Nagel - Oppenheimer","Congratulations on a real nice quarter.","Tom Folliard","Thank you.","Brian Nagel - Oppenheimer","So I thought, I want to start with a bigger picture question for Tom Folliard and then I had a couple of smaller kind of detailed questions. But the bigger picture question I have, Tom, is if you look at these results today and they were really good. If you look at the business and the environment you\u2019re operating, did something shift positively here in the first quarter of fiscal \u201814 that maybe wasn\u2019t in place through last year. And maybe the other way to ask the question is we think about our models and what we see here in the first quarter. How sustainable are the trends that we saw really throughout the P&L and throughout the divisions of this business?","Tom Folliard","First off, Brian, we didn\u2019t do anything different in the quarter. We\u2019re just trying to run a great business and execute better every day and control cost and provide a great customer experience. And I apologize that our business isn\u2019t that predictable and it\u2019s a little difficult to model because we have what I think is a terrific source of profit that are quite diversified. And you see our comps are only up three, four points but over two year, they are up 20.","Our wholesale has been a little behind retail for a while but that was up 10 in the quarter. CAF continues to deliver good results but there is nothing structurally different in what we did. Our stores continue to provide a great experience for our customers and they continue to grow. And then we\u2019re opening up stores at a pace that is the fastest pace we\u2019ve ever done before, opening 13 stores this year, another 13 -- I mean 13 last year and another 13 scheduled for this year. So I\u2019d say we\u2019re just doing the things that we said we\u2019re going to do.","Brian Nagel - Oppenheimer","Got it. And then some of these more detailed question. We\u2019ve looked at the subprime penetration which is something around 16% this year -- I'm sorry this quarter, down from over 20% same quarter last year. I know you don\u2019t manage towards this but how should we think about subprime penetration going forward?","Tom Folliard","We don\u2019t have to think about going forward. It\u2019s largely the result of the credit flow through our stores. We\u2019ve always talked about the fact that we want to make sure our customers have access to credit at all kinds of different scales of credit. And if you look at our applicant flow, we\u2019re still at 90% of our applicants are getting approval of some kind.","We told you last year at this time that our subprime providers had got a little more aggressive. We told you in the third quarter that they had pulled back a little bit. And so it makes sense. It was 21% last year when we thought people would be a little bit more aggressive and we saw a little pull back. We were flat in the fourth quarter. We\u2019re slightly down in this quarter. It\u2019s not that surprising based on what we have told everybody. But in terms of where it comes out long term, it\u2019s not really within our control.","Brian Nagel - Oppenheimer","Got it. And then the final question. On the wholesale, gross profit for wholesale vehicle, that popped up more and was there something funny there or was that somewhat reflective of the overall environment too?","Tom Folliard","I think that there has been, there is some -- if you look at all of the external data on appreciation, there was some slightly higher appreciation during the quarter. That\u2019s always going to benefit our buy rate a little bit and it always going to benefit our margin. So that\u2019s the one that -- I think it\u2019s only the second time, we\u2019ve been over $1000. I didn\u2019t think it was sustainable before and I don\u2019t think it is now.","Brian Nagel - Oppenheimer","Got it. Well, thanks and congrats.","Tom Folliard","Thank you, Brian.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sharon Zackfia, William Blair. Your line is open.","Sharon Zackfia - William Blair","Hi. Good morning. So just two questions. I guess, first on the wholesale business because that was a really big surprise on the quarter how well that business did. I think it was the best quarter in a year or two in that business. Was it just external dynamics that really contributed to that or wasn\u2019t anything different internally that you were doing that was helping kind of raise the traffic or that buy rate?","Tom Folliard","No, not a thing. You know, what I\u2019ve been saying and I\u2019m glad I\u2019m finally right is that I believe over time wholesale and retail will grow at a similar pace. I don\u2019t think there -- they seem to almost never be connected in a quarter. They happen to be this quarter. Both group total sales were -- total retail sales grew at 10%, total wholesale grew at 10%. But if you remember just two or three years ago, we had wholesales sales grow 30% in the first quarter on top of 50% in the first quarter prior.","So there is a lot of volatility in that business as well but I still believe over time that retail and wholesale will grow similarly over a long period of time. This quarter they happened to match up.","Sharon Zackfia - William Blair","Are you still seeing as the market ages the wholesale business pick up as people become more familiar with that option at CarMax. And I was wondering, I guess, if the national advertising that you do now, if you focus at all about we\u2019ll buy your car and if that might help around the edges?","Tom Folliard","We\u2019ve always had a piece of our advertising around we\u2019ll buy your car, it wasn\u2019t -- we did not change it in the quarter. So there was nothing different about the way we advertised or approached the business this quarter.","Sharon Zackfia - William Blair","Okay. Thank you.","Tom Folliard","So you know it came out the way it did.","Sharon Zackfia - William Blair","All right. Thanks.","Tom Folliard","Thanks Sharon.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Murphy, Bank of America. Your line is open.","Liz Suzuki - Bank of America","Good morning. This is Liz Suzuki on for John. The $39 per vehicle reduction in SG&A this quarter was pretty impressive. What were the major components of that cost reduction and can we expect that kind of improvement going forward?","Tom Folliard","Well, $56 of the $39 came from stock-based compensation expense. So that\u2019s not necessarily a good guy. And I think a 3-ish percent comps we wouldn\u2019t expect to get leverage like this. So if not for stock-based compensation expense change, I mean, reduction of $56, we would not have leveraged.","Liz Suzuki - Bank of America","Got it. Okay.","Tom Folliard","We need mid-to-high single digits if we\u2019re in a growth phase to leverage. And we still believe that.","Liz Suzuki - Bank of America","Got it. And would you categorize the lower subprime penetration rate this quarter as being driven more from the supply side or the demand side. I mean, in other words, are your lenders pulling back a little bit or are you seeing fewer subprime customers coming in?","Tom Reedy","It was a question on Tier 3 or on cap. I\u2019m sorry.","Tom Folliard","It was on subprime.","Tom Reedy","No, I think it\u2019s -- we need to take step back and think about it, subprime penetration is going to be a combination of factors driving it. One is the credit coming through the door and then another is the behavior of the other lenders in the system. And over time we worked to try to build, as Tom mentioned, a broad spectrum of lenders so that customers have access to credit and I think we are very happy with the partners we have today. We\u2019ve got nothing but praise for them. You look at cash penetration, it was flat. Subprime was down a little bit. We did see a lift in sales that were funded by sources outside of our system. We did see a lift in sales funded by our Tier 2 partners which means they stepped up and took some customers that they may have declined in the past. So Tier 3 behavior is going to be a combination of what\u2019s coming through the door and what makes it down to them, and finally their behavior and their credit appetite.","Tom Reedy","And then our stores ability to convert ones we have approvals to work with and the higher, the better the quality of approval, in other words lower the down payment, the better chance we have a conversion. So I would expect over time those things are going to be constantly moving as lenders continue to tweak their scorecard and make adjustments based on the performance of the portfolio that they have originated. Just like it\u2019s been going on for the last the whole time we\u2019ve got in business.","Liz Suzuki - Bank of America","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli, RBC. Your line is open.","Scot Ciccarelli - RBC","So she got Ciccarelli but missed Nagel, interesting. Couple of questions, guys. First of all, Tom Reedy, can you give a little bit more color about your commentary regarding vehicles funded outside your system? Do you have any feel for kind of what kind of credit tiering that\u2019s on? Or is that just, you just suspect that you\u2019re still 90% plus that your subprime penetration was down?","Tom Reedy","No, Scot, we\u2019ve historically said 20% to 25% of our business is going to get done outside of the system. That typically means credit unions or customers who have good access to financing elsewhere or cash. And then, we\u2019ve said that cash is going to run somewhere in the low-40s and the remainder it would be split between our Tier 2 and Tier 3 partners. That\u2019s moved around. This year Tier 2 -- this quarter Tier 2 was a bit higher than Tier 3. Last year Tier 3 was higher, but the year before Tier 2 was high. So it just depends what\u2019s come through the door and what\u2019s going on with the individual lenders and their credit appetite at the time.","Scot Ciccarelli - RBC","Okay. Understood. And then, since I have you on the line here, with the latest securitization, Tom, it looks like losses per receivable were up quite a bit in the last three months and it basically looks like recoveries had declined, but that seems odd given the fact that wholesale pricing was so strong. Do you have any more detail or reasoning as to why the numbers look shaking out the way they did?","Tom Reedy","Not, at this point, Scot. I mean, it\u2019s early into that deal, so I think you need to let it incubate for a little while, but we can follow up with you afterwards on if you want more - need to dig in more detail.","Scot Ciccarelli - RBC","Understood. And the last question for Tom Folliard. Tom, why do you think wholesale pricing was so strong? I mean, should we be on more of a normal depreciation curve at this point as kind of that lack of supply has been filled in over the last couple of years? I just find it\u2019s surprising that even at the Manheim level, we\u2019ve seen prices rising, which just seems counterintuitive?","Tom Folliard","Well, in the spring, if this was what we would say a normal year, we would see some appreciation in the spring and then kind of a steady decline throughout the rest of the year. And this year, we saw more appreciation in the spring than we are used to. And lots of people attributed to weather and pent-up demand for inventory. So we will go with that.","Scot Ciccarelli - RBC","I understood. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Craig Kennison, Baird. Your line is open.","Craig Kennison - Baird","Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to focus on your web traffic, I think you said it was up 25%. Would love to hear what is driving the strong growth in that metric?","Tom Folliard","That\u2019s a measure of traffic, that\u2019s continued to grow kind of around that pace for several years now. I think there\u2019s a number of different factors. First and foremost, I think we have a great website. I think we have a great search engine. I think we\u2019ve done a really nice job of making sure that when customers are on our site, whether it\u2019s through mobile or desktop or touchscreen that they have a good experience. So I think there is that. Clearly, the Internet is becoming bigger and bigger every single year as a source of information. So I think customers just naturally are going to go to the web first. We continue to expand our geographic footprint. So we are in more markets. So we are going to get some growth there as well. Remember, that\u2019s not comp, that\u2019s just total traffic. So as we grow the company and we add more stores and we sell more cars and we get more -- kind of more CarMax sports people on the road, I would expect that number to continue to rise as well. So I don\u2019t know if any one thing, I think it\u2019s a number of different things.","Craig Kennison - Baird","I am curious whether you can analyze any of the traffic you\u2019re getting to improve where you choose to locate stores, for example if you get a lot of traffic, it matters to Wisconsin. Is that a helpful metric as you decide in your next store?","Tom Folliard","Well, it hasn\u2019t, I mean at this point we think the CarMax consumer offer works in just about any market in the U.S. and we are very excited to go to the places that we\u2019re not, but we are also very excited to continue to add stores in the places where we are. And we haven\u2019t seen that web traffic by a particular locale is an indicative of where we should build the next store. We really want to go build our stores where people are, because then they need cars and then they are buying from us.","Craig Kennison - Baird","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt Fassler, Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Matt Fassler - Goldman Sachs","Thanks a lot and good morning. My first question, thinking about wholesale and the upside that you showed there. The pricing would explain the profitability, the units in the sense were really what took off most dramatically from the trend whether you compare to the prior couple of quarters, if you look at it as a percent relative to the sales of used cars. What kind of visibility do you think you have given the trends that we saw, the wholesale volume is going for? Do you think the volume piece of that could be sustainable?","Tom Folliard","Like I said, earlier, Matt, I think that wholesale volumes and retail volumes over a very long period of time will grow about the same. They seem to never be connected. They happen to be connected this time. If you think about the variables that go into that deliver a wholesale volume for us as how many customers show up at the store? Of those customers, how many get their car praised? Of the ones who get their car praised, who many sales a car? If all of those things were flat year-over-year, we should have gone up 10% because our sales went up 10%, so -- but they are never always flat. There is always movement in some of those variables. We had a strong buyer rate, a little over 30%, slightly up compared to the year prior and with total sales being up 10% and that been driven by foot traffic. It\u2019s time to come out the way you would think it would come out. But as I said, it\u2019s just on a quarter by quarter basis, these two things are never exactly connected.","Matt Fassler - Goldman Sachs","Got it. A quick follow-up. The stock-based comp piece, can you talk about how chunky that tends to be, in other words is that an item that is more typically for Q1 based on options timing or is this something that can be volatile as it was during Q1 and throughout the year?","Tom Reedy","Matt, it\u2019s really going to be driven of stock price. So last year in Q1, we saw stock price appreciate, this year and do so well. There is a -- we have outstanding equity grants to folks that we have to account for based on changes in stock prices and that\u2019s really who is going to drive it.","Matt Fassler - Goldman Sachs","But you would view this as sort of an outlier move in one direction or the other, it sounds like?","Tom Folliard","It\u2019s just something we are going to adjust on a regular basis based on the stock price. Street, it\u2019s pretty much street, Matt.","Matt Fassler - Goldman Sachs","Understood. But, is this one of the bigger moves you\u2019ve seen in that number that you called that up?","Tom Folliard","No, I mean, we\u2019ve seen it go the other direction as well.","Tom Reedy","Yes. Matt, we called it out mostly because it was a little distortive of our ability to leverage SG&A.","Matt Fassler - Goldman Sachs","Got it.","Tom Reedy","We really want to talk that. We want to get credit for leverage on SG&A on something that\u2019s not really under our control.","Matt Fassler - Goldman Sachs","Understood. And then finally if you think about the supply of vehicles at auction and the sources thereof, are you seeing the new vehicle hit in a way that you can get access to them?","Tom Folliard","We\u2019ve seen a few movements in our percent of sales in the first quarter by a few points over to 0 to 4 from 5 to 10 but only by 2 or 3 points, so wasn\u2019t significant. I have been saying all along I expect that supply to come back. We have historically done really well in that segment of inventory and I expect us to do well again. But overall, there wasn\u2019t a ton of movement.","Matt Fassler - Goldman Sachs","Is that the biggest move you\u2019ve seen in this cycle so far, that incremental creep?","Tom Folliard","Yeah, two or three points, yeah, I think over the last several quarters it\u2019s been pretty flat, so yes.","Matt Fassler - Goldman Sachs","Got it. Thank you so much guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Seth Basham, Wedbush Securities. Your line is open.","Seth Basham - Wedbush Securities","Good morning. It\u2019s Seth Basham. First question for you is on third-party subprime penetration. You guys have talked about one lender pulling back in the past. Have you seen any of your other lending partners start to pull back?","Tom Folliard","No, I don\u2019t recall talking about one lender specific in the past. And I will say that we\u2019ve observed across the board in our portfolio, a bit of a tightening in terms from our lenders. We look at the sales applications rate of ourselves of all of our partners and we\u2019ve seen that dial back a little bit for the quarter.","Seth Basham - Wedbush Securities","Got you. Okay. And as it relates to your own subprime test, it seems to be ramping a little bit more quickly than I anticipated. You guys still planning to complete that at the end of the year or is that ahead of schedule?","Tom Reedy","I say it\u2019s on track. We said we\u2019ve done about $30 million to date and really nothing specific to report yet. Yes, it is going to take us getting a critical mass of receivables and watching those incubate for a while before we have anything to start reporting on it. But I wouldn\u2019t read anything into the volume today.","Seth Basham - Wedbush Securities","And was there any impact at all on your CAF results from the additional subprime loans that you guys issued?","Tom Reedy","Not on the results. I mean, at this point it\u2019s little early in the process with the subprime and the expected losses are still high. It\u2019s actually a little bit of a drag on CAF earnings but it\u2019s nothing material. We have to reserve 12 months of losses out the gate as we originate those loans. And with those loans having a higher expected loss rate than our regular portfolio until we start building up a critical mass, it\u2019s actually going to be a little bit of a drag on our earnings but it\u2019s very minimal and nothing to report.","And as we go forward, it may have some impact on the loss provision, our average contract rate and the overall allowance. And to the extent, it does become something that merits calling out. We\u2019ll give you that color.","Seth Basham - Wedbush Securities","Are you being extra conservative in terms to your loss provisions on the new subprime loans without the history yet?","Tom Reedy","We\u2019re being -- we believe appropriately conservative.","Seth Basham - Wedbush Securities","Okay. And then on the wholesale, buy rate being up, that\u2019s good. But what about the mix of cars that you guys are buying? Have you seen the mix shift back towards older cars or you still seeing that mix shift towards new or late model cars?","Tom Folliard","Well, wholesale is all stuff that doesn\u2019t meet our retail standard. So the mix of that product has been pretty much the same and the mix of retail, I talked about earlier, couple of points of movement but not really too much.","Seth Basham - Wedbush Securities","No, I\u2019m just thinking about the cars you\u2019re buying from the appraisal lanes. Are you seeing a mix shift between newer used cars and older used cars?","Tom Folliard","No. And remember the cars we buy in the appraisal lane, a whole bunch of them we sell at retail and then the rest go to wholesale so.","Seth Basham - Wedbush Securities","Okay. And then lastly on the ASPs, obviously very strong this quarter. Were you guys anticipating the strength in the ASPs wholesale car prices this quarter to be a strong as they were? If not, how did that benefit your retail business?","Tom Folliard","No. And I never like prices going up. I rather have prices go down, although I don\u2019t think they will. So it\u2019s a first time we have been over $20,000 average retail, since we started the business. But our margins per car were flat. So it was clearly a reflection of what the market was doing. And we talked about wholesale pricing being up during the quarter and it was simply that. And really, the only benefit from higher ASP is we get a little more on the spread when we do a CAF loan but other than that I rather see us provide lower prices to customers.","Seth Basham - Wedbush Securities","All right. Okay. If I could sneak one last one in, the recovery rate on\u2026","Tom Folliard","We have got to move on there, Seth.","Seth Basham - Wedbush Securities","Okay. No problem. Thank you.","Tom Folliard","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of James Albertine, Stifel. Your line is open.","James Albertine - Stifel","Great. Thanks for taking the question. Congratulations on the solid quarter. So really quickly on just the small store formats, just a quick update there. Are there any plans within the store count openings that you suggested to incrementally add some small store formats? And then separately, I guess related, anything that you\u2019re learning from those initiative that you maybe help glean to more efficient super store model?","Tom Folliard","So we have three small formats stores open, only one has been open for than a year, so there\u2019s very little of anything to report. Other than we have some processes that needed to take place in order for those stores to work just from an operational standpoint and they\u2019re working very well. They have very small inventory. We have to move cars a little bit quicker. We have cross train lots of our employees in those stores to be able to do multiple tasks and that stuffs all working really great.","We don\u2019t really have any results to report, because we just don\u2019t have enough time under our belt with only three stores open. In this year\u2019s growth plan, we have two more those planned, one in Lynchburg, Virginia and one in Tupelo, Mississippi. We\u2019ve said we\u2019re going to get five of these open and read the results for a little while. So that\u2019s kind of where we stand. I think there will be some learnings over time with some of the stuff I just mentioned, cross-training of people and maybe the ability to run a store little bit more efficiently, but we\u2019re long ways away from that.","James Albertine - Stifel","Great. Thank you very much. And then a quick clarification on the website, the benefits of the increase in web traffic over time, are there any transactional benefits or you precluded from transacting still online to a degree based on state by state regulations?","Tom Folliard","We don\u2019t fully transact online. There isn\u2019t really a preclusion. If we wanted to really press down that path, we could. We found that customers want to test drive cars. They want to -- particularly, our average cars is almost four years old, with almost 40,000 miles on it. We\u2019ve been adding more and more capabilities for customers to do from home and they\u2019ve been taking advantage of that and we\u2019re very pleased with that so far.","But in the last six months we now allow our customers to put cars on hold and make appointments online without speaking to anybody. We still have the capability in the number of stores for customers to transfer cars, even a pay transfer by giving their credit card online without speaking to anybody and having that car delivered. They can actually start their paper work online, making appointment for the sales consultant and show up a lot of the work already done. But in terms of fully consummating the deal online, we\u2019re not doing that yet.","James Albertine - Stifel","Great. Thanks and good luck.","Tom Folliard","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rick Nelson, Stephens. Your line is now open.","Rick Nelson - Stephens","Thanks. Good morning. It\u2019s Stephens. Can you -- comps store traffic, could you see a meaningful acceleration there this quarter?","Tom Folliard","Well, we said our comps were due to store traffic. Our comps were a little over three. I think of traffic and conversion, like I\u2019ve mentioned wholesale earlier. I think over time that our comps will be driven partly by traffic and partly by execution increases or conversion increases. What happened over the last several years is we\u2019ve had few quarters where all of our sales increase was driven by conversion and we\u2019ve had sometimes where all of it has been driven by traffic. There were times when it was about a 50-50 split and I think over a long period of time, that\u2019s kind of what we expect. It\u2019s just so happened this quarter that our conversion was relatively flat and our comps were driven by traffic.","Rick Nelson - Stephens","Okay. And do you think you are getting any kind of benefits from the snowstorms that the business shifting from the fourth quarter to that March and May timeframe?","Tom Folliard","That\u2019s a really difficult thing for us to measure. We\u2019ve never really made a big deal out of weather. I think because we are an in infrequent purchase that we don\u2019t view that we lose. We\u2019re not like a grocery business where if you don\u2019t sell milk, then you never get to sell that milk. We sell a car. People buy it once every five years and what we\u2019ve seen in our history is, if we miss some sales then we kind of get them back overtime. But it\u2019s really hard to measure. So, I wouldn\u2019t attribute anything. We didn\u2019t attribute anything in the fourth quarter to it and we don\u2019t attribute anything in this quarter to it.","Rick Nelson - Stephens","Yeah. And I know you don\u2019t like to discuss weather as an issue, but thanks very much and good luck.","Tom Folliard","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Whiston, Morningstar. Your line is open.","David Whiston - Morningstar","Thanks. Good morning. I just wanted to, I guess, two longer term questions. Can you give any color on what -- with your cash continuing to grow so well and you are doing the share buybacks? Can you disclose a minimum cash levels to run the business either in dollar terms or as a percentage of revenue?","Tom Reedy","We are not -- I don\u2019t think we are going to talk about it in dollar terms as a percent of revenue. But we look at it more as minimum amount of liquidity to make sure that we have ample liquidity to keep inventory in our stores to keep CAF funded in the short-term period between securitization, et cetera. We are very comfortable with our levels today.","Tom Folliard","And to build stores.","Tom Reedy","And obviously to build stores and I don\u2019t think there is anything we can really talk about as far as minimum. I would say that we are comfortable moving to a position of more leverage than we have today in the current capital structure.","When you see we are doing stock buyback program and I want to extrapolate from there, but that, you have seen us before having significantly more depth than we have today and we are not uncomfortable with the level that\u2019s higher than today.","David Whiston - Morningstar","Okay. And then what, hopefully, the very long-term question is what are you doing over the next year or so and today strategically in your planning to protect profits for the inevitable next recession?","Tom Folliard","I mean, we are just running the business and trying to get more and more efficient each and everyday. I think, we learned a lot during the last recession. We significantly improved our profitability and our execution and because of those learnings, we have been hyper focused on not losing that momentum.","So I think, our store teams are doing a fantastic job of controlling cost and trying to be more and more efficient with the customer, where we have proven to be pretty good at managing inventory across a very short timeframe and I feel very confident that we were not just sitting still in that regard, we are actually better at it than we were couple a year ago. So I feel like working on what we do everyday and trying to get better at each of those things is the best defense against the recession.","David Whiston - Morningstar","Okay. It\u2019s very helpful. Thank you.","Tom Folliard","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Alex Knight, Tiger Management. Your line is open.","Alex Knight - Tiger Management","Hey, guys. Thank you for taking my questions and congratulations on a great quarter. You\u2019ve said in the past that one of the main limitations on your expansion is the number of associates you can train? Can you give us some color on ease of finding and training associates for the new stores and any progress you are making there?","Tom Folliard","Sure. We feel pretty good about where we are right now. We are, as I mentioned, although, our pace of store growth, 13 stores last year and 13 stores this year, is the most number of stores we have opened. As a percentage of our total store base, we have been much more aggressive at two different periods in the past.","And I think we learned that those were little bit too fast in terms of being able to higher train, develop and have people ready to not just open new stores but to replace people in stores that they vacated.","So at this pace right now we are very analytical about how we do it. We look at each position in the store. We factor in turnover levels. We try to hire people in advance. We try to hire people regionally, if we know we have store openings coming for example in California, we are going to try to staff up in stores that are closed and I feel like we have a great group of people working on that and a pretty good training program.","But again, it\u2019s something we are not satisfied with and we want to get better at everyday and we are focused on that. But right now we feel in very good shape to open up the stores that we have planned.","Alex Knight - Tiger Management","All right. Thank you very much.","Tom Folliard","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Armstrong, CL King & Associates. Your line is open.","Bill Armstrong - CL King & Associates","Good morning. Just getting back to the average selling price, I know you talked about higher overall levels of pricing? But also to what extent might that have been influenced by mix, particularly since you had a lower sub-prime penetration in the sales mix during the quarter?","Tom Reedy","Yeah. I never think about mix of inventory based on levels of credit. I think mix of inventory based on the actual cars that we sold and there was, I mentioned, there was a slight movement towards, we said, zero to four-year old cars for a while now have been 70% of sales and five to 10-year old cars have been 30% of sales, and remember that number of, I am sorry, of five to 10-year old cars used to be 15% a long time ago and it doubled.","And then we have seen that stay relatively flat for a number of years and then this quarter we saw couple of points movement. So I would say that had a little impact on the ASP but I am not sure to what extent. And I don\u2019t know what our ASP was the quarter before, was it 19.5, somebody know.","Katharine Kenny","Yes.","Tom Reedy","19.4, 5, so it\u2019s up a few hundred bucks.","Bill Armstrong - CL King & Associates","Yeah. And at the auctions, we hearing a lot of off-lease vehicles coming to the auctions that obviously relatively new cars three years old on average? Are you seeing more availability of those types of cars when you are looking for inventory at auctions, whether it\u2019s Manheim, Odessa, et cetera?","Tom Folliard","Yeah. We are always, depending on what the lease rate was, two years ago and three years ago, we have very high lease rate right now, then you see those cars back at the auction. The truth is, you always see those cars back at the auction in shape or form, but if they were leased then they come back in more of an organized lane.","But it is largely driven by consumer behavior not just people who lease cars, but people who buy cars and how quickly do they then trade those cars in and we have seen this -- we have kind of seen this act before with leases as a percent of total retail sales.","I would say being as low as 12% or 13% and as high as 30%. But that\u2019s a cycle, that happen, that goes up and down over the last 20 years multiple times and we have never had a problem accessing inventory.","Bill Armstrong - CL King & Associates","Got it. Okay. And then just finally, you mentioned a modest reduction ESP penetration rate, anything to call out there?","Tom Folliard","No. Nothing really, we mentioned last quarter that our partners were making some pricing adjustments. We make pricing adjustments on that product all the time based on the performance of their portfolio. Remember that\u2019s two different third parties that do our extended service plans and they manage their business to be profitable. So we had some price changes. We saw a little decline in penetration.","Bill Armstrong - CL King & Associates","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Tom Folliard","Thanks.","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Your next question comes from the line of Matt Fassler, Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Matt Fassler - Goldman Sachs","Thanks. I am back.","Tom Folliard","Hi, Matt.","Tom Reedy","Okay.","Matt Fassler - Goldman Sachs","Two very quick follow-ups, first of all, could you talk about your self-sufficiency ratio just year-on-year how it looked?","Tom Folliard","I didn\u2019t, but it was around 46%, 47%, it was flattish year-over-year.","Matt Fassler - Goldman Sachs","46%, 47%. Thank you. And then secondly, obviously, we recently saw an IPO from the company called TrueCar, is that, I know has focused on price transparency to the new dealer, to the new car channel, working hand-in-hand with dealers it seems, but also has a product for used cars, interested on your perspective on some of these tools? I guess, this one in particular, because of its profile, whether you see this is an emerging trend and what your best sense is of how to deal with that?","Tom Folliard","Nobody is more transparent than us with pricing and we have never really had to use the third-party to show customers what a great offer we have at CarMax.","Matt Fassler - Goldman Sachs","And is it putting any pressure on the market that you see or really no impact?","Tom Folliard","Nothing that we have seen.","Matt Fassler - Goldman Sachs","Thank you.","Tom Folliard","Thank you, Matt.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time.

Kenny","Thank you, Mo, and happy holidays to everybody. Thank you for joining our fiscal 2013 third quarter earnings conference call. On the call with me are Tom Folliard, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Tom Reedy, our Executive Vice President and CFO.","Before we begin, let me remind you, as always, that our statements today regarding the company's future business plans, prospects and financial performance are forward-looking statements that we make pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are based on management's current knowledge and assumptions about future events that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations.

Folliard","Thank you, Katharine. Good morning, everyone. Well, we're very pleased to report used unit comps for the third quarter of 12% and total growth in used units of 16%. Almost all of our comp growth was due to improved conversion. We believe improved conversion was due to a number of factors, more compelling finance offers from CAF and our third-party lenders, increased inventory selection and strong execution by our store sales teams.","In addition, we believe consumer sentiment has improved somewhat, which may be resulting in more engaged customers in our stores. Total used vehicle gross profit grew by 15% as our used unit sales increase was slightly offset by a $25 decrease in used vehicle gross profit per unit to $2,146 per car. Our wholesale unit sales increased 10% compared to last year due to higher appraisal traffic. Our buy ratio of 28% remained about the same as in the third quarter of last year. Total wholesale gross profit grew by 11% as a result of higher unit sales and a $9 increase in per unit gross profit to $923.","CAF quarterly income grew 16% to $72.5 million, Tom Reedy will comment more in a moment. During the quarter, sales of 5-year and older vehicles as a percentage of our total sales remained well above 25%, as we've been seeing for a while. Year-over-year sales of SUVs and trucks fell by about 4 percentage points of our total, offset by a similar increase in the percentage of compact and midsized vehicles.","You'll also notice that our total inventory at the end of the quarter was up substantially. This is also for a number of different reasons. First and foremost, our sales are up 12% and we usually move our inventory along with sales. We had 10 new stores in the quarter compared to last year, which was about 1\/4 of the increase. And lastly, historically, we've built inventory levels in the fall. And in last year's third quarter, we moderated this build given the negative comp levels we were experiencing at the time. But this year, we reverted to a more aggressive level of production given the improved condition.","I'll now turn the call over to Tom and he'll comment on financing. Tom?","Thomas J. Folliard","Thanks, Tom. Good morning, everybody. CAF income grew $10 million or 16% compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2012, in line with our portfolio of managed receivables, which increased 15% to $5.5 billion. For the quarter, interest margin after the provision for loan losses increased 14%. The growth in managed receivables was largely driven by strong origination volumes over the course of fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2013. These were lifted by CAF's expanded penetration and increase in the average amount of financed and CarMax's sales volume growth.","The allowance for loan losses grew $12.9 million or 31% to $54.3 million. As a percent of average managed receivables, it increased 0.1 point to 1.0%. This increase reflects the growth in our portfolio and the shift in credit mix as we return to our pre-recession origination strategy. The magnitude of the increase was tempered somewhat by favorable loss experience.","Net loans originated in the third quarter increased 29% year-over-year. This was largely driven by higher CarMax sales and an increase in CAF net penetration, which was 41% compared to 38% in the third quarter of 2012. Penetration increased due to the transition back to the pre-recession origination strategy and the extension of more compelling finance offers to our customers. As you know, we test offers and policies on an ongoing basis in attempt to optimize sales and profitability within our risk profile.","During the quarter, we believe consumers responded favorably to our finance offers, providing both incremental sales and higher CAF originations. We experienced continued strong access to financing for our customers. And as we've seen throughout the year, third-party subprime remains a higher percentage of our sales, 14% versus 9% in last year's third quarter.","Now I'll turn it back to Tom.","Thomas J. Folliard","Thank you. Our improved sales rate also drove SG&A expense leverage during the quarter even as we continue to ramp up our infrastructure growth -- our infrastructure per store growth. SG&A expenses per retail unit decreased by $43 a car.","We remain pleased with our new store performance. During the third quarter, we opened 3 new superstores: One in Des Moines, Iowa; one in Denver, Colorado; and our 10th store in Los Angeles. Last week, we opened our second store in the Denver market, and we plan to open one more store during the fourth quarter, a second location in Jacksonville, Florida. In today's press release, we included 4 planned openings in the third quarter of our next fiscal year: One in our existing Washington D.C. market; and 3 in new markets for CarMax, Jackson, Tennessee, which will be our second small-market store; and 2 in St. Louis, Missouri.","Also during the quarter, we launched our CarMax app available now on the iPhone. It already represents about 5% of the traffic to our website. Overall, web visits continue to increase, averaging now approximately 9 million per month, and this represents about a 16% increase year-over-year.","And with that, we'll open it up for questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] First question comes from the line of Matt Nemer with Wells Fargo Securities.","Matthew R. Nemer - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Just a few questions. First, can you talk about the improved inventory selection that you mentioned? Is that depth within certain models or is it more availability at certain age brackets?","Thomas J. Folliard","Well, it's really representative of what we're selling at this time. But as I said, about 2\/3 of the inventory increase is explained through just 12% comps. And as you know, we move our inventory along with sales, 10 new stores, which was about 1\/4 of the increase, and the remaining 1\/3 was, we always build inventory in the fall. Last year, we didn't, we moderated it some, so it created a kind of a bigger spike this year because we didn't build as aggressively as we normally do.","Matthew R. Nemer - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then secondly, I'm wondering if any of the changes in your store, the future, your next generation store format, have been working their way into the rest of the store base. Is there anything in that new store that you're planning on exporting to the base?","Thomas J. Folliard","Yes. It's still pretty early and there's a lot of the technology -- some of the changes in technology, with the display screens and how we present some of the consumer offer that we think we'll be able to push back into the existing stores pretty quickly. We have some process stuff that really doesn't require any capital, just some basic things like unlock in all of our cars, allowing our customers to test drive without a sales consultant, just some things we hadn't done in the past. We have yet to roll those out into existing stores because we want to be pretty certain what's working and what's not working. We do plan on going back in and remodeling 5 or so existing stores over the next 12 months to really see if we get a spike and get a read on kind of the whole package. But to date, we have our Chattanooga store open, Des Moines and 2 stores in Denver that are kind of our full next-generation package. But we're still learning which components are advantageous and which ones we can roll back into the stores pretty quickly. But there isn't any one thing that's jumping out right now.","Matthew R. Nemer - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And on the remodel, how big of a capital expense per store are you anticipating?","Thomas J. Folliard","We're still working on that. We tried to select some stores that had some capital coming anyway, like some -- they were up for some refreshing to begin with, so we think it'll be pretty manageable, but we don't have a number yet.","Matthew R. Nemer - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And then lastly, on the change in finance -- on the change in the finance environment, you mentioned that -- some changes at CAF, is that -- are the APRs coming down and is that due to higher 3-day payoffs or more sort of competitive rates from other folks in the industry?","Thomas W. Reedy","Yes. Matt, we talk about that we're constantly testing to see if changes in APR and in our offer will move the needle for customers, and we do that on an ongoing basis. And we've been testing in the past 2 years in this low interest rate environment. But I think what we saw in Q2 -- starting in Q2, is that customers have become more responsive to changes in interest rates and more receptive to it, which means we get better attach, fewer payoffs and more sales, so that's a good package for CarMax. And you can see in our APR for the quarter, which we started providing now in the earnings release instead of the Q so you have a couple weeks head start with it, that we're down at 7.7% for the originations during the quarter versus 8.1% in Q2 and 8.7% a year ago. So we have dropped rates, but all in all, it's -- we think -- believe it's positive for CarMax. And it's really -- that's our barometer for testing the competitive environment is whether customers are receptive to those changes and we found that we believe they have been recently.","Thomas J. Folliard","But that's about as low a total APR as we've had, Matt, in a long time.","Matthew R. Nemer - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","It sounds like it's more offense than defense, that decision.","Thomas W. Reedy","Yes, I think it's a proactive and responsive way of looking at the world and that's how -- we've just seen customers actually move this time. So the point of reference, our best credit customers during Q3 were offered a rate of 2.45%, which is pretty low and pretty competitive.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Gary Balter - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","It's Gary Balter for Simeon. You talked about 3 things and 2 of them were just discussed, the CAF, the inventory selection and strong execution at the stores as being behind the comp. Can you go -- are there any changes in the way you're talking -- your employees are approaching customers or anything along those lines that we should be thinking about?","Thomas J. Folliard","No, not really, Gary. That's pretty much -- we believe it's those factors that we referenced, but we -- there's no substantial change in the way we're talking to customers at all. We're always training and trying to get better and better at how we greet, handle customers, take them through objections, so -- but that's more of a marathon than it is a sprint. So if we're making some progress there, it's steady, slow progress over time.","Gary Balter - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And I think where there was a surprise in the quarter or in the trend has been the fact that the common perception has been that inventory is going to stay tight until we start seeing more stuff coming off leases, yet you're showing really strong inventory and really strong sales. What are your thoughts on the availability of cars as we go into next year and the following year?","Thomas J. Folliard","We've never felt like the lease issue had anything to do with our inventory levels. Our inventory levels were always a function of where we expected sales to come out and kind of how we felt about the next several weeks. As I mentioned, part of the unique comparison this year than last year, when we normally build inventory in the fall -- and there's a few reasons we build inventory in the fall. We have a really -- we usually have a pretty good sales week between Christmas and New Year's. We head into tax season in January and February, which you can see in our seasonality, there's always a pickup in sales there. There's also -- less of the auctions are opened on a more consistent basis, so if you want to build your inventory, you kind of have to do it in a bit of a spike during the fall season. If you think over the next couple of weeks, with Christmas and New Year's falling on a Tuesday, that's when, for example, Florida Auto Auction runs, that's one of the biggest auctions in the country, so they'll be closed for 2 weeks. And that's just something that we normally do. Last year, we had a negative comp quarter in the second quarter and we weren't as optimistic, so we just did not build inventory like we normally would. And this year, we're kind of back to where we were before in addition to moving inventory along with sales and having 10 new stores in the pipeline. So it's not something really -- it looks really big because it's 30% up year-over-year, but 2\/3 of it is explained by improved sales and new stores in the pipeline.","Gary Balter - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Right. And then last, when are you coming to New Jersey?","Thomas J. Folliard","We'll probably get to New Jersey as part of our Philadelphia market first. We're looking at Philadelphia now, but we're probably still a couple of years away. We do have a site in King of Prussia in New Jersey. The advertising market for Philadelphia, I think, would include parts of New Jersey like Cherry Hill, as well as Newark, Delaware. So Philly is a big market for us. It's complicated, it'll be multiple stores, but it's a place that we're excited to go to, and then you can buy a car from us.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer.","Brian W. Nagel - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","So I wanted to follow up, I know the 2 previous questions touched on finance too. But as you talk about the lower rates and more -- maybe more aggressive financing, is this something that you're beginning to advertise more aggressively to your customers or is it just something that comes up in your -- in the finance discussions to essentially aid conversion?","Thomas W. Reedy","It's the latter, Brian. We historically have not promoted finance in our marketing. We want to provide the customer the competitive and best offer that we can get at the point-of-sale and that's where they're seeing it.","Thomas J. Folliard","We have, on occasion, done some stuff on the website, advertising a particularly attractive rate, but remember -- Tom referenced the 2.45% rate, remember, that's only available to the very top tier of customers. So oftentimes, if you advertise too much of a low rate, your -- most customers don't qualify for that. So although we've done that some in the past that has very -- nothing to do with what we've seen this quarter.","Brian W. Nagel - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Got it. And then just regarding the sales trends, you mentioned it's -- the uptick in comps is largely a function of better conversion, but how would you characterize -- clearly, we had a shift here in Q3 from what we'd seen the prior 2 quarters and further back than that. The overall activity of your customers, something I know we watch a lot is -- you're starting to see that, I guess you'd call it maybe that aspirational customer come back to the store whether -- it's maybe not as much of a need purchase, but they're buying that car they kind of want, maybe kind of a fun car. Are you seeing the beginnings of a shift like that or is it basically just the same customer coming to your store now converting more?","Thomas J. Folliard","That part is really hard to judge, Brian, whether or not people are going back to buying, I guess, an extra car or a fun car. Our history with that is that usually doesn't happen in the fall anyway. And we had a negative 3% comp last year's third quarter, so this was our easiest comparison of the year. But I think consumer sentiment has come back some but -- and the customers that are coming to the store now seem a little bit more engaged maybe than they had been before, as has shown up in our conversion. And like I said, I think it's from a number of different reasons, and the credit availability and attractiveness of rate is no small part of the picture. I think it's people get involved, they get involved in considering to buy car and then they find out how cheap their payment's going to be, and they're probably a little bit more likely to buy a car, so. But it's really hard to tell if behavior is shifting back to what we saw pre-recession. I'd say not yet.","Brian W. Nagel - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Got it. And the final question, just you've been opening a number of new stores, just any comments on the performance of those units as you're opening them?","Thomas J. Folliard","Just as a group, we're very pleased with the performance of all of our new stores. And it's a pretty diverse set. There's some in brand new markets. We have a couple of our -- what we've called our next-generation format, we have some satellites going back into existing markets, so -- but we've only been back to growth here for whatever it is, about 2 years. And we've really -- since the recession, we opened those 3 stores that were already built. We opened 5 during the year last year and 10 this year, so there's not a lot of time really to read them, but as a group, we're very pleased.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","My first question relates to traffic. Just want to make sure I understand the relationship, if any, between appraisal traffic, which sounds like it was quite strong and drove the wholesale number, and traffic for used car sales, which sounds like it wasn't a big part of the comp generation. So has there ever been a consistency, any type of relationship between those 2 factors to the extent where this divergence would be unusual?","Thomas J. Folliard","I'm not sure how unusual it is, but in general, we would think that as traffic grows, appraisal traffic grows, it's probably a bit unusual in this quarter that our traffic was relatively flat in aggregate, but our -- those -- of those customers who came to the store, about 10% more decided to get their car appraised. And since we bought at the same rate, that delivers the wholesale increase. So yes, it might be a little bit unusual, but I would still think that over time, we would see those numbers move directionally pretty similar.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. And any relationship, do you think perhaps between that development and conversion to the extent that maybe the link just didn't shown up in used car traffic but more people who were there, were kind of already transacting with you in one way or the other?","Thomas J. Folliard","Yes, probably. Some of the people who -- obviously, some people who sell us the car also buy a car from us. So I mentioned the factors that we thought were improved conversion. And clearly, some of those customers had to get out of whatever it was that they were driving, so that probably had something to do with it as well.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. A second question relates to subprime. So obviously, over the past 4 quarters including this quarter, albeit to a somewhat lesser degree in this quarter, subprime has been ramping as a percent of the business. So there's obviously some cost to you for that. So you're about to cycle the first quarter where subprime begin to pop, that was the Feb 2012 quarter. What do you anticipate happening to the subprime mix of the business based on your positioning within CAF, based on your thought process on the cost of doing this business as we cycle that development?","Thomas W. Reedy","Yes, Matt. I don't think we can predict exactly what's going to happen as we cycle. And in fact, the subprime actually started elevating last fall and then we saw another pickup in kind of the wintertime Q4, Q1 period. But because we did see an increase in subprime over the course of Q4 last year, we expect that the subprime mix will likely be a bit higher this year than last year because we are rolling over a period of transition. But I wouldn't expect the same kind of proportional increase you've seen in other quarters this year.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","One or 2 more very quick ones. So obviously, the supply of late-model used vehicles has been a pretty big theme surrounding your stock and most likely, surrounding your outlook legitimately. It sounds, Tom, from what you said, like the mix of business didn't change a whole lot from recent quarters and whatever changes we saw on supply, and I know those come slow, probably didn't really move the needle here. Any updated thinking on this starting to have an impact for you going forward?","Thomas J. Folliard","So we've been talking about the supply issue, we've been talking about the spark coming back, which would help us from a supply standpoint. But it really -- our ability to predict when that'll happen, there are so many other factors there with consumer behavior and lots of other -- how quickly people turn out of their car, cars per household. We think it's coming. It's hard to really say whether or not it happened this quarter. We did see a mix shift within our mix, within the 1- to 4-year old cars, where this quarter, we had a bigger percentage of our sales were 1- to 2-year-old cars, so you could see it coming back a little bit. That was offset by a decrease in 3- to 4-year-old cars, but if you look at the mix of break it into 2 groups, 1 to 4 and 5 to 10, it was pretty similar to what it has been. So embedded in there is some movement towards 1- and 2-year-old cars, but in aggregate, we haven't seen it very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Murphy with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","John Murphy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","First question, I mean, is there anything that you're seeing in the market or with this new store opening experience, which sounds like it's going very well, which would lead you to accelerate your new store openings? I mean I know you're targeting this 10 to 15. But it sounds like the market's coming back, you're doing really well. Could this ever go up to a 15 to 20 rate?","Thomas J. Folliard","We've announced the next 3 years, we're very comfortable with that number. We said all along that we think we need a balance between opening up new stores and continuing to improve our existing business model. I think I'm very proud of the way our teams have reacted and the progress that we've made in both of those areas. I think the build that we've announced for stores: 3, 2 years ago; 5, last year; 10, this year; 10 to 15 in the next 3 years. We think that 10 to 15 gives us a range of acceleration to push it up if need be. Really, the next year for us is a largely baked because those stores are already under construction. It takes about a year to build one of these, so we're pretty happy with what we've -- what our plans are over the next few years. We don't want to get too overly excited over any short-term trends nor do we want to move in the other direction if something were to go south a little bit.","John Murphy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, got you. Then if we think about used vehicle pricing, meaning over time, if supply comes back, there'll probably be a little bit of natural pressure on pricing. I'm just curious, as we see that, your sales will pick up, but would your gross profit come under any pressure there? Do you think you can still hold this $2,100 to $2,200 gross profit? Is there a reason to think that might fade?","Thomas J. Folliard","Well, we've operated in depreciating environments before and been able to manage our margins pretty good, but it's really hard to say. There's just too many other factors. I mean, I would take lower margins for much higher sales, so it really just depends what's going on in the overall market place, including wholesale, including finance and including demand and supply. There's just too many factors there to really say I'm 100% sure we can keep our margins within such a tight window.","John Murphy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then just lastly on the wholesale gross profit per unit at $923, that's been pretty strong for the last few years. I mean, as we think about that going forward and it's same phenomena that supply comes back in, should we think about that at least having a base for at $400 to $500 the buy-sell fee at an auction, that would be sort of the worst case scenario you get on a wholesale gross profit per unit? It just seems like that should be at least a bare minimum floor and everything above that is your execution. Is that a fair way to think about that?","Thomas J. Folliard","Yes, I mean, as we're -- you've seen how finely we've managed it. So without giving any guidance, I don't expect our wholesale margins to go down to $400. So I mean, I think we're able to manage it pretty well.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets.","Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Tom, you outlined a couple of items that helped the conversion rates in the quarter. And I know it may not be a scientific exercise, but any way to tell kind of the size of the impact of those different factors, or at least put them in some sort of ranking or order?","Thomas J. Folliard","Yes. Not really, I wish there was. But even with the financing piece, which we know we're giving better offers, we know what's going on in the subprime world as it relates to our customers. Every time somebody gets an approval, we still have to execute in the store, we still have to overcome objections. Oftentimes, we have to convince customers to put more money down. Oftentimes, we're making them an offer on their car that's less than what they owe at the bank, so I just -- I couldn't be more proud of our store teams and our execution and our ability to manage customers effectively. So it's really hard to say. I mean, if you just changed a rate, it's not necessarily going to sell you more cars if you don't actually execute that in the stores and provide great customer service. So it's just -- it's really hard to say, almost impossible for us, really. It's a combination of all of those factors and they work well in the quarter and we're really pleased with the results.","Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","You had mentioned the better store execution. Was there any extra training or kind of change in terms of how you approach the customers? Or I know you guys have a checklist in terms of trying to knock down customer objections, et cetera, was there any kind of change on that front?","Thomas J. Folliard","No. As I said earlier, I think this is a -- it's -- I said it's more of a marathon than it is a sprint. I think we're providing lots of great training in the stores, but it's a very long, slow, continuous improvement type environment, not we're going to come up with some new thing that's going to change our fortunes overnight, we don't expect that at all.","Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then I mean you guys have stores kind of entering your comp base now. And given that the level of new store productivity that you're seeing, any feel for the kind of the level of comps that you're seeing from the first stores entering the comp base, the younger stores entering the comp base?","Thomas J. Folliard","It probably wasn't much in the quarter just from straight math. We have 10 stores we opened this year, none of those are in the comp base. We only opened the 3 2 years ago and then the 5 last year, so when you look at 116 or 117 store total and then the fact that the stores opened up in terms of a volume compared to one of our bigger stores pretty low, I'd say it had very little impact. Although I haven't actually gone and done it, I just -- it couldn't have had much of an impact on comps.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Clint Fendley with Davenport.","Clint D. Fendley - Davenport & Company, LLC, Research Division","I'm curious if you have any thoughts on customer recognition of the brand and how that might be changing? I know when I look at the new markets or cities that you plan to enter within the next year, most of them are in states such as the Virginia, Georgia, Tennessee, where you have been for a long time. I'm wondering, should that help you gain share there in an accelerated way?","Thomas J. Folliard","I think in general, our brand has gotten stronger since we started, so I think that has some truth in any new market we go to, particularly since we've been doing a portion of our TV ads have been national advertising over the last couple of years. It's about 40% of our TV spend is now national. So even a place like Denver, where we didn't have a presence, has been seeing some CarMax ads over the last couple of years. But clearly, in a market that we have a more established base of stores and established base of customers that we've been selling to, we would have a stronger brand awareness for sure, but that's not a factor in us selecting where we're going next. We're basically trying to go everywhere that we're not.","Clint D. Fendley - Davenport & Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And I wonder if you could discuss your strategy with the small-market stores? Why now given the large growth opportunity that is still in front of you in some of the larger markets?","Thomas J. Folliard","We think that is part of our growth opportunity and it represents somewhere between 80 and 100 markets in the U.S. that currently would -- they would not be in the growth plan, if not for figuring out how to do a small format store. I think we can do both. I think we can go after the markets that are more traditional or even bigger metro markets, and at the same time, on a limited basis, go after some of these small markets, figure it out, see if it works, and if it does, we can build them into the pipeline going forward. So when you look at what it represents of our total growth, it's a very small percentage of it. Next year, we'll open up Harrisonburg, Virginia and Jackson, Tennessee as 2 small format stores, but we got to get a couple of them opened and read the results for a while before we determine how aggressively we want to go after that opportunity.","Operator","Next question comes from line of Rod Lache from Deutsche Bank.","Dan Galves - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","It's Dan Galves for Rod. Just a couple follow-ups on CAF. The latest ABS issuance that you did loans through September was done at an 8.6% customer rate. Is the 7.7% origination rate on loans during this quarter, is that -- are those 2 numbers comparable?","Thomas W. Reedy","Yes, it's the same calculation. But if you look back sequentially, in Q2, you saw that, that number was 8.1%. But if you -- and if you look at a deal, it's a combination of loans we've originated probably over the last 6 months plus things that have rolled off of other deals. So there's -- each deal can be very pretty -- not significantly, but there can be some variance in APR on deals depending what's in there.","Dan Galves - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, got you. I just wanted to clarify that. And then on the loan loss provision, I mean, the provisioning on the quarter looks like it was maybe 1.3% and the allowance is 1.0%. Realize that the allowance is a reflection of all the loans in the pool and your expectations. But as the loans that were originated kind of during the crisis with higher average FICOs, as those become a smaller piece of the overall pool, do you think that the loan loss allowance migrates higher than the 1.0% you're at right now?","Thomas W. Reedy","Yes. I think if you think about how -- the life cycle of our portfolio, as we're adding -- if we change the mix of the portfolio, it takes a couple of years for the portfolio to normalize to kind of equate to that steady-state mix, and we're still seeing that happen here with regard to taking back the lower end of the credit spectrum that we've been doing over the last 18-or-so months. So I think as the portfolio continues to normalize to what we're originating today, we would expect to see that number move up, but it also depends on what's going on with loss experience, which has been positive in the last several quarters. It's hard to predict exactly where it'll go, but I would -- we would expect that it's going to trend upward. Now at the same time, you got to remember, we're charging up more for those loans because they're higher risk and it's a good business proposition for CarMax. At the end of the day, it's a profitable endeavor for us and that's why we're doing it, so you've got to remember, we're getting paid more too on this.","Chad Potter - Gradient Analytics, Inc.","Absolutely. And just one additional question. In terms of your competition from new car -- the used car lots from new car dealers, if you could just talk about, a lot of new car dealers have been talking about getting a bit more aggressive on what they'll retail versus what they'll wholesale. In addition, you're probably selling more 1- to 2-year-old vehicles now. Has there been any change in the competitive dynamic that you're seeing from the new car stores?","Thomas J. Folliard","There's been a lot of talk about that for the last couple of years, so the shifting that we've seen, I think we've already seen. So it's not like there was something unique in the quarter with the way everybody else behaved. And as it relates to us, we are selling older mix of -- an older mix of cars than we did pre-recession, but we never lowered our quality standards. So we've seen pretty significant growth in our wholesale business and that's the type of stuff that people are saying that they're retailing. We've chosen not to do that, but we've seen growth in that area of our business pretty substantially over the last couple years, as you've seen.","Operator","Next question comes from line of James Albertine with Stifel, Nicolaus.","James J. Albertine - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","On the 1- to 2-year-old vehicle comment, I just wanted to clarify sort of how you typically source those vehicles or have been sourcing them during the third quarter. And then \u2013 well, I guess I'll let you answer that question, and I have a follow-up to that.","Thomas J. Folliard","Yes, those cars are going to be bought the same way we buy everything, either a combination of buying cars directly from the consumer and buying cars in the open marketplace, whether it's at auction or elsewhere, so it's a combination of those 2.","James J. Albertine - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And have you ever detailed sort of the gross margin implications, the difference between when you buy at auction versus when you buy directly from a consumer?","Thomas J. Folliard","We have not, other than to say that our -- what we buy from consumers is more profitable than what we buy offsite. Remember, there's some costs involved with buying offsite, shipping and things of that nature, so it's always been a more profitable source to buy internally, but we've been able to manage the mix pretty effectively to a margin target.","James J. Albertine - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Understood. And then lastly, just on your comp leverage point, I think I probably share with sort of my peer view that the leverage was impressive, considering not only the 12% comp, but that you're investing in your new growth strategy. So I guess if there's a way to sort of peel back the investments that you're making. Has there been a shift perhaps to a slightly lower comp leverage point as you see it?","Thomas J. Folliard","No. I mean, it's -- again, it's one of those things that's -- it's not really -- I don't think that it should be measured on what happened this quarter and therefore, that means this forever because there's a lot of timing stuff in there as well, but we've always said mid to high single digits plus that even in a growth environment we thought we could leverage SG&A. We had a 12% comp, we leveraged SG&A, we're building infrastructure for growth at a higher rate than we were the year before, so we're pretty pleased with the results ourselves, but I'm not sure that it's -- that you should read into it any more than that.","Operator","Next question comes from line of Joseph Edelstein with Stephens Inc.","Joe Edelstein - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Just wanted to follow up on the leverage question that was just asked. And given that you will be up against a more difficult subprime mix, starting really fourth quarter here, I mean, do you think that you'll be able to leverage in the fourth quarter?","Thomas J. Folliard","Again, like I said, it's hard to tell. If I knew what comps were going to be, I'd have a better idea. And there's no doubt, I think if you're asking that an increase in Tier 3 or subprime percentage is less beneficial, you're right. So it's a little tougher to leverage when you have a higher percent mix, but we did it this quarter, so we'll have to see how the quarter comes out.","Joe Edelstein - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Sure. And just kind of tied into -- we're all trying to get a handle on where the comps will go, but earlier, you mentioned that there was improved consumer sentiment, and part of that helped you this quarter. But I'm just trying to get a sense for how you think consumers will react under any sort of fiscal cliff, those headlines have been getting louder.","Thomas J. Folliard","Yes. If you knew, it would be really helpful for us if you could tell us, but it's really hard to say. When you look at all the things that are in the fiscal cliff and you have to jump to a conclusion that therefore consumers are going to behave in a certain way. What I feel really good about is our ability to react, move our business, move our inventory accordingly and operate in lots of different economic environments. So I feel super confident in our teams' ability to respond to whatever happens with the consumer. It feels a little better this quarter. I think that's part of why conversion was up. It's not \u2013 this is just what I believe, it's not -- I can't go give you a statistic that says consumer sentiment added x amount to our sales, but it's just impossible to tell what will happen at the end of the year.","Joe Edelstein - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Okay. And as you try to then manage the inventory levels, et cetera, can you just tell us what your expectations are for used vehicle margins as we look out really kind of through the rest of this year just because there has been increased supply as a result of Hurricane Sandy, but then just also looking out a little further into next year where you think margins could go?","Thomas J. Folliard","Yes, we don't give any guidance on margin or sales.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Armstrong with CL King & Associates.","William Armstrong","Can you talk about what you're seeing in terms of pricing trends for used cars in your wholesale sources or from consumers?","Thomas J. Folliard","I think -- I don't have the Manheim trends in front of me, but there's been some depreciation during the last few months in the fall, which is pretty normal for -- actually, I'm not sure what normal is anymore but it used to be normal several years ago. We went through a couple years of unusual appreciation for a long time, but I think we've seen some movement -- some depreciation in the last few months that is just a little more normal than the fall, so I mean, nothing shocking.","William Armstrong","So we haven't gotten to a point yet where you're starting to see that spread between retail prices of a new car and a comparable 1- or 2-year-old car starting to widen again is what it sounds like.","Thomas J. Folliard","I think what's lost in that whole conversation of new car appreciation over the last couple of years -- I mean, I'm sorry, used car appreciation over the last couple of years, is that new car prices have gone up equal or more. The average price of a new car is over $30,000. So the spread, if you just look at our average sale price and the average of a new car, the spread really never tightened up very much. Now on an individual car basis, there's always examples, there's been examples the whole time we've been in business, where on a specific make or model depending on how hot it is and depending how much pressure the manufacturer's putting on pricing that, that window could get kind of tight and consumers might decide to buy a new car over a used car on a specific make-model basis. But in general, we think the spread is attractive enough that we're providing great value to our customers.","William Armstrong","Okay. Moving on to CAF, your penetration rate is over 40%. Where is that compared with historical levels, if you could remind us? And do you see it going higher?","Thomas W. Reedy","I'd say historical levels, it's going to depend on the quarter. But I think in -- low-40s is not an abnormal number for CAF. We said high 30s to low 40s. And it all depends on what's going on with the customer flow through the door and how they're receptive to our offers. It's very hard to comment on where it's going to go.","Thomas J. Folliard","It's not a number we're uncomfortable with.","Thomas W. Reedy","Right.","William Armstrong","Okay. And maybe just looking at the last cyclical peak, I would assume prior to the credit crisis, where -- I don't know if you have those numbers handy or not.","Thomas W. Reedy","We can get back to you after the call, but you've got to remember, we also had other partners lending in the same spaces as back as that time period, so it's not really an apples-to-apples comparison.","William Armstrong","Right, right, I remember that. And then just one sort of technical point of clarification, we're in December of '12, when we're talking about your sales of cars that are 5 years or older, are we talking about '08 model years and earlier at this point?","Thomas J. Folliard","What are we in, '12?","William Armstrong","We're in December of '12, but we've got...","Thomas J. Folliard","Yes, '08 would be 5 years and older.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Whiston with Morningstar.","David Whiston - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Wanted to go back first to the -- accelerating the store opening question, up or down, I should say. Specifically, is there any kind of -- on the macro side, is there kind of any factors such as SAR or unemployment, consumer confidence that would make you change those plans?","Thomas J. Folliard","No. Only if those things impacted our sales.","David Whiston - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay. And on the buyback, was the rationale for doing a buyback over a dividend just that buyback can be done at the board's discretion rather than a fixed cash outlay of a dividend?","Thomas J. Folliard","Want to get that one, Tom?","Thomas W. Reedy","Yes. I think we -- the way we looked at it is we're still a growth company. A dividend is more of a longer-term commitment. We're committed to looking at returning value to our shareholders in any method that is appropriate and makes sense and the repurchase just seemed, given our current situation, was a more appropriate vehicle. I really can't comment much beyond that but...","David Whiston - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay. Would you say then a dividend is something you wouldn't do until your store expansion is completed across the U.S.?","Thomas W. Reedy","I think we'll cross those kind of bridges when the time's appropriate. We look at our capital structure. We look at how the business is doing and what we're returning on an ongoing basis. And I think what we can say is we'll, like I said, we'll use the tools that are available, and we'll do what we think is most appropriate for our shareholders at that time. At this point, we don't have anything new to report. We're buying back programmatically right now.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","First of all, we were delighted to see you launch the mobile app. And I'm curious, you've talked about it being 5% of traffic. Are you seeing higher levels of conversion and can you tell if people are using it in the stores as a supplement to your systems and to your people?","Thomas J. Folliard","It's way too early to tell on that. The other part is we had it available with Android as well and we had a few issues with it, so we had to take it down this week. We expect it to be back up quickly, but until we have both the iPhone and the Android app up and running and get some more time to read it, it's almost -- what we can tell is what percentage of hits it represents, so that's the number we gave you.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And second final question, I know you're in the process of making a change in terms of EVP of Marketing, and I'm interested in whether you're taking a fresh look at all at the company's marketing strategy and what direction we might anticipate for you going forward.","Thomas J. Folliard","Matt, we're really proud of everything we've done here. I think we've done some phenomenal things in marketing. We've built a terrific brand over time. I think our marketing team has done an outstanding job in pretty much every area. We are looking forward and looking at staying ahead of the consumer and some of the things that are going on in mobile and digital. We had a terrific guy who you know, Joe, who was in -- who had multiple responsibilities here, and we really want to have a Chief Marketing Officer specifically dedicated to that one area alone. But I'm really proud of the stuff that we've accomplished so far. And as we look at growth over the next 5 to 10 years and we look at adding between 30 and 45 stores and continue to have our existing stores' growth, I'm just really excited about the opportunities we have to continue to build our brand.","Operator","And at this time, there are no further questions. I would like to pass the call back to the speakers for closing remarks.","Thomas J. Folliard","All right. Thank you very much. Thanks, everyone, for joining us. Happy holidays.

We are very fortunate that he is still involved and will be Chairman of our Board and I am looking forward to continuing to work with him. So, Tom, if you are listening, which I am sure you are since I know there are no Boston sports teams playing at this time of the morning, thank you. Thank you from all of us here at CarMax.","Over these past few months I have spent a lot of time on the road, visiting our stores and talking with our associates. I am incredibly proud of them. Our 22,000 associates across the country are doing an awesome job delivering the best car shopping experience in the industry. The success of our company is due to our great associates and I am committed to maintaining our strong workplace culture. I am also very excited about the opportunity we have ahead of us.","In addition to our great associates, we have a top-notch management team here at the home office, CarMax Auto Finance, and in all of our stores to lead us into the future. More than 20 years ago CarMax was founded to fundamentally change the way used car buying is done. We have revolutionized the used car buying experience and our brand offer continues to resonate with customers. Now we are focused on extending that revolutionary experience. We are in a unique position to leverage our core strength which is the exceptional customer experience our associates are known for and extend it into a state-of-the-art online experience.","We have launched a new Web site. We are testing new online shopping capabilities and we are continuing to build out a new technology infrastructure. All of these elements will ensure the entire car buying process is simple and seamless, both online and in our stores. And we are confident that our systems and processes put us in the best position to drive scalability and efficient execution nationwide.","Keep in mind, we still only reach about 65% of the U.S. population. We are committed to our national expansion and will open 15 stores this year and 13 to 16 stores next year. Now I'll take a few moments to review some of the highlights of our second quarter results before I turn the call over to Tom Reedy to address financing. Then I will conclude with an update on some of our strategic initiatives.","Our total used unit comps for the second quarter increased by over 3% and total used units grew 7%. Total used unit comps were driven by a strong improvement in conversion but it was partially offset by a decline in traffic. As we discussed last quarter, we believe our decrease in traffic was largely due to the continuation of less traffic from customers at the lower end of the credit spectrum. Used unit comps for our non-Tier 3 customers were significantly stronger this quarter at over 8%.","When it comes to our total web traffic, it increased 4% compared with the prior year quarter. Gross profit per used unit at $2,160 remained consistent with $2,166 in the second quarter of last year. Our wholesale units declined by 1.3% in the second quarter. Compared to the second quarter of last year we had one less Monday this quarter and approximately 55% of our auctions take place on Mondays. Excluding the effect of the calendar shift, we estimate this year's wholesale vehicle unit sales growth would have been 1.4% year-over-year.","Gross profit per wholesale unit decreased to $870 compared to the gross profit per unit of $951 last second quarter. Last year's gross profit per unit was exceptionally strong, so it was a tough comparison. Let me cover a few other topics before I turn the call over to Tom.","As a percentage of sales mix this quarter, zero to four year old vehicles fell to 76% compared to 79% last year as a result of higher customer demand for older and less expensive vehicles. On the expense side, SG&A for the second quarter increased 11% to $366 million. This growth partially reflects the 11% or 16 store increase in our store base since the beginning of the second quarter of last year and an $18 million increase in share-based compensation expense. Included in the share-based compensation expense was approximately $7 million which relates, like every quarter, to nonexecutive compensation units that are settled in cash. This expense is driven by the change in CarMax's stock price during a quarter versus the change in the previous year's quarter. So the expense in this second quarter was based on a five dollar increase in price versus a decrease of $10 in last year's second quarter.","The other $11 million included in share-based compensation expense is related to the Board's decision to modify certain equity awards previously granted to Tom Folliard. These modifications effectively treated Tom as a retiree even though he is somewhat younger but he far exceeded the service requirement having been here for 23 years. These changes did not accelerate the original vesting of his awards or extend the original terms.","Now I will turn the call over to Tom.","Tom Reedy","Thanks, Bill. Good morning, everybody. Consistent with recent quarters, we experienced a year-over-year increase in credit applications from customers at the higher end of the credit spectrum and a decline across the lower end. This mix drove growth in the percentage of sales financed by CAF and growth in sales where customers paid cash or brought their own financing.","CAF's net penetration increased to 45.3% compared with 43.3% in last year's second quarter. Net loans originated in the quarter rose more than 8% year-over-year to $1.4 billion due to a combination of CarMax's sales growth and our higher penetration. Tier 2 penetration fell year-over-year in the quarter by about 1 percentage point to 16.2%. While our tier 2 lenders performance based on what we see on their conversion of customers to sale, continued to be strong they were impacted by the decrease in volume for lower end credit applications as well.","In addition to the slower volume, tier 3 sales continued to be affected by credit tightening at one of our third-party lenders. Tier 3 sales mix was 9.5% of used unit sales compared to 13.7% for the same period last year. This level of decline does not represent further tightening from what we experienced starting in the middle of Q1 of this year. CAF income of $96 million represented a decrease of 2.3% compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2016. This was due to a higher provision for loan losses and a lower interest margin, partially offset by a 12% growth in average managed receivables to over $10 billion.","The year-over-year increase in the provision for loan losses in the second quarter reflected some unfavorable experience in the current quarter, the growth in receivables, and additional allowance that we booked based on our Q1 experience. Our ending allowance for loan losses at $110 million was 1.08% of ending managed receivables compared to 1.05% last quarter and 0.96% in prior year's second quarter. The allowance reflects the combination of both our experience in the quarter and adjustment for the overall portfolio based on what we have learned. This current level of loss reserve is consistent with our range of expectations, given our origination strategy and our portfolio mix.","For loans originated during the quarter, the weighted average contract rate charged to customers was 7.4%, similar to 7.2% in the last year's second quarter. Total interest margin declined to 5.9% of average managed receivables compared to 6.2% in the second quarter of last year. The total interest margin however has been at about 5.9% for three consecutive quarters.","Now switching gears from CAF to CarMax. Like last quarter, interest expense is up year-over-year to $14 million compared to $7 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2016. This was due to higher average debt levels which as we have discussed, are a deliberate component of our capital structure strategy, as well as the store lease extensions that we have previously discussed in our filings.","During the second quarter we took down the remaining $200 million of a private debt deal we closed in Q1 and we repurchased $2.4 million shares for $126 million. Now I will turn the call back over to Bill.","Bill Nash","Thanks. Tom. During the second quarter we opened three stores. El Paso, Texas, and Bristol, Tennessee, both of which were in new markets for us. We also opened a third store in Boston. Subsequent to the end of the second quarter, we opened a store in Boise, Idaho, another new market for us.","During the third quarter, we expect to open five more stores. Four will be in current markets including Philadelphia, Orlando and two in San Francisco. The fifth will be in Grand Rapids, a new market for us.","Last quarter I talked about how we are testing different online components of the selling process to better understand and meet our customers' needs. I would like to give you an update on those efforts. I previously shared with you that we had rolled out a new adaptive, more intuitive Web site. The new Web site combines an upgraded and enhanced design with a seamless experience across all devices. We also upgraded the entire site to a state of the art technology platform which will allow us to more quickly innovate, test new capabilities and personalize the experience. This is the first full quarter with the new Web site in place and we are pleased with the performance so far. We have seen a positive response based on increased engagement activity such as inventory searches, viewing of car page details and creating personalized accounts.","With our new site, we have to continue to drive leads and convert more customers from the Web site to store and finally to a sale. Second, we have been testing an online financing capability to help our customers to get pre-qualified for a loan before they choose a specific vehicle. They can get pre-qualified for financing from any computer or mobile device and then finish their shopping experience more quickly in the store. We have expanded the pilot to 13 stores and we are encouraged by the customer response. We are looking forward to rolling out the finished product to all our stores in the next couple of months and we will provide with you an update next quarter.","Lastly, we have previously mentioned that we conducted a small test of home delivery. This allows the customers to shop for and buy a car at their convenience without coming into the store. We are now conducting another larger test in Charlotte, North Carolina. Through this test we hope to learn the best ways to further operationalize this offering and deliver our hallmark exceptional customer service experience outside the store. We believe no one is in a better position to deliver as much of the car buying experience online as the customer wants. We believe that we are uniquely positioned to give customers the ability to go between the digital experience and the in-store experience whenever and however they would like.","CarMax's national footprint, unparalleled inventory and brand strength position us to continue to lead the industry. Now I will open it up for questions. Victoria?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer.","Brian Nagel","Bill, welcome to the CEO role.","Bill Nash","Thank you.","Brian Nagel","So I have a couple of questions, and I'll squish them together here. First off, with respect to used car unit comps, clearly there was a lot of estimate for, I guess a lot of noise with regard to forecast for the quarter. As I look at the results today, call it the 3% used car unit comp, was quite good in the sense that it suggested an acceleration from first quarter levels. So the question I have there is, as you look at the dynamic behind that, can you help us identify what may have changed in the environment for CarMax here in Q2 versus Q1 to help to facilitate that acceleration in used car unit comps? And then I'll do my follow-up.","Bill Nash","Yes. So, first of all, Brian, we are encouraged by the overall comps of the little over 3%. We are equally encouraged that we got that even with the headwind that we faced in the tier 3 space. So, again, if you looked at just the non-core -- I am sorry, the non-tier 3 sales, it was really at 8%. So we feel good about that. And I think really what you are seeing is the culmination of a bunch of different initiatives and better execution at the store level. I can't pinpoint it to necessarily one thing that\u2019s driving comps this quarter over last quarter. I think it's the culmination of some of the strategic initiatives that we have been talking about and I think also just better execution at the store level.","Brian Nagel","So on that, is the supply situation, I know we talk a lot about supply over the last several quarters now, but are you seeing some relief on the supply side, is that positive?","Bill Nash","Yes, I think on the supply side I think the expectations were that was going to be coming back more in full force at this point and continue on later into next year and in the year after. We really haven't seen a big, huge increase in the supply of late model cars. I think there is some coming out there but we haven't seen the big increase that I think was originally expected and we think it will come, our external partners being the auctions think they will come later this year into next year and even the year after.","Brian Nagel","Okay. And then my follow up on the -- with respect to the credit business. The loan loss provision there, just help us understand that. I get it, they're still very small numbers but the 1.4% here in the second quarter was up modestly year-on-year and sequentially. How should we think about that increase? Is it more one time in nature? Is there something happening in the business?","Bill Nash","What I can say, Brian, is that it incorporates everything we have learned about the portfolio to date. We can't speak to how things are going to migrate in the future but I think it's important to point out that we have been in an environment of very favorable, not just we but the overall credit markets in general, have been in a very favorable loss environment for the last few years, the last couple of years at least. And it's not hugely surprising to see things starting to migrate a little bit differently. That said, all we can put into -- all we put into our provision is what we learned to date. We are not making any prognostications about the future and continued movement and obviously we will keep a close eye on it and adjust our strategies if it merits that. I mean it -- as I think you pointed out, quarter-over-quarter sequentially it's not that big of an uptick. If you look year-over-year, it's a pretty significant jump about, but about half of that jump we would have expected based on the fact that the portfolio has grown 12% and the experience that we had in Q1, we incorporated into our provision for this quarter. So there was some unexpected unfavorable experience but much of the change in the provision shouldn\u2019t be too unexpected even though it was a pretty big step up.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sharon Zackfia with William Blair.","Sharon Zackfia","I guess I'm going to ask two questions but really quickly. The subprime degradation you're seeing, Tom, can you talk about whether that's more on the applications or the approval side? If you're seeing a little bit of both and whether there's any stabilization occurring there?","Tom Reedy","Sure. Sure. Yes, I think mentioned -- we are seeing it on both sides, right. If you kind of looked at our degradation year-over-year, we would estimate that about 40% of the decline is due to application volume and the remaining 60% is really due to a change in behavior of our lenders, one lender in particular. So as far as stabilization, I think what we saw happen last quarter was during the quarter, during Q1, Santander, who has been in the press about and talking about how they are pulling back in different spaces, we saw change in behavior there in the middle of the quarter, so we didn\u2019t really get a full quarter's impact of it in Q1, but since May we have seen stable performance in the tier three space that doesn\u2019t, I am not speaking to the future, but we\u2019ve seen four months of stability and this quarter reflects kind of a full quarter of the new world as it was since those changes.","As far as the change, it's more of the same that we have talked about in the past as we have seen changes in lender behavior. Our global approval rate is still well above 90% but the quality of the offers and the attractiveness of those offers to the customers, it becomes worse if they are asking for more down or if they are asking for stipulations like proof of income etcetera. And so that\u2019s the nature of the tightening that we have seen.","Sharon Zackfia","I guess as a follow up to that. Does this in any way kind of change your attitude towards maybe expanding the CAF test in subprime or, I know you're always testing other lenders. Is there anything you can do there to augment what's happening with Santander?","Tom Reedy","I think, as you pointed out, we are always looking at testing other lenders, we have got a test running right now but it's not big enough to talk about. The interesting thing about this space is there is very few national players, it's like much more a regional space in the financing world. So we can test additional lenders. As far as CarMax Auto Finance, we are comfortable with our level of activity where it is. I mean we are not -- Santander is not pulling back because they are delighted with what they are seeing in that portfolio. And when we think about that space, there is more to it than just the profit, there is the impact on our brand. There is the impact on our reputation with customers and in this current environment I think we are happier being thought of as a prime lender that has some activity in the tier 3 space. We are learning from it. We are learning how to originate. We are learning how to service. We are leaning how to perform and we are building a track record in that space. But we haven't determined that. Now is the time to go forward with anything greater.","And if you remember, when we first rolled this out a couple of years ago, we have said specifically that we were not interested in this space in order to augment sales at CarMax. It was more of a learning and potential profit play and that we could be one of several players in this space.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets.","Scot Ciccarelli","You guys did talk about seeing some slower traffic trends from lower credit quality customers last quarter as well. With more time to analyze your data and any kind of surveys you're doing, do you have any more clarity on what may be driving that? I'm trying to figure out, are people kind of disqualifying themselves from even walking in because they know they're going to be declined credit or is this just fewer footsteps coming from a certain portion of the consumer base?","Tom Reedy","Yes. It's difficult to pry all that data apart, Scot. So unfortunately I think we are not going to have a real satisfying answer for you on that. We can really only comment on what we have seen in our stores. One thing we do believe is there is some co-relation between the quality of offer that we are providing in the stores and the application volume because there is word of mouth in the customer space. The quality of offers is currently down year-over-year and has declined over the last several quarters.","Scot Ciccarelli","When you say quality of offer, you're talking about terms?","Tom Reedy","I am talking about the terms, not whether they are approved or not but whether they are approved and need another $1000 down or if there is something else. So what we have observed in the stores is a reduction in those applications, call it the below $600 FICO level and continued increases in the volume of applications on the high end. Now I can't speak to what other people are experiencing but we have seen some communications from other retailers that this particular segment of customers is a bit challenged today. So to the extent that might plan the things that\u2019s there. But when you ask about that and what you might do about it, is we think about hypothesis where we could be driving this it's not apparent to us that there is a course of change in our action in this segment that would be appropriate. Remember, we have always talked about this business as incremental and we already invest $1000 per car into this channel in order to realize half, a third to half of the profit of a tier two or a CAF deal.","So we could speculate that, would our lenders like to see more money from us in order to be more aggressive. I am sure they would say they would try. But I don\u2019t think we are interested in increasing the, or decreasing our margin any further on this space and we are certainly not interested in increasing prices to subsidize our tier 3 partners. That\u2019s just not good business for us. I think the investments Bill discussed in our online capabilities and customer experience are a high priority for us and looking at the business absent the effects of the tier 3 space, we are pretty pleased with the momentum we see at the 8% comps. And in the longer-term growing off the base of 45% CAF and 10% tier 3, is a much more profitable equation than when we were seeing tier 3 in your 20% a couple of years ago.","So I don\u2019t know what it makes of the overall environment but like I said, I don\u2019t think there is any action or course we would change to try to address the phenomena we are seeing.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs.","Matthew Fassler","I've got one question and one follow up, if you'll let me. We talk about traffic and some of the traffic declines. We haven't spoken a lot about the quality of traffic, not in terms of creditworthiness but in terms of how much research consumers have done and one would think that the attachment rate of heavy web research with the transactions growing substantially. So, is traffic as relevant of a metric for you? That could be a function of why, that could be why your conversion is rising the way it is. So should we even be looking at traffic at this moment in time? I realize it's a good legacy metric, but it doesn't seem to be aligning with your comps and perhaps that's the reason why.","Bill Nash","No. Matt, I think that\u2019s a good point. I think we know that nine out of ten of our customers that are buying from us start their shopping experience online. And they are coming in with better research already having been done. I think for us store traffic is still important and to your point, it has been kind of a legacy metric for us but I think equally important is we need to be looking at web traffic, we need to be looking at leads. Leads are highly, in the past they have been highly co-related to sales. So I think you have to step back and take more of a holistic picture and not just look at traffic. Because I do think part of the reason conversion is up, I think it's from execution, but I also think it's partly because people are coming in more informed and knowing what they want.","Matthew Fassler","My follow up relates to cut and stop sale. All independent used car retailers are operating, I believe, with less restriction than franchise dealers, at least when it relates to the brands associated with, that those dealers typically sell. Are you getting a sense that this is taking your share higher? Are more customers coming to you because they can't get access to the cars they want at the franchise dealers?","Bill Nash","No. I mean that\u2019s really a hard thing to come out and I would say we believe that we are not necessarily getting some big benefit from that. We are real proud of the transparency that we have when it comes to recalls. We have led the industry. If you shop online, you will see, you will get the ability to check them into Web site to see if there is any open recalls. When you come in the stores, you can't buy a car without working through the sales consultant to understand, are there any open recalls on these vehicles and if they are signing off on those recalls. So we feel good about that. And to your point, there are lots of other dealers out there selling vehicles with open recalls. I just think that we do it in the most transparent way.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Craig Kennison with Baird.","Craig Kennison","Bill, you mentioned that CarMax covers about 65% of the addressable U.S. market today. But with your opportunity to invest in some of your digital initiatives, could the pace of investment in those bricks and mortar stores slow in some of the out years?","Bill Nash","So, Craig, what we said and we will probably update this later on, but we are still committed to the national expansion. We have got 13 to 16 stores planned next year. Certainly I think as we go forward, we will look at the design of the stores and the design of the prototypes may change but at this point we are still committed to building brick and mortar facilities.","Craig Kennison","And just as a follow up. How many states will allow you to use home delivery as part of that new service you've piloted?","Bill Nash","Yes. I don\u2019t know that off the top of my head, Craig. I would have to get back to you on that. With your earlier question, the other thing I would just reiterate is we think that the advantage for us will be, as we look forward it's going to be a combination of having that store presence but then also being able to do the transactions online and being able to combine those two. And I think to be ultimately successful, or as successful as I think we can be, we need to do both of those really well. Well, that\u2019s why we are still committed to building out facilities.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Murphy with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","John Murphy","Good morning, guys. Just wanted to touch on SG&A because it seemed like a pretty good performance in the quarter. I mean when we back out the increase in stock comp, there really wasn't much deleveraging and we're looking at a store base that's almost 11% greater year-over-year. We're looking at investment in online opportunities and all your new efforts, yet we're not seeing a deleveraging in SG&A. So just curious, as we think about all the buckets of potential increases in deleveraging that we usually would expect, how are they playing out in SG&A and how do you think that should work going forward because it really is a very impressive performance. There really was no SG&A deleverage and traditionally we would look for like a 7% to 8% increase in same store sales to see this kind of performance and you put up a good number, 3.1%, but I mean it's not what we would have expected. It was a very good performance. Is there anything going on here in thrifting in certain areas or investment that might not be as great as we're thinking?","Tom Reedy","John, this is Tom. One think I would point out is something we called that in the release, is that there is some other favorable things going on with regard to incentive comp in this quarter that were larger than what we have seen in prior quarters. And it's relatively in line, I mean that stock-based comp was up quite a bit. But if you look at that and then the full year adjustment, they're of similar magnitude. So I wouldn't read into this that we're doing a better job with SG&A than we had been in the past. We're investing comp and benefits. If you look at those two things, absent those two things, is in line with that, the 11% you see on the table in the graph. Store occupancy is up in line with our growth of stores. So there's nothing really to talk about there. Advertising looks light relative to last year, but that's because last year we were in the midst of creating a new ad campaign that rolled out in Q3. So, both Q2 and Q3 last year were heavy ad spend.","Bill Nash","And John, the only thing I'd add to that, I mean we still feel like we can leverage at the mid-single digit comps and to Tom Reedy's point, we're continuing to invest in some of the technologies, in the digital experiences that I talked about earlier. Now that being said, we have an SG&A on a yearly basis over $1 billion and we're certainly focused on continuing to look at opportunities and continuing to do things better to continue to leverage more in the future.","John Murphy","So maybe to put a finer point on it, you would say that roughly something in the 5% to 7.5% range on same store sales comps would be enough to create some small leverage on SG&A, given all the efforts that are going on right now?","Bill Nash","I think that's fair. I...","Tom Reedy","We see some leverage at mid-single digit. 7% is pretty big. Once you start getting above that fulcrum of leverage, it gets pretty powerful. So I would say 7%, we feel pretty good.","John Murphy","Okay. So, 5% plus or minus is breakeven and as we get above that there's potential for some really good operating leverage to kick in?","Tom Reedy","And I'd just use that as a rule of thumb. We haven't dusted that off.","John Murphy","That's incredibly helpful. Just one quick follow-up. We see rates ratchet up on the cost side on CAF. You guys increased the cost to the consumer, I think, 20 bps. What is your comfort level in passing through the cost increase through to the customer so we don't see spreads sort of on a continuous basis, compress?","Tom Reedy","Yes. I think we're constantly testing at CAF, both up and down, depending on what we're seeing in the marketplace. And I think I've said this before on calls, the performance of the finance business is going to be somewhat market driven. We have to be an attractive alternative for our customers in financing or else we'd be turning people off to CarMax. So, if competition is aggressive and willing to accept a slightly lower spread than they are currently, we will have to adjust our offers over time to meet that competition and make sure that we're still relevant to the customer.","That said, if you look at the last eight or nine securitization deals, the spread has been pretty consistent in the mid-5s. And that's not out of line with what we've seen in higher interest rate environment. So like I said, we've been in higher interest rate environments before where cost of funds have been higher, where we've been able to achieve the spreads we are today. What's really the wild card is competition and how aggressive they get. And like I said, we'll have to be a market player, and that's just part of being in the finance business.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rod Lache with Deutsche Bank.","Rod Lache","Two questions. One is, there have been a few anecdotal reports, I think Experian and a few others, talking about a trend of consumers shifting from the new market to the used market, just given the inflation that's occurred in new car pricing. And I was wondering if this is something that you're observing and whether that you feel is a trend that could be quite meaningful? Obviously, seeing 8% comps in the prime side of things might support that.","Bill Nash","Yes. I have not heard that. I hope it's the case but I think part of what's helping is the prices of wholesale vehicles have gone down. Our ASP went down slightly. I think it's a factor of -- part of it's a shift from the zero to four to a little bit older vehicle for us. Part of it is the cheaper acquisition price as well, with a little offset in the fact that our large SUVs as a percent of mix are a little bit higher, a couple of points higher than they were a year ago. But I have not heard what you're referencing.","Rod Lache","Okay. Thanks. And just, I guess, a follow-up on CAF. It's been a relatively modest increase in provisions but just in terms of the trends that you're observing, is the decline mostly a function of frequency or is it severity as you're seeing some modest declines in used car prices?","Bill Nash","I think what we observed is a little bit of both. Last quarter it was a little bit more severity. So, if you look at kind of recovery rate year over year, it was more impactful last quarter. But at the end of the day, we've just got to keep an eye on both of them and we watch what's happening in the portfolio and we can adjust as we go.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Montani with Evercore ISI.","Michael Montani","I wanted to ask first, if I could, can you just give an update on SUV and truck penetration this quarter versus a year ago? And then just talk about your ability to source between those buckets and toggle between them as prices soften a little bit.","Bill Nash","Yes. So SUVs for us was up about 2 points. I think it was 25% of our mix, which is about 2 points higher than a year ago. And again, we're out in the market every week, every day, buying cars, and if we feel like they're at a good price, we're certainly going to buy them if that's what the customers are demanding. We want to make sure it's a good price. Again, we sell what the consumer demand is on our lot. So as prices shift, that's pretty much standard operating procedure for us. We're able to go in and take advantage of those offers.","Michael Montani","If I could just follow up on some of the online initiatives that you have, one question there is what you're seeing in particular if you can share, Bill, around the rollout of home delivery that's encouraging and making you expand it? And then the second question was, when you look at search engine optimization, if I do a Google search for used cars, you all are coming up on page four. And it just doesn't make sense to me. So I guess the question is, what kind of priority do you assign to search engine optimization and moving up that non-paid list on Google?","Bill Nash","Right. So on the home delivery, if you remember, we did a very limited test back in February and the goal of that test was really to see, does this resonate with our customers. And we felt like there is enough interest at the customer level that we decided to, okay, let's look at this, try to operationalize a little bit better and we had talked about coming back with a second test. It's really too early to give you any results because we just started the second test, just in the last couple weeks. And, again, the plan for this test is to understand, have we been able to operationalize it better, can we operationalize it even more. And then, really important to that also, is that we want to make sure that the experience meets our high standards of great customer service that we have in the stores. So that's really what we're trying to understand with this piece. It's too early to really talk about any type of results.","On the search engine optimization, obviously a big part of the web redesign is making sure that when customers search for us, that we come up organically. That's the best thing. When you don't have to pay for a lead and you just automatically come up on the first page. And what I can tell you, if I look at over a year ago, about a year ago if you searched for us in some generic terms we didn't show up on the first page. We were in some cases several pages below the first page. And if you search for something, you typically don't go many pages past the first page. I'm pleased to tell you that we've made great strides. And when you type in key words now, we're on that first page and our goal is to continue to climb that first page. So, we're encouraged by the results and the progress that we've made since we've been working on it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brett Hoselton with KeyBanc.","Irina Hodakovsky","This is actually Irina Hodakovsky on for Brett Hoselton. How are you? Most of the questions have been asked. I do want to ask a basic question on the share buyback. In your release you stated you have $1.89 billion remaining open. Last quarter your release stated $1.27 billion. Has there been an increase and what should we expect going forward?","Tom Reedy","Yes, I think, our board authorized a $750 million increase last quarter and they also took off the time limitations on the program. So I think the message there is it's become a part of what we do. As far as on a go forward basis, we talked about having a target capital structure in the adjusted debt to capital range of 35% to 45%. Both last quarter and this quarter we're scratching up on the bottom end of that. And as I said last quarter, I think you can look to be more in a maintenance mode rather than a shifting the capital structure mode on a go forward basis.","That said, with the cash flow nature of the business as it stands today, we'll continue to generate significant cash and we would expect to continue to buy back stock and continue to add debt to maintain those targets. And as we've said before, we try to do a little bit of an enlightened averaging in. So I wouldn't read into volume in any given quarter. It may be dictated by our view on valuation versus where things are.","Irina Hodakovsky","What is the new updated expiration date on the program?","Tom Reedy","As I said, they eliminated the expiration feature of the program.","Irina Hodakovsky","Oh, eliminated, I'm sorry. I didn't hear that correctly.","Tom Reedy","It's part of what we do now and we expect to be in the market maintaining the capital structure.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Albertine with Consumer Edge.","Jamie Albertine","I just wanted to understand if there were any changes from an inventory management perspective as it relates to when a vehicle's VIN would go in and out of your system as it's perceived on the web. Whether it's related to transfers across stores or if it's always a sale, or if it has something to do with recalls. Just wanted to get some underpinnings as to what may be driving the shifts in inventory we might be seeing from a web [indiscernible] perspective intra-quarter. Thanks.","Bill Nash","Yes. We haven't changed any of our practices or processes or behaviors. So I really can't speak to that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rick Nelson with Stephens.","Rick Nelson","I have a question about wholesale operation. The participants in those auctions, the independent used car lots, how dependent on subprime finance do you think those independents are?","Bill Nash","Yes, Rick, I think they're probably more dependent than a franchise dealer, but some of them finance themselves. It's really hard to say.","Tom Reedy","This is Tom. One thing I'd point out also, and I can't speak for the practice at all of those customers, but they do usually as a matter of course, have the ability to change the price that they charge the customer. So to the extent it's getting more challenging in subprime and their vendors may be asking for more money up front, they have more flexibility to do it than we would in our fixed price system. So the answer is, we don't know and I think it's across the board but there are some levers that they may pull that we certainly wouldn't.","Bill Nash","And I think that phenomenon exists even with other franchise dealers.","Rick Nelson","Okay. Thank you for that. Is all the decline in the tier 3 at all due to the tier 2 dipping into that tier 3 bucket? I know you've discussed that in the past.","Tom Reedy","I think in past quarters we've observed that. Tier 2 is clearly, from the data we look at, clearly behaving more aggressively, which is great for us, than they were a year ago, and when we look at conversion of the applications that they're seeing. So that would de facto be another thing that impacts the volume that tier 3 is seeing. But as I mentioned, tier 2 is down a little bit as well, just because of the overall mix shift. So, while they're behaving more aggressively and they're doing a great job for us and we're happy with the partners we have in that space, less is filtering down to them because more of it is getting caught by the high end credit and CAF.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities.","Seth Basham","Thanks a lot and good morning. My first question is a little bit more broader on the wholesale business. With wholesale gross profit down 10% year-over-year, obviously you had a calendar shift. But are there any other things you can point to which led to that decline and how do you think it's going to perform going forward?","Tom Reedy","Yes. So if you look at the wholesale margin GPU, I called out earlier in my remarks, it's a very tough comparison. When I say tough comparison, last year's second quarter was the highest GPU for wholesale we've ever experienced as an organization, so -- I'm sorry, in the second quarter. So, it was a very tough comparison. I think what you're seeing is the amount that we're at now is more representative of a typical second quarter. The other thing that I would point out is, last year's second quarter from a depreciation or appreciation standpoint, it was really stable. This year it was a depreciating market and you know we aren't proactive, we're more reactive and we move as the market moves. We don't speculate. So I think it's a combined factor of tough comparison and also a different type of market this second quarter, which really is more representative of what we would typically see in the second quarter versus last year.","Seth Basham","Got it. Okay, that's helpful. And then a follow up question, Bill. The company has had a practice of trying to maintain gross profit per unit pretty flattish for the last five years or so. How do you think about the balancing of comps versus GPU going forward?","Bill Nash","Yes. I've been involved with the organization for a long time and we've held that $2,100 to $2,200 pretty consistent for multiple quarters. Like we've talked about in the past, we're always willing and we're always trying, if you give up a little bit of margin, do you make it up more in sales, so that your total GPU or total gross profit goes up. We'll continue to test. But I also feel good about the fact that we're able to maintain that GPU. And as I think about levers to pull, if we want to make sure our price stays competitive, it's not just GPU, it's also acquisition price and it's also about the dollars that you put into a vehicle to get it to our quality standards. So again, I think our focus is going to be on acquisition price, it will be on the reconditioning, because again we're more focused on the spread between what we buy a car and what a customer ultimately pays for it. And we think that we feel good about where the margin is right now. We'll continue to test, obviously, but we're really focused on acquisition cost and the amount that we put into it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Bottiglieri with Wolfe Research.","Chris Bottiglieri","So SUV and truck mix was up pretty considerably. That should have driven ASPs higher. I'm not sure what you said about late model vehicles, the zero to fours, if those increased or not at the penetration level. I guess taking that together, your ASPs were actually down year-over-year. So, do we read into that, that you took a price investment this quarter? That being said, you held your GPU per unit even though your wholesale acquisition cost per unit seemed to increase. I'm just trying to triangulate all of that. Like what's the takeaway from all of that?","Tom Reedy","Yes. Chris, earlier I mentioned, while our mix was up slightly in the large SUVs, and you're right, that would drive the average ASP up a little bit. But we more than offset that with the fact that we had a mix shift. We didn't sell as many zero to four as we did last year, zero to four year old cars. This year we sold a few percentage points more in the older vehicles and those are typically less expensive. And the other thing that I would point out, that I spoke about earlier was we saw a cheaper acquisition price and that's reflective of what's going on or what went on in the market during the second quarter. So, it's really a combination of those three factors to get us down to a lower ASP.","Chris Bottiglieri","Okay. That makes sense. And then on tier 2, I'm not sure if you guys disclosed this historically, but what percentage of those loans would you say are subprime by FICO standards, like less than 620? I think you called [intentional] [ph] a slight pullback there.","Bill Nash","A majority of them.","Chris Bottiglieri","Majority of tier 2.","Bill Nash","Yes. I think, like I said before, I think subprime can be in the eye of the beholder.","Chris Bottiglieri","Yes, I agree.","Bill Nash","CAF, a wide spectrum of folks and FICO score is not the only indicator that lenders use to determine creditworthiness and whether they're going to advance. So some of what CAF does falls into that lower end. A good amount of tier 2 falls into that lower end and clearly all of tier 3, unless there is something really funny about the deal, fall into that lower end of the FICO. So as I said, tier 2s, their volume has been impacted but their behavior we're very happy with.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Armstrong with CL King.","Bill Armstrong","You took out a new $100 million warehouse facility for CAF tier 3 financing. Does this portend, perhaps, an appetite with CAF for more tier 3 lending or should we not really read anything into this?","Tom Reedy","I guess the short answer is, I would not read anything into this. As I discussed a little bit earlier, we are comfortable with our current level of activity and have no intentions at this time to change that. That said, like we want to learn about the space. We think it's good to build a track record on the financing side and I would rather use that capital to buy back stock and build new stores than fund the subprime initiative. So it makes sense, even though it's a small amount, it makes sense to take out debt against it because we can use third party capital.","Bill Armstrong","Got it. And would you be -- you wouldn't be securitizing this, you would just keep these loans in the warehouse facility and work through it like that?","Tom Reedy","Well, the warehouse legally is a securitization. So it's a non-recourse facility just like the warehouse for the core business but I think at this point we're comfortable with what we're doing. To the extent it ever got bigger, then we'd start contemplating permanent financing vehicles but we're not anywhere near that at this point.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paresh Jain with Morgan Stanley.","Paresh Jain","Just a question on superstores. When you look at some of your peers, particularly on the franchise front, they're increasingly moving to a smaller store format. Can you remind us again as to what the relative advantages of a superstore are in today's environment?","Bill Nash","Well, Paresh, what I would tell you is, I actually haven't heard the superstore name in a long time. We used to have what we called superstores. The mix of stores today are dramatically different than they were even 10, 15 years ago. And when I look at our stores today, we have small format stores which has been introduced in the last five years. We also have satellite stores that don't have production. We have satellite stores with production. We have bigger production stores and then typical size CarMax stores. So, I think what you've seen over time with us is that we've shifted our prototypes and our models depending on the market that we're going in and we don't open up just one standard store size.","Tom Reedy","I think I'd add to that is, when we go into a market, no matter what kind, we're taking into account what our expectations are for sales volume in that location, which means how much inventory we need and also whether there's going to need to be an auction production. It's a bigger puzzle and it might involve various locations, and we try to flex the size of the space to the need that we view is in that particular market. As Bill said, we've got a number of smaller prototypes now than we did several years ago.","Paresh Jain","Understood. And just a follow-up on home delivery. When you look at some of the new entrants in this space, customer acquisition costs could be significantly higher, perhaps more than double the $200 to $250 range that you guys might be seeing. Is that something you'd be comfortable with to gain traction for that business or take it up a little bit higher than what your current range is?","Bill Nash","Yes. That's one of the reasons why we're testing it. We want to make sure that it resonates. We're talking about probably a very small subset of CarMax customers that would take advantage of this. We still think about how complicated the used car transaction is and how it needs human intervention, which we do a phenomenal job in our stores. Again, it's a test for us and we'll give you more updates in the future.","Tom Reedy","It's too early to talk about whether it would be worth the additional cost because we need to scope what those additional costs would be and vet that out more significantly, and also determine how much incrementality there would be in that particular segment. We think it's much too early to tell.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of David Whiston with Morningstar.","David Whiston","You touched on this a little bit earlier. I just still wasn't clear. Any idea why your zero to four year old mix fell despite there being less traffic from the lower credit quality customers? Is there a bit of a supply issue there?","Bill Nash","No, there is not a supply issue. Again, we're meeting the demands of our customers and if our customers are looking for more older vehicles that are less expensive, then we're going to meet that need. So, it's more driven off of the customer need than any supply issue.","David Whiston","Okay. Thanks. And, Bill, now that you've had some time to travel around the store base a bit, is there anything you want to change or improve about the operations or the company as a whole?","Bill Nash","No. Like I said earlier, I'm really excited and proud of what our associates do on a daily basis. Their job is not an easy job. And when I go out to the store, I see improvements. I see dedication to the company. I see everybody looking to figure out, how can we execute better and do our jobs better and provide a better customer experience to our customers? So, no, I think it's going great.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs.","Matthew Fassler","Thanks for having me back for a couple of follow-ups. The other overhead line within SG&A was up meaningfully. Is that technology investment or is something else showing up in that line item?","Tom Reedy","The bulk of that, you've hit it right on the head, the bulk of it is investment in technology and digital.","Matthew Fassler","Is that likely to persist directionally?","Tom Reedy","Yes, we're going to continue to invest in that. And to my point earlier, we spend over $1 billion. So our job is to make sure that we refocus some of that money, so it's not all incremental. But, yes, we will continue to invest in this.","Matthew Fassler","And then, secondly, you've spoken a bit about zero to four and the age of cars that you're selling. I want to try to tie that in to the sources of used cars coming back onto the market. Presumably with the SAAR stabilizing or even slowing somewhat, transactions emanating from consumers buying new cars are flattening out or moderating but the institutional supply of cars coming off lease, I think, continues to grow. Are more of the cars that are hitting the market in that zero to four coming through auction rather than through trade in the marketplace at large? And is that one of the factors that, given your desire to maintain self sufficiency at a fairly high rate, is that one of the factors that could be impacting what you're selling? And, if so, does that impact profitability at all? It doesn't seem to be doing so, yes, but just to play that out.","Bill Nash","No, I don't think there's any big meaningful difference that we've seen through the appraisaling or through the auctions as it relates to zero to four. I do think we're a little surprised we haven't seen more of it funnel back. But, again, to my point earlier, we think that that's coming and it will be over multiple years. It certainly won't come back all at one time. And when we talk to our auction partners they agree that there's probably a lot that will be coming back next year and even the year after.","Operator","That's our last question. I'd like to turn the call back over to the presenters for any closing remarks.","Bill Nash","Great. Thank you, Victoria. In closing, again, I just want to thank all of our associates nationwide. They're doing an outstanding job delivering an incredible customer experience every day. We would not be the successful company we are today without our associates and their dedication to the customer. We have a long runway of growth ahead of us. No one is in a better position than we are to continue to give the customers the best car buying experience online or in the store and we look forward to the opportunity to continue to lead the used car retailing industry. Thanks for your interest in CarMax and your support and we will talk again next quarter.","Operator","Again, thank you for your participation.

Thanks.","Tom?","Tom Folliard","Thank you, Katharine. Good morning everyone. Thanks for joining the call today. ","As you saw, we had a record second quarter due to the continued growth in our store base and solid performances in used and wholesale unit sales, as well as CarMax auto finance. Here are some of the key highlights for the quarter: used unit comps increased by 4.6% and total used units rose by 9.2%. Gross profit per unit was flat at $21.66 compared to $21.73 in the second quarter of last year. Total wholesale units grew by 8.7% partially driven by one more auction date in the quarter compared to last year. Without the additional day of auctions, wholesale units would have grown about 5%. Gross profit per wholesale unit of $951 grew nearly 9% compared to $874 in the second quarter of last year, and CAF income grew 6% to approximately $98 million.","I\u2019ll turn it over to Tom to give you some more details on finance. Tom?","Tom Reedy","Thanks Tom. Good morning everybody. As Tom mentioned, CAF income grew 6.2% compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2015, and average managed receivables grew by 16% to $9 billion, or just under $9 billion. The weighted average contract rate - the rate charged to customers - was at 7.2%, up slightly from last year\u2019s second quarter of 7.0%. Our allowance for loan losses grew to about $88 million or 0.96% of managed receivables. CAF net penetration was 42.7%, half a point of which came from loans originated under our sub-prime test. That compares with 40.7% in last year\u2019s second quarter, of which 0.6% related to loans originated under that test. Net loan dollars originated in the quarter rose 14% to $1.3 billion due to a combination of CarMax unit sales growth and higher penetration at CAF. Finally, during the second quarter we repurchased 3.9 million shares for about $250 million.","Tom?","Tom Folliard","Thank you. This quarter, our comp unit sales were driven by improved conversion achieved by our store teams. Our total web traffic increased nearly 12% compared to the same period last year, and now approximately 65% of our visits are coming from something other than a laptop or a desktop. As for our sales mix this quarter, zero to four-year-old vehicles increased by 5% to 79% of our total sales, and SUVs and trucks were down slightly from 24% to 22% compared to last year\u2019s second quarter.","For SG&A, excluding the $21 million reduction in last second quarter\u2019s SG&A due to the receipt of legal settlement proceeds, SG&A for this second quarter increased approximately 4% to $331 million. Contributing to this growth was the addition of 16 stores since the beginning of second quarter last year, partially offset by a decrease of $10.5 million in share-based compensation expense. On a per-unit basis, excluding the settlement gain, SG&A decreased $100 to $2,083. The stock-based compensation expense decrease accounted for $78 of that leverage.","During the second quarter, we opened four stores, three in existing markets: one in Providence and two in Denver, and a small format store in Tallahassee, which is a new market for CarMax. After the second quarter ended, we opened two more stores, our sixth store in the Houston market and our second store in Minneapolis, and we also relocated our Rockville, Maryland store to its new larger location in Gaithersburg. ","Also during the quarter, we notified Nissan that we would terminating our new car franchise at White Marsh, which is just outside of Baltimore, and we notified Chrysler that we would be terminating our new car franchise at our Norcross store in Atlanta. Both terminations will become effective in the third quarter. ","With that, we\u2019d be happy to take your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions]","Your first question comes from the line of Brian Nagel of Oppenheimer. ","Brian Nagel","Hi, good morning. ","Tom Folliard","Hi Brian.","Brian Nagel","So my question, I wanted to focus on the used car unit comp. If I look at the number, in my view, the 4.6% you put in was very respectable given what we\u2019re seeing elsewhere from other dealers, or even other retailers. But Tom, as you look at the data, so maybe take a step back from the data, and you had a 4.6 here in Q2, a 4.9 in Q1, and it was only a few quarters before that used car unit comps are tracking upwards of--you know, in the upper single digits. Is there something to explain as you look at the data this kind of downshift we\u2019ve seen in the trend there?","Tom Folliard","You know, Brian, I don\u2019t know that there\u2019s something to explain. We have very big stores, average volume of 320 cars a month. I\u2019m very pleased with a 4.6% comp in one of our--you know, the first and second quarter are our two highest volume quarters of the year. At the same time, we\u2019re building stores, continuing to refine our model, continuing to develop our website and our apps so our customers have a better experience, and our store teams continue to execute very, very well. So you know, I don\u2019t spend too much time--we don\u2019t spend too much time trying to analyze a couple of points here or there in a quarter when you\u2019re building a business over a very long period of time, so we\u2019re very pleased with the performance of the business in the quarter.","Brian Nagel","Got it. If I can just follow up on that, as we think about--I mean, partially you\u2019ve already answered this, but as we think about the third and fourth quarters, where the comparisons at least on a single-year basis get more difficult, is that something that you manage around in any way?","Tom Folliard","You know, as you know, we don\u2019t give any guidance, any forward-looking guidance, but I will tell you that when we look at the business each year and over a long period of time, a lot of our trending analysis is going to take into account whatever the factors were in the years prior. So it matters what the comps were the year before, but it only matters in our forecasting at the beginning of the year.","Brian Nagel","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt Nemer of Wells Fargo Securities.","Matt Nemer","Morning everyone.","Tom Folliard","Hi Matt.","Matt Nemer","So just to follow up on Brian\u2019s question, I\u2019m just curious if the later Labor Day holiday this year potentially impacted the result. I would assume--it looked like August was a bit of a tougher month from a unit standpoint for the auto industry and that some of those sales had shifted to September.","Tom Folliard","You know, it\u2019s possible, but we don\u2019t really look at it--I mean, we don\u2019t really think of it in that level of detail. To me, Labor Day was in the third quarter last year and it was in the third quarter this year, so the only real difference would be the Saturday and Sunday of Labor Day compared to the year prior. So there might have been something in there, but we don\u2019t really consider it. We don\u2019t consider it to be any factor in the quarter, or we maybe would have called it out.","Matt Nemer","Okay, that\u2019s fair. Then just as a follow-up, your advertising expense was up about 18% year-over-year. Combined with the recent NFL affiliations, I\u2019m just wondering if this signals a change in strategy and perhaps we could see some higher ad expense per vehicle on a go-forward basis.","Tom Folliard","You know, our sales are up a little over 9%, so if we had just flat advertising per car, the expense would have been up 9%. It was up 18%. A good portion of the difference between those two is we actually had ad production during the quarter, and we did not have ad production during the quarter last year. That\u2019s a big chunk of it. ","Another big chunk of it is we\u2019ve outsourced our media buying, so some of those dollars have just moved from one bucket to the other, where we used to have that not in SG&A but in corporate overhead. So there\u2019s not really much to read into in terms of this quarter.","In terms of the affiliations with sports teams, we have gotten bigger. We are entering some big metro markets, but none of that expense would have really showed up in the second quarter because they are only starting now. We have a big launch in Denver, as you know. We have two stores that we had prior to this year, we added two more. We have a fifth store in Colorado Springs - that\u2019s a big market for us. ","In terms of New England and the Boston market, we have two stores in the Hartford market, we have two stores in the Providence, Rhode Island market. In December of this year, we\u2019ll launch Boston officially and we\u2019ll have three stores, one in Danvers, one in Norwood, and one in Westborough. We\u2019re continuing to look at sites. We own a site in Portland, Maine. We\u2019re looking in Manchester and Nashua, New Hampshire, so when we think about New England as a broad market, we have a huge investment coming there over the next several years, and as you know, Matt, Boston is a little bit of a sports town and you really have to try and connect with your customer base. I think that affiliating yourself with at least one of the sports teams is something you need to do. We also just announced a partnership with University of Minnesota as we\u2019re opening up the Minneapolis market, where we opened up our second store there. ","So we\u2019ve done some sports marketing in the past. I think this got a little bit more press because it was a little bit bigger, but as a company we\u2019ve gotten a lot bigger too.","Matt Nemer","Sounds good. Looks like based on your store openings that either the Raiders or the 49ers are going to be next.","Tom Folliard","Well, the Raiders beat the Ravens, so maybe they\u2019re not as bad as everyone thinks.","Matt Nemer","Thanks again.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Aram Rubinson of Wolfe Research.","Aram Rubinson","Hey guys, good morning. Can you give us a little bit of the lay of the land of new competitors as you see it, and also kind of where you sit and handicap yourself on your own ecommerce capabilities, your internet site? What again are the capabilities that you believe you\u2019ve got that are virtuous to you, and what capabilities do you really need to still work on and when do you think you\u2019re going to start attacking some of those? ","Tom Folliard","So I don\u2019t know that we have anything that\u2019s just virtuous to us where nobody else can do it. It\u2019s a free market, and what we are trying to do is make sure our customers can do as much of the transaction as they want to do from home. We\u2019ve definitely seen the sentiment shift where customers are looking to do more and more research, more and more pieces of the transaction from home, and in some cases the entire transaction from home. Our current capabilities are our customer can obviously do all kinds of inventory searches. We have 50,000 cars online - I think that\u2019s a huge competitive advantage for us, is the selection of inventory and the ability to transfer our cars at the customer\u2019s request, and as you know, Aram, that\u2019s about a third of our total sales. ","We also give the customer the ability to put a car on hold. We give the customer the ability to transfer a car. If it\u2019s a paid transfer, they can do it with a credit card without speaking to anybody and have that car transferred to the store of their choice. They can fill out a big chunk of the paperwork from home. We have tested online credit applications, and we are continuing to enhance our capabilities there.","We\u2019ve seen some start-ups and some smaller competitors that are doing kind of beginning-to-end transactions online. I don\u2019t think anybody is in a better position than we are to be able to do those things, and those are some of the things that we\u2019ll continue to work on and continue to evaluate as our business grows. But I think we have a bunch of significant advantages. The one I mentioned which I think is the most significant is the selection of inventory that we have and the ability to transfer it. As a company, last year we moved 2 million cars. We sold 600,000, but cars moving from store to store, moving from auction to store, we moved over 2 million cars. We have a very extensive network of and ability to move cars very quickly at the customer\u2019s request.","But I think we need to keep working on our app, we need to keep working on our capabilities, and we need to make sure we stay out in front of the consumer and give them the capability to do what they want to do from home.","Aram Rubinson","Thanks Tom.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sharon Zackfia of William Blair.","Sharon Zackfia","Hi, good morning. Two questions, I guess. Tom, there are a lot of investors that seem to be concerned about off-lease vehicles and what\u2019s going to happen there, and that this time might be different than prior years where there were a lot of off-lease vehicles. Can you kind of give us your perspective on how CarMax has done in years where there have been a lot of off-lease vehicles coming up, and whether or not your ability to procure those vehicles is any different than it would have been, say, 10 years ago?","Tom Folliard","Yeah, that\u2019s a good question, Sharon. I don\u2019t remember exactly, because remember that the supply comes back two, three years after the lease rate is at whatever it is. Right now, it\u2019s pretty high - I think it\u2019s in the high 20s as a percent of new car sales. I\u2019ve always said before, cars tend to come back whether they are leased or sold, not totally predictable but at a somewhat predictable rate as the years roll forward. When it\u2019s a very high lease percentage, it\u2019s kind of more predictable, so if there\u2019s a bunch of leases going out now, if it\u2019s almost 30% of new cars sales, two years out, three years out we\u2019re going to see a lot of leases coming back. They tend to be a lot more organized at the auction, maybe even a little bit easier for us to have access to.","In terms of our capabilities, we are much more organized today than we were 10 years ago. We\u2019re much more analytical about the way we approach car buying at the auction, and I think we\u2019re in a better position today to optimize the inventory that we acquire at the auction because of all the analytics that we\u2019ve put into it and all the digital capabilities that we\u2019ve given our buyers. Our buyers are now all using tablets at the auctions. We\u2019re tracking every single car that a buyer at CarMax looks at at the auction and deciding whether or not that car is worthy, and then the next time a buyer goes to the auction, they don\u2019t have to look at that same car and we\u2019re saving an enormous amount of time in evaluating cars at the auction. We have all the auctions on a program where the CarMax buyers are buying under one kind of generic card, and we can analytically decide where those cars go later. ","If you back up 10 or 15 years, we used to buy on a store-by-store basis, so I\u2019m really pleased with the progress we\u2019ve made in our ability to analyze and purchase inventory, and then I think--I really do think that leasing provides a more organized way because you\u2019ll see a lot of the big leasing companies will run hundreds and hundreds of cars a week on a very regular basis at the auction, and it\u2019s pretty predictable and we have the ability to look at that inventory in advance and decide which ones we are or are not going to bid on. ","Sharon Zackfia","Okay, great. Then a question for the other Tom - obviously the leverage on SG&A this quarter was largely related to the share-based comp decline. Can you talk about in the back half of the year what kind of comp you need to hold your SG&A? ","Tom Reedy","I think what we\u2019ve talked about in the past, Sharon, is we need kind of a mid-single digit comp to get SG&A leverage. If you look at this quarter, I think we levered about $23 if you back out the stock-based comp. There is some timing going on there, so I feel like at the comps we\u2019re at this quarter, we are right at the inflection point or thereabouts. When I say some timing, I think there is some favorability in prior years that I wouldn\u2019t give us a huge amount of credit for leveraging this quarter. So we\u2019re still in growth mode, I think we\u2019re still in the same mind that we need comps about this or a little north of it to get meaningful leverage.","Sharon Zackfia","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Craig Kennison of Baird. ","Craig Kennison","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. It\u2019s a regulatory question. I\u2019m curious if the government were to pass some law requiring CarMax to fix recalls, would you be able to seek reimbursement from the OEM in the same way that a franchise dealer would?","Tom Folliard","The way we would do it is the cars would go to the franchise dealer, and the franchise dealer would fix them under warranty and then they would get reimbursed for it, and then we would go back and get the car. We are not authorized to do repairs of any kind that run through the warranty system, and that\u2019s the category that recalls fall under, so for us it would be--we would have to take the car to a franchise dealer where it would repaired, and they would get reimbursed and we would get the car back, but it would be at no cost to us.","Craig Kennison","Got it. Then just following up on that, Volkswagen has a big recall they\u2019ve announced. What\u2019s your exposure overall to Volkswagen vehicles? Thanks. ","Tom Folliard","You know, the Volkswagen, which just came out so we\u2019re really still just evaluating it. It only relates to diesel product. We have about-- I mentioned earlier we have about 50,000 cars online. We have only a couple of hundred diesel products, Volkswagens or Audis, so very, very small.","Craig Kennison","Great, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli of RBC Capital Markets. ","Scot Ciccarelli","Good morning, guys.","Tom Folliard","Hi Scot.","Scot Ciccarelli","Tom, you talked about or highlighted that conversion rates drove the comp. Does that imply that traffic did not contribute to the comp this quarter?","Tom Folliard","It does, and as I\u2019ve said before, Scot, I never focus on one quarter\u2019s traffic or conversion. I always feel like, and it has been true over a very long period of time, I feel like our comps will be driven roughly half and half by traffic increases and conversion increases over time, and that has been true for a very long period of time. I think it will be true going forward, so in any given quarter, and it has happened in the past, our comps could be driven by just traffic increases and no conversion increases, or vice versa. This is a quarter where our store teams did a great job of converting the customers that they had in addition to constantly optimizing our finance offer and all the other things that go into conversion - buying the right product, having it at the right store at the right time. That\u2019s what delivered our comps this quarter.","Scot Ciccarelli","I know you guys don\u2019t typically give a lot of detail regarding kind of trends during the quarter, but taking a look at geography, did you see anything noticeable? I mean, obviously you have a lot of exposure to Texas, for instance, which is starting to have maybe some issues in certain areas just because of all the energy-related exposure there.","Tom Folliard","Yeah, you were right at the beginning, Scot - we don\u2019t give any guidance or trending during the quarter, or market-specific data.","Scot Ciccarelli","All right, you can\u2019t blame a guy for trying. Last question is--","Tom Folliard","It\u2019s probably the eighth or ninth time you\u2019ve asked in 10 years, so.","Scot Ciccarelli","I know. I keep trying, right? Is there anything you could put your finger on that drove the gross profit dollars per unit on the wholesale side? I mean, it was a pretty big spike, and I know there is some natural volatility to that category, but I was just wondering if there was anything you could point to this particular quarter.","Tom Folliard","You know, as I\u2019ve always said, it\u2019s not a--we sell cars to the top bidder, so it\u2019s not a manageable business for us within a very--I mean, it is within a narrow range, obviously, because we\u2019ve been able to do it, but within $50 or so, it kind of comes out the way it does If you look at the first quarter this year, it was, I think, right around $1,000, so we have normally a little seasonal drop in margin per car from the first quarter to the second quarter, and that\u2019s what I would say--I would look at it more sequentially than I would year-over-year. So we came off of $1,000 in the first quarter, and we\u2019re down to $950 in the second quarter. Last year\u2019s sequential drop was a little bit steeper, but I didn\u2019t see anything unusual there.","Scot Ciccarelli","Got you. All right, thanks a lot, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Fassler of Goldman Sachs.","Matthew Fassler","Thanks a lot. Good morning. My primary question relates to SUVs. You disclosed the change in mix. I\u2019m interested in your read on what\u2019s transpiring in pricing in the SUV market, and also whether you think perhaps some of the change in traffic trends would have reflected consumers\u2019 awareness of where you are in the SUV market.","Tom Folliard","Yeah, our sales were down 2% in SUVs and medium SUVs and trucks, so 24% down to 22%. It\u2019s still a really big number for us, so I don\u2019t think traffic had anything to do with it. As you know, we try to manage our inventory based on turns and consumer demand. I don\u2019t view 2% as a very big move, and that\u2019s on a year-over-year basis. It\u2019s still almost a fourth of all of our sales, so still a really big chunk of our sales.","Matthew Fassler","To the extent that that happened during a quarter when for the market more broadly, at least on the new car side so presumably used paralleled this, SUVs gained share within the mix. Is that a function of pricing in that market at a moment when gas prices are down and there\u2019s lots of demand for that product?","Tom Folliard","You know, what I\u2019ve seen in that product is prices have gone up because there\u2019s more demand, so I think the lowering of gas prices has caused some higher prices when you\u2019re looking to buy those cars at auction, but not something that caused it to move meaningfully one way or the other in terms of our sales.","Matthew Fassler","Got it. Then just one quick financial question. On the warranty side, you got dinged a little bit, I guess, by warranty cancellation reversals, some accruals there that hit you. Can you quantify that for us, please?","Tom Reedy","Hey Matt, it\u2019s Tom. That reserve has gotten to be a really big number over time. It\u2019s over $100 million now, and we\u2019re going to have movement in any given quarter as we learn new things about the business. So I don\u2019t think we want to get in the habit of calling out everything that is an adjustment in that line because, frankly, it\u2019s part of life going forward and we don\u2019t want to call it out as a one-timer.","I can tell you, though, margin and penetration in that space are relatively consistent with what we\u2019ve been seeing over the last year, so we\u2019re happy with how the business is going so absent the adjustment, you would have expected to see that line item increase relatively close to where unit growth was.","Tom Folliard","Matt, one additional thing - if you go back a year and a half ago when we had the much bigger reserve, which we announced, called out and talked about, we also said from that point forward we would look at this in a much more granular way on a more frequent basis, so when it\u2019s a reserve the size that Tom mentioned, you could expect us to be looking at it more frequently and probably make adjustments as necessary on a quarterly basis, and unless they are material or something worthy of discussing, it will just be part of us normally running that business.","Matthew Fassler","Got it. Thank you so much.","Tom Folliard","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Irina Hodakovsky of Keybanc.","Irina Hodakovsky","Good morning, everyone. A quick question for you guys on CAF. The income growth slowed substantially sequentially, it was even down. I was wondering if there is anything to point out there, any material changes in the strategy or in terms of the end markets, anything of note?","Tom Reedy","Yeah, I think from the perspective of CAF, it was a straightforward--you know, a boring quarter, which is what we like to see. That means everything is going as expected. If you remember, last quarter and, I believe, the quarter before, we had some adjustments--or not adjustments, but changes in our loss expectations which were favorable and actually boosted income growth in those quarters. This quarter, we\u2019ve seen loss experience come in as expected, right where we booked it, which is how we like to see things. So there\u2019s nothing different going on, it\u2019s just a matter of we\u2019ve seen losses come in exactly as we\u2019d been planning on.","Irina Hodakovsky","Great. There was a lot of detailed discussion in terms of the used vehicles and the trends there and year-over-year comps, and all this other stuff. Can you talk on a broader level any material changes in terms of consumer demand out there? You mentioned a mix shift in SUVs. Do you see demand holding as it was before, slowing down, or anything of note? ","Tom Folliard","Nothing really. If you look at the first quarter and the second quarter, they are very, very similar - a little over 9% total sales growth, so that\u2019s our new stores kicking in about half of the company growth and then comps of 4.5 to 5%. So it looks very similar to the first quarter, nothing of note.","Irina Hodakovsky","Thank you, guys. Congratulations on a strong beat.","Tom Folliard","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rick Nelson of Stephens.","Rick Nelson","Thanks. Can you discuss the sub-prime market, what you\u2019re seeing in terms of appetite from your lenders? I saw the Tier 3 proportion was down sequentially and year-over-year.","Tom Reedy","Yeah, I think the Tier 3 portion was down only very slightly year-over-year, just a couple of tenths of a point. But I think as we mentioned last quarter on the call, we\u2019ve seen pretty consistent behavior from our Tier 3 lenders, and when I say consistent behavior, it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean what percentage of sales are getting done by Tier 3 because they are impacted by what is actually flowing down through the channel and that they\u2019re able to see, so if there is a change in credit mix or if our other Tier 2 lenders are becoming more aggressive, it changes the nature of what they are seeing.","What we look at is their behavior on how many of the applications that they see, they approve, and if they convert, and on those bases we\u2019ve seen pretty consistent behavior. ","Rick Nelson","Got you, and if I could follow up with a question about [indiscernible] now over, say, the non-bank auto finance companies like CarMax. Has there been any changes that you\u2019ve implemented operationally?","Tom Reedy","Sure. The larger participant ruling is out there, and frankly it was nothing of any surprise for us. There is no direct impact on our dealer operations, but as we expected all along, CarMax Auto Finance will be subject to the Bureau\u2019s supervisory authority, and what that means is we\u2019ll be interacting with them in the future, as we were pretty certain.","As far as what we\u2019ve been doing, we\u2019ve been paying careful attention to developments in the industry as we see new announcements and new actions by them. We\u2019ve been assessing our practices as we see what we think are the expectations of the Bureau, and we\u2019ve been working hard to make sure that our compliance and program is up to snuff and will be ready for examination, if and when it comes.","Rick Nelson","Okay, thanks Tom.","Tom Reedy","Sure.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Murphy of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. ","John Murphy","Good morning, guys. Just a follow-up on the same store sales and the showroom traffic. I mean, obviously it sounds like the showroom traffic was pretty stagnant, or up only slightly year-over-year. Tom, what do you think is driving that? I mean, we\u2019re at a point where miles driven is increasing, gas prices are low, rates are low, employment is improving. It just seems like we\u2019re in an environment where showroom traffic for you should really be stepping up. I mean, is there something going on with the relative price of used cars versus new cars? I\u2019m just trying to understand why showroom traffic isn\u2019t up a lot.","Tom Folliard","As I said earlier, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s something you can look at on a quarter to quarter basis and get a true read. Because we have so much traffic both on our website and in our stores, if customers are not visiting as many places as they used to visit before because they\u2019re more prepared before they show up, then that could change the quality of traffic, and that\u2019s just as good as getting more traffic. So there are just so many factors that are involved in there, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any one item that we could point to and say, this is why traffic was up or down in any given quarter. Again, we\u2019re trying to manage it over a much longer period of time. I don\u2019t have a great answer there.","John Murphy","Yeah, it just seems like the factors should be moving for you in the right direction here. Maybe just a second question - as we look at the store openings, obviously you guys are doing a great job there. What would it take to accelerate your plan for store openings? I mean, the business is operating very well, you\u2019re executing on these store openings well. Could you ramp up the pace of openings?","Tom Folliard","We clearly could from a financial standpoint. We are very focused on making operational improvements in our existing stores and growing store base as well, and we don\u2019t want to do one at the expense of the other. Some of the markets that we\u2019re opening and some of the stores that we\u2019re opening in the next couple of years are very big and very complicated. When you think about us opening a big production store in San Francisco, Los Angeles, Boston, Seattle - all markets which we have construction coming in the next few years, they are not just a store that opens and sells a few hundred cars a month. They also recondition in some cases 2,000 cars a month and then run an 800 or 1,000 car a week auction. So we\u2019re starting up really a business within a business when you think about the auctions, and then building a giant reconditioning center in some cases attached, so really one store for us in some cases is very, very complicated. If you look at, as I said, our opening plan over the next several years, we\u2019re going into some pretty big metro markets, building some pretty big, complicated stores, and what we don\u2019t want to do is accelerate the growth pace and say, oh, we opened two more extra stores this year but the ones that we did open, we didn\u2019t open as well and we lost the ability to improve execution.","So I don\u2019t know exactly what the right number is, but I can tell you that at this pace of about a store a month, I feel like it\u2019s a pretty aggressive growth pace and I\u2019m really comfortable that we\u2019re growing the business effectively, and at the same time not losing track of maybe the most important thing, which is improving existing store execution.","John Murphy","Great, that\u2019s very helpful. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rod Lache of Deutsche Bank.","Mike Levin","Good morning, guys. It\u2019s Mike Levin on for Rod. Tom, I remember last quarter, you were a little puzzled by the down year-over-year ASPs. We kind of saw something small similar this quarter. Just wondering if you guys are getting a better handle of what might be going on, or if some of the used car supply might be starting to get better affordability for your consumers, just any kind of a beginning of a trend here.","Tom Folliard","Puzzled is a good word. I think I probably was a little puzzled in the first quarter, but this quarter our ASPs are actually up sequentially, and I think ASPs should be looked at on a sequential basis more than a year-over-year basis. I think it\u2019s the more relevant data point, and I think we\u2019re up $150 from the first quarter to the second quarter. I\u2019m sure that a lot of it for us is mix related. It turned into a much bigger deal at the end of the first quarter last year when we were down by $300. I think people thought it was some type of an indicator of other things in the marketplace, and honestly we just didn\u2019t see it that way, and it hasn\u2019t borne out to be that way. So we manage the business on a per-unit basis, not on a revenue basis, so we don\u2019t really look at it that closely. But coming from the first quarter to the second quarter, we\u2019re up $150, so.","Mike Levin","Got it, okay. Maybe just on CAF, it looks like the collateral spread is starting to stabilize here around 6.2%. Do you guys still feel like that might have a little room to soften from here, or with rates possibly on the rise in the near future, are you getting the ability to raise prices to end consumers at this point?","Tom Reedy","I think the answer to both of those is probably a bit of a yes. You know, it\u2019s going to be a byproduct of where we--what customers are demanding, what the market is for auto loans, and what cost of financing does. We saw our costs on the last deal tick up about 20 basis points, which we see in any given period is not a big deal, but they actually were up relative to the last three deals. We are constantly testing both up and down in different pockets of the business to make sure we\u2019re optimizing what we have available for the customers, and we\u2019re going to manage the spreads at whatever the market will allow us. So hopefully--I tried to answer it, but I think the answer is both. If rates go up and we\u2019re not able to raise APRs, we\u2019d continue to see some compression. If the market allows us to keep that spread there, we\u2019ll do that; but we\u2019re absolutely going to be a competitive lender and be providing excellent opportunities for our customers from a financing perspective.","Tom Folliard","I\u2019d just say if you look at this over a very long period of time, as Tom mentioned, we\u2019re one of the lenders in our store and we have to be competitive, and we also give our customers three business days to go get a better deal somewhere else and they can turn it in with no charge. Generally over time in a raising rate environment, spreads tend to compress, and in an environment where rates are going down, spreads tend to widen. Other than that, we\u2019re not in the business of trying to predict where it\u2019s going to go, but there\u2019s been a lot of talk about cost of funds increasing over time, and we\u2019ll see what happens.","Tom Reedy","Yeah, and I think I said this on last quarter\u2019s call - we\u2019ve been in rate environments where benchmarks are significantly higher than they are today and lived with similar spreads to what we\u2019re doing today. That doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s the case in the future, but as a point of reference if you want to look back at the mid-2000s, we were in a higher rate environment with pretty strong spreads of CAF.","Mike Levin","Got it. Appreciate the color, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Seth Basham of Wedbush.","Seth Basham","Good morning and thank you for taking my question. My first question is just a follow-up on CAF. Obviously the penetration improved a little bit year-over-year, about 200 basis points. Would you say that you guys were a little bit more aggressive in terms to get that type of penetration, or is there anything else you could point to there?","Tom Reedy","I think there\u2019s a couple things going on from that perspective. Part of it is what\u2019s coming in the door. Credit quality in the door was up a couple points year-over-year, so that naturally would lend towards CAF getting more of the volume. Also, we have been a bit more aggressive in our testing, and we probably did take a little volume from Tier 2. You can see that in the other financing margin line where even given the fact that Tier 3 was down a little bit, that we had a slight increase in fees paid to other financial parties, and that\u2019s because Tier 2 was down a little bit as well.","Seth Basham","Got it, that\u2019s helpful. Then secondly, in terms of inventory availability, Tom, you spoke to the huge competitive advantage you guys have there, but it seems like nowadays almost every other used car in a given market is online and customers are willing to travel a bit further to buy those cars. Does that sort of change the competitive dynamics in your view, or not?","Tom Folliard","It depends on who the competitor is that they then go and buy the car from. I mean, we\u2019ve been consistently the retailer that offers a no-haggle price, easy access to financing with no negotiation, a cash offer on every car, a 30-day warranty, a five-day money back guarantee, three days to go get a better loan somewhere else. We stand behind the product that we sell. We have a seamless process. Our sales consultants are not paid a commission based on which car you buy or how much profit we make, so I don\u2019t think it\u2019s just the fact that the car is available. I think it still goes back to the process that the customer has to go through and whether or not they are comfortable doing that, and I think that\u2019s something that we continue to have a very large competitive advantage on. ","So the market is extremely fragmented and the fact that all of those cars are online doesn\u2019t change the fact that when the customer goes and actually goes through the process, they still have to go through a process in a way that makes them uncomfortable.","Seth Basham","Got it, so increased price transparency isn\u2019t really a big issue for you guys because of the offer that you had all around, not just price?","Tom Folliard","Well, increased price transparency is price transparency on the price of the car only, which is almost always negotiable, and then the price of the trade, which is always negotiable, and then the price of the financing, which is ridiculously negotiable, and then the price of all the add-on products like extended service plan or accessories, which are also negotiable. So when you look at it from top to bottom and the fact that we are straightforward and transparent on all of the pieces of the transaction, I think we have a significant competitive advantage and it shows up in our volumes.","Seth Basham","Got it. Thanks and good luck.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Armstrong of CL King & Associates.","Bill Armstrong","Good morning, guys. Just one question on CAF. Your weighted contract rate was up a little bit year-over-year but down sequentially. Are there any seasonal factors involved, or was it more the customer mix? How should we look at that?","Tom Reedy","Yeah, Q4 and Q1 are typically lower credit mixes, so you might see a little bit it skews down our Bs and Cs then, but I don\u2019t think there\u2019s really anything to read into it. There\u2019s nothing from a behavioral perspective that we did differently.","Bill Armstrong","Okay, so you would just kind of consider it within the norm?","Tom Reedy","I\u2019d say what\u2019s coming through the door is probably driving that.","Bill Armstrong","Yeah, got it. Okay, thank you.","Operator","Again ladies and gentlemen, in order to ask a question, please press star and the number one. Your next question comes from the line of David Whiston of Morningstar.","David Whiston ","Thanks, good morning. Going back to the NFL endorsement deals, should we think of this more as a very large scale trial, or should we expect more deals like this going forward because, as you noted, you are a bigger company?","Tom Folliard","You know, like any other advertising program that we have tried or run in the past, we\u2019ll evaluate it based on its performance and determine if it should be a bigger piece of what we do going forward. We\u2019ve been a sponsor of the Los Angeles Clippers for almost 10 years now, so this isn\u2019t our first sports sponsorship, it\u2019s just our first NFL sponsorship.","David Whiston","Okay. You mentioned at the beginning of the call, about 65% of your business is coming from something other than a laptop or desktop. Is there anything that a smartphone or tablet user cannot do today that someone on a laptop or desktop can do?","Tom Folliard","That was 65% of our web hits, not 65% of our business. So it\u2019s 65% of the total hits coming to our website are coming from a tablet or on a--you know, we have a different site for each, so there\u2019s a mobile site you go through on the mobile device and then there\u2019s an app, and the app has somewhat limited capability, but all the things that we think are most important - the ability to search for a car, the ability to look at 40 high definition pictures, the ability to zoom in on each of them, the ability to find a store and contact a sales consultant. We are continuing to work on adding additional capabilities, but clearly there are more capabilities on a desktop just because there\u2019s more room and there is more access for the customer to do more things online. But we are continuing to work on our app and continuing to give the customer more capabilities based on their demands.","David Whiston","Okay. Can you transfer on an app?","Tom Folliard","Can you transfer on an app? You cannot transfer on the app right now. You can\u2019t go in and enter your credit card information and transfer a car, no.","David Whiston","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Montani of Evercore ISI.","Michael Montani","Hey guys, good morning. I wanted to ask on the retail gross profit per unit, which was quite consistent there, a lot of the public competitors on the dealer side have been seeing mid-single digit declines, and you guys have been really persistent. So can you just discuss some of the levers you might have, and how should we think about that going forward?","Tom Folliard","You know, we\u2019ve been pretty consistent with managing our margins over a pretty long period of time now. I can\u2019t comment on the way others manage their business, but we\u2019re pretty confident in our ability to manage margin through all kinds of different environments. Even going back to the recession, we were able to manage margin pretty effectively and inventory turns during that time, which is the most significant single piece of volatility that we\u2019ve seen in our time running the business. So we feel pretty confident in our ability to be pretty consistent with our margins.","Michael Montani","Thanks. Just one other issue was on the buyback potential. From a debt to cap standpoint, I think that you all have said that there is opportunity there to perhaps be a little bit more aggressive, so maybe for Tom Reedy, if you could just go through how you\u2019re thinking about that, and then also what are the metrics you would use to evaluate if you want to get more aggressive with the buyback.","Tom Reedy","Yeah, we\u2019ve tried to be pretty consistent in our approach, and the fundamental to it was that we obviously are continuing having a priority of returning capital to shareholders as it\u2019s appropriate, and we also believe that we could use a little additional leverage in our capital structure. We\u2019ve talked about getting back to levels that are closer to where we ran pre-recession than where we are today. We\u2019ve made some progress - we\u2019ve bought back about 1.8 billion since the start of the program, or about 15% of the shares that were outstanding as of October of 2012, but we still think there\u2019s--as you\u2019ve seen, and we\u2019ve made a little bit of progress on the cash balance this past quarter, it\u2019s gone down about $250 million. But to get back to the levels we were considering, we would need significantly more debt than we have today, so I think we\u2019d expect to continue on with the program as is.","As far as how aggressive we get, we set up the program with bumpers in place that essentially govern our buy volume based on stock price and valuation, allow us to be a little more aggressive as price and valuation drop, and vice versa if price and valuation are up. We review that on an ongoing basis and will adjust it as appropriate. As you saw this quarter, the stock price was down, we were a bit up on our volume; last quarter, it was the opposite, so you can see we do take a bit of a view on how much volume to buy at given prices, but remember, it\u2019s going to be a programmatic approach over time.","Operator","Again ladies and gentlemen, if you would like to ask a question, please press star and the number one. Your next question comes from the line of Irina Hodakovsky of Keybanc. Irina, your line is open.","Irina Hodakovsky","Sorry about that - I was on mute. I have one follow-up question on the recall question that was asked earlier. Auto Nation made a move to ground all vehicles under recall. There was a recent attempt to implement a law similar to that - it didn\u2019t work right now, and in near term nobody expects that, but longer term it could become an issue if the industry moves in that direction. Was just wondering if you had discussed that internally, if this is a concern, how material--is it just a higher cost issue, maybe higher inventory cost? And if it\u2019s not a concern, then why not? ","Tom Folliard","Well, it is a concern. We\u2019ve talked about it at length. It\u2019s something that we\u2019re always trying to do what\u2019s the most transparent thing that we can do for our customers. Something to remember is we\u2019re in a different--we are almost exclusively used cars. We operate almost no new car franchises, and actually two less as of this quarter. We\u2019re down to just two Toyota stores, one in Baltimore, one in Kenosha, and any repairs that are under warranty, which include recalls for us, have to be taken to a dealer and done at that location. If there were laws passed, we have always complied with all the laws. If there was a law passed that required us to fix recalls, we would absolutely do that; but then, everybody would be in the exact same boat and all others who sell used cars would have to get those repaired at manufacturers\u2019 locations.","We think the most important thing is to make sure that customers are fully informed of whether or not there\u2019s an open recall on the car and also how important it is to register on a manufacturer\u2019s website. We may sell them a car and a week later a recall may come out, and if they haven\u2019t registered with the manufacturer, then they won\u2019t ever know about that. Every customer that buys a car at CarMax is made aware in several different points of the transaction about recalls. We have a direct link on our website to the NHTSA database. It automatically populates the VIN for the customer so they can see exactly what\u2019s going on with that individual car, and then at the point of sale our sales consultants are walking through with the customer exactly what I just said - whether or not the call has a open recall, and the importance of registering with the manufacturer on their website so they can be notified of recalls going forward.","So we\u2019re absolutely committed to transparency, and if there\u2019s any changes in the law, obviously we\u2019ll comply with all those laws.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Quarter 4 Fiscal Year 2012 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Ms. Kenny, you may begin your conference.","Katharine W. Kenny","Good morning. Thank you for joining our Fiscal 2012 Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call today. On the call with me today are Tom Folliard, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Tom Reedy, our Executive Vice President and CFO.","Before we begin, let me remind you that our statements today regarding the company's future business plans, prospects and financial performance are forward-looking statements that we make pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are based on management's current knowledge and assumptions about future events that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual events -- actual results to differ materially from our expectations. In providing projections and other forward-looking statements, the company disclaims any intent or obligation to update them.","For additional information on important factors that could affect these expectations, please see the company's annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2011, filed with the SEC. Tom?","Thomas J. Folliard","Thank you, Katharine. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. While we are pleased to report another year of record revenues and earnings, we achieved some major milestones this year, including total revenue of over $10 billion for the first time and retail used vehicle sales of over 400,000.","Some other highlights for the year include used unit comps increased by 1% compared to a very challenging 10% in the prior year. Net earnings, up 10% to $414 million. Wholesale unit sales increased by 20% to over 300,000 and total wholesale gross profit grew by 26%. CAF income, up 19%. And we ended our managed receivables at nearly $5 billion. We also estimate we increased our market share of late-model used vehicle sales by approximately 3%.","Highlights for the fourth quarter. Used unit comps increased by 4% compared to 12% in the previous year. Total used gross profit grew by 8%, and total wholesale gross profit grew by 20%. Wholesale unit sales, up 13% due to strong appraisal traffic. Our appraisal buy rate was similar to the last several quarters and last year's fourth quarter at a little over 29%. CAF quarterly income was also a strong contributor growing by 22% to $66.1 million.","During the quarter, sales of 5-year and older vehicles as a percentage of our total, were over 25% similar to what we reported in the third quarter. Sales of SUVs and trucks remained about the same as a percentage of our total last year, but fell from 31% to less than 21% -- less than 27% of our sales sequentially. As we've discussed before, our mix of vehicles would vary depending on the needs of our customers.","And I'll turn over to Tom Reedy. Tom?","Thomas W. Reedy","Good morning, everyone. As Tom mentioned, CAF had a strong quarter with income up $12 million or 22% compared to the fourth quarter fiscal 2011. Our portfolio grew 14% to nearly $5 billion. And net loans originated increased 36% compared with the fourth quarter fiscal 2011.","While the increase in unit sales and average selling price contributed to the portfolio growth, it was largely driven by the key motive impact of our decision to retain more of the loans we had historically approved, but in recent years had been purchased by third-party providers.","As of January this year, we have transitioned back to retaining all of these loans. CAF penetration for the quarter was approximately 37%, up from 29% last year. Interest margin as a percent of average receivables increased to 7.3% compared to last year of 6.9%.","While we have increased our retention of higher risk loans with higher APRs, we've also been providing more aggressive offers to attract and retain higher FICO customers. So while interest and fee income grew about $10 million year-over-year, it was down modestly as a percent of average receivables from 9.7% to 9.4%.","Interest expense has continued to decline as higher cost securitizations paid down and yields of lower interest expense continued to become a greater portion of our financing. As you may have seen, we closed the first 2012 ABS deal in mid-February. At this point, the market for auto paper seems to be quite healthy as we saw a strong demand for the deal and were able to upsize the transaction to $970 million.","Our provision for losses grew by $2.2 million year-over-year. That's the product of favorable loss experience dampening the impact of retaining more loans with greater credit risk in the growth in our receivables.","Access to financing for our customers continues to be very strong with 85% of applications receiving an approval. While the fourth quarters always are high for subprime mix, subprime penetration grew to 15% of sales in the quarter, that's versus 9% in the fourth quarter last year. Some of this may be due to strong tax season and mix through the door, but we have clearly seen our partner with continued experience and comfort in the CarMax origination channel begin to provide more attractive offers to our customers. Additionally, we believe we've improved our in-store execution around subprime sales and applications.","Before I turn the call back over to Tom, let me touch on the correction and lease accounting. During the quarter, we determined, along with our auditors, that we should utilize the financing method of accounting for sale-leaseback transactions. As a result, we made revisions to our financial statements to correct the accounting for transactions entered into between fiscal 1995 and 2009.","In simplest terms, certain assets that we were treating as rented are now treated as owned and financed. The net effect is the assets are added to our balance sheet and the financing liability is created. Depreciation has increased with those new assets, and rent expense and G&A is reduced. And payment on the sale-leaseback transactions are now recognized as interest and a decrease in the financing liability. We've determined that these revisions do not materially affect our financial statements. They generally impact our income statements by approximately the same amount, $0.02 a share, each year including fiscal 2012. However, our total earnings growth is not affected.","For your reference, we have included revised quarterly income statements for the past 2 years in our press release. Tom?","Thomas J. Folliard","Thank you, Tom. As I mentioned, we estimated that we grew market share this year in the 0- to 6-year old vehicle market by approximately 3%. Given the strength and unique quality of our consumer offer, we're confident we'll continue to expand our market share, especially as we continue to grow our store base and as late-model vehicles begin to increase again as a percentage of the overall used vehicle inventory.","Also remember that currently about 15% of our sales are vehicles that are outside of 1 to 6 years old older than 6. We're also very excited about our store opening plans over the next several years. As you know, during the fourth quarter, we opened our fifth store for fiscal 2012 in Chattanooga, Tennessee. In today's press release, we included the complete list of our currently projected store openings for fiscal 2013, including our expected opening of a second store opening in Jacksonville, Florida in the fourth quarter.","All right, at this time, we're happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer.","Brian W. Nagel - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","So first question, Tom, more of a qualitative one -- but we're looking at the sales trend, the used unit comps, and you're clear that, that metric continued to improve here in the fourth quarter with the 4%. I assume it got -- the numbers got better through the quarter. But the question I have for you is -- and we talk a lot about this on prior calls and other conversations, but how would you characterize your overall tone of your customer -- the overall tone of your customer? Now you've seen -- I've seen a larger number of customer, better traffic, better conversion, and how is that basically playing out?","Thomas J. Folliard","Well, we -- in the quarter, our traffic was up. And I think we talked about this some on the last call that because of our really high volume of appraisals recently and particularly appraisal-only customers, over the last couple of years, we've kind of gone back and looked at our conversion and tried to segment out customers who are really and specifically just coming to buy a car from us. And when we do that, we're really comfortable and confident that our conversion continues to increase, and that we did once again in the quarter and it also went up some for the year.","Our traffic was up about 6% in the quarter, but that includes -- that's total traffic, which also includes appraisal traffic. So I think the customer flow that we're getting is solid; good, quality customer flow that wants to buy cars and we're converting them at a pretty good clip. We still would like to see a higher flow of customers overall, but we're pretty pleased with how the quarter came out.","Brian W. Nagel - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","So I guess just to follow up on that. If we look at how the customer tracked through the fourth quarter, I mean, where there significant differences between, let's say, Q4 and then Q3, Q2 for you guys? How should we think about the change of dynamics in the customer?","Thomas J. Folliard","Well, we don't talk about any movement during the quarter. The last 2 quarters were a little disappointing from a sales and customer flow standpoint with -- I think we were a negative 2 and negative 3 on comps in the second and third quarters. So clearly, this was a better quarter with a plus 4, and I'd say that's the biggest difference. We were down the last 2 quarters, we're up this 1.","Brian W. Nagel - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay, fair enough. And the second question I have on SG&A spend. We talked -- you guys are clearly ramping up growth again. We saw a higher SG&A spend in the fourth quarter related to that growth. How should we think about SG&A spend as we look into 2012 related to your unit -- more aggressive unit expansion?","Thomas J. Folliard","Well, we're going to have some more expenses around store growth because we're either opening or preparing to open more stores in this year than we did last year. And we talked about coming out of the recession having a kind of a controlled build of store growth. We opened up 3 stores 2 years ago, 5 stores last year. We said we're going to open 10 this year and 10 to 15 in the next. So there are some spend that goes along with that on pre-opening expense, on staffing up to be prepared to open up those stores, relocation, all those kind of things. So we expect SG&A to go up and hopefully, we can get some comp sales to offset it.","Brian W. Nagel - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","So was there any -- do you mind giving parameters of how much higher SG&A spending should be in 2012?","Thomas J. Folliard","We're not going to give any guidance on that. We did provide -- we are providing a table for SG&A. Where did we put that?","Katharine W. Kenny","In the K.","Thomas J. Folliard","It will be in the K and we break it down a little better in there, so that will be new.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli.","Austin Pauls - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","This is actually Austin on for Scott today. Question just to follow up on the previous question on SG&A. I understand that the expenses will be ramping up as you ramp up store growth. But I did notice in the press release, you talked about lower advertising expense, which, I guess, seems a little bit counterintuitive. I would think that you would ramp that up as you grow stores and grow into new markets. So could you maybe talk about advertising and how you expect that to trend in the coming year?","Thomas J. Folliard","Yes. I think that for the quarter, that was just -- we did not -- we didn't do Super Bowl this year and we did last year. That's a pretty, pretty overpriced thing to do.","Austin Pauls - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay, fair enough. So that was just for this quarter. But I guess in the coming year, should we expect advertising to ramp up along with the other expenses related to new store growth?","Thomas J. Folliard","Yes. We try to think about advertising on a per unit sold basis. If we get the sales we expect, we would expect to spend more money on advertising. And then we're going to have some pre-opening advertising that will be larger than it was last year because we'll open more stores.","Austin Pauls - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay, understood. And then just one last question on a different topic. Obviously, we've all seen gas prices rising in recent months. I'm curious, is that impacting your mix at all? Are people looking for smaller and more [indiscernible]? And I guess I'm kind of thinking about that in the context of ASPs, but were still up with, I think, 4% year-over-year. So just curious how the mix is trending and how that will impact ASPs going forward.","Thomas J. Folliard","Yes. We talked about -- I mentioned that in the -- in my opening remarks. Our SUV mix was down 4 points sequentially year-over-year. But it's not -- it's in the sub -- I mean, I'm sorry, midsize and small cars were up about the same to offset that. So we have seen it, but just from a how does it feel, it doesn't feel anything like it did back in May of '08 when gas hit $4, and we saw a dramatic shift in consumer behavior. I'd say this has been a little bit more gradual, and people seem a little more settled into the high $3s on gas prices. But I think one of the best things about the CarMax consumer offer is we're pretty nimble, and we can adjust our inventory to whatever the consumer is looking to buy. And it doesn't make any difference to us. We're happy to sell smaller cars. We're happy to sell SUVs. And as we've talked about before, our margin is more on a per unit basis, and it's not really driven off of ASP. The only place where ASP really has an impact is on average amount financed in CAF. So -- and I also think that ASPs over the last couple of years have been driven far more by the changes in the wholesale market than they have been by anything to do with our mix.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Craig Kennison with Robert W. Baird.","Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Market share. I want to thank you for the additional detail you shared with us. Could you help us clarify more detail on that in terms of the overall size of the 0- to 6-year-old market?","Thomas J. Folliard","Yes. The overall size -- the 0- to 6-year-old market shrunk again during the year. A few points to remember about the way we report market share: One, we only report market share in the market that we're in. We're only in half of the U.S. markets. We're talking about our share of 1- to 6-year-old cars. We do it on an annual basis because the data that we buy and we get -- although it's been very consistent for a long period of time, it's actually very inconsistent if you look at it over shorter periods of time. We feel pretty comfortable reporting it annually. And we feel very comfortable that we grew our share of 1- to 6-year-old cars. And then remember that 15% of our retail sales are older than 6 years old, so they're not even included in the number. And that makes it a little bit challenging. But if we said well, we sell all the way out to 10-year-old cars, so let's look at our share of 1- to 10-year-old cars. That chunk of the market is so big that if we said our retail share that will drop down to just a miniscule number. So that's the reason we keep reporting on the consistent basis. Additionally, we sell very high quality cars at retail, and we wholesale stuff that is older. So you've seen our wholesale business grow pretty dramatically over the years. When you look at those 2 numbers combined, we sold over 300,000 wholesale cars during the year. Lots of those cars are in that older segment, the 6- to 10-year old. So we try to look at our total business. We run our business a little different than some of the other retailers. Most others don't have such a big wholesale business. So we kind of look at our participation in -- in the total used car market, we sold 400,000 retail cars. We also sold 300,000 wholesale cars. And we really like our positioning there. But we're going to keep reporting share the way we do. We think it's important. We think it's an important measure for our business. But again, there's a lot of caveats there because of the lack of data that's available.","Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","And the 3% to which you refer, is that a percentage point gain in share of the market you're addressing?","Thomas J. Folliard","That's 3%, not 3 percentage points. So it's 3%. It's a small change. And again, it's of 1- to 6-year-old cars, remembering that 15% of our sales are not even in that segment. And we still grew share and a couple of other pieces I didn't mention. As our store base ages, we have slower growth in our bigger older stores as you would imagine. We're now starting to put newer stores back into the base, which should help. We'll also be adding stores into existing markets, which help share -- doesn't necessarily help comps right away but helps share. So you have those factors as well. And then historically, we have -- our performance has been stronger in 1- to 3-year old than it has been in, say, 4 to 6. And 1- to 3-year old has shrunk even more than 1 to 6 because of the lack of new car sales. So when that starts to come back and we've seen the SAAR start to come back some, then that 1- to 6-year-old share number also should benefit a little bit from that.","Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","That was my last question. When do you think we'll see the bottom in your addressable market as SAAR picks up? Is that a 2014 bottom?","Thomas J. Folliard","We have no idea. Hopefully, we already saw it. But it's hard to judge. But -- and if you look at the supply chain and you look at what's been sold over the last couple of years, we're still a year or 2 away from seeing the supply come back in 1- to 3-year-old cars. And it's one of the things I'm really proud of that we've been able to do is move our business model around with the changing conditions in the marketplace. And our business is really a diversified profit model between retail and wholesale and finance, and I think we take advantage of whatever is available to us at the time.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt Nemer with Wells Fargo Securities.","Matthew R. Nemer - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Just to follow up on market share. The 3% change in share was a little bit lower than it has been in previous years. And I'm wondering, was that pretty consistent through the year, or do you think that there's a point in time where maybe you went negative or you were lower than 3%? And if so, what do you attribute that to?","Thomas J. Folliard","Well, one, Matt, you've been asking questions long enough to know we don't talk about trends during the year. It was 3% up for the year. All the reasons I just mentioned, I think, are contributing factors to a share gain that isn't as strong as the last 2 years. Last year, I think it was around 7 and the year before, we were in the double digits. But I'm pretty happy with our share growing every year. I'll take share gains every year.","Matthew R. Nemer - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Understood. And then just in terms of subprime increase and subprime. How much of that do you think was incremental and helped the comp this quarter? Or is there a way to kind of think about the impact that it may have had on used unit comps?","Thomas W. Reedy","It came as comp, Tom. I think a great amount of it was incremental. If you see the step-up, it was 9% last year, 15% this year. As I've mentioned, we did see credit quality through the door down but our partners, because they've gotten more experienced with the origination channel and how their portfolio has performed, have been delivering offers to our customers. They are offers that the customers are more likely to accept, and mainly that means better down payments. So we've seen a definite step-up in that, and it was impactful for the quarter.","Matthew R. Nemer - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then just lastly, I know that you don't give guidance and you'll probably say that again. But as you look at 2013, is it possible that wholesale units will be down? How are you thinking about wholesale given sort of the strange comparisons? And then, do you have any feeling for whether we'll see net gains in -- from a reconditioning standpoint?","Thomas J. Folliard","Well, the first part, you were absolutely right about, which is we don't give guidance. What I will say about wholesale is, wholesale is driven by appraisals and appraisal buy rate, and the number of cars we get through the lane that don't meet our retail standards. We do expect that if SAAR grows, that our appraisal lane traffic will grow. It's not exactly correlated, and I couldn't tell you what that's going to be. But if we saw a big movement in SAAR during the year, we would expect to do more appraisals. That would benefit us on the wholesale side. It would benefit us on the retail side because we'd buy more of those cars as well. Our buy rate can move with how the wholesale market moves, whether it's an appreciating market or depreciating market. We've been able to manage pretty well throughout. But there's no question that in an appreciating market, buy rate is helped. So there's just a lot of variable there that will yield whatever wholesale will yield this year, which is why we don't give any guidance on it. But I would say, as SAAR moves, we would expect appraisals to move. And what was the second part?","Matthew R. Nemer - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Just recon, your reconditioning savings expectations for this year.","Thomas J. Folliard","Yes. So we feel really good about the 250 that we've gotten so far, and that is sustainable. I've said all along that if there was any left, it was going to be the more difficult part to get. I think we originally talked about 300, and we've said the last 50 would be a lot harder than the first 250. I mean, it's really tough to say what will happen during the year and whether or not we'll get it. But that's about all I can say there. We're really pleased with the progress that we've made so far. One benefit that we've had over the last couple of years that we're now not having is we really didn't see a lot of inflation in parts and things like that a couple of years ago. And over the last year, we started to see inflation a little bit more, so we got to think about inflation adjusting, how we talk about reconditioning cost. But that's just been something -- clearly, we don't expect it to be true going forward that we really don't see any inflation in cost.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Murphy from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Elizabeth Lane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","This is Elizabeth Lane on for John. What kind of inventory levels do you guys currently have in stores compared to what your ideal levels would be? And do you have a projection for U.S. new vehicle sales this year and how that increase in trade activity could help inventory?","Thomas J. Folliard","So one, we don't have a projection. We've always felt really good about our ability to react and adjust to whatever happens. That wouldn't -- our view is that if SAAR went up a bunch, that traffic would benefit and potentially, sales would benefit, and we would move our inventory accordingly. So it's not like because SAAR goes up that, that's going to change our inventory level. We'll move our inventory along with sales. Inventory year-over-year was roughly flat, probably up just for the new store difference. Our inventory turns for the quarter were a little over 8 compared to 7.5 last year. So turns were -- in the quarter, so turns were up.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sharon Zackfia with William Blair.","Sharon Zackfia - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","A few questions. I guess, I know it's still relatively early but it appears that the new stores that you opened last year got off to a relatively good start. So just wondering how you feel about the new store productivity and whether there's any predictability there yet. And with price elasticity of demand, I know there's something you and I have talked about quite a bit over the over past few years. Are you seeing any indication of price elasticity of demand coming back with the consumer?","Thomas J. Folliard","So on the first one, it's still a little early for new stores. If you -- we opened up Cincinnati, Dayton and Augusta, which would now be in the comp store base. And then the 5 we opened last year, none of those will be comp stores. And it's still a little early to talk about that. I think over the next couple of quarters, we'll start reporting on -- we'll start thinking about reporting on new store performance as a group. And then the last question was?","Thomas W. Reedy","Elasticity.","Thomas J. Folliard","Elasticity. Yes, it's still not like it was before. And as you know, we're constantly adjusting and moving our prices and our margins to try to capture what we think is the optimal amount of both sales and margin. But in terms of moving price down a couple of hundred bucks and seeing it -- getting it all back in sales, we still don't see it.","Sharon Zackfia - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. Just one follow-up question. I guess on CarMax Auto Finance, I know you don't give guidance specifically for it. But would it be reasonable to expect the contribution from CarMax Auto Finance to grow a little bit less quickly this year than last year?","Thomas W. Reedy","Sharon, I don't think that's an unreasonable assumption. As we mentioned, during the course of fiscal 2012, we were taking back volume that we used to be selling off to our partners, which means our penetration was increasing during the year. And as I mentioned, we are back to the full spectrum of what we bought historically. So as far as opportunity, you take additional sales and support them with CAF without doing something different. From a credit perspective, we pretty much moved to where we were historically.","Thomas J. Folliard","And then, remember too, Sharon, it's not like the old accounting where if we got an 8% or 10% comp during any given year in the past, because of the way accounting worked, CAF would kind of grow along with it. And now that's going to get dampened because of the -- because of how you recognize earnings.","Thomas W. Reedy","Sharon, one other thing, if you remember at the beginning of the year, we mentioned that we had significant favorability and losses, and we saw some of that this quarter as well. So obviously, we have baked into our loss provision everything we think we're going to see over the next 12 months from a loss perspective. So one thing to keep in mind is FY '12 was helped by a favorability in losses. And obviously, we're not projecting that or it would be into our reserve.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman with the Credit Suisse.","Simeon Gutman - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Tom, have you given any thought to maybe selling an older mix of cars at retail? And I guess to your point earlier, if you combine the retail and the wholesale business, you're probably taking share in all classes of older ages of vehicles?","Thomas J. Folliard","Yes, I talked about this last quarter and I mentioned in the script, our percentage of inventory that we retail that was between 5 and 10 years old. Now I'm going to go back to June of last year, roughly, our percentage of inventory was about 15% of what we retailed was between 5 and 10 years old. And then at the end of the third quarter, that number was up closer to 30%, north of 25%. So clearly, in a short period of time, about 6 months, we responded to consumer demand, and we shifted our inventory to that older mix. The reason it gets a little confusing is because we report 1 to 6. I just gave you 5 to 10, so that includes 5 and 6. And then in this last quarter, the one that just ended, that mix of sales was similar. So if you said what's your mix of 5- to 10-year-old sales this year compared to last year, it's up pretty significantly. So we absolutely have shifted towards older stuff, and because that's what the consumer is looking for.","Simeon Gutman - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Got it. Okay. And I know it's early days, can you just give any initial thoughts on Chattanooga because I know it's a slightly different format on a couple of respects? I'm curious what the -- some initial takeaways may be.","Thomas J. Folliard","Well, it's a really good-looking store. We have a bunch of technology in there that we're excited about, and it's all working. So that's a plus. And it was a pretty enthusiastic store opening because of all the kind of exciting uses of technology and social media and some of the other stuff that we're using in the store. But in terms of result, it's just way too early to even talk about.","Simeon Gutman - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","What about anything on the labor model there or in smaller market stores that you can apply to either other stores now or other bigger stores?","Thomas J. Folliard","Yes, we didn't really -- there's nothing there especially not this early. One thing to remember is this is -- it's an evolutionary change for us. It's a product of 18 years of history and adjusting our model accordingly. But we didn't reinvent the consumer offer in that store. We changed somewhat the way we deliver it. But we're still doing the same high-quality cars. We're still doing the 30-day warranty. We're still doing the 5-day money-back guarantee, still paying flat commissions to all of our sales people, so that our incentives are lined up in the consumers' best interest. We're still making a cash offer on every car. We're trying to do a better job delivering on the store. But the basics of the CarMax customer offer are all still there. And a lot of the components that we have designed into the store are pre-modular, and we can roll them back into the existing stores if we see them working. But again, it's just -- it's awfully early to be talking about sales in one store.","Simeon Gutman - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then second or third on CAF. Is it fair to assume that the loss rate ticked up because you're expanding the mix, or the mix of subprime is going up or there are some offsets? And then any update -- I think there was talk about potentially adding another subprime partner to the mix?","Thomas J. Folliard","Well, the mix of subprime has nothing to do with CAF loss rate because those are done by a different lender.","Thomas W. Reedy","Yes, and we're texting other partners in both the Tier 2 space and the subprime space. And as soon as we have one that's enough of a critical mass, we'll talk about it.","Thomas J. Folliard","And the change in loss rate in total was absolutely just the change in the mix and taking back the stuff that we were doing -- that we used to do and didn't do and now do again.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rod Lache with Deutsche Bank.","Dan Galves - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","It's Dan Galves in for Rod this morning. Just I have a question on CAF. Versus Q3, it looked like the kind of the net interest margin as a percent of managed receivables declined a little bit, and the loan loss provision also declined somewhat. We have expected loan losses to kind of stay similar to Q3 on kind of your broader credit spectrum. Wondering if you could provide any color on kind of trends in those 2, what do you expect in trends in those 2 margin numbers going forward?","Thomas W. Reedy","Yes, I can't give any visibility on what we expect in trends. But as far as during the quarter, we did see some favorability in our loan loss experience. Our wholesale recovery rate is still high, around 60% like it's been going. But what we've seen this quarter is a higher frequency of people paying to get current. It wasn't enough to be material about the number, but we did see some favorability in the quarter on losses. And as far as the APR. As I mentioned, in addition to taking back the higher risk and higher APR paper, we've also been pricing more aggressively with our higher FICO customers, so there's some offset there on the -- from the top line.","Dan Galves - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, got you. And then, on SG&A per unit, I mean, is there any kind of rule of thumb we should be looking at in terms of what level of comps, same-store comps you need for that SG&A per unit number to stay flat or not go up?","Thomas J. Folliard","Yes. I think we've historically set it. It's in the kind of mid-single digits, which -- and it's probably in the current environment since we're adding incremental stores vis-\u00e0-vis last year Remington. This year versus 5 last year, I'd look to the higher end of that kind of range.","Dan Galves - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, got you. And then one other one, in terms of more later-model vehicles, obviously used prices are pretty strong right now. Also we're seeing like a lot better fuel economy and connectivity and technology and some of the new vehicles that have come out in the last year. What are you seeing? Has there been any change in how people are evaluating a purchase of a late-model used car versus a late-model new car? Kind of what are you seeing when people are making that decision and any changes recently?","Thomas J. Folliard","Well, I don't know that any of that stuff has had an impact as much as just the economy and people's unwillingness to get involved in a loan or higher priced car. I think that's why we've seen the 0- to 6-year-old market decline for a few years in a row now. And new car sales, although they're up and everybody's happy about it, they're nowhere near where they used to be. It's 15, the SAAR was 15 in February. It was a little over 14 in March. We went 8, 9 years in a row with that number around $17 million. So I still think the customer is sitting back and waiting a little bit. I still don't think it\u2019s back to where it was before. Despite all the things that you talked about with technology and changes in new cars that I think are all positive, the consumer is still not all the way back.","Dan Galves - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, got you. And one housekeeping, can you tell us what percentage of your retail sales came out of the appraisal lanes this quarter?","Thomas J. Folliard","That was a little over 50%.","Dan Galves - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Is that about flat from last quarter?","Thomas J. Folliard","I think it was -- I think so. We'll get that for you.","Katharine W. Kenny","It was a little bit down from the last quarter, I think.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just a couple of quick follow-ups here. First of all, if you could sort of talk about the puts and takes on used vehicle gross profit per car in the current environment. You addressed reconditioning briefly, were any other moving pieces that you think are influencing that number?","Thomas J. Folliard","No, not really. It was relatively flat compared to last year. Our turns are up a little bit. That always helps but nothing really unusual on the quarter.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. And then, secondly, can you talk about the distribution of outcomes among your markets? And I know you don't give market-by-market performance. But are you seeing the differences between markets get bigger, smaller, what things that refer from a number of retailers, is that as the environment has improved to some degree that dispersion has moderated somewhat? Are you seeing that in your numbers?","Thomas J. Folliard","Yes, we haven't talk about that historically, Matt.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Clint Fendley with Davenport.","Clint D. Fendley - Davenport & Company, LLC, Research Division","I know there were several adjustments related to the sale-leaseback for the year. I just wondered, should the depreciation run rate for fiscal '13 be similar to what we've seen in the fourth quarter?","Thomas W. Reedy","I think when you look at the adjusted numbers, you can get a good picture for that. It's in the cash book.","Clint D. Fendley - Davenport & Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And so we should we expect the similar rate for the coming year then.","Thomas W. Reedy","Well, obviously, we're going to be adding new stores, which have probably planned equipment to get appreciated. But as far as the adjustment, it should be...","Clint D. Fendley - Davenport & Company, LLC, Research Division","We're done with the adjustment.","Thomas W. Reedy","Absolutely, absolutely.","Clint D. Fendley - Davenport & Company, LLC, Research Division","And switching gears for a second. And I know we've had several questions on market share growth. But I just wondered, is it reasonable to expect for you guys to get back to the previous growth rates now that you've resumed your store growth? And just kind of wondering, I mean, how much of the SAAR rate here is due to the tighter or tougher consumer environment versus your sort of lack of opening any stores for the last several years?","Thomas J. Folliard","It's hard to really quantify that's why I think the number of factors that I talked about earlier as it relates to market share. And we're hopeful that the games go back up, but it's nice to be explaining gains, so.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Armstrong with CL King and Associates.","William R. Armstrong - CL King & Associates, Inc.","I was wondering if you could discuss current trends in the spread between new car prices and late-model used car prices. Are you seeing that widening at all? And if so, does that start to make your offerings a little more attractive to consumers?","Thomas J. Folliard","We haven't looked at that in a while. That's a good question. But the spreads, as our average retail has gone up since kind of the depth of the recession, our average retail went up $2,500 to $3,000. Over that same time period, we saw new cars, average new car price go up about $4,000. So probably it would have widened the spread a little bit more recently here. I actually don't -- I don't know the answer, but we haven't seen a move enough that we thought we should talk about it.","William R. Armstrong - CL King & Associates, Inc.","Understood. And on capital expenditures, you're budgeting about $280 million, that's a big increase from last year. I assume most of that is new stores. Are there any other major projects that are incorporated into that number?","Thomas W. Reedy","No, I think you're right that the lion's share of that is new stores and new land, et cetera, for future development. If you look back to what we were talking about in 2006, 2007, it's not out of line with the amount of spend we were projecting and spending at that point. There's always a certain amount of maintenance CapEx but for the most part, the increase is new stores.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Justin Ellstein with Stephens Inc.","Unknown Analyst","A number of my questions have already been answered but maybe just a couple of cleanups here. First question, just curious how much of that extra day in February helped the comp?","Thomas J. Folliard","Probably roughly 190th.","Unknown Analyst","Yes, okay. On the receivables balance, now that we're -- you've kind of caught up to the point where you are retaining all the lower quality credits.","Thomas J. Folliard","Below high quality. Yes, remember.","Unknown Analyst","I mean, just how quickly do you think you can grow that receivable balance going forward?","Thomas J. Folliard","Well, we -- go ahead, Tom.","Thomas W. Reedy","I was going to say, that is -- there is a -- there's a number of things that are going to drive that. And all else equal, the interest margin stays the same. Over time, you would see that portfolio grow similar with sales and which makes sense. But in a period of escalating growth, it might lag a bit because remember, we recognize the profit on these transactions over the life of the loan, not upfront. It's a portfolio. And our penetration average selling prices interest margin, those things all impact income. But all else equal, over the long term, it should go with the business unless we change our approach.","Unknown Analyst","Sure. And can you just tell us what the total delinquencies were at the end of this quarter?","Thomas W. Reedy","I want to get back to [indiscernible] and we'll get to that back up.","Unknown Analyst","Okay, I'll just go into the next question. Given supply constraints still likely for this year, what kind of pricing benefit are you anticipating that we could see?","Thomas J. Folliard","I'm not sure we see a pricing benefit in supply constraint. That generally in the past has led to higher prices. But we don't know what's going to happen with SAAR and the supply chain. I'm not really sure what your question was.","Unknown Analyst","Well, with limited supply in units, I mean, are you anticipating any benefit in pricing? Do you think you can raise prices again this year?","Thomas J. Folliard","No. I'm not sure. We manage it on a pretty short window of time. We're managing our inventory and pricing pretty much every day. So we're going to do whatever the market allows us to do.","Operator","And I'm showing no further questions at this time. You do have -- I apologize, you do have a question from David Whiston from Morningstar.","David Whiston - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","I'm sorry if I missed this at the beginning, but did you give the appraisal buy rate yet?","Thomas J. Folliard","Yes, it was a little over 29%.","David Whiston - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","29%. And to each of the Toms -- in your investor presentations, you used to have what you call your iceberg slide where you laid out your 5 components of sustainable competitive advantage. And in your opinion -- for each of your opinions, I'd just like to hear what do you think is the single most important contributor to that business model?","Thomas J. Folliard","Well, in my opinion, I don't think there is a single one. I think it's a combination of all of the factors together that differentiate us from the competition. And I think one of the reasons we showed the iceberg like we did is to just give a visual understanding of how complex the behind-the-scenes stuff is in this business to do and do well. And I think that we're continuing to learn every year, and we're continuing to make strides every year in those areas. But the whole idea behind that slide was that what you see, what the consumer sees, what the competitors see, what investors see from the look and feel of the building, from walking in, from shopping in our store is only a small piece of actually delivering the consumer offer. So to me, there is no one thing.","Thomas W. Reedy","Yes, I guess I would echo that. But I would add that over time, I think the competitive advantage that Tom mentioned is we've evolved into 3 real strong businesses that are complementary and deliver. We've got the retail business with all of the add-ons that go with that, the wholesale business and a very strong finance business. And the iceberg really doesn't capture that. It's more our competitive advantage from an operating perspective. But I think, that's the key that over time we've grown into a pretty diversified set of revenue streams.","Thomas J. Folliard","That's a really good point. If we redid our iceberg, we have to put wholesale and CarMax Auto Finance under the waterline and make the bottom bigger.","David Whiston - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Yes, I agree. You guys just kill your competitors in wholesale. I mean, how long can you keep those margins up?","Thomas J. Folliard","I think we don't look at it as what we're doing against the competition. It's a business segment for us that has customers. And we market to those customers. We provide great customer service. Our dealers are loyal, they're consistent. We have -- I think we have the highest dealer attendance ratios in all of the -- in auctioning. We're now the third largest auction chain in the United States. Again, we have really consistent attendance. We have phenomenal ratios. And we're pretty upfront with those customers. They know what they're buying from us. We stand but for the most part, stand behind what we sell. We make announcements on the condition of those cars, and I think it's allowed our business to continue to grow. We just -- we run that business as a separate business, and we run it differently than what the competition does so...","Operator","And I'm showing no further questions at this time.","Thomas J. Folliard","All right. Thank you again for joining us. And as we close the year and start a new one, I just want to once again thank all of our associates for all your hard work, all your dedication. And I'd also like to express our thanks for the support and confidence of our customers and our investors. We'll talk to you again next quarter.

Thank you all for joining our fiscal 2017 first quarter earnings conference call. On the call with me today are Tom Folliard, our Chief Executive Officer; Bill Nash, President; and Tom Reedy, our Executive Vice President and CFO.","Before we begin, let me remind you that our statements today regarding the company\u2019s future business plans, prospects and financial performance are forward-looking statements that we made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Before I turn it over to Tom, I just want to say how about those Cavs? Tom?","Tom Folliard","Thank you, Katharine who has a hometown of Cleveland as you can tell. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining the call today. As usual, I will start with a quick overview of the key drivers of the quarter. Tom Reedy will then give some more detail around financing and we will turn over to Bill Nash who will share some additional information regarding the quarter.","First quarter fiscal 2017 was a challenging one for us. Total revenues increased by 2.8%. Used unit comps were slightly positive and total used units grew 4%. Comp units were driven by an improvement in conversion, which offset a modest decrease in traffic. We do believe that the decline in traffic is both predominantly and disproportionately a result of the decrease in Tier 3 sales given the fact that Tier 3 conversion has historically been significantly lower than our non-Tier 3 conversion. For the non-Tier 3 customer base, comp units actually rose by 3.6%. Total web traffic increased by 7%. Wholesale units grew by 1.8%. CAF quarterly income fell 7.7% to $101 million. And net income for the first quarter declined by 3.6% to $175 million and EPS rose 4.7% to $0.90. During the first quarter, we bought back 2.6 million shares at a cost of $132 million.","I will now turn the call over to Tom to talk about finance. Tom?","Tom Reedy","Thanks, Tom. Good morning, everybody. This quarter, consistent with last two quarters, we continue to experience a year-over-year increase in credit applications from customers at the higher end of the credit spectrum and a decline in applications across the lower end. Consequently, we saw growth in the percentage of sales financed by CAF. We also saw growth in the share of sales where customers paid cash or brought their own financing. CAF\u2019s net penetration was up over 1 percentage point to 43.9% compared with 42.7% in last year\u2019s first quarter.","Net loans originated in the quarter rose 6% year-over-year to $1.4 billion due to a combination of CarMax\u2019s sales growth and the higher penetration of CAF. Tier 2 financing, as a percent of sales, fell slightly year-over-year to 17.4% compared to 18%, due to the lower applicant flow, which was partially offset by stronger conversion in that space. Tier 3 financing as a percent of sales declined to 11.9% compared to 14.7% in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 due to a combination of lower applicant volume and some measurable credit tightening by our third-party lenders.","As Tom mentioned, CAF income of $101 million represented a decrease of approximately 8% compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2016. This was due to a higher provision for loan losses, a lower interest margin partially offset by 12% growth in average managed receivables to $9.7 billion. The increase in the provision for loan losses in the first quarter reflected the favorability we commented on in last year\u2019s first quarter, selling favorable experience in the current quarter as well as the growth in the receivables. Given last year\u2019s favorability, much of the year-over-year increase in the provision was expected. However, we did have some unfavorable loss experience this quarter reflecting several factors, including a drop in wholesale recovery rate.","Our ending allowance for loan losses at $104 million was 1.05% of ending managed receivables compared to 0.94% in last year\u2019s first quarter and at 0.99% last quarter. This loss reserve is within our range of expectations given our origination strategy, which includes our Tier 3 activity. For loans originated during the quarter, the weighted average contract rate charged to customers was 7.5%, similar to the 7.4% in last year\u2019s first quarter. Total interest margin declined to 5.9% of average managed receivables compared to 6.3% in the first quarter of last year, but that\u2019s consistent with the last couple of quarters.","Interest expense in the quarter rose to $11 million \u2013 turning over to CarMax overall now. Interest expense in the quarter rose to $11 million compared to $7 million in the first quarter of FY \u201816. This was partially due to higher average debt levels that more than half of the increase was a result of the completion of lease extensions related to some of our stores as we discussed in our last 10-K filing.","During the first quarter, we executed a private debt placement of $500 million. We sold $300 million of the deal in the first quarter, which was primarily used to reduce our outstanding revolver balance. And we will fund the remaining $200 million sometime in the second quarter. We also repurchased 2.6 million shares for $132 million. And at quarter end, we had $1.3 billion remaining under the current authorization.","I will turn over to Bill.","Bill Nash","Great. Thanks, Tom. Good morning. As a percentage of our sales mix this quarter, 0 to 4-year-old vehicles remained essentially flat compared to last year at approximately 77%. Midsize and large SUVs and trucks as a percentage of sales increased by over 2% to approximately 25% in this first quarter compared to last year\u2019s first quarter remained flat compared to the fourth quarter.","SG&A expense for the first quarter increased 8.7% to $380 million. This growth primarily reflects the 11% or 16 store increase in our store base since the beginning of the first quarter of last year and a $7 million increase or $36 per unit in share-based compensation expense. Another $3 million increase in cost or roughly $18 a unit was related to hail damage incurred in several of our Texas markets during the quarter. In total, our SG&A per unit increased by $97 to $2,223.","During our last call, I highlighted some of the advancements we are making to improve the customer experience and drive efficiency. Specifically, I mentioned that we would be rolling out a new adaptive and more personalized website. The new website was fully rolled out in April. It combines an upgraded and enhanced design with a seamless experience across all devices. We have also upgraded the entire site to a state-of-the-art technology platform. This will allow us to more quickly innovate, test new capabilities and personalize the experience based on the customer\u2019s individual preferences.","We will also continue to test different components of selling process online to better understand our customer needs. One of the new capabilities that we are currently testing is offering our customers online financing. Being pre-qualified for financing before the store visit helps build the customer\u2019s confidence and will make the in-store shopping experience faster and more enjoyable. Our plan is to initially roll it out to 10 stores. We continue to believe that no one is in a better position than CarMax to deliver more of the transactions online or even deliver the car to the home. No one can match our existing infrastructure, our national footprint, our inventory scale and our brand strength. The ability to combine a state-of-the-art online experience, with the exceptional customer service our associates are known for is what will set us apart from our competitors.","During the first quarter, we opened 2 stores, both in new markets, one in Springfield, Illinois and one in San Francisco. We plan to open 13 other stores during the fiscal year. Subsequent to the end of the first quarter, we opened a store in El Paso, another new market for us. During the second quarter, we expect to open two more stores, one in Bristol, Tennessee, which is another new market for us and the other will be our third store in the Boston market.","Now we will open up the call for questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of John Murphy with Bank of America-Merrill Lynch.","John Murphy","Good morning guys, can you hear me?","Tom Folliard","Yes. Hi John.","John Murphy","Just maybe a longer term question just to kind of follow-up on what you were just talking about your enhanced website, do you foresee a time where your store count is not necessarily growing as quickly as you are expecting right now, but you are reaching a broader set of consumers, quite simplistically I mean do need as many stores to cover a market as you do now if you kind of increased this physical presence and can you go a lot more asset light as the business emerges over time?","Tom Folliard","Yes. John, I think it\u2019s important that we do both very well. So I think in the short-term, we don\u2019t have any intentions of changing up our growth as far as the physical stores as we said in the past, 13 to 16 stores is what we have committed to for this year and next year. And we think that\u2019s to be ultimately successful, you need to have a really good presence in both. And so I think for us, it\u2019s going to be a combination of continuing to expand our offering online and then continuing to evolve our in-store process. Could we get to a point down the road where that may change up, that\u2019s hard to tell at this point.","John Murphy","And these efforts aren\u2019t having any impact on your showroom traffic, are they at this point?","Tom Folliard","No, I think when you think about traffic, foot traffic, it\u2019s broadly known that consumers are being much more informed before they come into the store. So they are doing a lot of the research upfront. In our case, we know nine out of ten of our consumers that end up purchasing from us do some homework ahead of time from \u2013 on carmax.com. So what we do think is they are coming in more informed. And as we look out and try to continue to get comps comes, we are going to be focused both on traffic, both in-store traffic to the web and then equally focused on conversion.","John Murphy","Okay, great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets.","Scot Ciccarelli","Good morning guys.","Tom Folliard","Good morning Scoot.","Scot Ciccarelli","Hi, I guess my primary question is on the cap side and we did see obviously, a pickup in the loan loss reserves, where \u2013 how would you expect that to trend for the balance of the year given some of the unfavorable changes you saw happen during the course of the quarter?","Tom Reedy","Yes. Scot, one thing I would point out is that what we have booked in the quarter and is now booked in reserve is the 12-month look forward on losses. And our negative experience during the quarter is baked into our forecast direct for the rest of the year. So to the extent things were to worsen or improve, we would adjust accordingly. But at this point, everything we know about the environment including the experience we had in this quarter and having losses coming a little hot is baked into that forward-looking estimate. When you see the increase in that provision for loan losses, it\u2019s a combination of both our experience in the quarter versus our expectation of what we had booked and an adjustment to the overall portfolio based on what we have learned. So as I said at this point, I think everything that we have learned based on methodology is baked in.","Scot Ciccarelli","So when you kind of peel back the onion a little bit Tom, is it more a recent vintages or is it older vintages or is it kind of across the board?","Tom Reedy","I think it\u2019s a combination of things, Scot. In general, if you step back and look at it, last year\u2019s experience was very favorable. So I don\u2019t think we would have expected to have a repeat of that, so that\u2019s kind of the first point. We have also seen pretty significant growth in the portfolio, which means losses are going to step-up. And then also in the last 2 years, we have expanded on the credit front a bit. If you remember back in 2013, we got much more aggressive with customers at the very high end of credit, offering very low rates to the highest credit quality customers. That had an impact of kind of bringing down our expected losses on the portfolio. Over the last 2 years though we have been expanding at the lower end of what CAF has done with some testing and some I guess prudent expansion, in an effort to bring our targeted cumulative net loss back in line with where we have tried to run it at that 2% to 2.5%, which is a very highly financeable portfolio. So I think it\u2019s fair to say that activity in the last couple of years, we have gotten a bit more aggressive internationally. And we get compensated for that with higher rates. And some of that has \u2013 you would have maybe expectation and that would increase losses in the portfolio. But we did have some unfavorable experience in the quarter as I mentioned due to \u2013 partially due to that expansion and partially due to the wholesale recovery rate.","Scot Ciccarelli","Got it, okay. Thanks a lot guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Craig Kennison with Robert Baird.","Craig Kennison","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Before I begin I just want to say I consider Katharine the LeBron of Investor Relations.","Katharine Kenny","Thank you, Craig.","Craig Kennison","And my question is just a follow-up on the prequalifying buyers online, could you share more detail on what is required to do that, how long it takes and how you plan to handle sort of a disappointing outcomes and if someone who doesn\u2019t get what they want? Thanks.","Tom Folliard","Yes. So like I said we are currently just testing it, getting ready to put it in ten stores, really what we want to do is, we are going to a prequalify them or they come into the store. We have the sales consultant involved in the process. So if someone\u2019s decline, we can \u2013 we will contact the customer. And again, the goal will be not only to give them an approval, but to also transition them into the store at this point.","Craig Kennison","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt Fassler with Goldman Sachs.","Matt Fassler","Thanks a lot and good morning. If you think about the lower subprime penetration, this is a bit of an acceleration in the decline year-on-year in terms of penetration and do you expect declines to persist at this level, do you feel that your third-party providers are seeing similar experience to you and are in the process of pulling back further, do you feel like you have reached a stable level here?","Tom Folliard","Yes. Matt, it\u2019s hard to say what we expect in the future. As I have always said our goal is to have sustainable partners that are there for our customers and can provide a wide range of financing. In the quarter though we did see one line in particular a pullback and it was Santander I mean you have seen them out in the public domain, talking about how they are pulling back in sub-prime auto, letting other business to other folks. So it\u2019s not inconsistent with what they have been saying in the public domain. So as far as what they will do going forward, I could say we saw a couple of different things happened during the quarter. And I feel like it stabilized during the quarter. But looking forward, it\u2019s their business, they are going to manage their portfolio as they see fit. And if they determine they need to dial back or get more aggressive, they are going to do that. I think Matt there is \u2013 out of the long time you know that sub-prime as a percentage of our total sales has at one point, it was pretty much zero. It\u2019s been as high as 19 in a year and then I think last year, we ended at 16 or 16 for the year. So wherever it ends up is going to be a result of a whole bunch of different factors, lender behavior, applicant flow, but what we have always talked about with this phase is, we believe each customer is almost 100% incremental. Remember also that these points of sale are also significantly less profitable, that\u2019s one of the reasons we wanted to point out that if you take out the decline of 2 points or 2.5 points, whatever it was in the quarter, then the rest of our business actually grew by 3.6%. And if you look at our mix of business as a base from which to grow, this is actually a better base from which to grow than if we go back when 19% of our sales were Tier 3. Again, we believe that 100% of it or almost 100% of it is incremental because of the way we were up we flow financing from lender to lender. But at the same time, it\u2019s going to move around based on a whole bunch of different factors.","Matt Fassler","Totally understood and if I could just follow-up very briefly on this point, to the extent that Tier 2 extensions fell a bit and you talked about more consumers coming in with their own \u2013 other cash for their own versus credit, is there \u2013 are there other competitors, we are kind of hearing two different things in this sense, is to some degree, interest among low end is down and their willingness to extend credit, to the low income consumers down, on the other it does seem like perhaps on this competing away, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the middle part of the market or other consumers who might otherwise shop through Tier 2, so any kind of holistic comments on whether the competition is increasing in any part of the credit spectrum?","Tom Folliard","Well firstly, do remember that traffic of that FICO score applicant is down, so it kind of starts with traffic, I will let Tom comment on competition.","Tom Reedy","Yes. As far as Tier 2 goes Matt, I think we mentioned last quarter that we thought some of the Tier 3 degradation was due to their Tier 2s aggressiveness or at least there is the competitiveness. We have not seen any degradation in the quality of offers that the Tier \u2013 our Tier 2 partners are providing or the aggressiveness or even their conversion to sale rate, which in fact it\u2019s better than it has been in the past couple of years. It\u2019s just they are not seeing quite the same volume they were before. So the decline in Tier 2, I would say completely on the flow of traffic and we are very happy with how they have been performing in the quarter. We were looking on that but\u2026","Matt Fassler","And the final follow-up, to the extent that Tier 3 traffic is down or are these consumers essentially anticipating a lot of credit availability given that this has been perhaps, brewing the market for a little while or is that customer finding a better deal elsewhere saying buy here, pay here channel or somewhere like that?","Tom Reedy","It\u2019s really \u2013 that\u2019s almost impossible for us to tell, Matt.","Matt Fassler","Okay. Thank you.","Tom Folliard","Thank you, Matt.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Montani with Evercore ISI.","Michael Montani","Hi guys. Good morning. Just wanted to ask if I could, can you provide some additional color on the recovery rate experience versus gross charge-offs in the quarter, specifically as it relates to the provisioning?","Tom Folliard","I can give you a little color on the recovery rate. It was down about 5 points year-over-year, so it\u2019s 55-ish last year, 50 this year.","Michael Montani","Okay, got it. Thank you. And then if I could also, can you provide the \u2013 an update on the CAF Tier 3 pilot that you all have been doing, what was the penetration there, how was the trending and a related question given that the Tier 3 penetration rate is down, do you feel the need to add additional lenders in that space or take on additional originations in that space?","Tom Folliard","Sure. As far as our Tier 3 activity, I would characterize it as steady as she goes. We are comfortable continuing at the same pace that we have been running at, which is roughly 5% of the Tier 3 volume, getting done at the stores. There is really no news there. I think the rationale for doing this program is still good, it still holds true. It\u2019s not about driving additional sales, it\u2019s more about knowledge, risk mitigation and some profitability. As far as looking at our other Tier 3 lenders, we will do that from time to time. We have \u2013 we test lenders when it makes sense. That space though is a little different than the Tier 2 space. I think there is fewer people that are equipped to do it on a national scale. And we are very concerned about making sure we are doing, we are working with partners who are experienced, credible and are going to have a sustainable business and be there. So we are not going to be interested and bringing a new player in that is too risky.","Michael Montani","And if I could just, lastly ask the penetration from your website, I was there recently and saw a low-40% range of SUV truck, kind of crossover and van versus sedans being obviously high-50s, when you look at new vehicle SAAR, it\u2019s basically the inverse, with 60% kind of SUV and truck, can you guys give us kind of what that average number would have been for you all during the quarter because just from what I can gather, that could have been a several hundreds of headwind to demand as well, if you assume the same dynamics in the used market as you get on new?","Tom Folliard","Are you asking if our mix should be as same as new?","Michael Montani","I am just asking for the quarter, what\u2019s the fair way to look at your SUV and truck mix, Tom, broadly speaking as you included crossovers and do you feel...?","Tom Folliard","We haven\u2019t looked at it like that, I mean recently, so I couldn\u2019t give that number to you off the top of my head, what I will tell you is we have always been a demand driven inventory model. So what you see on our \u2013 and we are big enough and have enough scale that has inventory turns. We are pretty good at going out and finding it. Occasionally, there are some pockets where we don\u2019t think it\u2019s a great deal for our customers so we might be in the light in a particular area. But what you see as an overall percent of sales for the company is largely driven by consumer demand and our inventory turns. On a pace of 600,000-ish cars a year, about half of which we have to buy offsite and half of which we buy through the appraisal line approximately. We are going to buy what customers are buying from us and replenish at that same pace. So I don\u2019t expect us to match up exactly with new car sales.","Michael Montani","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Levin with Deutsche Bank.","Mike Levin","Good morning everybody. I wanted to kind of see what you guys were seeing in terms of the ramp-up of mature store base, less than 5 years old, that\u2019s in the comps at this point, maybe it\u2019s about 30% of your store base, how are those maturing and kind of ramping up at this point in terms of their support of same-store sales and leveraging SG&A at this point or are they still kind of lagging in a bit of the drag?","Tom Reedy","So I think if you \u2013 first, our leverage in SG&A in any given quarter, that\u2019s going to largely driven by comps in that quarter, particularly for a company that\u2019s in a growth mode like we have been over the last several years and plan to be over the next several. But in terms of the performance of the newer stores, if you take a step back and you look at since we restarted growth in 2011, so fiscal 2011, we have increased our store count by 50%. So we had about 100 stores. We have a little over 150 now and over that same timeframe our net earnings are up by 65% and our EPS is up by 84%. So I mean, I think if we really step back and look at it that way, they are clearly delivering outsized returns and returns that justify continuing to build stores. So we are very pleased with the performance of the stores. They are at or above our financial expectation as a group. And I am glad you asked the question over a longer period of time of 5 years, you go back to 2011 and look at it, again the numbers are store base up 50%, net earnings up 65% and EPS up 84%.","Mike Levin","Got it. And it was the first quarter, you guys held gross profit per used units flat on a year-over-year basis in about a year, just wondering what you are seeing there in terms of the gives and takes versus adding some more volume?","Tom Reedy","Yes. So I think what we are all \u2013 a couple of dollars, year-over-year, quarter \u2013 last quarter, we were about $39 off and we have said there is a range. We think this is an area where we excel from an inventory management standpoint and feel like that we can continue that range, staying in that range and keep it fairly tight. Now that being said, we will constantly be testing and the looking at trade-offs if you lower the gross profit, what\u2019s the sales that you get back from that, all of the idea of looking also what your total gross profit is if you can get to. So again, we will continue to test but we feel like where we are right now is still the same, it\u2019s sustainable.","Mike Levin","Got it. And then just lastly, it was interesting to see that direct expense at CAF move up sequentially in Q1, we have seen it usually seasonally take the tick down from 4Q to Q1, is there anything in particular to read through there and is this kind of the level we should expect going forward?","Tom Folliard","There is some stock based impact there as well just like there is in the \u2013 but there is nothing extraordinary going on.","Mike Levin","Got it, okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Irina Hodakovsky with KeyBanc.","Irina Hodakovsky","Good morning everyone. We are waiting for Katharine to join us for the parade tomorrow, we think you should let her come visit us\u2026","Katharine Kenny","Thank you.","Tom Folliard","She is the one...","Irina Hodakovsky","Absolutely and I know we have brought up cabs [ph] with her in the past, so definitely we would love to hear here for the parade, she should join in. We wanted to ask a couple of questions on the Tier 3 a little bit more into that, if you were to put a weight impact on lower Tier 3 traffic versus lower application approval rates, as you mentioned, some of your partners pulling back, how would you weigh that?","Tom Folliard","Sure. And let me be a little more clear, it\u2019s not approval rate, we \u2013 if you look at the percent of customers that are up in approval of some kind in the stores that\u2019s well above 90%, what we are seeing is the decline \u2013 a degradation in I guess both quality of the offers, meaning they might be asking for a little bit more money down or they are asking for stipulations and particularly we have seen a step-up in that with one of the lenders there is an increase in asking for proof of income, asking for proof of residence, asking for proof of phone number, things like that. So it\u2019s not really a change in the number of approvals, but the quality of approvals and therefore, the ability the customer to accept or the willingness for the customer to accept it. And as far as the ratio, I think I would say that I can\u2019t \u2013 we don\u2019t want to be super excited about it because it\u2019s not easy to calculate. But I think the preponderance of the change is due to the change in behavior, call it, two-third and a third to the traffic. And I think there \u2013 I mentioned traffic earlier as it relates to this space. I am not giving too many specifics, what I said was, we convert these customers at a significantly lower rate than we do non-Tier 3 customers. So if you just think about it that way, it takes more flow of customers to sell one car than it does to sell one car of a non-Tier 3 customer. So if we are down by 2.5 points in Tier 3 percent of sales, it represents a disproportionately higher percentage of traffic than the sale that it generates.","Irina Hodakovsky","That makes sense. Did you see any geographical concentration in lower traffic and sub-prime?","Tom Folliard","Yes, we don\u2019t comment on geography.","Irina Hodakovsky","Got it. Thank you very much.","Tom Folliard","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Seth Basham with Wedbush.","Seth Basham","Thanks a lot and good morning. My question is on the wholesale business. We have seen some softening trends there for the last couple of quarters in terms of wholesale to retail unit ratio as well as profit per unit. Can you give us a sense of what\u2019s driving some of that softness and how you expect that business to perform through the balance of the year?","Tom Folliard","Yes. Seth, I think if you look out long-term for us, wholesale and retail pretty much grow at about the same pace. And this time, in this quarter, retail grew about 4, wholesale grew about 2. We don\u2019t feel like there is anything really extraordinary to note even the profit, the gross profit margin is off a little bit, but again just like the retail side, that\u2019s within a range and there is really nothing extraordinary to note from that.","Seth Basham","Okay. What is your buy ratio? How has that been trending? And do you see more competition to acquire vehicles?","Tom Folliard","Yes. The buy rate is still around 30%, which has been a historical high. That\u2019s similar to what it was last quarter, it\u2019s to get that again this quarter. So, I would say that we haven\u2019t seen any indication where customers are choosing to take their vehicles other places and have them purchased by other dealers.","Seth Basham","Okay, thank you very much.","Tom Folliard","You bet.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rick Nelson with Stephens.","Rick Nelson","Thanks. Good morning. Is there a way to size up the exposure on the wholesale side of the business to sub-prime?","Bill Nash","I am not sure your question, Rick. Are you saying the...","Rick Nelson","Tom, it would seem here the customers that participate in the wholesale auctions, higher mileage, older vehicles would be perhaps even more dependent on sub-prime finance for them to stimulate sales?","Tom Folliard","Oh yes, that\u2019s very difficult for us to ascertain with our customer base. I can tell you that we have, we have continued to see very, very strong attendance at our auctions and very, very strong sell-through rates. We have talked about this before and these numbers really haven\u2019t moved very much. We are 98%, 99%ish sell-through rate through the auctions, turning our inventory more than 35 times a year. Our ratio, so our dealer ratio has been very, very strong. I think it\u2019s 1.3 to 1, some of the strongest ratios we have seen. So, we haven\u2019t seen any softening in the demand through our auctions, but you could then relate back to some of the things that we are hearing about in Tier 3.","Rick Nelson","Got it. Okay, thanks a lot. Good luck.","Tom Folliard","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paresh Jain with Morgan Stanley.","Paresh Jain","Good morning, everyone. Couple of questions. The first one on CAF and going back to something you said earlier, you mentioned you were a bit more aggressive in the last 2 years with your CAF offers and that\u2019s leading to some increase in loan loss provisions. And yet when we look at the securitization, the average FICO score there has been impressively been around 700, so just trying to reconcile that if you can provide some color there?","Tom Reedy","I think I may not have done a great job explaining it earlier. But in 2013, we began getting more aggressive with the high FICO customers. Our current lowest invest rate is still below 2% today. So, what we saw as an increase in the volume of people at the very highest end of the credit spectrum, which was \u2013 have the effect of potentially bringing down our loss expectations. And so over the last 2 years, we have been trying to manage back towards a range that we have been comfortable with for a long time in the securitization market. So, you could almost think of that as a bit of a barbell effect. You wouldn\u2019t see a dramatic step down in the overall FICO, because we are adding it at the top end and the lower end.","Paresh Jain","Understood. Thanks for the color. And then a question on traffic, a superstore, obviously, helps with the conversion rate, but traffic has been an issue for a few quarters now. And at the same time, readers\u2019 report suggests industry retail sales are growing at a healthy clip. So, is that because of these aggregate of websites taking traffic elsewhere? And if so, would you consider having a bigger presence on aggregated websites?","Tom Folliard","I am sorry, we would actually consider any website and we have tried several. We have been on all of the big ones. We are on \u2013 we continue to test, I think all of our cars are currently on Car Gurus. So, we have tested all the aggregators and we will use anything that helps us drive incremental sales and delivers a good return. One additional comment on traffic, Bill mentioned some of this earlier is it\u2019s been widely reported that customers are visiting less stores before they buy. So, it only makes sense that customers who show up would be more likely to buy. And as I have said, we think comps will be driven by traffic and conversion. It\u2019s not going to always line up and it doesn\u2019t matter to us which way to get it. So, lot of the efforts we are making around developing a new website given the customer more digital capability are \u2013 those efforts are to make sure that customers get more information, do more research, are more prepared. It\u2019s clear that that\u2019s what they want to do and we want to be in a position to do that for them. So, when they show up, they are more likely to buy.","Paresh Jain","Got it. Thank you.","Tom Folliard","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Armstrong with CL King Associates.","Bill Armstrong","Good morning, everyone. The charge-off, the increase in charge-off, was there any particular concentration in the profile of customers that you saw with these charge-offs or was this more driven by the lower recovery rate since this is the net number?","Tom Folliard","Yes, I think this quarter we feel like it was driven by the recovery \u2013 it\u2019s a combination of both, but the recovery rates probably had a little more weight this quarter. And as far as any specifics around customers, we really don\u2019t have anything.","Bill Armstrong","Okay. And then with the recovery rate going down, is that simply a function of the Manheim or overall wholesale prices softening up a little bit during the quarter or were there some mix issues as well? Are you getting more sedans versus SUVs in the charge-off mix?","Tom Folliard","No, I think it\u2019s just \u2013 it\u2019s a by-product of overall pricing in the wholesale market. As you probably know, when we repo cars, we typically sell them off at our auctions and we realize whatever the auction market is delivering at that point in time. And as I said, year-over-year, we are down about 5 points in that wholesale recovery rate. And we never really see much mix impact on the recovery rate that\u2019s always because it\u2019s a pretty big sample. It\u2019s generally going to be a macro trend that\u2019s going to impact the recovery rate.","Bill Armstrong","Got it, okay. Thank you.","Tom Folliard","Thank you.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of David Whiston with Morningstar.","David Whiston","Good morning. Just wanted to go back I think to an answer on an earlier question, I was trying to ascertain why applications in traffic are falling at the lower end of the credit spectrum. And it sounds like you are really just not sure, is that fair?","Tom Folliard","That\u2019s fair.","Tom Reedy","Yes.","David Whiston","Okay. And then on auction prices, would you say are there any particular areas that are rather still too high in your opinion? Are you anticipating a huge falloff as more vehicles come off lease?","Tom Folliard","You are asking about supply now and not recovery rate?","David Whiston","Correct.","Tom Folliard","We have talked about lease volume in the past. And this past year, leases were 32% of used cars \u2013 of new car sales, roughly. That means you will see that flow come back in the next 3 years, 2 or 3 years. We have seen some increase this year, but I think we will see big increases in lease turn-ins in the next couple of years, not so much this year so far.","David Whiston","Okay, thank you.","Tom Folliard","Thank you.","Operator","We do have a follow-up question from the line of Matt Fassler with Goldman Sachs.","Matt Fassler","Thanks a lot. Just got back in line. So, my first question relates to stock comp, the number was up big year-on-year. Last year, Q1 had been a pretty big number too. If you look back over time, there hasn\u2019t necessarily been that much seasonality at the stock comp and at the moment in time, the stock has been under some pressure, I was a bit surprised to see the number increase so much over anything you have had in the past, so can you talk about what that related to, please?","Tom Folliard","Yes. I mean, what you got to look at, Matt, is the year-over-year change in the stock price. So, I am not sure exactly what happened in the year ago quarter, but the lion\u2019s share of the difference is going to be arising from the difference in the change this year versus the change last year\u2019s first quarter\u2026.","Tom Reedy","And the change in the number of people.","Tom Folliard","And the change in the number of folks that are getting.","Matt Fassler","Is it the year-on-year change in the stock price, because year-on-year kind of today to exactly a year, got stuff down more than 20%. So, is it the magnitude of comp that\u2019s being dumped through stock? Is it \u2013 does it have to do with exercise prices on options? What was that \u2013 what would the number be, what would the driver be to take the dollars up so much?","Tom Folliard","It\u2019s largely related to our restricted stock program that the majority of our associates get, because those are going to fluctuate with the market value of the stock. And what you have to look at is not the year-over-year stock price, but the year-over-year change in stock price during the particular quarter.","Matt Fassler","Got it. Okay. So, to the extent that you might have started lower and moved higher that would have moved higher. Okay, we can follow-up. It\u2019s a very big number and frankly, I think most of the shortfall versus consensus probably could be traced to that line item. Another question, since I have you, SUVs as a percent of the mix recovered nicely and do you feel like your ability to buy those cars at prices that you like is essentially back or the markets normalizing? Is your ability to navigate those dynamics improved as we have moved into 2016 here?","Tom Folliard","Yes. I think to what Tom spoke about earlier, we are going to get the mix in there based off of consumer demand. Are we are able to get that inventory? Yes, we feel like we are able to get it. I still think it\u2019s probably a little bit high. But again, we are not having issues or troubles sourcing it.","Matt Fassler","And then finally a question on one financial detail, so you have this new disclosure on the other revenue and gross profit item essentially, the new vehicles plus the service piece is baked in there. So, the year-on-year increase in other gross profit is a bit bigger than what we can track explicitly to the higher warranty revenue and the lower third-party fees. I think you take those out and there is still a few million dollars. Is that all related to presumably lower losses or better grosses on new plus higher service gross profit or is there anything else from the number that would move it higher?","Tom Reedy","Matt, I think you hit it on the head. The [indiscernible] are up a little bit better than sales, because we have got some more margin in there and obviously the finance penetration is causing us to be favorable on that. And there is some service favorability in there that makes \u2013 that\u2019s pretty much makes up the difference.","Matt Fassler","But nothing out of the ordinary, nothing extraordinary one-time, et cetera?","Tom Reedy","Yes, deeper than we expected and we did a little better than we expected.","Matt Fassler","Got it. Okay, thank you so much.","Tom Reedy","Thanks, Matt.","Operator","You have a follow-up question from the line of Irina Hodakovsky with KeyBanc. Irene, your line is open. Please proceed with your question.","Irina Hodakovsky","Sorry about that. My question is also around SG&A. That line number was much higher than anyone anticipated. And if you could just maybe tell us how much of that you expect to stay and continue of course the higher store count and how much of that is something specific to the quarter than we can expect to improve going forward?","Tom Folliard","I think there was an increase of about $30 million and a large portion of that is attributable to new stores and store growth as a growth company. And then I highlighted in the opening comments, we had about $7 million or $36 per unit on share based comp and then we also had a one-time, where we had some hail damage in some of our Texas stores that was about $18 per unit increase as well.","Irina Hodakovsky","Alright. Thank you very much.","Tom Folliard","Thanks.","Operator","You also have a follow-up question from the line of Michael Montani with Evercore ISI.","Michael Montani","Hey, guys. Thanks. Just wanted to talk a bit if I could about the work you have been doing on the website, I think there was a re-launch in April and what have you seen from that that might be encouraging or incremental to justify kind of the investments in the work that you all have been doing?","Tom Folliard","Yes. So, I think it\u2019s a little early on, but what I will tell you is one of the big drivers that we are looking for is what we call lead. So, it\u2019s point to our customer either e-mails us, it sets an appointment, calls us and our goal with the new website is to make sure that we generate more leads, because leads are highly correlated to sales. So, ultimately, you want to drive traffic. Traffic will then drive the leads. We are at the point now where we are trying to figure out how those leads convert in comparison to the old website. We feel good about the leads it\u2019s generating, but again we are trying to understand the conversion of those leads.","Michael Montani","And then also can you update us on the thinking around the home delivery testing and then when might we be in a position to get a full transaction done online if that is you can hope?","Tom Folliard","Yes. So, the home delivery, we have referenced that in the last call. We did do a test. We have since pulled back on the test. We are looking at how to better operationalize that and we will be coming out with another test later this fall on the home delivery. As far as the full transaction online, that\u2019s something that we will continue to explore. Like I said earlier today, we started looking online financing as a component of that. And again, part of that will also be driven by the consumer demand and need for doing the whole transaction online as well as making sure that we stay within the state restrictions of what can be done online and what can\u2019t be done online.","Michael Montani","Thank you.","Operator","We have a follow-up question from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets.","Scot Ciccarelli","Hi, guys. It seems like the thing to do today. I did have a question regarding buyback expectations. I thought the general plan was to do a pretty steady run-rate quarter-after-quarter, but obviously the buyback was a little bit softer than I think the pattern we have seen recently. What\u2019s the general idea moving forward? Is it going to be more of an opportunistic pattern or it should be a relatively steady run-rate from what we just saw in 1Q?","Tom Folliard","Yes, Scot. I think, it\u2019s \u2013 our goal as we have talked about before is to be kind of a steady player in there, but we are going to have some latitude around how aggressive we are based on where the stock price is in our view evaluation. As we talked about, we are targeting a certain capital structure that debt to capital, excluding the non-recourse stuff and account receivables of 35% to 45%. A quarter or so ago, we got up to the bottom end of that range. So, it would be natural to see a little bit of a tapering off as we have moved from a mode of moving to a newer capital structure, a more leveraged capital structure to one of maintaining that capital structure. That said, with the amount of cash that we have generated and becoming all things staying equal, the amount of cash we generate, the amount of growth we are doing, we would expect to continue to need to repurchase shares and add debt into the capital structure to maintain that. So, I would say, our expectation is to be in the market on a pretty consistent basis going forward, but we do have some parameters around our program that allow us to be more or less aggressive depending on market conditions.","Scot Ciccarelli","Okay. So, the change in pace is more a function of kind of getting to that lower end of the cap structure rather than your assessment of the value of the stocks, I thought the other thing you just said, Tom, was regarding being opportunistic?","Tom Folliard","Yes, going from moving toward the capital structure to maintaining it. So, that would have a natural change of pace. But as I said, we are \u2013 I think we ended the quarter a little bit below this quarter. So, we have got that latitude of some 10 points that we will be working with them.","Scot Ciccarelli","Got it. Okay, thanks guys.","Tom Folliard","Thanks, Scot.","Operator","Your next follow-up comes from the line of Mike Levin with Deutsche Bank.","Mike Levin","Hey, guys. Thanks again. Just wanted to kind of get your feelings around the recovery rates that have been down on auto IBS across the market and for you guys this quarter. Is that playing a role in some of the tightening standards that you are seeing? How do you think that\u2019s kind of going to progress going forward in terms of credit availability and cost of borrowing for your securitizations?","Tom Folliard","I guess, I would point to \u2013 we have been doing securitization, independent securitizations for over 13 years now and we have been able to manage through a lot of different market conditions, including recovery rates that are lower than what they are today. That said the structure and the enhancement in the deal might need to be modified if loss, if the perceived losses in the rating agency size change. What that usually means though is the change in the over-collateralization that gets built into the deals and builds over time, meaning we give money back a little bit slower. But in general, we have been \u2013 we will be able to maintain a pretty solid program through a lot of different environments. As far as our partner lenders, have you asked them about how they view that in their tightening, but again, they \u2013 I think, probably more of the impact is what they are experiencing in their portfolio than the overall wholesale market.","Mike Levin","Got it. And if I remember correctly, a couple of years ago, when Santander did some pulling back, you guys added some lenders to the platform. Are you considering that now as well?","Tom Folliard","Yes. As I mentioned earlier, we would \u2013 we will test partners to the extent it makes sense for us. But as I also said, in this space, I think we need to be much more careful about who we are doing business with and make sure that we have established partners that can be reliable source of financing for our customers over a longer period of time. I know it\u2019s been talked to a lot of players out there that are behaving aggressively. Santander has talked about that as well and that they are willing to let some of them get the business. But we are very focused on \u2013 in the right place for our customers and as I said, we will test as it is appropriate, but not many people have the national scale that we would need.","Mike Levin","Understood.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Bottiglieri with Wolfe Research.","Chris Bottiglieri","Hi guys. Thanks for taking my question. I was hoping to follow-up on your CapEx guidance plan, I think last quarter, you took it up a little bit for the year, can you kind of explain that again, kind of how you said playing out the course of the year and what exactly that relates to?","Tom Folliard","Yes. I think and you saw a step-up a bit versus recent years, a lot of that is due to timing of what we expect land acquisitions to do over the next year. I really wouldn\u2019t read into it too much as far as the existing stores or anything. We are working on a pipeline of many, many different locations, the next 3 years to 4 years of growth and our ability to acquire land is different in every situation. And I think as we look forward this year, we just saw a little bit heavier land acquisition than we have done in the past. And there is a lot of timing in there too as well, so if you look at the tail end of this year, there will be significant investment in the openings that are coming the following year. So that\u2019s just our best guess that timing over the next 12 months.","Chris Bottiglieri","Got it. Does that give you flexibility to uptake your store opening plan or is that just nothing read into there?","Tom Folliard","No, nothing to read into there, we have announced what our projections are and we are sticking to them.","Chris Bottiglieri","Okay. And then one follow-up, just want to get your overall thoughts in the whole awfully supply that\u2019s surging, I mean you are already sourcing about 77% of your units 0.4, which was really impressive, is there any reason to think that the added off-lease supply would actually accelerate that mix or is it really just instead of sourcing trade-ins, you are outsourcing off-lease supply like how do you think about that?","Tom Folliard","Yes. I kind of think they are unrelated we are going to drive \u2013 try to drive as much as we can through our own appraisal lane. I think when the off-lease supply starts to come back, like Tom said earlier, we haven\u2019t seen a big off-lease supply coming back into the auction houses, but certainly when it does come back in, we will be in a position to buy them because we turn our inventory so quickly. If there are good deals we will be able to realize those good deals for our customers. So we kind of think about them separately, appraisal lane versus off-site.","Tom Reedy","But historically, when there has been a big lease volume and it comes back at the sale, we are usually in a pretty good position to take advantage of it. And just on a side note, it does organize the cars a lot better at the auction.","Chris Bottiglieri","And how does the organization help, can you maybe just walk through that, you can play in better or?","Tom Reedy","Sure. In any given year, there is going to be \u2013 people are getting out of their car let\u2019s say, every 3 years, 4 years, 5 years. Well, when it\u2019s leasing, it\u2019s pretty programmed that they are going to get out at a certain time. And a lot of those cars go back through whoever the lessor was. And then those lessors, then run big long lanes at the auction as opposed to those same cars, which might end up at the auction otherwise are spread out. And GMAC could be running 1,000 cars in a row.","Chris Bottiglieri","Interesting. Okay cool. Thank you very much for the commentary. I appreciate that.","Tom Reedy","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. That concludes the Q&A session. I would now like to turn the conference back to the presenters for any closing remarks.","Tom Folliard","Thank you very much. I want to thank everyone for joining the call today. And of course, I want to thank all of our associates for all they do everyday to make CarMax such a great success. And we will talk to you again next quarter.

[Operator Instructions] Thank you. ","I would now like to turn the call over to Katharine Kenny, Vice President, Investor Relations.","Katharine Kenny","Thank you, and good morning. Thank you all for joining our fiscal third quarter earnings conference call. On the call with me today is Bill Nash, our President and Chief Executive Officer, who by the way is very proud, along with Cliff Wood, and our many CarMax JMU alumni, of the Dukes, who are playing in the FCS National Championship. And of course with us is Tom Reedy, our Executive Vice President and CFO.","Before we begin, let me remind you that our statements today regarding the company\u2019s future business plans, prospects and financial performance are forward-looking statements that we make pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Thank you so much. I\u2019ll turn the call over to Bill.","Bill Nash","Good morning everyone. Katharine, I was not going to mention JMU since we\u2019re a little bit more team agnostic now that Folliard has left, but since you did mention it, I\u2019m excited about it and I wish them well. For today\u2019s call, I will first review the key highlights of the quarter, then I\u2019ll turn the call over to Tom Reedy to cover financing, and then I\u2019ll close the call before Q&A with a brief update on some of our new initiatives.","As you read in our press release this morning, our total used unit comps for the third quarter increased by 5.4% and total used units grew by 9.1%. Total used units were driven by strong improvement conversion as well as by a small increase in store traffic. We believe the increase in used units was due to a variety of factors. These include improved store execution, our website redesign and related online capabilities which have made it easier for our customers to submit leads. ","We continue to be very pleased with our core business as we again saw headwinds from tier three sales. The estimate used unit comps for our non-tier three customers were again significantly stronger this quarter at 9.8%. Our total web traffic was flat compared with the prior year quarter, while web leads performed well in the quarter. We continue to see a positive response to the website, with increased activity such as engagement with the search tool and car pages, as well as submitting leads. Our goal is to drive leads and convert more customers from the website to the store and finally to a sale.","Our wholesale units declined by approximately 2% in the third quarter. This was driven by a decrease in appraisal traffic, partially offset by the growth in our store base and a higher buy rate. The decline in industry new vehicle sales during the recession is affecting the supply of older vehicles. Remember, we saw this dynamic in our core retail business following the recession. ","We continue to maintain a consistent gross profit per used unit at $21.55 compared to $21.60 in the third quarter of last year. Gross profit per wholesale unit decreased to $900 compared to $949 in last year\u2019s third quarter. Again, as we reported in the second quarter, last year\u2019s wholesale gross profit per unit was the highest recorded in any third quarter. So like last quarter, it was again a tough comparison. ","A few other topics before I turn the call over to Tom. As a percentage of our sales mix, zero to four year old vehicles fell this quarter to 785 compared to 81% last year, once again as a result of higher customer demand for older and less expensive vehicles. SG&A expenses for the third quarter increased 5.7% to $357 million. This growth partially reflects the 12% or 18 store increase in our base since the beginning of the third quarter of last year. While we reported leverage of approximately $74 per unit, remember that our advertising expense in last year\u2019s third quarter was significantly higher due to the production and rollout of our new brand launch. Absent this increased spend in the prior year, leverage was modestly positive. Other overhead costs were up year-over-year, reflecting our continued investment in strategic initiatives.","Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Tom.","Tom Reedy","Thanks Bill. Good morning everybody. In recent quarters we\u2019ve discussed the trend of year-over-year increases in credit applications from customers at the higher end of the credit spectrum and less application volume at the lower end and we saw this continue in the third quarter. We recently purchased credit bureau data related to auto credit inquiries in the marketplace and our analysis of this data suggests that this trend is not unique to CarMax. This application mix growth in CAF\u2019s net penetration which increased to 45% compared with 43.3% in last year\u2019s third quarter. ","Net loans originated in the quarter rose more than 9% year-over-year to $1.3 billion due to a combination of CarMax sales growth and the higher penetration, partially offset by our lower average selling prices. In addition, as you would expect, the higher credit mix applications drove growth in the portion of sales where customers paid cash or brought their own financing. ","Tier two penetration fell year-over-year in the quarter to 15.7% from 16.9%. But just as we said last quarter, our tier two lenders continue to provide strong offers based on what we\u2019ve observed in customer conversion. Tier three sales mix was 10.2% of used unit sales compared to 13.8% for the same period last year. This decrease in penetration continues to be due to the same factors, credit tightening early in the year and lower application volumes. Performance by our tier three partners however has been consistent since the middle of Q1. ","CAF income fell 3.2% to about $89 million compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2016, while average managed receivables grew by 11% to $10.3 billion. The provision for loan losses increased and the portfolio interest margin decreased very modestly. During the third quarter, we continue to see higher losses experience. Our ending allowance for loan losses at $115 million was 1.1% of any managed receivables compared to 1.08% last quarter and 0.97% in last year\u2019s third quarter. This level of losses is a departure from our experience in recent years. However, losses in the last several years have been quite favorable. The current level of loan loss reserve is consistent with our range of expectations given our origination strategy and portfolio mix. ","For loans originated during the quarter, the weighted average contract rate charged to customers was flat year-over-year at 7.3%. Total interest margin declined slightly to 5.8% of average managed receivables. This compared to 6% in the third quarter of last year and 5.9% sequentially from Q2. During the quarter, we repurchased 3.8 million shares for $199 million. As of the end of Q3 we had $1.7 billion remaining in our stock repurchase authorization. ","Now I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Bill.","Bill Nash","Thanks Tom. During the third quarter, we opened six stores, including two in new markets Boise and Grand Rapids. We also opened four stores in existing markets, Philadelphia, Daytona, and two in San Francisco. Late in the current fourth quarter, we expect to open four more stores; two in our Los Angeles market, one in Murrieta will include a centralized production and auction facility to support our growth in Southern California. In addition, we plan to open two small format stores in the fourth quarter, both in new markets, Mobile, Alabama and Albany, New York. ","Next, I\u2019d like to give an update on our new online offerings and the tests we are conducting to continue to advance the customer experience. First, as we discussed last quarter, we\u2019ve been testing a new online financing capability that has helped our customers get prequalified for a loan. When we talked at the end of the second quarter, we were piloting this product in 13 stores. Towards the end of Q3, we successfully rolled this new capability out to all stores nationwide and we\u2019re pleased with the early results, which includes increased leads.","Second, we continue to test our home delivery offering in Charlotte, North Carolina. As a reminder, home delivery allows the customer to shop for and buy a car at their convenience without coming into the store. We continue to learn about the customer demands and operational scalability, while also ensuring it meets our standards for an exceptional experience. The last update is [regarding] a one store test we\u2019ll be conducting in the fourth quarter. We plan to test a new digital solution for customers who are interested in getting an appraisal value for their vehicle by submitting their vehicle information online without having to come into the store. ","These initiatives position CarMax to deliver more of the car buying experience online and we remain committed to giving the customers the ability to go between the digital and in-store experience whenever and however they would like. While we are constantly working to innovate and improve the business, we are also very focused on being cost conscious and eliminating waste across the entire organization. We continue to look for new opportunities to ensure we are growing in a way that is in the best interest of our customers, associates and shareholders. ","Like last quarter, I remain confident that we\u2019ll continue to lead the industry. We have 23 years of experience to build upon to help us excel into the future. With our great associates, our national footprint, our unparalleled inventory, brand strength and continued focus on improving the customer experience, both online and in-store, no one is in a better position than CarMax to fully deliver the best car buying experience. ","With that I will open up the call for questions, so Victoria?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Sharon Zackfia with William Blair","Sharon Zackfia","Hi, good morning. A question on the search engine optimization you\u2019ve been working on, I think, earnestly this year. I guess I'm a little surprised that web traffic is flattish, given that. So, if you could give us an update on where you stand on search engine optimization and how much of a driver that might really be going forward.","Bill Nash","Sure. Thanks Sharon. So SEO is a big focus for us. The things that we\u2019ve done so far this year to really focus on that, first of all the website which we\u2019ve talked in the past. In addition to the website, recently we\u2019ve been working on some of the design of the website to make sure that search engines can get the information in a quick, time sensitive fashion so that they can pull all the relevant data down. So that\u2019s something that we\u2019ve been working on here more recently. We\u2019ve also been publishing some content that our customers want and expect, but this is an area now that we\u2019ve got the website up, we\u2019ve made some tweaks to it. This is an area that we think still has a lot of opportunity going forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer ","Brian Nagel","Good morning. Nice quarter. My question is on used car unit comps, two parts. I'm going to shove it together. First off, a number of retailers really across the board have discussed some sales disruptions, like the change around the recent presidential election. So I know it's not typical for CarMax to talk about intra-quarter trends, but I thought maybe you could discuss that. And then the second question also relating to car sales, you talked a lot in the prepared comments about some of the internal initiatives. We've clearly seen a sequential improvement in used car unit comps over the past few quarters. From a market standpoint, has CarMax started to benefit yet from the supply of vehicles improving within the industry? Thank you","Bill Nash","Yes, Brian. So on the first question, I really don\u2019t have a comment on that and the Trump effect. On the second part of the question, as it relates to the supply, I absolutely think that we are starting to see the supply come back in the auctions and I think that\u2019s a good thing for CarMax. As that supply comes back, it helps to drive the difference in price between a new car and a late model used car. So while I didn\u2019t highlight that as one of the factors in the prepared remarks, I absolutely think that that\u2019s also a contributing factor. ","Brian Nagel","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Craig Kennison with Baird.","Craig Kennison","Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. It's on the wholesale business, which fell a little bit. Do you think you are seeing your fair share of appraisal traffic or are sellers starting to use some of these alternate channels, which, again, you may have access to with your new strategy? And then on a related note, how does the increase in lease activity, we've got a lot more leased cars today, impact your opportunity for appraisal given those lessees are not selling their car. Thanks.","Bill Nash","Okay. On the wholesale piece, I think that\u2019s more indicative of what I talked about in the early remarks, that as the new car SAAR works its way through from the recession, the shortage of new cars, for us that\u2019s right into seven to nine year old vehicles and you know that\u2019s right in the sweet spot of wholesale. And we saw the same phenomenon earlier on when those cars were zero to four. We saw less of them coming through as appraisal traffic we expect and we\u2019re seeing the same thing come through in the seven to nine year old vehicles. So we think that\u2019s more of a factor of what\u2019s at play there. And I\u2019m sorry the second question, what was it in regards to lease activity?","Craig Kennison","With the increase in overall lease activity, there are a lot of people who have cars that are leased and not therefore for sale. Does that impact your ability in the wholesale business to attract those cars? ","Bill Nash","No, I don\u2019t think so at this point because first of all the leases are just starting to come back at this point and our wholesale cars are generally older. I do think that as the leases come back, that\u2019s a good thing for the core business because that\u2019s a lot more selection of younger vehicles. But I don\u2019t think that\u2019s having a big impact on the wholesale business. ","Craig Kennison","Thanks. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt Fassler with Goldman Sachs","Matthew Fassler","Thanks a lot and good morning. Within the SG&A, other than the advertising, which was down for reasons that you stated, your compensation expense was also quite well controlled. It looks like on an aggregate basis it was up only 3% year on year, this comp and benefits, and up really, barely up on a two-year basis in aggregate dollars despite a big increase in stores. Was there anything related to stock comp, which I know you have sometimes called out, or any other factor, incentive comp, that would have led this number to be so subdued here in the third quarter?","Tom Reedy","Hey Matt. Yes, stock comp actually this quarter is the first time it\u2019s been at a level so small that it\u2019s not worth talking about on a year-over-year basis. But there are some good guys embedded in that comp and benefit number, both some unfavorability last year and some unfavorability this year. But despite that, we still did leverage that line relative to growth in unit sales. You could probably double the percentage increase and it would be a rough idea of what we -- kind of run rate it would be. ","Matthew Fassler","So, in other words, the run rate would have been something like 6% in dollars, normalized for everything, which still would have led you to good leverage.","Tom Reedy","Yes, that\u2019s fair to say.","Matthew Fassler","Got it. That's very helpful. I'll count that as my follow-up and come back if we have more. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Levin with Deutsche Bank.","Mike Levin","Morning everybody. Just wanted to focus on the loss provision rates at CAF for a second. Is there a way that you can talk about, is this factoring in just what you are currently experiencing or does this take into account additional expected declines in used vehicle values moving forward? If it's just now, how much do you think this could continue to move down with used values coming down further from here?","Tom Reedy","Let me hit on a couple of things. One is used values definitely has a impact on loss rates, but historically customer behavior has been a much bigger driver and on an ongoing basis there\u2019s many things moving. So it\u2019s hard to say that that one individual factor could have a dramatic impact on a go-forward basis. As to the determination, every quarter we determine based on what we know we to date rather than based on any kind of speculation, a 12 month look-forward on loss expectation. So as I said, it\u2019s based on historical information that we have and then how we are performing to date relative to that historical performance. So in a quarter where things are moving, you\u2019re going to see us move that loss expectation. We have not in the past when things were going good taken a view to try to get ahead of things and we haven\u2019t done that here as well.","Mike Levin","Got it. Maybe to put that in a little better perspective, these current rates versus history, I know the accounting was different at the time, but could you compare where these loss rates are versus where we were, say, through the crisis?","Tom Reedy","Yeah, I think well through the crisis, we typically try to manage our portfolio to kind of a 2 to 2.5% cumulative net loss rate. And the average life for these loans has been roughly two years as a proxy. So during the recession, we saw loss rates go to double that in the portfolio. But one thing I think I\u2019d point out, after one point, if you look at the size of the loan loss allowance today which is a 12 month look, it\u2019s 1.10%. So if you double that, you can see they were still well within the range of expectation in the zone that we are looking to originate. And something to remember also is that our tier three CAF is also part of that overall loan loss provision and represents almost 10% of it.","Mike Levin","10% of the 1.1%?","Bill Nash","10% of the dollar volume, the $114 million, $115 million of loan loss allowance.","Mike Levin","That\u2019s really helpful. Thank you.","Bill Nash","So when we step back and look at this, yes we\u2019ve seen deterioration relative to recent years, but still not to the point where we were pre-recession. ","Mike Levin","Got it. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets.","Scot Ciccarelli","Good morning, guys. You guys have always talked about tier 3 sales as really being incremental to the core run rate. So my question is, when CAF increases penetration, do you have an estimate what percent of those CAF sales are incremental? So in other words, is CAF financing some people that wouldn't have received credit elsewhere?","Tom Reedy","I think the answer to that is yes and not necessary because we are more aggressive than other folks, but every lender has a way that they look at credit. We think we have ways to look at our applicants and find pockets that work for us that may convert at a better rate because they got a CAF offer than if they get a tier 2 or tier 3 offer. So if you look at the conversion of customers based on a CAF offer versus based on a tier 2 or 3 offer, it\u2019s much more significant. So you would expect that some of the CAF offers would be incremental just because of that phenomenon. ","Scot Ciccarelli","But, Tom, if you had, let's call it 7,600 extra unit sales because of the increase in CAF penetration, is there a percentage you would suggest that was incremental based on the way you guys look at your models?","Tom Reedy","Like I said, there would be some incremental there, but we haven\u2019t shared anything as far as fractions. I can tell you that that percentage would not be expected to be up or down relative to recent years. ","Scot Ciccarelli","Right. Understood. And then related to that, because it has to do with on the credit side, given the rise in interest rates that we\u2019ve seen, I would assume that your funding costs have actually increased. Just how should we generally think about how you guys plan to manage the spread versus moving interest rates too quickly on customers with the potential for negative unit elasticity? Thanks.","Tom Reedy ","Well the nice thing about our business is we can test quickly and we can test pretty accurately in the CAF space. So we have seen an increase in benchmarks in recent weeks I guess if you look at it. And we have taken action to raise rates in certain pockets selectively to offset it to some extent. Now what we\u2019ll need to do is as we look at it going forward to see if the market will allow us to keep those rates up because I\u2019ve said many times we\u2019re going to be a market lender. We\u2019ve got to provide competitive rate to the customers so nobody is getting sour on CarMax over the finance offer they got. And we\u2019ll closely monitor our three day payoffs. We\u2019ll closely monitor conversion as we ramp up rates and we\u2019ll do what the market allows us. But we are - this is something that is just ongoing business as usual for CarMax Auto Finance. We are constantly testing ways to maximize the profit and sales coming from that portfolio. ","Scot Ciccarelli","Okay. Got it. I'll follow-up later. Thank you. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Murphy with Banc of America Merrill Lynch","John Murphy","Good morning, guys. Just a question on supply and the impact potentially on grosses. It seems like there's a lot of the new vehicle dealers that are getting off the stop sale wagon and retailing a lot of used vehicles they had stored on their lots in the short run. So, I'm just curious what you think about supply there. And then, also, as you look at this leasing bubble that's coming over the next three years, where you think we are in that increase in supply. And as you think about those two legs of supply increases, what you think you can do as far as holding your grosses. Are you going to stay committed to this $2,100 to $2,200 range as we see that increase in supply really pick up?","Bill Nash","Yes, John. So on the first part of the question about the stop sales, I don\u2019t really think that\u2019s much of an impact. Lots of dealers have been selling vehicles that have open recalls. While you\u2019ve got the franchise dealers that cannot - by the manufacturer standard, you can\u2019t sell it for that franchise, they still sell other non-brand franchise at those stores. So for me that\u2019s not really - I don\u2019t really see that as either a positive or a negative. I think it\u2019s just continuing on. As far as the lease thing, I said earlier we\u2019re seeing more vehicles come back from the leasing channels and we think it will continue through next year and even into the year after that. And I think we\u2019ve proven over time that we\u2019ve been able to hold our margin throughout many different cycles. Now the only caveat that I would give there is you know we constantly do testing and if we think that moving that margin down would more than pay for itself in units, then we would look at that. And so we will continue to test, but we feel confident that we can continue to maintain those gross profit margins. ","John Murphy","And if I could just follow up, we simply think that if you dropped your gross by 10% you would expect to get at least a 10% pick up in volume or else you wouldn't do it. Is that correct? Or 11% increase in volume to offset that drop in gross? How would you think about that?","Bill Nash","Yes, we would want to see total more than offset the drop than what we see. So it would have to be a win on total gross. ","John Murphy","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Montani with Evercore.","Michael Montani","Hi guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to ask if I could and apologize if I missed it, but what are you seeing now in terms of SUV truck penetration? I think last year it was 23% by your measures and I was looking for it to be maybe low 30s. Could you talk about that?","Bill Nash ","Yeah. So our large SUV mix for the quarter was - excuse me. Our large SUV mix for the quarter was up year-over-year. It\u2019s about 25.7% versus last year\u2019s third quarter was 23.3% so it\u2019s about 250 basis points. It\u2019s up about a point from the second quarter of this year. So the mix is up a little bit, which would inherently drive our ASPs up a little bit, but then because we had a shift in some of the older vehicles, that brought the ASPs down as well acquisition process. Lower acquisition prices brought it down. So SUV mix was up a little bit.","Michael Montani","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Can you talk a little bit about SAAR setting and how its trending in terms of buys that you would do and appraisal weighing versus auction in other areas? Just thinking about big picture, it would seem that you would be in a better position to sort and merchandise given that acquisition cost has come down. I just wanted to see how that\u2019s playing out. ","Bill Nash ","Is this in particular to the large SUVs or just in general?","Michael Montani","No, just in general.","Bill Nash ","Yeah. I think what we are seeing out there is what we typically would see this time of year with fall depreciation. And I think with the fall depreciation obviously is going to lower the acquisition prices. Again, we feel like that\u2019s a good thing for us because as the acquisition prices go down, we just can pass those lower prices onto the customers and there is a bigger delta between new cars and late model used cars, so we think it\u2019s good.","Michael Montani","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rick Nelson with Stephens.","Rick Nelson","Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to ask about third-party lead generators, where you stand with those. And did you do anything different this quarter with the lead generators? ","Bill Nash ","Yes. We have all of our inventory listed on - for the quarter it was on Car Gurus and that was the only site that we had our inventory listed on during the third quarter and we\u2019ll constantly test some different things, but that was the only one during the quarter.","Rick Nelson","Okay. Thank you for that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of James Albertine with Consumer Edge","James Albertine","Great. Thanks for taking the question and good morning, everyone. I wanted to ask, and I know it's early, but certainly we're getting a lot of questions. We hosted a call yesterday on the subject matter in fact. Wanted to understand your thinking and maybe what you're hearing from your advisors as it relates to tax planning for next year and maybe some of the pushes and pulls as you think about the potential deductibility of CapEx or PP&E and maybe the reversal of deducting interest expense, and so forth, as well as the reduction in corporate tax rate. So just any strategy thoughts there would be helpful in helping us frame how you guys are thinking about it relative to peers, even. Thanks.","Bill Nash","Well James, since you had a call yesterday, maybe you should brief us on it because you probably have more information that we do. We really don\u2019t have any thoughts at this point. It\u2019s all so new and there\u2019s so much up in the air. It\u2019s just it\u2019s too early to really talk about.","James Albertine","Okay, great. Thanks. I'll get back in queue.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Armstrong with CL King & Associates.","Bill Armstrong","Good morning, everyone. So you mentioned a small increase in overall traffic into the stores, but you also had a reduction in appraisal traffic. Are you seeing any change in consumer behavior in terms of fewer people coming in with trade-ins? What do you think explains for that apparent disparity?","Bill Nash","I think like you said, we saw a small increase in store traffic and I talked a little bit about store traffic last quarter in that you really can\u2019t look at just store traffic by itself. You really have to look at web traffic and especially for us, leads and store traffic to understand the overall big picture. Consumers are a lot more educated. We know that of the consumers that buy vehicles from us, nine out of 10 of them have already done a lot of research on CarMax.com. So they\u2019re already much better educated. I think on the difference between getting a little bit more store traffic in and get appraisal traffic down. Again, a lot of it is tied to what we\u2019re seeing as the SAAR rate works its way through the bubble. And I think that\u2019s a main driver of why you see some of the appraisal traffic down.","Bill Armstrong","Because they are getting less money for the \u2026","Bill Nash","Just because there aren\u2019t as many. So like I talked about earlier, the seven to nine year old vehicles, there just aren\u2019t as many as there were because seven to nine years ago the new car sales rates were going down. So if there aren\u2019t as many customers that have those cars, they\u2019re obviously not coming in to get them appraised. ","Bill Armstrong","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities.","Seth Basham","Thanks a lot and good morning. You guys called out increase in the mix of sales to higher credit customers and their supply of late-model vehicles, but at the same time you are selling a higher mix of older vehicles. Can you help square away that dynamic, which has occurred for the last two quarters now?","Bill Nash","Yes. I think contrary to what a lot of people think is that your tier 3 customers are going to be the ones buying your late model or your older, less expensive vehicles and for us, that\u2019s just not the case. Majority of the vehicles that we sell of the older, less expensive vehicles are to non-tier 3 customers. So I think what it says is that the consumers are still out there looking for a great deal and they\u2019ve opted to go a little bit older and a little bit cheaper. So I think that explains the dynamic. It\u2019s not just tier 3 customers that would be buying older, less expensive vehicles.","Seth Basham","Okay, that's helpful. And just as a follow-up, considering the increased supply of late-model vehicles, would you expect your mix to shift back to that direction over the next few quarters?","Bill Nash","Seth, we\u2019ll sell whatever the consumers want. So if the consumers want that late model vehicle, then we\u2019ll absolutely adjust our inventory accordingly. If they want to continue to buy older vehicles, then you won\u2019t see that change. So it just depends. It\u2019s all driven by consumer demand.","Seth Basham","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Whiston with Morningstar.","David Whiston","Thanks. Good morning. Just wanted to talk about the future in e-commerce with the pilot programs you are doing. Obviously there are consumers who want this process to be very easy, but at the same time it's still roughly a $20,000 purchase for people. So how willing do you think people are to buy a vehicle without even coming into the store to do a test drive? Is it a small portion of the American public? Is it ultimately going to be a lot of people? I'd love to hear your thoughts on that.","Bill Nash","It\u2019s a good question, David and I think you hit the nail on the head. It\u2019s not an easy transaction. It\u2019s a complicated transaction. That being said, I do think there\u2019s a small subset of customers that want to try that experience. I think for us, we certainly are going to meet those customers wherever and however they want to do business, but I think more importantly is that I think consumers will want to do more of the transaction online in the near term and we will have the ability to not only do more of the transaction online, but it will be a seamless integration into the store. And I think that\u2019s really what we\u2019re focused on. In addition to giving the customers the ability to do everything, it really is okay, you want to do part of it online. Let\u2019s make sure it\u2019s a great experience and then when you walk into the store we just pick up from where you left off and that\u2019s really what we\u2019re focused on. I think that\u2019s really where the consumer demand is going to be in the near term.","David Whiston","Okay, that's helpful. And for my follow-up, I wanted to ask a comment about buybacks. Stock has been near a 52-week high. Are those still full steam ahead?","Tom Reedy ","Pardon me. I didn\u2019t hear the tail end of your question.","David Whiston","The stock is near a 52-week high. Are buybacks still full steam ahead or are you looking to be a bit more cautious on that going forward?","Tom Reedy ","As we\u2019ve discussed before, we take an enlightened averaging in methodology to repurchases. So at any given time, we\u2019re trying to average into the market and maintain our capital structure in the zone that we\u2019ve targeted. You saw that in this quarter we bought back $199 million versus $125 million in Q2. That did represent a little bit of a step up in aggressiveness because we saw some weakness in the stock price, but the parameters we put in place allow for a little bit of that, allows us to be a little more aggressive when the price is weak and a little more conservative when the volume and price is looking strong. But we intend to be in the market on a regular basis.","David Whiston","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paresh Jain with Morgan Stanley.","Paresh Jain","Morning everyone. Just a quick question on inventory resourcing. Would it be fair to say that you currently source about 40% of your inventory from auction? How has that number changed in the last two years, if that's changed at all?","Bill Nash","So when we think about self-sufficiency which is opposite of the auctions, but actually getting it through our own appraisal and we\u2019ve given the range of 40% to 50%, we\u2019re at the lower end of that range, but we\u2019re higher than we were a year ago and we\u2019re very similar to where we are last quarter.","Paresh Jain","And a follow-up on the profitability of the vehicles sourced from auction, has the gap in profitability with those sourced through trade-ins changed at all in the last two years? I think the gap is about hundreds of dollars between the two.","Bill Nash","So the vehicles that we source through our appraisaling are still more profitable than the ones that we source offsite. As you can imagine, you don\u2019t have transportation fees. You don\u2019t have folks going out and incurring expenses, that kind of thing. So there\u2019s still about the same amount of profitability over what they were before.","Paresh Jain","And no change in the last two years in that gap?","Bill Nash","I can\u2019t speak really off the top of my head on the last two years, but it\u2019s been very similar.","Paresh Jain","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Bottiglieri with Wolfe Research.","Chris Bottiglieri","Hi, thanks for taking my question. Did you guys give out the zero to four mix this quarter, like you historically have, and how that compared versus last year?","Bill Nash","Zero to four we were down slightly 81 to 78.","Chris Bottiglieri","Got you. Okay. And then just a follow-up to that, given the scarcity of those cars given supply, I'm wondering if you're holding back more of those vehicles from wholesale to sell it used, if the two are related at all.","Bill Nash","Actually I think that supply is starting to come back on those so we\u2019re seeing more out there. But as far as the selectivity, we\u2019re always looking at selectivity when we purchase a car, whether we designate it wholesale or we put it through. I would say at this point when you\u2019re talking about zero to four year old cars, we really haven\u2019t changed anything recently as far as selectivity goes.","Chris Bottiglieri","I'm sorry. I meant holding back the seven to nines where you had tighter supply. Have you held back some of those from wholesale to retail at this point?","Bill Nash","I don\u2019t think it\u2019s considerably different than what we\u2019ve been doing before. It really depends on the vehicles as they roll through. If they\u2019re good quality vehicles and we can turn them into CarMax cars, then we\u2019re going to do that. But we look at selectivity every single quarter and make the decisions that are appropriate at that point. I wouldn\u2019t say that this one is necessarily - there hasn\u2019t been a big change in this quarter versus other quarters.","Chris Bottiglieri","Okay, great. Then one quick follow-up. Two questions have been asked on auction supply. It seems to me just looking at the auction data that there seems to be a mix of improvement in SUV and truck availability at the auction lanes. Has that been a driver for your business in terms of increased SUV and truck penetration?","Bill Nash","I think it\u2019s, when you see that increased inventory, that will drive the prices down and that probably has a factor. It is a factor into where the customers want to buy the car, depending on how attractive it is from a price standpoint. But again, we really go off of customer demand and if they\u2019re looking for large SUVs and we can get them at prices that they\u2019ll pay, then we\u2019ll put them on our front lot. Just this quarter folks were looking more for older, cheaper cars and so that\u2019s what we did.","Chris Bottiglieri","Okay, that's helpful. Thank you for the commentary.","Operator","We do have a follow up from the line of Matt Fassler with Goldman Sachs.","Matthew Fassler","Thanks a lot. Good morning again. If we were to be able to accurately calculate how new space productivity looked versus a year ago just in terms of raw numbers, what do you think we would see? And how did new store performance compare to your expectations?","Bill Nash","We\u2019re pleased with new store performance. As we\u2019ve talked about in the past, it\u2019s difficult to talk about store productivity when you look at the size of stores that we\u2019re building, when you throw in the small formats, when you look at going into new metro markets where awareness is at different levels. You\u2019re going to have different ramping up. All the new stores are reaching profitability quicker than the old stores because of the GPU and they\u2019re also meeting all of our internal rate of return. So we\u2019re pleased with new store productivity.","Matthew Fassler","Got it. And then, secondly, I know you are far more focused on your customers than on your competition, but we did see one piece of competitive fallout with one of the higher-profile, albeit small, online startups essentially ceasing operations in its prior form and merging with another company. What\u2019s your sense about the competitive environment online? Is it intensifying? Are you starting to see any signs of more rationalization in terms of the kind of offers that your customers can pursue away from CarMax?","Bill Nash","I think first of all just a comment on your first part about the online competitor ceasing operation. I think it goes back to something I talked about earlier which this is not a simple business. This is a hard business. It\u2019s not easy to go out, source inventory for the right amount. It\u2019s not easy to go out and put a cash offer on every single car. And I think that\u2019s just an indication of why some of these folks are struggling. I think competition is hot in both the online space and the traditional and I think our challenge is to make sure that we continue to leverage the equities that have made it successful and them even better and leverage our data and our processes and our systems and our people to continue to widen the gap between us and our competition. ","And like I said earlier, we\u2019ve got 23 years\u2019 worth of experience and 23 years\u2019 worth of data and we\u2019re leveraging that data and tapping into it in ways that we haven\u2019t been able to and haven\u2019t done in the past. So although the competition is hot and heavy, we feel really good about the positon that we\u2019re in and I think ultimately to be as successful as we can be, we do need to make sure that we can be in the online space, but equally important is we\u2019ve got to be in the brick and mortar space. I think you have to do both very, very well and I think we\u2019re positioning ourselves to do just that.","Matthew Fassler","Got it. Thanks so much.","Operator","Your next follow up comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets.","Scot Ciccarelli","Hey, guys. I guess this is a bit of a follow up on Matt's question. But I guess what I'm trying to figure out is, on some of these delivery tests, are there any key differences to what you are trying to do versus the guys like Vroom and Beepi? And also, how is it that you are allowed to close a transaction outside of the dealership? Because I guess I was always under the impression just legally you had to close the transaction at a dealership. Thanks?","Bill Nash","So on the second part of your question, there are some states where you can\u2019t close it outside of the dealership. Our delivery, where we\u2019re doing our tests, that\u2019s obviously not the case. I think as far as differences, one of the difference in our home delivery test is you don\u2019t have to buy the vehicle before we bring it out to you. We\u2019ll bring it to you. You can test drive it at your home and if you decide to purchase it, we can do the transaction right there. That\u2019s different than any other tests that are out there where they make you purchase the vehicle before it\u2019s brought out to you. Again, it\u2019s a small test. We\u2019re trying to understand exactly what the customers want and the good thing is we can adjust the test as we move forward.","Scot Ciccarelli","Got it. Okay. Thanks, guys.","Bill Nash","Hey Scott, I think Tom was just saying, he thinks maybe one online competitors might allow you to \u2026","Tom Reedy ","Yes. There\u2019s one that allows you to test drive, but they also make you give up your car as they\u2019re trying to sell it.","Bill Nash","That\u2019s right.","Scot Ciccarelli","I'm sorry, can you repeat that? It was broken up.","Tom Reedy ","There is one competitor that allows you to test drive as a purchaser, but they\u2019re a C2C enabler and the other part of their business offer is that they take possession of your car while you\u2019re attempting to sell it so you don\u2019t have use of your vehicle.","Bill Nash","Yes. So there\u2019s nobody doing it exactly the way we are from a business to consumer, but to Tom\u2019s point, there\u2019s a C2C that will allow you to test drive without purchasing it beforehand.","Tom Reedy ","I think it\u2019s important. I think when we\u2019re looking at this, we\u2019re trying to make sure we\u2019re not doing anything that inhibits the customer from wanting to transact with us.","Bill Nash","Yes.","Scot Ciccarelli","Got you. Thanks, gentlemen.","Operator","Your next follow up comes from the line of James Albertine with Consumer Edge.","James Albertine","Great. Thanks for taking the follow up here. And then on the same theme, on the online versus your traditional sourcing methods, I was curious, from a qualitative perspective, given you are now pretty far along in terms of your investments digitally, how do you think about operating margin? Are there any differences in the final operating income contribution whether you have sourced the customer through an online channel versus a traditional mechanism? And if you can maybe at a high level talk about what are the differences and pushes and pulls from an expense perspective that we should think about that drive that delta, if there is one?","Bill Nash","So James, I think it\u2019s a little early to be talking about the differences. While we\u2019re committed to expanding our online capability, we really we have such a small test going on home delivery and outside of that, all the other online capabilities customers are utilizing them and then transitioning into the store. So it\u2019s a little early to talk about the economics of one versus the other and the delta.","James Albertine","Okay. Then maybe a quick follow-up. You\u2019ve done a great job of laying out milestones for us historically to think about pilot programs. Are there any additional measures that we should look for in terms of calendar 2017? Any other major investments coming or looming that you thought about and are willing to articulate, at least from a qualitative perspective?","Bill Nash","No, I think the one that I highlight was one that we were going to be doing in the fourth which is the online appraisals and then in the fourth quarter, we\u2019ll highlight any new ones for the upcoming year.","James Albertine","Okay. Great. Thanks again.","Operator","You do have another follow up question from the line of Michael Montani with Evercore.","Michael Montani","Hey, guys, I just wanted to follow up on two things. One is for Tom, if you could just quantify what recovery rates were like in the quarter and contextualize that for us. And then, secondly, what are you seeing in terms of credit availability from some of your third-party lenders? If memory serves, I think it was last March or April that you saw a noteworthy pullback from one of the largest ones.","Tom Reedy","So as far as recovery rates, it\u2019s down a couple of points year over year in the quarter, but as I mentioned, consumer behavior in payments and recovery, them recovering themselves out of trouble tends to be more impactful. And I\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t quite get the tail end of your last question.","Michael Montani","I guess the last question was just, you did the 10% comp if you back out third-party subprime. I guess the question is, do you start to cycle the pullback in March, April, if memory serves? And then, also, what are you seeing in terms of lender behavior from third parties? Does it appear stable at this level or is there further pullback that you can see now? ","Tom Reedy","Sure. As far as cycling, I think in the current period right now we\u2019ll begin to cycle over the trend we began observing in traffic. So remember we\u2019ve been talking for several quarters about seeing fewer application volume at the lower end of the credit spectrum. That started somewhere around this time last year. So that portion of the decrease we\u2019ll start to see some cycling. As I mentioned in my comments, the most recent tightening we saw was in mid Q1 from one of our tier 3 lenders. Since that time they have been behaving very consistently.","If we look at conversion of customers in the tier 3 space, since the middle of Q1 it\u2019s been very consistent. It\u2019s below last year, but it\u2019s been consistent. So yes, all else equal, in April you start to see us rolling over that on a year over year basis. In the tier 2 space, it\u2019s almost exactly the opposite phenomenon. Conversion has been consistently better than last year since the first quarter and as I mentioned, they\u2019re doing a great job of converting the volume that they see. A lot of the mix they\u2019re now foreseeing, a lot of it is from the customer traffic coming through the door. That\u2019s why CAF is up. That\u2019s why other is up and that\u2019s why that tier 2 and 3 are down.","Michael Montani","So, are you guys happy with the third-party subprime where it's at now at around 10%, or could we consider new lenders that might help to grow that again?","Tom Reedy","I think it\u2019s going to be a matter of - obviously it\u2019s going to be a matter what customers come through. We\u2019re happy today with the amount we\u2019re investing in the tier 3 space, which is about $1,000 a car of margin that we give away in order to enable those transactions. The tier 3 space is a lot more fragmented than the more prime space and other lending. We\u2019re happy with the performance of our partners. We test other partners occasionally and to the extent one can add value, we consider bringing them in the mix. But I think if you step back and think about our current base as a platform for growing, it\u2019s a much more profitable dynamic to grow at this mix than to have the mix migrate back to something higher.","Michael Montani","Thank you.","Operator","Your next follow up comes from the line of Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities.","Seth Basham","Thanks for taking the follow-up question. Just thinking about the fact that most of your customers are shopping online before visiting the stores, as you consider the store model of the future what kind of changes are you thinking about? We notice, for example, in the Seattle area you're opening a pretty large megastore, which is likely a reconditioning focused facility in a lower cost area. Is that something you'll consider in other markets too?","Bill Nash","Yes. I think what you\u2019re seeing in Seattle is more driven by the market dynamics and what\u2019s available land wise. Obviously we\u2019re looking at our store prototypes. We\u2019ve got the small format store out there. You\u2019ve seen we\u2019ve opened more of those here more recently. I think it\u2019s something that we\u2019ll stay close to as we better understand the customer desire for transacting more and more parts of the transaction online. But I tell you, it\u2019s not like we have 1,000 stores around the country. We have 169 stores and I think they\u2019re all strategically located and the product we sell, you need space and you need places to build those cars. So I feel very comfortable with our growth strategy, what we\u2019ve done so far and I feel very comfortable with what we\u2019ve got in the pipeline currently.","Seth Basham","All right. Very good. Thank you.","Operator","Your next follow up comes from the line of Mike Levin with Deutsche Bank.","Mike Levin","Thanks, guys. I wanted to follow up on your comments about increasing applications at the high end of the credit spectrum. And you said you also bought some market data that you were taking a look at. Just wondering if you could maybe put a few numbers behind what you are seeing at CarMax, how that compares to what you are seeing within the market. Are you outperforming those increases? And then how we might think about higher credits being a larger percentage of your mix impacting loss rates going forward.","Bill Nash","I\u2019ll start with the last one. We\u2019ll see how it impacts loss rates going forward depending on the environment. It\u2019s way too early to tell. We\u2019re not in a positon to give you any numbers regarding this, but I can give you a little color around what we looked at. We bought data related to auto inquiries, meaning folks that are hitting the bureaus in conjunction with an application for credit for an automobile for the past several years, both through submissions to captives and submissions or inquiries through the major dealer groups. And while we likely started feeling the phenomenon a little earlier, the data is telling us that the lower and lower middle part of the credit spectrum has seen a year over year decline in recent quarters for everybody. As far as the higher credit folks and the growth there, our data appears to show that we are growing a little bit stronger than the rest of them, but there could be a lot of factors between new car mix, used car mix et cetera that drives that. I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s anything really to take away from that.","Mike Levin","Okay. I appreciate the color.","Operator","That concludes the Q&A portion of the call. I would now like to turn the conference back over to the presenters for any closing remarks.","Bill Nash","Thanks, Victoria. In closing, I just want to thank you for joining us today. I want to thank you for your continued support. I also want to thank our 23,000 associates that are working for us across the country. Our success is absolutely due to them and the exceptional customer service they provide on a daily basis. And I\u2019m really proud of everything they\u2019ve accomplished this year.

Tom?","Tom Folliard","Thank you, Katharine. Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us. As you saw, we had a challenging third quarter due primarily to slightly negative used unit comps. Here are some of the key highlights for the quarter. Used unit comps decreased by 0.8%, while total used units grew by 3.2%. Gross profit per unit of $2,160 was in line with gross profit per unit of $2,172 in the third quarter of last year. And total wholesale units grew 3.4%, about the same rate as total retail units. Gross profit per wholesale unit grew by $22 to $949 per car sold. CAF income also grew 3% to approximately $92 million.","I will turn it over to Tom Reedy to talk about finance. Tom?","Tom Reedy","Thanks, Tom. Good morning, everybody. As Tom mentioned, CAF income grew by 3% compared to third quarter fiscal \u201815 and average managed receivables grew by 15% to $9.3 billion. The weighted average contract rate charged to customers was 7.3%, up somewhat from last year\u2019s third quarter of 7.0%. Our total interest margin declined to 6.0% of average managed receivables from 6.4% in the third quarter of last year and 6.2% last quarter. We saw some tick up in charge-offs during the quarter, which resulted in a modest increase in the loss provision. However, at $91 million, our ending allowance for loan losses was 0.97% of managed receivables consistent with last year\u2019s third quarter at 0.98%.","CAF net penetration was 42.9% compared with 41.8% in last year\u2019s third quarter. The increase reflects a mix shift towards higher credit applications in stores. The percent of CAF penetration attributable to our sub-prime test was unchanged at about 0.5%. Net loan dollars originated in the quarter rose 6% year-over-year to $1.2 billion due to combination of CarMax unit sales growth and higher penetration.","As you saw in the press release, Tier 3 financing as a percent of sales is 150 basis points lower than in the third quarter of fiscal 2015. This decrease was primarily due to the mix shift I mentioned with regard to CAF penetration. In Q3, we experienced a year-over-year decline in the number of credit applications across the lower end of credit, but moderate growth at the higher end.","During the third quarter, we repurchased 7.7 million shares for about $446 million. We ended the quarter at the low end of our target range for leverage, which is booked debt to capital after backing out the notes in receivables associated with non-recourse securitizations of 35% to 45%. Going forward, we expect to continue using share repurchase as a means of managing capital structure and returning value to shareholders. Tom?","Tom Folliard","Thank you. As a percentage of our sales mix this quarter, 0 to 4-year old cars increased to approximately 81% compared to 75% in the third quarter of last year and 79% in the second quarter. SUVs and trucks, as a percentage of sales, were 23% down from 25% in last year\u2019s third quarter, but up slightly from 22% in the second quarter.","Our lower used unit comps were primarily a result of modestly lower traffic in our stores partially offset by better conversion. Total web traffic increased by 7% compared to the same period last year. We believe our cost may have been impacted by several factors of note this quarter. First, we have seen a decrease in the supply of 5-year-old to 10-year-old cars as you would expect. Second, we have seen very aggressive promotions and lease offerings from new vehicles that appear to be pressuring sales of 0 and 1-year-old cars. Wholesale prices of SUVs and trucks have increased. So, some don\u2019t represent a good value for our customers. And as Tom mentioned, Tier 3 was down about 150 basis points due to lower credit applications. Now despite these factors, we still sold over 154,000 cars during the quarter, which is the most ever in the third quarter for the company and our average store during the quarter sold 340 cars.","SG&A for the third quarter increased about 7% to $338 million. Contributing to this growth was the 10% increase in our store base since the beginning of the third quarter of last year partially offset by a decrease of $6.5 million in share-based compensation expense. In addition, our advertising expense grew by about $9 million year-over-year reflecting the timing of expenses related to our new ad campaign. During the third quarter, we opened 2 stores in existing markets, our sixth store in Houston and our second store in Minneapolis. We also relocated our Rockville, Maryland store to its new larger location in Gaithersburg. And after the end of the quarter, we entered the Boston market with the opening of 2 stores in Danvers and Norwood.","And with that, operator, we will open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Matthew Fassler of Goldman Sachs.","Matthew Fassler","Thanks a lot and good morning. My first question relates to SUVs, I know you guys were down about 200 basis points year-on-year. Do you have a sense for what the used market is doing for SUV mix, in general? In other words, do you think used market sales of \u2013 do you think the mix of SUVs to the market is down, is it flat, is it up or are you differing in the way you are indexing in SUVs versus your broader competition?","Tom Folliard","I am not sure which is the broader competition, Matt, but we were up a point compared to the second quarter and we still sold a lot of trucks and SUVs in the quarter, 23% of our total sales. But as I mentioned, our prices were pretty high during the quarter. And as you know, we buy a lot of cars at the auction and our buyers are trying to make sure we always deliver a great value to our customers. So, there are times during the quarter and we just didn\u2019t think it was worth overpaying at the expense of giving a great value to the consumer. I think this is probably short-lived. Obviously, it\u2019s been driven by low gas prices. We have seen bigger increases in new car sales as it relates to SUVs and trucks compared to the used car market increases. But ultimately, these cars will all come back into the market at some point.","Matthew Fassler","And then my follow-up for you briefly, the advertising dollar shift into Q3, was that out of Q2 or out of Q4?","Tom Folliard","Really, we just wanted to point out that we launched a new campaign during the quarter and that this just \u2013 it wouldn\u2019t be a typical increase for us in terms of our quarter-over-quarter expense given that the sales level that we had. So, we weren\u2019t really trying to say came from one place to the other just this is not what you would expect typically from us on a year-over-year basis. We did create and launch a new campaign during the quarter that started in September.","Matthew Fassler","And how do you guys feel that campaign wise as you measure, I know given where the sales force you measure the return on that ad campaign, I know it\u2019s been early to judge, but your own evaluation?","Tom Folliard","Yes, it\u2019s very early to judge. Particularly when you have a new broadcast campaign, it\u2019s mostly around brand building and not necessarily for short-term sales gain. You guys know we are not promotional. We don\u2019t have sales. So, most of our campaigns are long-term brand building.","Matthew Fassler","Got it. Thank you.","Tom Folliard","Thank you, Matt.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Nagel of Oppenheimer.","Brian Nagel","Hi. Good morning and Thanks for taking my question. So first I think my first question is just basically follow-up to what Matt asked, but Tom thanks for laying out some of the extra color there with regard to sales in the quarter, but how do we think about if you take those individually, how do we think about the I guess the trajectory from here, I mean it seems the comments you made some of those factors will begin to abate here, but maybe a little more color on that as to how we should think about these factors going into the balance of this fiscal year and into 2016?","Tom Folliard","One, it\u2019s very difficult to attribute a number of points to each of the factors. They are just all things that we noted during the quarter. We also had our toughest comparison of the year, which I didn\u2019t mention. And our 2-year stack comp in the third quarter was actually higher than it was in the second quarter. But I think each of these things had a little bit of an impact on our ability to deliver during the quarter. Most of them I think are short-lived, it\u2019s very difficult to predict trends and when things are going to change and supply, but I think we have done a really nice job over the last several years of being able to adjust and adapt to changing trends in the used car marketplace. I think we will do the same here. I just thought those were things we should have pointed out during the quarter. A lot of the supply stuff is going to take care of itself over time and we are going to take advantage of the things that present themselves to us.","Brian Nagel","Got it. And then so maybe a follow-up to that, I think there is a lot of comments or commentary out there about new competitive \u2013 new competitors coming into your marketplace, have you seen anything new with respect to this, your stores that may compete more directly with some of this new competition?","Tom Folliard","I mean, we \u2013 it\u2019s an ever-changing marketplace. A lot of the stuff we have seen is around additional capabilities, which we are working really hard to continue to increase for our customers. And as I mentioned remember, our average store sold 340 cars a month during the quarter. If you look at industry data, the average new car dealer sells about 50 cars a month. So it\u2019s really hard to say that we are losing ground and a lot of that stuff that you read about for \u2013 from new competition are very small players in very limited markets. So it\u2019s not likely that we are seeing an impact across the nation for our 153 stores when a lot of the press you see is around very small players in limited markets.","Brian Nagel","Got it. Thanks and best of luck with balance of the year.","Tom Folliard","Thanks Brian Nagel.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sharon Zackfia of William Blair.","Sharon Zackfia","Hi good morning. My first question I think is pretty easy. I did not see any kind of quantification of the ad spend kind of the launch and how much of that might have been incremental, Tom do you have any color you can provide on that?","Tom Folliard","We did not quantify it, but of the $9 million difference year-over-year, the majority of it was around the new launch.","Sharon Zackfia","Okay. And then obviously you have seen the cycles in terms of kind of how the wholesale market adjust to maybe supply\/demand anomalies, so on this whole kind of conversation around SUVs, could you kind of provide some historical perspective perhaps about anomalies you might have seen in the past and kind of how long a correction might take in the pricing in the wholesale market?","Tom Folliard","I mean, I can probably comment on some anomalies in the past, but in terms of how long a correction takes, I think there is too many macro factors involved. But we are seeing, as you know highest SAAR we have ever seen and the bigger of the increase in the SAAR is related to trucks and SUVs. If I was thinking about that over a long period of time, that means a couple of years from now we will see lot of trucks and SUVs out in the wholesale market, which if there is demand, then we will be able to take advantage of that and buy and sell them. I think the other big variable that\u2019s impossible to predict is first, gas prices and then second, the impact of gas prices. I know you remember back in the spring of \u201808 when gas hit $4 nobody would buy an SUV of any kind. But in October of that same year, gas was below $2 and things kind of went back to where they were. Since then when we have seen gas prices increase we haven\u2019t seen the same knee-jerk reaction that we saw. So gas prices have been pretty low for a while and I think it\u2019s provided a boost for trucks and SUVs. But it\u2019s really hard to say what will happen going forward. I just think our model is best equipped to take advantage of whatever the market brings. We are not holding to any manufacturer or any type of product and we want to sell whatever the customer wants to buy.","Sharon Zackfia","I want to violate Katharine\u2019s two question rule. Just one last follow-up I guess, what you are seeing right now, will you characterize as kind of normal ebbs and flows that you have seen in the market over time or is there anything that gives you longer-term more fundamental concerns?","Tom Folliard","Yes. We don\u2019t see anything that causes us long-term concerns.","Sharon Zackfia","Okay, great. Thank you.","Tom Folliard","Thank you, Sharon.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Craig Kennison of Baird.","Craig Kennison","Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions as well. I know it\u2019s early, but you did just enter the Boston market and I am curious if you have seen any or had any surprises as you enter that market?","Tom Folliard","We have been open for less than a week. So I really couldn\u2019t \u2013 I am not going to comment.","Craig Kennison","Even from a staffing standpoint, you are able to staff the different types of positions you need?","Tom Folliard","We were able to staff. I will say Boston was a bit challenging with staffing, but our teams did a great job of finding a bunch of really great people and we are very excited about our go forward there.","Craig Kennison","And then in terms of technology, could you cover Tom, your priorities for the next 12 months in terms of digital and technology initiatives?","Tom Folliard","Well, our priorities are somewhat unchanged. We want to keep making sure that our customers have a great experience regardless of how they interact with CarMax, it could be from a desktop, it could be from a mobile device, a tablet or in the store and we are very focused on making the transition from their digital experience to the store simple and seamless so that the experience they have online matches up with the experience that they have in the store. And we are also pushing real hard over the next 12 months or so to make sure that our store teams are equipped with information that\u2019s available regarding the individual customers to try to make their experience more personalized. We have a very big database of customers and we are going to make sure that we can access that information and that our associates in the store can access the information when the customers arrive.","Craig Kennison","Great. Thank you.","Tom Folliard","And also we just want to keep increasing capabilities of customers if they want to do more and more of the transaction online.","Craig Kennison","Thank you.","Tom Folliard","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Murphy of Bank of America.","John Murphy","Good morning guys. Just a first question, Tom as we think about sort of these tougher comps, I mean basically we are looking at multi-decade lows in the zero to 5-year-old portion of the fleet in absolute terms. And certainly, 30-plus year lows as far as the percentage of the total population of cars outstanding. So I mean as we see that zero to 5-year-old bucket grow in the next 1 year, 2 years or 3 years, don\u2019t you just sort of naturally \u2013 would you just naturally expect your same-store sales to recover as that addressable market recovers and sort of the pressure we are seeing here is just a function of the supply?","Tom Folliard","Well, I expect us to be able to comp our stores over a long period of time and I think there is lots of external factors that either help or hurt. I have always felt like the supply of zero to 5-year-old cars increasing is good for us. It\u2019s an area where on a market share basis, if you look at an individual year-to-year basis, we have \u2013 it\u2019s been kind of our sweet spot. So I mean I agree as the supply increases there, I think we will do better in those segments. What I feel even \u2013 what I also feel good about is coming out of the recession, we did a really good job of figuring out how to sell older cars as well. And I feel like we can do both. So you look at the CarMax consumer offering at zero to 10-year-old cars and I think we are pretty good across the spectrum at near new cars and then older cars with higher miles. I don\u2019t think anybody does good a job reconditioning as we do. I don\u2019t think anybody in a better position to take advantage of those sales as we are.","John Murphy","Okay. And then just sort of a follow-up and the second question, I mean when you look at the gap of new versus used pricing and then you look at the financing offerings that are at \u2013 in the new vehicle dealers for new vehicles. It just seems like it\u2019s very compelling for a zero to 5-year-old or even zero to 10-year-old consumer to trip into buying a new vehicle, I mean if you look at zero to 5-year-old car, basically the gap on a monthly payment basis $100 are actually potentially significant and less depending on what kind of financing they get at their new vehicle dealership. I mean how do you kind of fight that tide, I mean and do you think you just need that supply plus pricing to come down to create a wider gap to drive those consumers back and to use vehicles, because it\u2019s incredibly tight right now, I am just trying to understand how that dynamic might change and if there is anything you can do to help change it?","Tom Folliard","Well, it\u2019s not like this doesn\u2019t happen, it hasn\u2019t happened before. There are always pockets or segments of near new cars that given incentive environment whether it\u2019s through cash back or leasing, oftentimes consumers will make that decision. It doesn\u2019t mean they won\u2019t come back to us 3 years or 4 years or 5 years later when they are buying something different. And I do want to point out our average car is around $20,000 and the average new car is around $33,000. So the difference on average has not come down at all, in fact it\u2019s widened. But it\u2019s always true that at any given point in time, given \u2013 depending on the incentive environment that there are some closed calls there and I think it was especially true this quarter and that\u2019s why I pointed it out.","John Murphy","Great. Thank you very much.","Tom Folliard","Alright. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of James Albertine of Stifel.","James Albertine","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just another follow-up on the trends you are seeing in the new cycle. And quite frankly, you have lived through a lot of obstacles and a lot of other headwinds over the last 20 years. It doesn\u2019t seem like there is anything you can\u2019t weather, but it seems like this time might be a little different, particularly among the domestic manufacturers given the propensity to lease. Is there a higher likelihood that some of these new vehicles that are selling on the SUV and truck side go back to dealers rather than hitting the auction market and that \u2013 could that limit your availability of supply in the coming years or is that something that you considered and aren\u2019t really worried about?","Tom Folliard","Well, it\u2019s something we have lived through before in terms of percent of new car sales that are leased. I think the number now is around 30%. It\u2019s been this high at times before. Generally, what that means is 2, 3 years down the road those cars will come back to the market in a kind of a more organized way. And dealers won\u2019t be able to absorb the volume that comes back and a lot of those cars end up at auction and that\u2019s what\u2019s happened historically. And we have been able to take advantage of that in the past. I never look at a high lease environment as a negative for us when you think about supply 2 or 3 years later. If you think about this cycle of people getting out of a new car, if it remains that people get out of their car every 3 to 5 years, it really doesn\u2019t make any difference whether it comes back through a lease channel or it comes back as an individual car, eventually they end up in the open marketplace and we have an opportunity to buy them.","James Albertine","Got it. And that ties I think with your 340 cars per month comment versus 50 per month average that you made earlier. There is not a capacity for the dealers to handle the off lease. So, I appreciate that color. And then a quick follow-up on the credit market now that we have finally seen a rate increase and if you look over the last few CAF securitizations, it appears as though the spread might be stabilizing, but really wanted to get kind of an update there as to what you think if we are near that stabilization point or even now that rates are up sort of optically consumers are now expecting higher rates, does that allow you now to sort of increase the APR and maybe even see that spread expand in the near term? Thanks.","Tom Reedy","Yes, this is Tom. As far as the spread to the customer go, that\u2019s going to be really market-dependent as we have said in the past. Our first goal of CarMax auto finance is to provide a competitive offer to the customer and we will go where the market dictates we go. That said, we are constantly testing both up and down to make sure we are optimizing CarMax sales and CAF income at the same time. We have seen a little bit of cost of funds increase this year. We have been testing rates upward a little bit. But I really can\u2019t give you any kind of forward-looking theory on where that spread will go, because it\u2019s going to be market rate based. Historically, as rates have come up, we have been a little bit as the market has slower to adjust upward, because that rates can be sticky and conversely when rates have been coming down, you are usually a little slow to adjust downward because the market is going to drive that as well and you see a little bit of a benefit. But as far as going forward, yes, the market will tell. I think now that the Fed has given some guidance, I think about where they are going with interest rates that stabilize things from the perspective of spreads in the asset-backed market. We saw our spreads gap up in the last year versus prior deals even though we are in a lower interest rate environment, but I think some of that was uncertainty around what Fed was going to do.","James Albertine","Got it. Well, thank you again and best of luck in the remaining quarter.","Tom Reedy","Thanks a lot.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Lynn Walter of Wells Fargo.","Lynn Walter","Hi, thanks for taking my questions. Just regarding traffic, can you talk about, was that consistent throughout the quarter, any regions that you saw more impact than others?","Tom Folliard","Yes, we don\u2019t give regional or quarterly differences. I said what it was for the quarter and that\u2019s all the information we give.","Lynn Walter","Okay. Let me just ask one other one then if that\u2019s okay. Just following up on your digital capabilities that you are talking about adding how should we think about the kind of investments required to bring those up to what you are talking about?","Tom Folliard","Well, a lot of the investment can be done within our normal spend over the course of the year. We have a pretty significant spend in both IT and marketing and a lot of the investments that we will be making can go over that normal course, but we are looking forward at what types of bigger investments might we need to make. And when we have something to talk about there, we will let everyone know.","Lynn Walter","Thank you.","Tom Folliard","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Irina Hodakovsky of KeyBanc.","Irina Hodakovsky","Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Two questions for you. The lower floor traffic that you called out in your release, what do you think are the drivers, is it the lack of the SUVs and trucks you pointed out as a difficult supply right now or is it perhaps competition and new entrants into the market who are competing in the standalone used vehicle stores?","Tom Folliard","It\u2019s really hard to say, but I do want to point out, we did get enough traffic to sell 340 cars a month per store. And it was only slightly down. And then conversion was slightly up. And we ended up where we ended up. But in terms of traffic through the door, I think there is a chance that customers are being more prepared and are more likely to buy when they show up. And for us if we could get traffic that\u2019s more prepared and more likely to buy, that\u2019s just as good for us as it is if we just got plain old extra traffic. So, it\u2019s not as easy an answer as you might think, but we had a lot of traffic in our stores during the quarter. It\u2019s slightly down compared to last year.","Irina Hodakovsky","Okay, thank you. And the second question for you. You mentioned in your opening remarks one of the headwinds impact in the comps was the lower supply of 0 to 5-year-old cars, is that as in general to what we have been hearing or are you seeing an actual sequential pullback in this supply from, let\u2019s say, in the second or the first quarter?","Tom Folliard","Actually, while I mentioned supply, I said the supply was down in 5 to 10-year-old cars, not 0 to 5. And in 5 to 10-year-old cars, it just makes sense since the SAAR that you are building off of in years, I don\u2019t know 6, 7 or 8 was dramatically lower than what the SAAR is today. Remember, we had a SAAR as low as 10 in September of \u201808. So, I was referencing the supply of older cars.","Irina Hodakovsky","Thank you for that clarification. Thank you, guys.","Tom Folliard","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Montani of Evercore.","Michael Montani","Hey, guys. Good morning. I wanted to ask about if you could just talk us through how you think about managing the business in terms of balancing inventory turns with gross profit dollars per unit. Generally speaking, some of the publicly traded dealer peers have shown a little bit higher used unit comps, but then they have also shown greater erosion in terms of GPUs. So, just trying to think through how you would run the business and any tests you may have had tweaking either of those two elements?","Tom Folliard","Yes. We have talked about this in the past. We run pricing test on a pretty regular basis. You can also see we have been very consistent with the margins that we have been able to achieve. So look, there is no way to go back and say, look what if we had lower prices, how many more cars would we have sold? My guess is we probably gave up a little bit of share by maintaining our prices during the quarter, but it\u2019s impossible to quantify. I don\u2019t think however that we gave up gross margin dollars and I don\u2019t think that we \u2013 I think we try to make the decision that\u2019s in the best interest of our shareholders each and every quarter. So, we did see the decline in margins that some of the other publicly traded auto retailers reported ending September. And it maybe helped their comps a little bit, but as far as we are concerned, we can only make the best decision we can with the information that we have and that\u2019s what we did during the quarter. And we are okay with the results.","Michael Montani","Okay. And then if I could just follow-up on one which is the leverage point. I believe in the past, you have said 4% to 5% being the comp that you would need to show leverage. And obviously, the commentary today is that there is no change to the outlook for future year store growth. So, should we assume that\u2019s the same, because I know there is a lot of initiatives that you guys are working on in terms of cost to try and prove that as well?","Tom Folliard","Yes, we think \u2013 we have always said kind of mid single-digits. We have never really put an exact number on it. It\u2019s also dependent on the rate of growth during any given quarter. It\u2019s also dependent on the type of growth during the quarter, opening up the big metro markets, more expensive than opening up smaller stores. And as you saw during this quarter, there is occasionally some timing of expenses that\u2019s going to impact it, but I think if you think about it over a long period of time with the growth plan that we have publicly announced mid single-digits or so, I think we can leverage our SG&A dollars.","Michael Montani","Thank you.","Tom Folliard","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Armstrong of CL King & Associates.","Bill Armstrong","Good morning, Tom. Just getting back to the SUV light truck mix, yes, I mean, so if we look at total industry sales 2012 through \u201814, about 50% of total sales were light trucks, so call it SUVs and pickups. Your sales and inventory mix clearly is much less. So, are you seeing \u2013 are you not seeing that many of those vehicles available for sale or is it they are maybe not in the condition that you want to re-retail, like what \u2013 there seems to be a disconnect there?","Tom Folliard","Did you say it \u2013 just I didn\u2019t hear what you said about the mix, did you say 50%?","Bill Armstrong","50% of all car \u2013 vehicles sold from 2012 to 2014 were light classified as light trucks, so SUVs and pickups basically?","Tom Folliard","Yes. I haven\u2019t heard that number before, but I believe you, but that\u2019s never been the case for us. I mean, we had always been in the mid-20s. So this isn\u2019t...","Katharine Kenny","Not the same metric.","Tom Folliard","Hold on a second. Our 23% is medium and large SUVs and pickup trucks. I think the 50% includes crossovers and smaller SUVs. So that\u2019s not in our number. And I don\u2019t have that number handy to tell you what the mix was. I think in general over time, we are going to look a lot like the industry looks. Our sample is very large. We are very widespread across the country. And in general, we are going to look like the industry looks over time. I mean that\u2019s where our supply comes from and we are going to match up consumer demand. It\u2019s never going to be exact particularly on a quarter-to-quarter basis, but if you look at what we have historically reported in trucks and SUVs, it\u2019s generally been in the mid-20s, sometimes in the high 20s. This quarter was 23%. It was up a point from the time before, remembering that we are talking about two different measures.","Bill Armstrong","Okay, got it. Do you feel like maybe you are missing some opportunity then with the SUVs or not necessarily?","Tom Folliard","Well, as I have said I think during the quarter, there was a chance that we could have paid more. It\u2019s not like the cars weren\u2019t out there, but we are always trying to deliver a great value to the consumer as well. So there are always times when certain things at the auction, we just think they are too expensive and we don\u2019t want to buy them and then turn around and resell them, so we wait. And I think the same thing is true here. We have been around a long time. We have seen cycles go up and cycles go down. And as I mentioned earlier, who knows what happens with gas prices. You see a big spike in gas prices and there is a good chance our SUV mix would go up during that time because those cars will be cheaper and be a better value to our customers. But I did mention it during the quarter we saw that there was a lot of pressure on SUV pricing.","Bill Armstrong","Got it. Okay, that makes sense. If I can just sneak one in, extended protection plan revenue lagged vehicle sales a little bit anything to call out there?","Tom Reedy","Nothing in particular, in general we would expect that business to grow with unit sales. This quarter, we had some adjustments in the return reserve. Remember that\u2019s like $100 million reserve, kind of plus $1 million reserve and we are going to see small movements in that based on experience as we see it, as we go forward, so nothing really exciting to report, it\u2019s just an adjustment.","Bill Armstrong","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rick Nelson of Stephens.","Nick Zangler","This is Nick Zangler in for Rick. I was just wondering \u2013 are you guys considering any changes in the policy of selling recalled vehicles, obviously one of the larger dealer group sees those sales, I think to enhance their brand name and obviously you guys have a very strong brand name, but any thoughts there and in general how do you recall cars in that view operationally?","Tom Folliard","We talked about this on the last call. Remember we don\u2019t have \u2013 we are not authorized to repair recalls at our stores. And obviously, the recall environment has changed over the last several years. We think the most important thing is being completely transparent with our customers and making sure that they are fully informed. And also that they register on the manufacturers website because I mean we can sell them a car today and a recall could come next week and it wouldn\u2019t have mattered whether or not we did anything to the car. And we think it\u2019s very important that they are notified. We are the only retailer that \u2013 we are the only car retailer that has a direct link to the NHTSA website. And it\u2019s VIN-specific and we pre-populate the VIN so any customer that\u2019s on the CarMax website can look up any \u2013 all recall information on each and every individual car. And then, during the sales process, we make sure that we point out to every customer the recall status. We help them register with the manufacturer and historically the relationship as it relates to recalls between the manufacturer the customer who owns the car and we want to make sure that customers are fully informed and get that information going forward. So our policy is 100% transparency as it relates to recalls.","Nick Zangler","Great, understand. And then just in general, where do you guys stand with third party lead generators what was the proportion of sales through those sites in the quarter?","Tom Folliard","We never talk about proportion of sales, but we have been asked about Cars.com and AutoTrader.com and we have not used those sites for a long time.","Nick Zangler","Great. Thank you very much guys. I appreciate it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Healy of Northcoast Research. Your next question comes from the line of David Whiston of Morningstar.","David Whiston","Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to go back to the distinction between SUVs and crossovers, on the crossover side for vehicles like RAV4, CR-V, Chevy Equinox, can you talk a bit about what kind of pricing you are seeing in auction for those vehicles?","Tom Folliard","I don\u2019t have that information handy, but those are good sellers for us. But I don\u2019t have the mix in front of me. I am sorry.","David Whiston","What I am basically asking, are you having inventory issues there, it sounds like similar to what you are talking about the SUVs is that an issue at all?","Tom Folliard","Yes. I don\u2019t think so.","David Whiston","Okay. And Tom Reedy, you mentioned before Q&A that you are on the low end of your leverage, so can we infer that you are not going to pay back the incremental revolver borrowing anytime soon?","Tom Reedy","I think that\u2019s fair. I mean, the revolver balance is going to be something that\u2019s quite seasonal. As you know we buy up inventory pretty significantly in the fall and we sell through it in the winter and into the spring. So it\u2019s there to manage liquidity. But as I mentioned, I think we have kind of got a target range of leverage we would like to manage to. I would expect to keep adding debt as we go forward and buying back stock to manage to that level. And it wouldn\u2019t be out of the question for us to do something. Think about the revolvers kind of like if you look at our conduit facilities on the asset back side. It\u2019s something that we can use to manage liquidity, but then when you get critical mass, it would take it out of a longer term instrument.","David Whiston","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paresh Jain of Morgan Stanley.","Paresh Jain","Good morning everyone. I just wanted to follow-up on Mike\u2019s question earlier, so if I am hearing you right, stable GPU seems to be the more important metric here for CarMax, am I thinking about it right or how would you characterize your most important metric, is this comp or is it GPU?","Tom Folliard","Our most important metric is sales. And then we have just been able to manage gross profit per unit very consistently over time. We want to make sure that we have given our consumers a great value. One of the things that we are very focused on is continuing to aggressively manage our costs because the price of the consumer is not just the margin but also the cost that we put into a car during the reconditioning process and we continue to put enormous efforts around the engineering that we \u2013 we have turned our reconditioning process into an engineer process and we want to continue to try to figure out how to lower our costs, so we can still deliver great price to the consumer and maintain our margin so that we are delivering a good return for our shareholders.","Paresh Jain","Understood. And then on a most strategic front, I wanted to talk about dealer partnerships with ride and car sharing businesses, we see some of these businesses big and small, looking to partner with dealers on two fronts, either to buy or sell a car or in some cases, just utilize of used car sitting on dealer lots and pay dealers a fee. How do you feel about these partnerships between ride sharing firms and dealer businesses, are there potential hurdles in this type of arrangement or maybe there are no issues and it make sense to make some money on used cars while sitting on the lot?","Tom Folliard","We haven\u2019t really explored those avenues for us. The one thing I would say is it is an incredibly fragmented business and a huge marketplace. There are over 40 million cars \u2013used cars sold annually in the U.S. We are very small fraction of that. So as I said, we haven\u2019t looked at those things in particular, but we try to pay attention to all of things that are available in the marketplace and see if we think there is an opportunity for us. But right now, our biggest opportunity is to continue to grow the business in markets that we are not in, continue to add stores back into places where we already have a presence. We are only reaching about 60% of the U.S. population. I think we have incredible growth in front of us. And right now, those are the kinds of things that we are focused on.","Paresh Jain","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert Iannarone of RBC Markets.","Robert Iannarone","Hey, guys. Robert Iannarone on for Scot Ciccarelli. Just a couple of quick questions for you, some of the credit data that we have tracked has indicated outsized growth in 72-month plus financing arm, I was just wondering if you could give us any commentary on what you are seeing in customer behavior and their desire for longer term loans for their vehicles?","Tom Folliard","Yes, I think the way I can respond to that is that like I said we are going to be a market-driven lender at CAF and we are going to make sure we are doing the best thing for our customers. And it\u2019s always a balancing act. So, we are going to be continually testing and assume it makes sense. I think recent \u2013 the data you might be pointing to recent Experian [ph] data shows about 15% of used volumes getting done at terms longer than 72. We are not sure how much of that is actually pushing out more than a couple of months. But as I said, we will stay competitive. If we see the need to move, we will, but at this point, we don\u2019t feel comfortable to rush into any longer term financing.","Robert Iannarone","Great. Thanks. And just one more on advertising so second quarter in the row now we have seen the advertising expense tick up. You have certainly commented on this in the last couple of calls for us. Just wondering if we should expect that to normalize going forward that you are in the Boston market and you have launched this new campaign?","Tom Folliard","Yes, we are going to make decisions throughout the quarter as well. But as I said, this increase on a quarter-over-quarter basis would not be typical for us.","Robert Iannarone","Okay, thank you.","Tom Folliard","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Fassler of Goldman Sachs.","Matthew Fassler","Thanks a lot. I got back in line and I guess there was room. I have two follow-ups for you. The first relates to write-downs. What can you talk about in terms of the drivers of the tick up in write-downs? How would you relate it to underwriting standards? You talked about seeing higher quality credit applications etcetera. Just give us a sense if you could about how to think about those write-downs and how we might model of them out from here?","Tom Folliard","Are you talking about CAF losses?","Matthew Fassler","Correct.","Tom Folliard","I am sorry, Matt. Yes, I think what I mentioned about the close in the quarter was that it was a quarterly \u2013 this quarter phenomenon for the last several, several, several quarters, in fact, most of them, we have seen growth in kind of all areas in the credit spectrum this quarter. We saw decline in application volume and lower FICO stuff and a continued growth in the higher end stuff, the 650 plus. That\u2019s what I meant by the traffic. That\u2019s unrelated to what\u2019s going on with charge-offs. Charge-offs has to do with what\u2019s in the portfolio and it\u2019s been put in there over the last several years. And the way I characterize it is we have had a long stream of favorable experience and at some point, it was \u2013 the tide was going to turn in. Things were probably going to normalize. I would probably characterize it as giving back some of the favorable experience we have had over the last several quarters. It\u2019s too early to tell what that means from a go-forward perspective. But as I mentioned, the reserve balance today is at the same level as a percent of receivables that was last year.","Matthew Fassler","And is there anything that you saw in recent delinquency data that would lead you to be incrementally concerned or do you feel like the book is still in very good shape?","Tom Folliard","Now, as I said, we have got a quarter\u2019s worth of data and we will take it as it comes.","Matthew Fassler","Got it. And then my next question just you bought back an awful lot of stock during what was obviously a tough quarter, what would you need to see? What would it take in terms of fundamentals of the business to lead you to slow that buyback down?","Tom Folliard","Well, Matt, as I said I think we have kind of got into the lower end of the leverage range that we have been targeting. And on a go-forward basis, we will continue to do it, to manage the capital structure going forward. I can\u2019t comment on what would it compels do anything, because market conditions could be \u2013 in the future could be all over the board. I just think you should take away that we are going to continue using it. We are going to continue using a programmatic approach. You saw during the quarter that we stepped up volumes based on what the stock price did. But on a go-forward basis, it\u2019s probably more of managing the structure perspective rather than moving to a new capital structure.","Matthew Fassler","Got it. Thank you very much.","Tom Folliard","Yes. Thanks, Matt.","Tom Folliard","Alright. There are no more calls. I want to thank everybody for your interest in CarMax. And of course, I want to thank all of our more than 22,000 CarMax associates for all they do everyday to make CarMax a success and a great place to work and happy holidays to everyone.

Ms. Katharine Kenny, you may begin your conference.","Katharine W. Kenny","Thank you, Susan, and good morning. Thank you for joining our fiscal 2014 second quarter earnings conference call. As usual, on the call with me today are Tom Folliard, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Tom Reedy, our Executive Vice President and CFO.","Before we begin, let me remind you that our statements today regarding the company's future business plans, prospects and financial performance are forward-looking statements that we make pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Tom?","Thomas J. Folliard","Thank you, Katharine. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. As you saw, used unit comps for the second quarter grew 16% compared to last year, primarily due to better conversion, as well as a modest increase in traffic. Total used unit sales grew by 21% in the quarter. Total used vehicle gross profit grew by 21%, and used vehicle gross profit per unit of $2,174 was virtually the same as last year. Also, unit sales increased by 10%. This was largely due to a higher buy rates and the growth in our store base. Total wholesale vehicle gross profit increased by 3%, as the 10% growth in units was partially offset by a decrease of $58 in gross profit per unit.","Extended service plan revenues rose 23%, reflecting our sales growth and an increase in penetration. CAF quarterly income increased 12% to $84 million. Tom will give you some details on that in a moment. Overall, we had a very strong quarter. Net earnings grew 26% to $140 million and net earnings per diluted share rose 29% to $0.62 a share.","With that, I'll turn it over to Tom to talk about financing.","Thomas W. Reedy","Thanks, Tom. Good morning, everybody. In the second quarter, CAF income was up 12% compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2013, while our average managed receivables increased 24% to $6.5 billion. Consistent with recent experience, the portfolio growth was driven by a continuing strong origination volume, which was supported by the expansion in CAF penetration, CarMax's sales growth and an increase in the average amounts financed. Managed receivables continue to grow at a faster pace than CAF earnings, as the increase in loan volume was offset by continued compression in the spread between consumer rates and funding costs.","Credit losses in the quarter were largely in line with our expectations. The allowance for loan losses grew to $66 million or approximately 1% of ending managed receivables, compared to 0.9% in Q2 of FY '13. For CAF, net loans originated in the quarter rose 32% to $1.1 billion, and net penetration was 41% compared to 37% in the second quarter of fiscal 2013.","The weighted average contract rate for the quarter's originations was 6.8% compared to 8.1% in last year's second quarter, but that's down only slightly from 7.0% in this year's first quarter. Similar to the first quarter, we experienced higher applicant flow, higher conversion, arising from both more attractive offers and better in-store execution and also greater retention of our finance customers, as 3-day payouts remain at historical lows. We believe our finance offers continue to optimize overall sales and profits for CarMax. And as outlined in the press release, we saw third-party subprime providers accounting for about 18% of our sales in the second quarter, compared to 15% in last year's second quarter.","Now I'll turn it back over to Tom.","Thomas J. Folliard","Thank you. Regarding our sales mix, there was very little change. Sales of 5 year and older vehicles were above 25% as a percentage of our total as they have been for the last few years. Sales of SUVs and trucks remained about 25% as well, similar to last year, although sales of compacts and midsized vehicles grew a few percentage points to nearly 40%. As we've discussed in the past, our mix of vehicles will vary based on customer demand.","Total SG&A increased by 11%, reflecting variable expenses related to higher sales and the 12% growth in our store base since the beginning of last year's second quarter. SG&A per retail unit fell by $174, largely driven by our 16% comps.","In the second quarter, our average monthly web visits grew to over 12 million for the first time, up more than 30% compared to last year's second quarter and up from 11.5 million in the first quarter. Average monthly visits to our mobile site represent about 21% of total visits and visits utilizing our iPhone and Android apps grew to approximately 11% of our traffic by quarter end, compared to about 9% at the end of the first quarter.","During the second quarter, we opened 2 new stores: our fifth store in Houston, Texas; and our second store in Sacramento, California. In our press release, we also announced 5 planned superstore openings for next year's second quarter. Four will be in new markets for CarMax, including Madison, Wisconsin; Reno, Nevada; Lynchburg, Virginia; and Portland, Oregon. We will also open our fifth store in the Dallas market.","With that, we'd be happy to take your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Simeon Gutman - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Tom, one question with maybe 1 or 2 little parts, and I'll say it all upfront. First, regarding the vehicle population, the data is pointing to an inflection point in the 0- to 5-year-old range. Your mix comments alluded to this to some degree, but I'm curious if you can share any anecdotes of whether you're starting to sense or see a change in the complexion of some of the vehicles that are coming through your channel. And then the second part of that question, is the store pipeline, based on the press release, it looks pretty robust over the next 12 months. I think it's 17 stores. And so unless the back half of next year is very light, might you end up doing either the high end or a little bit more than the high end of the range of store growth?","Thomas J. Folliard","So although that was a two-part question, they were 2 very different questions. However, we're going to allow it. But as far as the mix is concerned, we really haven't seen much of a change. If you look at what's happened with new cars than supply, it does feel like we're heading towards an inflection point. But in terms of if you just divide our inventory into 2 big segments: 0 to 4 and 5 to 10, there was very little change in our mix between those 2 segments. As I said last quarter, we saw some movement within 0 to 4, but not as a group. So that was very similar this quarter.","In terms of the store mix, we've not changed to what our plans are of 10 to 15 stores. Including this year, we said for the next 3 years. So that's this year and the following 2. What you see in the next 12 months is just a reflection of timing, so it really hasn't changed at all. It's just -- and it will be kind of a higher volume over the next 12 months than the 12-month periods around it -- we haven't changed our projections at all.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt Nemer with Wells Fargo.","Matthew R. Nemer - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","So I'm just wondering if the mixed compacts and midsized vehicles impacted the gross profit per unit. And then as a follow-up, can you talk about what led to the improved conversion? I'm sure it was lots of little things but maybe just the highlights.","Thomas J. Folliard","Yes. As we said before, Matt, the mix of vehicles by category really doesn't have much impact on our margins. And our margins were flat and it was only a few points of move within that segment anyway, so very little impact there. And what was the second part?","Matthew R. Nemer - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Just factors that led to a better conversion?","Thomas J. Folliard","Yes, it's pretty much the same. As we talked about last quarter, we have outstanding execution in our stores. We have some good results coming from improved training programs, but, also, we have better consumer offers from our, not only CAF, but our lending partners as well. So they have a little bit more to work with. We have approvals at all-time highs, which has not really changed from last quarter of kind of our global approval rate of all applications that we receive in the store. 90% of applicants are receiving an approval from at least one of those lenders. So it's very similar to last quarter. I think just great execution in the stores, very good offers and our store teams have done a really nice job of getting inventory and getting it ready and getting it up to a very high quality standard, so our customers have a very great selection.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer.","Brian W. Nagel - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","The question I had was really, maybe a couple of parts under the 1 topic, at the subprime. So we're seeing the results there that the subprime remains a contributor to your overall sales growth. The question I have with respect to subprime, I mean, one, as we look at this, maybe from a high-level perspective, are you managing that growth? Or are you just allowing the market to basically dictate it for you? And as you're thinking -- as you think about this growth, kind of, where's your mind as far as the puts and takes, maybe the risks, the benefit-risk relationship at subprime becomes -- continues to become a bigger piece? And then finally, just as we've started to see interest rates rise a little bit here, is there any shift in the way your subprime providers are financing customers?","Thomas J. Folliard","In terms of the mix, it's really -- it's actually as a percentage of sales, it's slightly down from last quarter in terms of how we think about that business. We're not controlling that at all. Those -- the lenders that are approving those customers are only seeing those applications after they've been declined by CAF and all of our other lending partners. So as I've said in the past, our view is, at that moment, that is a 100% incremental sale. It's a sale that we wouldn't have gotten otherwise to that consumer did not have an option for credit. So although it's a lower profit deal for us at that moment, we believe it's 100% incremental. And what's been happening over the last few years, as we've said a number of times, it's just our lending partners, again, more and more comfortable with our origination channel. I think they've been more aggressive with their offers to our applicants, and it's been terrific for sales. Each individual deal at the moment that it's approved, we think it's a good decision for us. So we really haven't -- we're not at a level that we're uncomfortable with. And as I said, if you compare it to the first quarter, actually down slightly in this quarter. I don't know if Tom can comment some on the interest rate part.","Thomas W. Reedy","Yes. As far as the rate environment up, during the quarter, we didn't see any change in our subprime partners' behavior, vis-\u00e0-vis what they were doing in the Q1 or across the quarter. But obviously, if we see significant changes in the interest rates, just like with CarMax Auto Finance, it impacts the overall math of their -- the makeup of their returns, so we would expect them to change behavior in some way. How that would be, we can't tell you until it starts to happen. But at this point, we have no reason to think that they are in the mode of change in their buy behavior.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Craig Kennison with Robert W. Baird.","Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Your SG&A per unit declined nicely, providing some very good operating leverage. What were the key factors behind that?","Thomas J. Folliard","About 16% comps, similar to last quarter. We've always said that in a growth mode, which we're in, we need, we think, mid- to high-single-digit comps in order to begin to get some leverage. So when -- if we're going to be in the mid to high teens, we would expect some leverage.","So it's also very good execution. You still have to remain very disciplined in the stores with managing your expenses. And, I think, once again, our store teams did an outstanding job.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","My question also relates to CAF. We are seeing the APR, I guess, the average APR you're offering your consumers through CAF continue to come down, though to your point the decline from Q1 was relatively modest. Now that we're starting to see your financing cost firm up, along with the overall cost of money, what's your feel within the market, both for your and your competitors' desire to start to lift that APR? And what are consumers' tolerance, you think, to entertain somewhat higher cost to money on the credit front?","Thomas W. Reedy","Matt, that as far as consumers' tolerance and our competitors' desire, we're going to have to just keep an eye on that and, through testing and watching our 3-day payoffs and watching what the competitive marketplace is offering, work through that.","As far as the funding costs, we've seen them tick up a bit. I still feel like the ABS market is open to it, and we're doing a good job with securitizing. We've done 3 deals this year. We did see spreads tick up a little bit last deal, but not dramatically.","As far as benchmarks go, that's why we hedge, as we originate our loans and that's why we have CAF, is looking at the market every week and making their pricing decision. So, I mean, I guess, I can just emphasize it. Our plan is to run a competitive and profitable finance business with an overall eye towards maximizing CarMax's profits and sales. So we can't -- because we're the only person in the Tier 1 space, we can't afford to turn customers off the CarMax at the finance office, so we're always going to make sure that we're competitive. I think we're in a nice position because we are -- we can contest very pretty accurately, because we control our origination channel. And I think that gives us a competitive advantage and ability to stay on top of the market.","Thomas J. Folliard","[indiscernible] dramatically is the transparency of our offer to the consumer is, I think, a critical and very important competitive differentiator for us. And since customers -- since we don't negotiate, there are no incentives in our stores for financing. The customer gets a real clear picture of exactly what their rate is. And if they don't -- if they think they can get better rates, they have 3 days to go pay it off somewhere else. So it's an excellent barometer for us to make sure that we're charging a very competitive rate. But in some regards, we're going to only be able to move as much as the market allows.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Do you think that the market is starting to move at this point?","Thomas J. Folliard","Well, it hasn't shown up in our rates yet. So -- but this is -- a lot of times, rates are in a longer cycle. We've seen in the past, as rates have gone up, that the market doesn't move up as much and you tend to see some compression. This is no different than normal. And when rates -- when cost of funds goes down, oftentimes, the lenders don't go down as quickly, and you tend to see a little widening of the spread. So if you look back over the years for us, this is kind of normal. When rates go up, you see a little compression.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Murphy with Bank of America.","Elizabeth Suzuki","This is Elizabeth Suzuki on for John. On store openings, what percentage of the U.S. markets will you be ultimately able to service with your current growth plan? I think the number was somewhere around 50% a little while ago. Just wanted to get an idea of what the target is for the next couple of years.","Thomas J. Folliard","I haven't really thought of it like that. We're only in half of U.S. markets. When we think about a 3-year growth plan of 10 to 15 stores a year, we said roughly half of those stores will be in building back into existing markets. So I haven't really thought of it that way.","What we're more thinking about is our long-term growth plan, and how to make the CarMax consumer offer available to customers all over the country. So our goal is to go everywhere. I don't really know what percentage we'll achieve in the stated growth plan of 3 years, which -- of which we're in year 1.","Elizabeth Suzuki","Okay. But there's still plenty of room for growth, obviously?","Thomas J. Folliard","Plenty of room for growth.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of James Albertine with Stifel, Nicolaus.","James J. Albertine - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I just wanted to focus very quickly, if I could, on originations. I think last quarter, you gave some good details around sort of your online metrics and some of your app metrics. And I just noticed, looking at your SG&A in a little bit more detail, obviously, advertising sounds significantly year-over-year. So maybe they're related, maybe they're not related, but I was hoping you could kind of walk us through that. And perhaps, just from a housekeeping standpoint, talk about the buy rate from the appraisal lane.","Thomas J. Folliard","Yes, I'm not sure what you're referring to there on the app rate. Advertising was down in the quarter. Some of that's driven by a higher comp rate. Some of that is timing, some of that as you expect to get a little leverage on advertising as you continue to grow.","In terms of the -- what was the last part? Oh, the buy rate, yes, in terms of the buy rate, it was up for the quarter, compared to last year's second quarter. So that helps contribute to that 10% growth in wholesale. And we've always talked about that being a balancing act between buying cars through the appraisal lane, does some of those customers, in turn, buy a retail car from us, and you really can't manage one individually. So we're actually very, very pleased with how the -- how it all came out in total. Nice buy rate increase in, really, what was a depreciating environment, which is a little bit more normal. So if you look at the Manheim index for the summer, we saw some depreciation, which we would normally expect. That we've had a few years where things haven't been the way they normally are. But -- so to see our buy rate tick up a little for the quarter, we are very pleased with that.","James J. Albertine - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","And any update on the online front in terms of any of the metrics that you're willing to share?","Thomas J. Folliard","Well, I talked about them earlier, mostly just on hits. 12 million hits to the website, average monthly visits, that's an all-time high. We obviously continue to see growth through mobile applications, and touchpads, actually, at the end of the quarter, it was the first time for CarMax that more than 50% of all of the hits to the website came from something other than a desktop. So that's a trend that we expect to continue.","We don't do a lot of online credit applications. I'm not sure if that's the question you were asking earlier, but that's a very tiny piece of our total at this time.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Bill Armstrong with CL King & Associates.","William R. Armstrong - CL King & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Tom, so your average selling price actually declined slightly year-over-year for first time since, I think, 2009. Does that reflect mix? Or are we seeing some impact from lower acquisition cost? Or is it just not big enough of a decrease to even be relevant?","Thomas J. Folliard","It's that part, what you just said.","William R. Armstrong - CL King & Associates, Inc., Research Division","The last part?","Thomas J. Folliard","Yes, it's not really a relevant number. I would guess it's partly the first 2 things: a little bit of mix, a little bit of some depreciation in the quarter, but nothing that we're really spending time thinking about.","William R. Armstrong - CL King & Associates, Inc., Research Division","So it sounds like your acquisition costs that are not necessarily following along with the Manheim index, which, obviously, has been decreasing.","Thomas J. Folliard","It's impossible to tell from the ASP, because of all the variation in the mix. I think the easiest way to look at it is our margins were relatively flat to last year. So we have to be tracking somewhat close to the market on a vehicle-by-vehicle basis in order to achieve a flat margin.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Whiston with Morningstar.","David Whiston - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Can you talk about if you would want to own the new properties you're constructing? Would you want to own them if interest rates were to rise dramatically? And what's your goal for owning your real estate in terms of the percentage over the midterm?","Thomas W. Reedy","We really don't look at it as a goal, whether we want to own it or lease it or controlled portfolio. We look at it as the amount of capital we need to commit to execute our opening plan and our Treasury department's going to look and figure out the best way to fund it from a cost and flexibility perspective, depending on what the market offers at the time that we need the capital.","At this time point, we haven't had to use any external capital to buy our sites. But if you ask me, all else equal, I'd prefer to own rather than lease our real estate, because it allows you to be the master of your own destiny a lot more.","Thomas J. Folliard","The only thing I'd add there is, we want to get the best site. So there are some cases where maybe the only thing available is a long-term ground lease. And if it's the best site, then we'll look at the cost and we'll make a decision based on that.","David Whiston - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","So are interest rates a major decision factor for your Treasury department?","Thomas J. Folliard","What's that?","Thomas W. Reedy","I'm not sure what you're getting at.","David Whiston - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","You said the Treasury department is evaluating for -- on each deal, so just, from your answer, it just sounded like interest rates were not that high on the decision-making tree for your Treasury department. I just wanted to confirm that.","Thomas W. Reedy","We look at everything from an overall need-for-capital perspective. So our business generates a certain amount of money. We need a certain amount of liquidity for inventory and working capital, and we need capital to fund our growth. The last couple of years, we have not needed to go external for that capital as we look forward, to the extent we would need to go external for that capital. But what I was saying is, whether we're leasing or buying the property, is not a fact -- is a factor, but it's not -- the decision point's not based on a preference to own versus lease. It's based on a preference to get the best cost of fund and most flexibility.","Thomas J. Folliard","And remember, too, oftentimes, we'll make a decision on moving forward with a certain piece of property and then we won't actually have to fund it for 2 or 3 years. So we're not going to make a decision now, not knowing what the circumstances will be 2 or 3 years from now. So then Tom and his team will make whatever the best decision is at that time.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]","Thomas J.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you.","I would now like to turn the call over to Stacy Frole, Vice President, Investor Relations.","Stacy Frole","Thank you, Carol.","Good morning. Thank you for joining our fiscal 2020 third quarter earnings conference call. I am here today with Bill Nash, our President and CEO; and Tom Reedy, our Executive Vice President of Finance; and Enrique Mayor-Mora, our Senior Vice President and CFO.","Let me remind you, our statements today regarding the Company\u2019s future business plans, prospects and financial performance are forward-looking statements we make pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are based on management\u2019s current knowledge and assumptions about future events that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations.","In providing projections and other forward-looking statements, the Company disclaims any intent or obligation to update them.

Bill?","Bill Nash","Thank you, Stacy, and good morning, everyone.","Before we get started, I want to take a moment to personally congratulate Enrique on his recent promotion to CFO. Enrique and I\u2019ve worked together for many years, and he\u2019s made a lot of great contributions during this time. I also want to thank Tom for serving as our CFO for the past nine years. I\u2019ll look forward to continuing to work with him as he shifts his focus to our strategic initiatives, in addition to continuing to oversee all the finance.","For today, I\u2019ll start with our third quarter highlights before turning the call over to Enrique, who will discuss our financials in more detail. Tom will then provide additional color around customer financing. And I\u2019ll wrap up with an update on our omni-channel experience before opening it up for your questions.","As you read in earnings release, we delivered a strong sales performance this quarter with revenues up 11.5% on a 7.5% increase in used unit comps and 11% increase in total used units sold. Net income and EPS for the quarter were down 9% and 4.6%, respectively. This is largely the result of significantly higher stock-based compensation due to an increasing share price during the quarter, combined with a planned increase in third quarter expense due to the timing of advertising.","As a reminder, volatility in stock-based compensation expense is driven by restricted stock units that are awarded broadly to our non-executive associates. Enrique will provide additional details on these items shortly. Keep in mind, despite these third quarter cost headwinds, year-to-date comps were up 6.7%, EPS is up 10.1%, earnings are up 3.6%. And while we have delevered SG&A by $37 per unit, this includes $42 per unit of stock-based compensation.","We attribute our sales growth to a variety of factors including solid execution in operations, finance, customer progression and marketing in addition to an overall favorable used car sales environment. Web traffic increased 15% year-over-year as we continue to benefit from our various marketing efforts.","During the third quarter, our markets offering an omni-channel experience had slightly stronger comp sales in our non-omni markets. The strong performance in both was supported by many of our omni-related digital initiatives that have been rolled out nationally. This includes improved customer lead management tools, finance self-service tools and digital merchandising. And we believe all stores benefited from our national marketing campaign launched in October, which reinforces the strength of our brand.","For the quarter, gross profit per used unit was $2,145, up slightly when compared with the prior year. Our teams have done an exceptional job in continuing to drive efficiencies, allowing us to maintain margins while offering competitive prices. Wholesale unit sales were also higher this quarter with volume up 3.3% year-over-year. The increase in wholesale volume was slightly offset by a small decrease in gross profit per wholesale unit due to heavier depreciation at auctions since the beginning of the third quarter.","As a percentage of sales, zero to four-year old vehicles was 77%, similar to last year. Total SUVs and trucks accounted for about 49% of sales, up from 45% last year.","At this point, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Enrique to provide more information on the third quarter financial performance.","Enrique Mayor-Mora","Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone.","For the quarter, other gross profit decreased slightly. EPP profits grew by $11 million with 13.3% due to the combined effects of strong used volume growth and increased margin. Like the prior year, we did not recognize any additional EPP profit sharing revenue. This increase was offset by an $11 million decline in service department profits for the quarter versus a year ago. The decrease in service profits was largely due to three factors. First, we increased our post sale warranty period from 30 to 90 days back in May. We view this as an investment in providing a better customer experience. Second, we experienced near-term inefficiencies due to a sharp ramp in technician hiring support future sales growth. And finally, a portion of stock-based compensation runs through the service department.","On the SG&A front, expenses for the quarter increased $75 million to $485 million. SG&A deleveraged by $157 per unit. A material component of this growth and the resulting deleverage was driven by stock-based compensation. $11 million or 25% of the overall year-over-year growth in SG&A on the quarter was due to the 17% increase in our share price for the quarter versus a 15% decrease in the prior year period. This resulted in a $94 per unit deleverage to SG&A and represents $0.09 of EPS.","We also had a planned increase of $14 million or 39% in advertising costs for the new ad campaign and the rollout of our omni-channel experience that Bill mentioned earlier. This spend on the quarter brings our year-to-date advertising expense per unit to $225. On a year-to-date basis, this is slightly higher than last year and consistent with our earlier communications that our intention is to spend slightly more per unit for the full year. Other notable expense drivers included the opening of 19 stores since the beginning of the third quarter last year which represents a 10% growth in our store base. Higher variable costs associated with our strong sales growth and continued spending to advance our technology platforms, digital initiatives and our omni-channel roll out.","During this period of investment, we continue to believe comps in the range of 5% to 8% will be needed to leverage SG&A on an annual basis. As part of our expansion strategy, we opened four stores in the third quarter, two in new markets, Palm Springs, California and Gulfport, Mississippi, and two in existing markets, Dallas and Atlanta. Over the next 12 months, we anticipate opening 11 more stores.","Earlier this month, we also opened our Phoenix Customer Experience Center or CEC. We continue to enhance shareholder returns through our repurchase program. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 1.3 million shares for $115 million. This program has contributed to our 10% year-to-date EPS growth that Bill mentioned earlier. We have $1.67 billion remaining in our current authorizations. ","Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Tom to discuss customer financing.","Tom Reedy","Thank, Enrique, and good morning, everybody.","CarMax Auto Finance and our partner lenders continued to deliver solid results with CAF income growth and strong conversion in Tier 2 and Tier 3. During the quarter, we saw modest growth in application volume and strong performance across all credit tiers. Tier 2 accounted for 20.4% for used unit sales compared with 18.3% last year. Tier 3 was up slightly to 9.5% compared with 9.3% a year ago, and CAF penetration net of three-day payoffs was 43.3% versus 44.1% in last year's third quarter.","Year-over-year, CAF's net loans originated grew by 13% to $1.7 billion as the increase in used cars sold and the average amount financed was somewhat offset by the decrease in CAF\u2019s net penetration rate.","For loans originated during the quarter, the weighted average contract rate charged to customers was 8.1%, down from 8.5% a year ago and 8.6% in the second quarter. Portfolio interest margin increased to 5.7% versus 5.6% in Q3 last year. CAF income was up 3.9% to $114 million, primarily driven by the 7.5% growth in average managed receivables and a small increase in interest margin, offset by an increase in the loss provision as a percent of average receivables.","The provision for loan losses was $49 million in Q3 versus $40.8 million in the prior year period. The increase arises from portfolio growth and a modestly higher allowance based on loss experience we began to see earlier this year. At $153.6 million the allowance represents 1.15% of ending managed receivables, up slightly from 1.12% a year ago and comparable to the second quarter. This remains well within our range of expectations, given our origination strategy and portfolio mix.","Before I turn the call over, I will touch on the impending Current Expected Credit Loss accounting standard, which is commonly referred to as CECL. CECL will be effective for us at the start of our fiscal 2021 and a number of you have inquired about it. This is a non-cash accounting change and won't impact our previously disclosed cumulative net loss expectations. The most significant element of the new standard is that it requires companies to reserve for the expected lifetime losses, whereas currently we reserve for the following 12 months. As a result of the adoption, we will increase our allowance for loan losses by $200 million to $250 million. This is based on information as of November 30, 2019 and the adjustment will flow through retained earnings. Post adoption, CECL could also create more volatility in the quarterly provision for loan losses as any true-ups will be projected over the life of the portfolio versus the 12 months we're currently estimating.","Now, I'll turn the call back over to Bill.","Bill Nash","Thanks Tom and Enrique. Now, I'll provide an update on the rollout of our omni-channel experience, and how we are continuing to innovate and improve the business for the future. First, the numbers. We now have four CECs that we continue to staff, Raleigh, Atlanta, Kansas City and our newest in Phoenix, which opened earlier this month. Approximately 40% of our customer base currently has access to our omni-channel experience, and we are on track to reach the majority of our customers by the end of this fiscal year in February. We plan to complete the rollout in the next fiscal year.","ESP penetration in our omni markets is slightly lower than our overall penetration, which is a little above 60%. We have not seen a material change in finance penetration or mix with the rollout of omni. We are pleased to achieve 7.5% comps while at the same time, implementing the largest transformation in the Company's history. While we continue to run some inefficiencies in both our CECs and stores, we are confident we will be able to improve productivity as we roll out and mature the new experience.","We also still believe our unique omni-channel experience will be more cost efficient than our current model. We've already begun to drive cost efficiencies in our Atlanta CEC quarter-over-quarter. We are also excited about the opportunities ahead as we continue to improve our customer offerings. Two key areas where we see opportunity are our Customer Relationship Management or CRM platform and our new delivery options.","Our CRM platform enhances the experience for both our customers and our associates. It provides associates with valuable insights and data about our customers that allow us to better personalize their experience. It provides customers with the access to our customer hub. This hub makes it easier for customers and our sales associates to have full visibility to the status of their journey and to continue to progress further, while either online or in store.","We also see tremendous opportunity with our express pickup and home delivery offerings. Our conversion rate on these sales is very high and the customer experience these delivery options is extremely well received. While combined they still represent less than 10% of sales in eligible markets, these offerings steadily increased throughout the quarter. Going forward, we expect more customers will take advantage of these delivery offers -- options as we expand our omni-channel experience into new markets and increase customer awareness through various marketing channels.","Our associates are doing an amazing job and structuring and delivering a systematic yet aggressive rollout of the new omni experience, an experience that personalizes each customer's journey whether in person, online, by phone or a seamless combination of channels. Our ability to leverage the infrastructure, analytics and processes we have built over the last 26 years and continue to improve with state-of-the-art technologies and new digital capabilities is a significant competitive advantage, an advantage that when combined with our ongoing store expansion, positions us well to continue to lead the industry, profitably grow sales and gain market share. I'm extremely proud of our associates and all of their accomplishments and we're all excited about the future.","With that, we'll be glad to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","At this time, we will be conducting our question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Scot Ciccarelli from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Scot Ciccarelli","Good morning, guys, and happy holidays to you.","Bill Nash","Good morning, Scot.","Scot Ciccarelli","Can you guys talk about the change that you had in your service policy, specifically what caused you to make that change, the 30 to 90 days? And was there any financial catchup in the quarter or is this more of a reset that will continue for the next few quarters?","Bill Nash","Sure, Scot. So, for the longest time we had a 30-day limited warranty program. And as Enrique said, we changed that over in May to 90 days, and we feel like that's best for the customer experience. So, what you're seeing is that it\u2019s -- now that it's everywhere, it's been in place since May, it's this -- from an expense standpoint, it's a couple of dollars per unit that's a little bit of additional headwind.","Scot Ciccarelli","And so, we should expect, let's call it, similar effect to that service department revenue for the next three quarters, let's call it?","Bill Nash","Well, keep in mind, when Enrique was talking about the service profits, there is really three different buckets that are going in there. Part of it was the shift from 30 days to 90 days, and of that, I would say that's about a third of the overall change, another third was stock-based compensation and the other third of the staffing inefficiencies that we see, because we're ramping up our technicians. And as we ramp up technicians, until we get a critical mass, it's hard to turn on new shifts. So, each one of them make up about a third. And on the 30 to 90-day warranty, of that third, about half of it is a little step up on a per unit basis of the expense. We also had in that third a mix shift, where we did more 90-day warranty work in retail service work.","Scot Ciccarelli","Got it. And just for clarification purposes, the 90 days, does that basically put you at par with the CPO -- most CPO programs that are out there?","Bill Nash","I'm not sure about the CPO program, Scot. I would have to go and look at that. I think that we feel like 90 days is certainly best-in-class for used cars.","Scot Ciccarelli","Got it. All right. Thanks, guys.","Bill Nash","Thank you.","Enrique Mayor-Mora","That's a program that will anniversary itself in the first quarter of fiscal year 2021, as we rolled it out in May of this past year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Nagel from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.","Brian Nagel","So first off, Enrique and Tom, congratulations on your new roles.","Enrique Mayor-Mora","Thank you.","Tom Reedy","Thanks.","Brian Nagel","So, the question I want to ask, I guess, my first question, really just from a bigger picture perspective. Clearly, the business has turned much healthier here lately with used car unit comps in this quarter tracking at over 7%. So, Bill, as we look at this, as we look at the improved trajectory in used car unit comps, how should we think about -- and maybe you could help us understand better the split, so to say, between -- the data we're looking at suggests the overall environment has gotten better, maybe with some help from used car pricing other factors. But, you also clearly have a number of initiatives taking place at CarMax, a lot of these tied to the omni-channel. So, how much of this strengthening used car unit comps is internal versus external? And if you look at maybe the internal side, what should we think as the kind of the bigger drivers of all that you're doing?","Bill Nash","Yes. That's a great question, Brian. As I noted earlier, it is part of great execution. It's also some favorable environment. When I think about the favorable environment, obviously, favorable access to credit -- new car prices at an absolute level are still high, although in the quarter, we seem to see a little bit of narrowing of the new to used car gap, but the absolute prices of new cars are still high. You've got low unemployment, you've got good consumer confidence, inventory build that I said. You\u2019ve got those external factors. But, I also salute a lot of the internal factors, especially from an execution standpoint, when you look at buying -- acquiring the right car at the right price, especially in a time where we saw depreciation that we would normally see in this time of year. Our operations teams continue to find efficiencies in ways that we can pass along to the customers. The customer progression, both in-store and online, we've made great strides there, moving customers along, online in our CECs, we've got new tools that we started to roll out to help our new associates there. CAF executed well, supporting sales, driving CAF margins and still offering great customer offers, we've got the marketing campaign that launched. And as we look at it, there is no one factor that's the majority of that comp growth. I really do feel, we really believe that it's a combination of all those factors.","Brian Nagel","Got it. It's very, very helpful. Then, my follow-up -- my related follow-up question, just with regard to the marketing expense you called out here in Q3, which was somewhat of a headwind to earnings. How is the new marketing campaign -- or how should we look at the new marketing campaign as an enhancement to what the changes you've already made to marketing, over the past few quarters?","Bill Nash","Yes. I think, periodically we rework our marketing. This was a big change. We have a new outside agency, between the outside agency and our internal team, I think they've done a great job really bring it to life, not only our brand, but also the omni-channel experience in those markets. So, as you've seen in the past, when we go with the new marketing campaign, if you look at the last one with Andy Daly, we run that for a while, we build off of that. I would think that this marketing campaign, the same type thing will continue to build off of the strength of this. And as we go forward, you will just continue to see this new campaign versus running ads on all campaigns.","In the third quarter, I've talked about this on previous calls, in the first and second, we knew that we were going to be heavy on the backside of the year. We ran light on advertising as a matter of fact. Through the second quarter year-to-date on a per unit basis, we were spending less than what we spent last year on an annual basis. And I've said all along, we're going to spend a little bit more to also help market our omni-channel experience. And I think, as you look at where we are now year-to-date, Enrique cited earlier, we're about $225 per unit, slightly above last year. And I think that's a good proxy. We will be slightly above where we finished the year last year. We still expect that's where we will come in, on a per unit basis.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sharon Zackfia from William Blair. Please go ahead.","Sharon Zackfia","Hi. Good morning. Question on SG&A. There's obviously a lot of moving parts in there this quarter. And, I appreciate the commentary on the 5% to 8% to leverage comps, I guess, going forward. Can you talk about whether that 5% to 8% would be applicable for the fourth quarter? And then, as we go into fiscal 2021, I know there is still continued investments in omni-channel, but does that start to abate somewhat in terms of the incremental spending and in efficiencies that you're seeing?","Bill Nash","Yes. Enrique will take the first part. I'll take the second part.","Enrique Mayor-Mora","Yes. On a quarterly basis, there is so much -- there can be so much variability that when we refer to the 5% to 8%, it's on a longer annual basis. If you take a look at this quarter between stock-based comp and between the advertising timing, that alone caused us to deleverage. So, within any particular quarter, it's difficult to say. But certainly on an annual basis, that is our expectation.","Bill Nash","Yes. And Sharon on the second part of your question about what you should expect to see in the New Year. I've said earlier in previous calls, last year was a step-up year. We expected this year to be another step-up year. Next year, we expect it to be a continued step-up year but less to a degree than what you've seen from a growth percent, less so than what you saw this year or last year. And of course, we'll provide some more direction in our fourth quarter call when we're back here, then.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Murphy from Bank of America. Please go ahead.","John Murphy","Good morning, guys. I just wanted to follow-up on one of the comments you made on the call. The development of the CRM system and making it more advanced, so there's more data available to your sales team. And I'm just curious, is there an intention to maybe go more proactively and market sales directly to individual consumers to drive same-store sales, as you're developing that CRM system, or is this more just as people come in and inquire about vehicles, you just have more information to help out the process? It just seems like there may be an opportunity here to get more directed advertising going.","Bill Nash","Yes. I think, when I think about the CRM, the CRM is more of a tool to help our associates, whether they're in the customer experience center or in the store. I think, the beauty of the CRM is we collect data and we can analyze data. We can do what we call smart routing to make sure that we handle those leads -- how we handle those and who handles those leads, we're becoming much more savvy of that, which is one of the areas that I'm excited about as we go forward, continuing to pick up efficiencies. As far as being able to directly target more customers, we've already shifted that way. When you think about our total advertising spend, probably half of it is more on a digital advertising, which is much more pinpointed than what I would call traditional advertising, which is more of the broadcast TV, radio type of stuff. I do think that the data that we're collecting from the CRM can assist us in helping to target future customers, but I kind of think about them in different buckets, if that makes sense.","John Murphy","Okay. And then just one follow-up on the express pickup and in-home delivery. You said a little bit less than 10% in the eligible market. So, it sounds like it\u2019s somewhere between 5% to 10%. I mean, would you call those folks that are doing the express pickup and in-home delivery incremental consumers or buyers in your stores or is there some kind of cannibalization? Just trying to understand what's incremental and what's cannibalized?","Bill Nash","Yes. At this point, I would say, it's probably both. And when I look at those two, we're doing more express pickups than we are home deliveries, at this point. It's interesting because sometimes we'll have customers that think that they want to be home delivery and then they start working through the process and they realize, you know, I'd like to come in and test drive a couple of cars, and so they convert over to in-store. The express pickup, just as a reminder, that allows a customer really do everything online and still come into the store, get their keys, if they want to take the car for a test drive, maybe learn about the options that we can have them out in less than 30 minutes. So, I see both those -- as I said earlier, I see both of those as continuing to grow as we mature the experience and also as we highlight the mix -- the experience in our marketing efforts.","Operator","Our next question comes from Armintas Sinkevicius from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Armintas Sinkevicius","Great. Thank you for taking the question. 7.5% same-store sales growth year-over-year, that's quite a strong number. How do we think about how much of that comes from a favorable used car sales environment versus how much of that comes from the omni-channel rollout? Any way you can help us contextualize that that would be very much helpful.","Bill Nash","Yes. As I said earlier, there is a lot of different factors. I don't think any one of those factors is the majority. So, I don't think necessarily the favorable environment is a majority when you add all those things I talked about earlier. I think, a lot of these execution things that we highlighted, I think, the -- especially the digital initiatives improvements that we've made as part of omni and rolled that out to the other locations that don't have omni, I don't think -- we don't believe any one of them lines up and has the majority of that lift. It's really a combination of all of them.","Armintas Sinkevicius","Okay. And when you talk about lift, does that mean versus the comp a year ago or just the 7.5% number itself?","Bill Nash","When I think about that 7.5% number and what contributes to that performance, that's what I'm saying, I don't think -- we don't believe in any one of those items is the majority of that 7.5%.","Operator","Our next question comes from Craig Kennison from Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead.","Craig Kennison","Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I guess, first, I want to tell you that my daughter contributed to your comp this quarter. We had a great experience. So, thank you for that.","Bill Nash","That's great. Thank you, Craig.","Craig Kennison","Yes. It was a good experience. We didn't get to do the internet omni-channel experience yet, but I'm sure that will come. The question I had was on your recon business or your recon work. You always seem to drive cost out of the reconditioning process. Has that trend continued? And as a follow-up, is it still your policy mostly to return that to the consumer rather than trap some of that in the gross profit line?","Bill Nash","Yes. Craig, to answer your question on giving it back to customer, yes, at this point, we like passing that along to the customer. It helps make the prices as competitive as possible. The reconditioning, we continue to look for efficiencies there. I would say the area that we're seeing a little bit more improvement on is more of the procurement. So, think about parts, that kind of thing, we've equipped our associates in the field with certain tools that allow them to buy the right part at the right time, at the right expense. I would also tell you picking up some efficiencies in our transportation, as we move more vehicles with our internal and dedicated fleets, that helps as well. And then, of course, I always put an emphasis on our buying, because that's really when you think about price competitiveness. It really starts with where you purchased the cars. And I think, the buyers have helped to make sure that we are buying them at the right price and the right time. The other thing I would just say is that, not only does it help us be competitive on prices all those savings, but it also helps us manage our margin and keep that stable as well.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rick Nelson from Stephens. Please go ahead.","Rick Nelson","So, the New York Fed this week pointed to a higher rejection rate for auto loans. I'm curious, if you see any need for tightening of CAF? I did notice a shift toward the Tier 2 and Tier 3 finance providers away from CAF?","Bill Nash","Rick, could you just repeat the first part of your question, please?","Rick Nelson","So, the New York Fed this week, they had a report out that pointed to higher rejection rate on auto loans. And I'm curious, if you need to tighten CAF?","Tom Reedy","No. I think, as I mentioned, we've seen real strong performance from both our partner lenders who are originating in our system, which is as Bill mentioned, providing a little bit of a lift year-over-year. And in CAF, we saw losses tick up a little bit earlier in the year and our increased provision this quarter kind of reflects that's just going at that run rate that we've been experiencing in all year versus a little bit more favorable environment last year. But, we've seen no need to adjust our credit appetite. We're still generating portfolio that we're very comfortable with and happy with the business.","Rick Nelson","Also, on the GPU front, another solid quarter. You talked about gaining leverage from omni-channel? Is your intent, Bill, to pass those -- that leverage on to the customer to drive more volume or does that spend...","Bill Nash","Yes. Right now, the leverage that I referred to on the call was we started to see one of our -- the oldest customer experience in Atlanta, customer experience, we started to see some cost leverage there. And that would really show up more in the SG&A line versus the GPU or passing along to the customer in the form of the price. So, you'll see that show up in SG&A savings.","Operator","Our next question comes from Derek Glynn from Consumer Edge Research. Please go ahead.","Derek Glynn","Good morning. Thanks for taking our question. We had a follow-up on the home delivery attach rate at a little less than 10% of sales in omni-channel markets. Where do you think that steady state number is? What percent of your overall sales do you think home delivery can be in the long run?","Bill Nash","Well, just for clarification, Derek. The 10% that I cited is both home delivery and express pickup. And express pickup is home delivery. So, it\u2019s higher than home delivery. So, both are still, if you take each one individually, very small percent of our overall sales. But, as far as where I think it can go, to be honest with you, I don't know. But, to be honest, it doesn't really matter to us because we're there to support the customer and give them the experience they want. So, if more want home delivery, great, we\u2019ll be able to satisfy that. If they want to come into the store, we\u2019ll be able to satisfy that. So, I don't know where it's going to go. We did see -- throughout the quarter, we saw more people leveraging express pickup and home delivery. But, I don't know what the top end of that could be.","Derek Glynn","And then, just as a follow-up, as we think about your SUV and truck mix, I would think that follows a pattern unfolding in the new market with the mix of those vehicles is much higher. To what extent do you view that as a tailwind to your ASPs? And is there any opportunity or appetite to take more price drive higher GPUs?","Bill Nash","Remember, when we look at GPUs, it's not driven by the expense of the car. That's not -- we don't make necessarily more money on a more expensive vehicle. As far as how do we see this going forward? The truck mix, I think, and I'd have to go back and confirm for sure, but the truck mix has been ticking up a little bit. And that's more representative of what's coming into the marketplace, either through our appraisal lane or through the outside auction. So, I would continue to see that that pattern exist in the upcoming quarters.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Whiston from Morningstar. Please go ahead.","David Whiston","Thanks, good morning. My question is on new vehicle leasing as a substitute to buying a used car from CarMax. I think, leasing has very much peak for the cycle but it\u2019s -- in the past, there's been some very attractive offers to the consumers. So, do you see new vehicle leasing as less of a substitute threat than say 12 months ago or is it about the same or\u2026","Bill Nash","Well, I think, the industry data would say that this year probably the off-leasing vehicles will peak -- between this current year and last year, there'll be at a peak level. As far as where we think leases might go next year, again, it would be a shot in the dark. I'm certainly not a leasing expert. But, wherever it goes, whether leases continue to persist in the next quarter or if they drop off a little bit in the next quarter, inventory availability for us will still be in good shape as far as acquiring inventory and as leases -- the peak of off-leases come down, there will be something else that fills in that spot. I mean, we've seen this cycle run many times over the years that we've been in business.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Bottiglieri from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Chris Bottiglieri","First question is on advertising, the step-up. Was most of this incremental spend distributed nationally, or was it more targeted to where you have omni-channel markets? And then, two -- sorry.","Bill Nash","I'm sorry. Go ahead. Finish your question.","Chris Bottiglieri","Yes. Then, I was just like kind of -- related to that was kind of like, as you push more online, have you rethought like what the right advertising budget is, maybe advertising more makes more sense, I'm just curious how you think about that.","Enrique Mayor-Mora","Yes. The majority of the spend on the quarter was actually the national spend, not the omni-market spend.","Chris Bottiglieri","Got you. Okay. That's helpful. And then, I wanted to talk more about the wholesale business. You talked about like the web traffic looks great, you talked about lower -- like your unit growth was great, but then talked about lower appraisal traffic at wholesale. So, A, wanted a sense for what you think drove that. Is the competitive environment for trade is getting more difficult, just given were we are in the cycle of competitive threats? And then, two, can you talk about the supply of the 8 to 10-year old vehicles that should be increasing, has that manifest the way that you thought it would have earlier in the cycle.","Bill Nash","Yes. So, Chris, I mean, I think that it's been -- there has been robust competition for what we would consider A lane vehicles. I mean, a lot of different dealers are focused on trying to buy more outside of the auction. But, that's nothing new. The comments I made earlier about wholesale was more around GPU. And with that, the GPU went down a little bit, but that's more of a function of what we saw in the marketplace from a depreciation standpoint as the vehicles depreciate and we put less on the offer, which also has an impact on buyer rate and volume. So, we had a little bit of pressure on buyer rates, still up around 30%, little over 30%. So, we're still pleased with that. But anytime you have a depreciating market, it puts a little headwind on your offers which then puts a little headwind on your volume.","Chris Bottiglieri","Yes, it certainly makes sense. Did the number of wholesale locations change this quarter? It looks like you closed a couple, but I might just get the way on reading the schedule.","Bill Nash","No, we did not close any auctions.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Seth Basham from Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead.","Seth Basham","Stock-based comp was a big headwind this quarter. You mentioned some additional stock compensation to service line associates, which is captured in SG&A, but are you also giving more stock-based comp to associates that would be captured in that SG&A?","Enrique Mayor-Mora","Yes. Stock-based compensation, the majority is going to be in SG&A, but there's also components in service profits as we mentioned related to service associates, it\u2019s also a component related to CAF as well. But, by far the largest component is within SG&A. I think, it's also -- it's just important to emphasize again, this is our broad-based equity program, it's targeted at non-executive management, settled in cash and runs through the P&L.","Bill Nash","Yes. And Seth, just to also clarify, we didn't increase that program. It's not like there were more shares or anything out there. It's just the market volatility to change from quarter-over-quarter.","Seth Basham","Got it. Thank you for that clarification. And then, secondly, as it relates to the performance of your comparable store sales overall relative to your omni-channel markets, you mentioned omni-channel is slightly better. That sounds a little bit different than what you're describing. The omni-channel outperformance in prior quarters, is that A, correct; and B, is that surprising; and C, is it still a good investment, if you're not getting a big lift on those omni-channel sales?","Bill Nash","There is a lot of different questions in that one question, Seth, but I'll try to do my best to remember all of them. You have to keep me honest. But, is it surprising where we are, absolutely not. I mean, if you're comparing it to what we have seen in the Atlanta market, it is different than that. But, I said all along, look, every market's is going to be a little bit different. We're going to have different levers that we pull. I actually feel really good about where we are with the omni rollout and the comp contribution to that. Because right now we have a headwind in our omni markets as it relates to our customer experience centers. If you think about it, when a market rolls onto to the omni -- the omni experience, the day it rolls on, we turn the e-offices in the stores. While the e-offices have been manned by associates that have been around a long time, they know what they're doing when it comes to progressing customers. We now turn them on to the customer experience centers. And I would just remind you that our customer experience centers, the most tenured associates that we have working with customers has only been doing it for about six months. So, as we continue to roll out and we continue to stand up and open these new customer experience centers, the Kansas City one, the Phoenix one, you have a lot less tenured associates that are handling the customer progression. I think, it's a great opportunity for us and it's one of the things that I think about when we think about efficiencies going forward and productivity gains. But, I feel good about where we are given that our omni markets actually have a headwind working against them.","Seth Basham","Understood. Thank you very much. Happy holidays, guys.","Bill Nash","You too.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session. I\u2019ll now turn the call back over to Bill Nash for closing remarks.","Bill Nash","Great. Thank you, Carol. I want to thank all of you for your interest in CarMax and for joining us today. As always, our success is because of our associates and the culture that they have created.

Thank you all for joining our fiscal 2015 fourth quarter and year end earnings conference call. As always, on the call with me today are Tom Folliard, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Tom Reedy, our Executive Vice President and CFO.","Before we begin, let me remind you that our statements today regarding the company's future business plans, prospects and financial performance are forward-looking statements that we make pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Tom?","Tom Folliard","Thank you, Katharine. Good morning everyone, thanks for joining the call today. As you saw by now, we had both a record fourth quarter and a record fiscal year. During the year, total revenues grew to more than $14 billion and we sold nearly 1 million total vehicles, more than 591,000 retail cars and 376,000 wholesale cars through our in-store auctions.","Here are some of the key highlights for the year; used unit comps, up 4% and total used units grew by over 10%. Wholesale vehicle gross profit, up 16%, driven by a 10% increase in units sold, and an increase in wholesale gross profit per unit of $54 per car. CAF income up 9% to more than $367 million, Tom will give some more details on that in a moment. Excluding the items we highlighted in the press release, net income for the fiscal year increased 16% and EPS grew 21%.","Our data indicates, that for the calendar year 2014, we increased our share of the zero to 10 year old used vehicle market by approximately 5%. We also continue to focus on returning value to shareholders through our stock repurchase program. During fiscal 2015, we bought back 17.5 million shares at a cost of a little over $900 million. Since we began the program in fiscal 2013, we have purchased more than 30 million shares.","Now on to some of the key drivers for the fourth quarter, used unit comps, up 7%, driven by an increase in traffic, as well as an improvement in conversion. Total used units grew by 12%. Wholesale gross profit, up 22%, reflecting a 12% increase in units sold, and an increase of $83 in gross profit per unit. GAAP quarterly income up 12% to $90 million, and again, excluding the items we shared in the press release, net income for the fourth quarter increased 20%, and earnings per share up 28%.","With that, I will turn it over to Tom, and he will give you some details around CAF. Tom?","Tom Reedy","Thanks Tom. Good morning everybody. CAF recorded another solid year, with 9% income growth to $367 million, and growth in average managed receivables of 19%. As Tom mentioned, in the fourth quarter, CAF income was $90.4 million, up 12% compared to fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, and Q4 average managed receivables grew 18%, to $8.3 billion.","CAF's weighted average contract rate, that rate that we charge to customers, was flat to last year's fourth quarter at 7.2%. This rate continues to be relatively stable, at around 7% for the past couple of years. The allowance for loan losses grew to about $82 million, this represents 1% of managed receivables, which is relatively consistent with last year but during the quarter and the year CAF income did benefit from favorable loss experience.","CAF net penetration was 40.9% compared to 40.1% in last year's fourth quarter. This figure includes originations from our subprime test, and if you back out those originations, this quarter's penetration would have been 40.2%, which is similar to last year.","Net loan dollars originated in the quarter rose 16% to $1.2 billion, due to a combination of CarMax's unit sales growth, our modestly higher penetration and a small increase in the average amount financed.","Finally, we intend to continue with our subprime test. Recall that our primary goal for this investment, was to gain knowledge regarding this space, and we expect these learnings will prove invaluable.","While performance to-date is in line with our expectations, we believe allowing the receivables to [indiscernible] deeper into their life, including maturing through a full tax season, will better equip us to assess our long term strategy. On average, the terms of these contracts is nearly 70 months, and at fiscal year end, the average time on our books for loans is less than seven months.","We are comfortable continuing to originate at the current target volume which is 5% of CarMax's subprime sales or a little less than 2% of CAF originations.","Tom?","Tom Folliard","Thank you. As far as mix of sales, sales of zero to four year old vehicles grew to approximately 75% of our total sales, the same as the third quarter by over five percentage points higher than last year's fourth quarter. Sales of SUVs and trucks as a percentage was similar to last year.","SG&A for the quarter, increased approximately 11% to $330 million, contributing to this growth, was the addition of 18 stores, since the beginning of the fourth quarter of last year, and a $9 million increase in share based compensation expense. On a per unit basis, SG&A decreased $23 to $2186 compared to $2,209 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014.","During the fourth quarter, we opened one store in our new Cleveland market, in Katharine's hometown. Since the fourth quarter, we opened two more stores, one in Minneapolis, a new market for CarMax, and one yesterday in Turnersville, New Jersey, which is part of our Philadelphia market. In addition to these two, we plan to open 12 more stores in fiscal 2016, plus the relocation of our store in Rockville, Maryland.","In regards to our small format test, we have now opened five stores, and as a group, they are performing at or above our expectations. We expect the small format stores to be a part of our store openings going forward. Of our 14 store openings in fiscal 2016, there will be three small format, including our first small format front store, with full production capability in the back, and that will be in Gainesville, Florida. Also, we now plan to open between 13 and 16 stores annually over the next three years.","Store traffic, was up once again in the quarter, and our web traffic also continued to expand. For the fourth quarter, average monthly web visits grew over 9% compared to last year's fourth quarter, to over 14.5 million visits, and visits to our mobile site now represent approximately 32% of the total, while visits utilizing our mobile app, represent another 16% of the total.","And with that, we will open it up for questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from the line of Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer.","Brian Nagel","Hi good morning.","Tom Folliard","Hi Brian.","Brian Nagel","Congratulations on a nice quarter and a nice year.","Tom Folliard","Thank you.","Brian Nagel","So I have got just a couple of questions here; a question and then I guess a follow-up. First off, just a point of clarification, you mentioned the subprime test and the continuation of that test. So are you now planning to go above the prior stated $70 million size in the test? And then if so, how should we think about -- I guess there could be the new volume relative to that initial goal\u2026","Tom Reedy","Hey, Brian, I am sorry if I wasn't clear, but I think in the release we say we did $72 million up to the end of fiscal 2015. So that's what we did through the year. What I said is, we are comfortable continuing at the same pace, which is about 5% of the subprime business that CarMax does. So if subprime continues to be a similar number of our sales as last year, it\u2019ll be a similar pace of volume for us.","Brian Nagel","Okay. That's helpful, thank you. Also on this follow-up; also on the subprime business, if you look at not just what you originate but what your partners originate as well, any commentary there about the willingness of your partners to lend -- I guess couple of quarters, where we saw some type of disruption, just look a lot of rumblings of the market with what's going on out there. Are you seeing any shifts at all in the willingness of your partners to lend subprime based accounts?","Tom Reedy","Well I think, if you look year-over-year, we are at 17 versus 17.6 as a percent of subprime in the business. Last year's fourth quarter is when we really first started feeling any changes in behavior. And as I mentioned, I think on the last call, we have seen pretty consistent behavior out of our partners for the last several quarters. The key thing that we are looking at, is the quality of their offers, and what that translates into, just how many of the customers that receive offers from them, actually convert to a sale. Our subprime partners cannot control the nature of what's coming into them, because the tier-2 lenders are looking at it ahead of time, and have the first look at that.","So on the basis of conversions of offers, we assume their behavior would be very consistent, and we are very happy with their performance.","Brian Nagel","That's very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Sharon Zackfia with William Blair.","Sharon Zackfia","Hi, good morning. So I think, this might be -- in the press release you indicated you're doing 15 remodels this year, and one relo. And I don't really remember any remodeling program at CarMax; can you talk about kind of what you expect to do on the remodels if there is anything operationally that that will affect, or if it\u2019s more cosmetic? And then the relo, just where is that, and is there the opportunity for more relos in the CarMax system?","Tom Folliard","Sure. So first of all, over our history, we have constantly spent capital on keeping our stores up-to-date and renovating them over time. Since we launched the next-gen concept, I forget, four or five years ago now, we have now gone back in, and we are applying some of those technology changes with some more digital screens and some digital capabilities in the store. As well as open seating, which we really had prior to next gen, but we think it\u2019s a much more efficient use of floor space. And so the conversions are a little more extensive than they have been, because we are doing a combination of technology and converting, whether its cubes or offices into floor space, we just finished converting our Richmond store and it looks fantastic and that's the oldest store in the chain.","I think we completed three or four of these types of conversions, and they're a little bit more expensive than the money that would have been spent. So we just thought we would call it out, and we plan to do another 17 this year. In terms of operational changes, it doesn't change much operationally, but I think it provides a better experience for our customers, and a better working environment for our associates as well. So we have been pretty pleased with what we have done so far, and we will gauge the results going forward, and see how much more aggressively we want to spend.","In terms of the relo, that's our Rockville store; our Rockville store was originally a competitor who built a kind of a copycat. It\u2019s a very small footprint. I think it\u2019s only on five acres or so, and it has been a very successful store for us. This is just a situation where the lease was up for renewal, and we took the opportunity to move -- we are really only moving a short distance away from that store, to a much bigger facility, and that store has been very successful for us. But it was really undersized the whole time we had it. At this time, we don't have any other plans for relos, this one was just more opportunistic as the lease came up.","Sharon Zackfia","Okay, great. Thank you.","Tom Folliard","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets.","Scot Ciccarelli","Good morning guys. How are you?","Tom Folliard","Good. You Scot?","Scot Ciccarelli","Good, thanks. So I think the last couple of quarters, you talked about tier-2 becoming a bit more aggressive, in terms of their lending, and that was -- subprime penetration was starting to moderate a little bit. But subprime penetration has kind of rebounded, at least sequentially the last two quarters. Does that mean tier-2s pull back a bit, or should we just see that as more overall credit availability, when you look at the overall market?","Tom Reedy","Hi Scot, this is Tom. I think you\u2019re better to viewing it as Tier-3 stabilizing versus reading anything into overall credit availability. Tier-2 is still doing very strong for us, and we said we are happy with our partners. We brought in some new partners, we have a really good diverse stable of finance partners in tier-2 and it\u2019s performing well for us.","Scot Ciccarelli","Can you give us an idea kind of what tier-2 is going on penetration rate, kind of on a year-over-year basis Tom?","Tom Reedy","Clearly, what we have seen is something in a low 40s for CarMax auto finance, and we have said 20% to 25% gets financed outside the CarMax system, and the rest being kind of split between tier-2 and tier-3. I'd say that in the current environment we are looking at kind of the lower end of that 20% to 25% for other, and tier-2 and tier-3 are doing 35 -- we said tier-3 was at 17, so that gives you a pretty good flavor.","Scot Ciccarelli","Got it. Okay, thanks a lot guys.","Tom Folliard","Thanks Scot.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Craig Kennison with Baird.","Craig Kennison","Yeah, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. First, could you just give us the buy-rate, if you did not provide that in the quarter? And then second, related to your ad spending, it appears to have declined after four quarters of strong growth. How should we think about ad spending going forward, and what are your key priorities for marketing under your leadership there?","Tom Folliard","What was the first part again?","Craig Kennison","The buy rate?","Tom Folliard","Sorry. Buy rate was right around 30%, very similar to last year, and in terms of ad spend, we did a Super Bowl last year, we did not do a Super Bowl this year. So some of that -- most of the change is just the subtraction of Super Bowl year-over-year. But in terms of kind of a regular scheduled spend, it was in line with what we were trying to accomplish.","Craig Kennison","And any change in priorities, under the new leadership?","Tom Folliard","We are making a lot of changes, and we are evaluating how best to spend our money, but that will be an ongoing process for us. So continued strong effort on TV, we are pretty much out of print, and have been for a long time, and continuing to try to optimize our paid search, as well as trying to improve our SEO, our search engine optimization through organic search. And continuing to test using outside partners as well. So, you know, a similar mix, but we will see what happens going forward.","Craig Kennison","Great. Congratulations.","Tom Folliard","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Matthew (sic) Fassler with Goldman Sachs.","Matthew Fassler","Good morning. It's Matt Fassler with Goldman Sachs.","Tom Folliard","Good morning Michael.","Matthew Fassler","Go figure. My primary question here relates to wholesale. So you had -- from what I can tell is, the highest level of wholesale profitability per vehicle you've ever had in the fourth quarter. You also had the biggest year-on-year increase in wholesale gross profit per vehicle that you've had in about five years. Just curious whether there is anything in the backdrop other than your stellar execution, that would lead to that kind of pop in the wholesale profit number?","Tom Folliard","First, thank you for calling our execution stellar. And you know, really good execution continues to build year-over-year. You're right, it\u2019s the first fourth quarter we have ever had, that exceeded $1,000 in profit per car. We have had two first quarters that have done that in the past. But, as our reputation builds, it\u2019s a great place for dealers to come and buy this type of product. I think our stores do a great job of marketing, and we are \u2013 it\u2019s always a balancing act between wholesale margin and making sure we have a very strong buy rate. Remember, lots of the customers that are selling us these cars are also buying a car from us.","So a good barometer for how fair we are being with our customers with our buy rate, which I just mentioned was very strong at 30%. So again this is -- wholesale is always at balance with retail. It\u2019s never a standalone business that can be managed separately. You always have to pay attention to what's happening on the retail side. So I am really proud of the stores and how well they have executed. We have some stores that are particularly tight on space, and have to manage running -- some stores running two auctions a week out in California, and we have just started -- the stores have done a fantastic job of managing relationships and making sure we get great attendance. And that has lead to a great performance.","Matthew Fassler","Has the fact that prices based on some of the Mannheim indices have been particularly resilient, maybe that surprisingly so, kind of been part of the profitability story here, or would you say that it\u2019s independent of that?","Tom Folliard","No, I think that's a factor too. And usually at this time of the year, coming out of the winter, you start to see some movement up in the Mannheim index, and we se that as well. So that's always a little bit of a tailwind for us, in terms of margin, when we see an appreciating market. I don't think it was up that much in the last report, but it\u2019s typically a time of the year, when we see some appreciation.","Matthew Fassler","And then, just a follow-up and hopefully you will consider this a public service request, rather than a question. Just a little bit of color on the capitalized interest add back and just what that number is, why it would have looked different this quarter versus prior quarters?","Tom Reedy","Hey Matt, the only thing we'd really say about that, is it was a miss on our part. We are required to capitalize interest on construction projects and it netted against other interest expense. So as you saw, it was 8.9 in Q4, 6.9 of that related to periods before Q4 this year. Look back at other periods, and it made the determination that the impact is not material on any earlier period. So it\u2019s just something we will be doing going forward, but it was a miss.","Matthew Fassler","So some of it shut up in prior periods, and you shut it here, it\u2019s a catch-up if you will?","Tom Reedy","Yes.","Matthew Fassler","Got it. Thank you so much.","Tom Reedy","And that it all would have been in this year.","Matthew Fassler","Understood.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of James Albertine with Stifel.","James Albertine","Great. Thanks for taking the question, and congratulations as well. I just had a quick sort of housekeeping; I noticed your cash balance as one of the lowest you have had in quite some time, and in light of the store growth and the renovations and remodels and everything you're working from on that perspective. Is that something that's temporary or how should we think about that from the fourth quarter?","Tom Reedy","I mean, as far as the cash balance goes, I can kind of walk you through what we did this year. If you look -- we went through $600 million in cash plus took out a $300 million term loan, that's $900 million of stock buyback during the year was a little bit greater than $917 million. So what that means is, all the other spend that we had during the year, CapEx, needs for CAF and inventory, which again totaled another $900 million, were covered by cash flow in the core business.","So as far as liquidity goes, I mean, we are in an environment where we feel pretty good about our banks allowing us to step up and live up to their commitments on our revolving credit facility, a $1 billion facility. We will manage with some amount of liquidity that we can run the business with. I think the decline in the cash balance was planned and deliberate, and the business is still generating lot of cash. And if you look kind of closely at it, it reflects that.","Tom Folliard","And we sought them in the past about moving towards a more optimal capital structure, so this is just us kind of delivering on stuff that we have already talked about.","James Albertine","Very good. Just a quick follow-up if I may; any thoughts on the Wells Fargo announcement with the capping of subprime loans; and if we start to see that elsewhere, how should we sort of think about that probably over the market? Thanks.","Tom Folliard","Yeah, I am always hesitant to talk about anything outside of CarMax with regards to subprime, because everybody thinks about subprime differently. And if you recall, Wells Fargo is not one of our -- what we call our subprime partners, but I am sure in the Tier-2 space, they originate loans that some people would define as subprime.","So that's one thing; I mean, that's really an evidence of why keep a diverse stable of partners, to make sure that our customers have access to financing and access to give credit offers at all times, and I think we feel like we are in a pretty good shape there. Also historically, we believe that our partners have opted to direct volume towards CarMax, at the expense of other places, because they like the origination channel, the clarity of information and the knowledge about what the asset is really worth, etcetera. So we have observed in tough times before, that we felt we were less impacted than other folks. Who knows what that means going forward, but that's probably as much color as I can give you.","James Albertine","Good. Thanks again, and good luck.","Tom Folliard","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Aram Rubinson with Wolfe Research.","Aram Rubinson","Hey everybody. Good morning and terrific results. Question for you on the technology, if it\u2019s okay. I think you said your web traffic was up 9%, I know a lot of retailers have web traffic up a lot more than their own sales. And so irrespective of that, I am hoping you can give us a little lens or window into kind of technology, as you're using it incrementally to run your own business and enable sales; and also, maybe from the competitive standpoint, what you're seeing out there in terms of technology or apps or things like that, that might be causing any pressure down the road?","Tom Folliard","Thanks Aram. So we have used technology at our stores from the very beginning, and a combination of things, both for our associates and for our customers. So we employ a lot of use of data, and the ability to deliver that data back to our employees. At the moment, they need it to make good decisions. We have lots of ability to track customers through the process and make future decisions based on that. So I think we have done a pretty good job of utilizing technology in our stores, so that our associates can deliver a great customer experience.","In terms of customer facing, it\u2019s something that we continue to invest in and we will continue to invest in more, going forward. We want to make sure that we can communicate with our customers. However it is that they want to communicate with us. I have talked in the past about being a little bit behind in terms of mobile. We will continue to invest there. We have made lots of improvements over time to our pictures and the quality of our pictures. We used to take one to nine, we are up to around 40. We have high definition pictures, we have zoom capability, we have adjusted our landing pages to be more personalized, and we will continue to make some efforts in that regard as well.","And I think you will see us do a lot more stuff, as it relates to mobile, and touch screen. Its -- more than 50% of our total hits to our web site are now coming from either a mobile device or a tablet, and its something that we need to make sure that the customer has a fantastic experience, if they want to communicate with us in that format. So those are the kinds of things we continue to invest in, and we have tested online capabilities, which is a lot -- you see a lot of niche-y type of things from various -- whether they're competitors, or people who enable our competitors; things such as online current applications which we are testing, the ability to transfer our car from one location to another, without speaking to our sales consultant; the ability to put a credit card payment down to have those cards transferred, which we are doing. You can go online and put a car on hold, you can make an appointment with our sales consultant. So we have done a lot of stuff, to make sure customers can do more and more of the process from home. They can fill out a good chunk of the paperwork before they show up at our store. But all these things, are the types of stuff that we need to continue to invest then. But I think we have made a lot of nice progress, but we got a long way to go.","Aram Rubinson","Sounds like you're not resting on your laurels. Thanks a lot.","Tom Folliard","Thank you, Aram.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Montani with Evercore ISI.","Michael Montani","Hey, good morning guys. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to ask about productivity in terms of used units sold per dealership. And I guess, the way I was thinking about it is, pre-recession, you guys averaged about 4,800 units, which was well over of 4,000 of zero to four year old cars, by my math. Just looking ahead in coming years, we think the supply of zero to four year old vehicles is going to grow by about 25%, 30% over the next five or six years, and ultimately could drive a 10% to 15% tailwinded throughput. Can you just comment on that at all, about what maybe what some of the risks are to that, or if there's something that improvement missing? And then secondarily, I'd just love to get your thoughts around profitability on a dealership level, if you're able to get that kind of throughput, any structural impediments to retail EBIT margins going up in that environment?","Tom Reedy","First on your comment about throughput annualized of zero to four year old cars, we never adjust zero to four year old cars, we have always been zero to 10. So it\u2019s a much broader spectrum of vehicles than you stated there. That number did change over time, as I stated in my comments; zero to four year old cars represent 75% of our sales, that was 70% just a couple of years ago, so it has moved by about five points. But you kind of have to look at a much broader spectrum of inventory to look at total sales fro CarMax. And it does look like, you would see a supply movement in zero to four, just base don movement in zero to four, just based on movement in SAR, and as I said before, we have historically had higher share in the zero to four year old segment. So is there a potential tailwind, probably, but the other factor there is consumer behavior, and will they trade out cars as much as they used to and you have population growth and new drivers and things like that. So there is lots of different variables and factors, and I don't think you can just say, we expect whatever the number you said, 20% or 10%, I forget what number you said there. But I don't think we can just expect that as an increase in sales.","In terms of how do the stores handle it, we have been able to deliver exceptionally high volumes out of some pretty limited space in our stores, and all comp sales are more profitable than sales, once you've cleared all of your expenses. So it\u2019s very-very profitable for the company to continue to deliver comp sales out of existing facilities, because a lot of your fixed overhead remains comp spending, really just have to add some variable overhead.","So we are really pleased with the comps we delivered over the last couple of years. I think its one of the great parts of our business model, is that our stores continue to grow. As I said, we gained 5% share during the year, that's on top of a 17% share gain the year prior. But once again, that's over a zero to 10 year old car. So I think our stores are well primed to take advantage of supply increases as that translates to sales, and they are well positioned to turn that into better than average profits, because they are all on top of a base that's already covered fixed overhead.","Michael Montani","Thanks. Congratulations and good luck.","Tom Folliard","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Seth Basham with Wedbush.","Seth Basham","Good morning and thank you. My question is around comp sales growth. Tom, you spoke to traffic conversion driving the comp; maybe you can break that down, how much of it was traffic and how much was conversion? And related to that, what was driving the better conversion?","Tom Folliard","Seth, that's a good question. We get that frequently. It was roughly 50-50 in terms of conversion and traffic, and I always thought that over time, it will be 50-50. It doesn\u2019t line up all the time, sometimes it all comes from conversion sometimes it all comes from traffic, this happens to be one where it maxed up. As we have looked at over a very long period of time and the way we think about it going forward is, I would like to be able to continue to increase traffic to our stores, and I'd like to be able to do better with the traffic that we have.","And in terms of what are we doing to improve conversion, we have some really fantastic people in our stores that are dedicated and committed everyday to give the customer a great experience. We've tried to do a good job of providing additional training. Some of the stuff I talked about earlier in terms of technology as it relates to information and capabilities that our associates have, we have improved over the last several years, and plan to continue to improve going forward. So I really think it\u2019s just a testament to our 20,000 dedicated employees in the stores who work really hard everyday to try to be more and more efficient, and give the customer a better experience. Hopefully, that turns into higher sales, and they in turn go and tell all their friends and become spokespeople for CarMax. It has worked for us in the past, and I expect it to keep working going forward.","Seth Basham","So [indiscernible] would you say there was any difference in the quality credit offers, or the credit availability that has affected the conversion trends over the last few quarters?","Tom Reedy","That's another thing that's constantly on the move. It\u2019s a combination of what we do, a combination of what our partners do. I think Tom mentioned -- this was a relatively stable year, compared to some in the past, where we have seen some movements, whether its up or down from some of the lenders, we saw a big pullback during the recession, we saw some changes over the last coupled of years in subprime up or down. But this year has been relatively stable in terms of credit.","Seth Basham","Great. Thank you guys.","Tom Folliard","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Rick Nelson with Stephens.","Rick Nelson","How have franchise dealers have opened stores and your markets have -- you could comment there, the impact that they might be having, how you respond from a competitive standpoint and overall thoughts on those [indiscernible]?","Tom Folliard","Sure, thanks Rick. I know Sonic opened some stores in the Denver talking, and Asbury opened some stores in the Florida market. We are clearly more established in Florida, we have been there for a much longer period of time. Neither of those concepts have been open very long, so it\u2019s very difficult for us to read any results or impacts at this time. When we have some, we will be happy to share it, but both of those concepts have been open for a very short period of time and I really can't comment on their performance.","Tom Reedy","I think Sonic has been open for less than six months, and Asbury has been open, I think around a year. So the stores are a little bit smaller than ours. Some of them are closer than others, but so far, it\u2019s too early to comment.","Rick Nelson","In March here, you had talked about the move from zero to 10 year old bucket. Can you discuss where the gains are the biggest, and that sort of what your old bucket -- [indiscernible]?","Tom Folliard","You know Rick, I actually don't know the answer to that, I am not sure we are having that level of detail. We generally guess the whole market, you saw that we said it\u2019s through calendar year this year. This is the data that we have bought, and the reason we have gone to yearly announcements is that data is very, I would call unstable in the short term. So we are pretty confident in the direction and the number, but in terms of dividing it very specifically, we haven't really done that.","Rick Nelson","Got you. Thanks a lot and good luck.","Tom Folliard","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Armstrong with CL King & Associates.","Bill Armstrong","Good morning guys. I see that your average selling price for retail was down about $600 sequentially. Is that a function of mix, or are you seeing maybe some decline in pricing trends? And related to that, when you're out -- you're buying cars at auctions, what sort of trends are you seeing right now, in terms of supply and price trends?","Tom Folliard","Yes. That's mostly seasonality. We see a seasonal drop in the fourth quarter. Really fourth quarter over fourth quarter our average retails were up slightly. So not really much there. If you look at our mix sequentially of zero to four year old cars, didn't really move very much. It did move from this year's fourth quarter compared to last year's fourth quarter, by almost five points, which would lead you to believe that may be prices would go the other direction.","So I think it\u2019s more just a seasonal movement and nothing really else to read into there. In terms of what we are seeing at the auctions, this is the time of the year, when we always see appreciation in the marketplace, if you look at the most recent Mannheim Index, there really hasn't been very much movement. But if we were just thinking of it as a normal year, we would come out of January and head into the spring and expect some appreciation in the marketplace, probably into early summer, and then we would see a normal decline through the fall, if this is a normal year. But we don't like to make a lot of predictions about where the market is going to go, I think we have talked in the past about our ability to adjust and move and adapt to whatever the market brings to us, and we plan our inventory on a weekly basis. So what we are seeing right now in the wholesale marketplace is not really out of line with what we would have expected.","Bill Armstrong","There is a lot of anticipation I guess of -- an influx of more supply of the wholesale coming from off-lease vehicles and trade-ins etcetera. Are you guys seeing a more plentiful supply when you go to auctions every week or not necessarily?","Tom Folliard","Not necessarily. I mean, remember to that, leases that are originated in, I think lease percentages, is that a pretty high flip right now, somewhere around 30% in the industry. We won't see those cars for two or three years, so I think a lot of people look at lease percentages and think, oh you're going to see a big influx of cars, when its really two or three years down the road. And what we have seen in the past, and we have been at this for 20 years, and we have seen lease percentages in the 30, and we have seen lease percentages in the teens. What ends up happening is eventually those cars end up available for purchase, and we have done a nice job figuring how to have access to them.","Bill Armstrong","Okay got it. Thank you.","Tom Folliard","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley.","Ravi Shanker","Morning everyone. Just a couple of questions. First, on the subprime pilot program. Just wanted to make sure that the extension doesn't really rule out a meaningful expansion of the program later, and can you highlight any specific areas that you feel need more time to evaluate versus what you were expecting earlier?","Tom Reedy","Let me address the first, I think as I said, the results to-date are in line with what our initial expectations were. This is a different asset class for us, so we are interested in seeing how it performs, because its new to us, we are willing to be patient and ensure that we understand it completely, before we understand it completely before we do any sales. It does not rule out us doing a larger amount in the future. But if you remember, when we rolled this out a year ago, we said that there was three things we are looking for, one is learning, which we are definitely getting on that, I see that's going to benefit our business, whether or not we are in this space. But the other was a risk diversification play, and we have three partners in a subprime space who are doing an awesome job. Any decisions we make will be contemplating the impact on them, and I would not expect us to ever intend to be a full player in this space like we are in the prime space.","Ravi Shanker","Got it.","Tom Reedy","Probably as much color as I can give you about where our intentions have been.","Ravi Shanker","Makes sense. And on competition, this is perhaps a more longer term strategy question, over the last 12 months, we have seen emergence of a few peer-to-peer user vehicle platforms that tried to pass on SG&A savings to customers, and show these new startups only in the few markets right now, but one can imagine them going after the high volume used markets first, where you and your peers already have a presence. So my question really is, what do you guys think about these new business models, versus the brick and mortar strategy in general?","Tom Folliard","You know, we look at every part of competition, and in terms of peer-to-peer, one thing to remember is, that is a huge chunk of the market already and always has been. About a third of all cars sold in the U.S. are sold from consumer to consumer. Whether you sell a car by putting a sign in your yard or you list it online or you just put it in the newspaper or whatever you do. So that has always been a third.","One could argue that, that's where those sales could come from since they are already happen, and it\u2019s just such a giant piece. It\u2019s by far the biggest piece -- the biggest percentage of cars sold are sold from peer-to-peer already. A lot of what we do in our off -- when we make a cash offer to every customer on every single car, I think we probably have tapped into that as well as anybody by getting some of those cars that maybe would have been sold peer-to-peer. But its something we keep a very close eye on, and we will watch very closely and see if there is an opportunity somewhere for us.","Ravi Shanker","Got it. Thank you guys.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of David Whiston with Morningstar.","David Whiston","Thanks. Good morning. On store openings, for the upcoming year, you have got definitely a skew towards existing markets over new, and I was just curious if longer term, are you going to look to focus more on growing existing over new\/old or focus more on new later on?","Tom Folliard","You know, its an ever changing landscape for us, as we continue to get more data in existing markets, it gives us more comfort with going back into those markets. But we have a healthy mix of new markets as well, and one thing to take into account; when we go into a metro market like Philadelphia, Minneapolis, or this year, we will be entering Boston, those are intentionally multiyear plays for us to really grow out the market. So when you see us go back into Philly with Turnersville, New Jersey store this year, that's just part of the long term Philadelphia plan. It looks like a skew towards an existing market, but those are existing markets that are clearly understored, and we are not where we expect to be long term. So I expect it to be a mix going forward.","Some of the big ones that we have, coming in the next three years or so, Boston, San Francisco and Seattle are places where we have no presents. And it has taken us, I don't know, 15 years to get to 10 stores in LA, and you will see us continue to learn more, figure out places where we are -- zip codes where we are missing, and then try to figure out the best storing pattern to go into those bigger metro markets. So I don't read too much into that, because as I said, some of it is just planned, because the markets are bigger and more stores are required to fill them out.","David Whiston","Okay. And on buybacks, it would be helpful for modeling if you could give any clarity on dollar spend for fiscal 2016?","Tom Reedy","We don't give guidance on anything. But you can look at our release last fall, and it gives you an idea of the scale that we have, intentions for the longer term.","Tom Folliard","But its also going to be a balance based on where we are trading, and what we think makes the most sense, and its something that we have a discussion with the board on a very regular basis and we have done with a programmatic fine schedule that we put a range around and we adjust it accordingly, based on the environment that we are operating in.","David Whiston","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And we do have a follow-up question from the line of James Albertine with Stifel.","James Albertine","Great, thanks. Just wanted to sneak one more in; given the harsh weather on a year-over-year basis, you may have lost some day sales, and maybe mixed your comp with even stronger, in retrospect. But just wanted to maybe ask for your -- kind of your view on the weather if you will?","Tom Folliard","As you probably know James, we never like to use weather as an excuse, but it was really cold, and we did have a lot of stores closed, particularly in the back half of February. As far as attributing sales loss, we generally think we get it back, because when we are closed, everybody else is closed. It\u2019s not like milk, if you didn't sell it, you didn't sell it, or a grocer. It\u2019s such an infrequent purchase, where if we are closed, generally all the competition is closed as well. So I can attributed a specific sales loss to it, but we probably would have done a little better, if it wasn't so cold. We had a bunch of stores closed, particularly in the back half of February, but as I said, I think generally, we get those sales back.","James Albertine","Very good. Thanks again.","Tom Folliard","Okay.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. And we do have a follow-up question from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets.","Scot Ciccarelli","Hey guys, thanks for letting me back in here. Just a quick follow-up; with energy prices being such a major investor topic today, I am curious for a big ticket purchase like autos, have you seen any notable change in some of the energy centric markets, like Texas?","Tom Folliard","Well Scott, as you have learned over the years, we don't really talk about regional differences, so we are probably not going to start now.","Scot Ciccarelli","Is there any color you could provide on that, just because it does kind of indicate some sort of overall big ticket demand, even if it doesn't really -- directly to your business, just kind of changing behavior at all?","Tom Folliard","We didn't see much. S I mean, whether it\u2019s regional or -- I feel like we had a really good quarter and a really good year. We have gotten a lot of questions around gas prices and is it potential that lowering gas prices would drive sales towards kind of SUVs and V8s and we really didn't see much of that either. So I think possibly because we have such a wide range of inventory, and we appeal to such a broad range of customers, that some of those impacts are muted with us, but who knows.","I also think, in terms of gas prices, that people do not expect gas to be this cheap, and a car is a long term purchase. So although you might see some shifting, it really hasn't affected us as much as you might think.","Scot Ciccarelli","Got it. Okay. Thanks Tom.","Tom Folliard","We don't think prices are going to go back up. ","Scot Ciccarelli","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Rod Lache with Deutsche Bank.","Michael Levin","Hey guys, it\u2019s Mike Levin on for Rod. Just wanted to see if you could discuss some of the factors that went into you guys getting increased confidence in raising your store growth plans over the next three years, from 10 to 15 to 13 to 16?","Tom Folliard","Sure. So if you recall coming out of the recession and getting back into a growth plan, we wanted to have a phase build-up. We wanted to make sure that we built up our infrastructure, and by infrastructure I mean, the ability to go out and source real estate, the ability to make sure that we provide experienced management into all these stores, where we spent a lot of dollars on relo, to make sure that first customer that walks in the door gets a great experience at CarMax, and our buildup over the few years, we opened three the first year, then five, then 10, then 13 for two years in a row. So this is kind of in line with continuing; as the base has also gotten bigger during that time.","I think we have added 50 stores since 2011; increased the company size from 90-ish stores to 145 or so. And we opened 13 this year, and we plan on opening 14 next year, so it\u2019s right in the -- just kind of in the range of what we delivered, and we wanted to give ourselves some flexibility. These are big complicated stores, sometimes one or two might slip in or out every year. So we'd like to put a range about it, but we don't plan on opening 10 anymore, so we are -- that's kind of the range we can deliver over the next few years. So its confidence and all the things that I talked about, and that's the reason we raised the range.","Michael Levin","That's great, and maybe just a follow-up; can you guys let us know how you're thinking about the pace of buybacks going forward with some of your increased capital plans?","Tom Reedy","I think we hit on that a little earlier. As Tom mentioned, I think our goal was to be in it programmatically. If you look at what happened in Q4, we bought back a fewer shares and spent less dollars at an elevated stock price. So we put some buffers on our program based on our estimation of valuation. But in general, we want to be in the market on a continuous basis, and programmatically move towards a capital structure that's got a little more leverage unit; and I think you will see that over the next couple of years.","Michael Levin","Great. Thanks guys. Congrats on the results.","Tom Folliard","Thank you.","Operator","We also have a follow-up question from the line of Michael Montani with Evercore ISI.","Michael Montani","Hey guys. Just wanted to follow-up on two things, one was inventory per store, which I had up kind of low double digits. So I was just trying to understand, how much of that might be anticipated build-out, as you increase the unit growth, versus like a desire to actually increased fill rates, and have more cars on the lot? And then secondly with CapEx going from $310 million to $360 million, can you just help to understand, how much of that is related to the remodels versus the new store acceleration and what the major markets are to spend there?","Tom Reedy","Sure. What was your first question again? Inventory, yeah. So inventory in the quarter was up -- remember last year, we were behind on where we wanted to be, so some of it is, I would call it an easy comparison, because we were behind on inventory this year. We did a much better job of building, and we also had a bunch of new stores. So a lot of times when you look -- when we are in a build mode, we get a car done and saleable, we make it saleable in a store that finished it. So some stores have elevated inventory in the anticipation of a store opening, when we ship the cars over to the new store. So if you look at our total sales increase for the quarter, I think it was 12%, and you would expect inventory to go up kind of commensurate with that number, and then we had another -- during the quarter, 7% of compass, and I know inventory is slightly higher than when you add those two things together, but that I think is more of a reflection of -- we are a little behind of where we wanted to be last year.","And then your second question --","Michael Montani","On the CapEx side, just understanding the step-up year-over-year in CapEx spend, how much is related to the new store openings increasing whereas remodels and the major buckets of spend in the $360 million?","Tom Reedy","Yeah, the major buckets in the $360 million, roughly 80 of it would be on existing stores, 40 of that would be in normal maintenance, and the other 40 would be in the remodels that we talked about, and all the rest goes towards new stores.","And remember, CapEx is always our best guess at the year. We have a lot of movement and a lot of timing during the year, particularly in new stores and new construction. So that's our best guess and what we will spend this year, and that's roughly the breakdown.","Michael Montani","Great. Thank you.","Tom Folliard","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And we have no further questions in queue at this time. And I would like to turn the conference back over to our presenters.","Tom Folliard","All right. Thank you very much.

If you're interested in attending, please let us know. Tom?","Thomas J. Folliard","Thank you, Katharine. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today.","Used unit comps for the third quarter were up 10% compared to last year despite the toughest comparison of the year, primarily due to better conversion, as well as a modest increase in traffic. Total used unit sales grew by 15% in the quarter. Used vehicle gross profit grew by 16%, and used vehicle gross profit per unit of $2,149 was generally flat compared to last year.","Wholesale unit sales, up 4% due to the growth in our store base. Our wholesale gross profit was similar to the prior year, as the 4% growth in units was offset by a decrease of $36 in gross profit per unit.","Extended service plan revenues were also similar to the prior year, as the reserve adjustment related to the increases in cancellations offset the effect of our sales growth.","CAF quarterly income increased 16% to $84 million. The bottom line is we're pleased with another strong quarter. Net earnings grew 12% to $106.5 million, and net earnings per diluted share rose 15% to $0.47 per share.","I'll now turn the call over to Tom Reedy to talk about financing. Tom?","Thomas W. Reedy","Thanks, Tom. Good morning, everybody. In the third quarter, CAF income grew 16% compared to the third quarter of FY '13. Average managed receivables increased 24% to $6.8 billion, and portfolio growth continues to be largely driven by strong origination volume. Similar to the first half of the year, managed receivables grew at a faster pace than CAF earnings, as the increase in loan volume was offset by compression in the spread versus last year's third quarter.","Weighted average contract rate for accounts originated during the quarter was 7% compared to 7.7% in last year's third quarter, but up slightly from the 6.8% we saw in Q2 of this year. The allowance for loan losses increased to $68 million, and at 1% was flat as a percentage of managed receivables. Credit losses in the quarter were moderately better than our expectations. For CAF, net loans originated in the quarter rose 12% to $961 million, and net penetration was 41% for both this and the prior year's third quarter.","Third-party subprime providers accounted for about 18% of our sales in the third quarter compared to 15% in last year's third quarter. As you know, we have experienced an increase in subprime volume over the last couple years, as third-party providers have made more attractive offers to customers. Late in the quarter, we began to see them tighten the credit offers that they've been providing.","Finally, we plan to launch a test during the quarter to actively learn more about originating and servicing customers who would typically be financed by our subprime providers, an initiative we've been working on for over a year. Our objective, at this point, is to gain familiarity with the customer segment and to determine if it is appropriate for CAF to participate as one of the lenders in this space. Beginning in the fourth quarter, we plan to route a small percentage of these applications to CAF, and we'd expect to originate approximately $70 million over the course of the next year. This represents less than 2% of what CAF originated from -- in the last 12 months, and we plan to fund this test separately from our securitization vehicles.","Tom?","Thomas J. Folliard","Thank you. Regarding our sales mix, there were very few changes of note. Similar to the second quarter, sales of compacts and midsized vehicles grew a few percentage points. As we've discussed before, our mix of vehicles will vary based on customer demand.","Total SG&A for the quarter increased by 11%, reflecting the 12% growth in our store base since the beginning of last year's third quarter and variable expenses related to higher sales. SG&A per retail unit was down $98, again, largely driven by the 10% comps.","In the third quarter, our average monthly web visits neared 12 million hits per month, up 36% compared to last year's third quarter. This quarter was the first during which more than 50% of our traffic came from devices other than desktops or laptops. Average monthly visits to our mobile site represented about 26% of total visits, and visits utilizing our iPhone or Android app represented nearly 12% of our traffic.","Also during the third quarter, we opened 3 stores: 1 in Jackson, Tennessee; 1 in Brandywine, Maryland; and 1 in St. Louis. And after the third quarter ended, we also opened our second store in St. Louis and 2 stores in our Philadelphia market, including our King of Prussia store, which will open today. We announced 4 planned openings for next year's third quarter. Three are in new markets for CarMax, including Portland, Oregon, Tupelo, Mississippi and Reno, Nevada. We will also open our third store in the Raleigh market.","And with that, we'll be happy to take your questions.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And the first question is from Simeon Gutman.","Simeon Gutman - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","So I have one and a follow-up. The first might have a couple of parts to it. On the finance side regarding the subprime tightening, can you talk to -- is the number of offers being made is going down or is it the same number with higher rates? And can you discuss what's sparking the change and if you're seeing any other changes in the actions of other lenders?","Thomas W. Reedy","I'll take that, Simeon. As far as what tightening means, it really means they're going backward on the changes that they've made over the past couple of years, which is downpayment and kind of ease of documentation. So it seems to slide back a little bit on that. As far as where it lands, we don't know, it's too early to tell and what that means. And as far as why they're doing it, they run their own portfolios, just like CAF does, they're managing to optimize profitability and size as well. I can't speak for them, but I guess -- I would guess that they're taking moves to manage risks based on what they've been seeing over the past couple of years. I do not believe that it's a CarMax-specific issue, though.","Simeon Gutman - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And then the other lenders at the other part of, I guess, the portfolio, not the non-CAF stuff, some of the other lenders, are you seeing any changes there?","Thomas W. Reedy","Actually, this quarter has been a little bit positive vis\u2013\u00e0\u2013vis where they've been historically.","Simeon Gutman - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then the one follow-up is in, in testing your own portfolio, is that something that was discussed with your current partners and might you expect a change in the fee you pay as a result of that test?","Thomas W. Reedy","No, this is something that we've made them aware of. In fact, we've been working with them over the past year trying to do due diligence and get smarter about the -- about working in this space, so it's not a surprise for them. And the nice thing about being back in growth mode again is that we can grow the portfolio and allow partners to continue to grow and bring new people in, like ourselves, if that's what makes sense.","Operator","And your next question is from Matt Nemer.","Matthew R. Nemer - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I'm just -- just a follow-up on subprime. I'm curious if your in-house auctions and the ability to sort of dispose of vehicles quickly and probably cheaper than other subprime players could potentially allow you to have a better offer in the marketplace.","Thomas J. Folliard","Matt, we dispose of a lot of our current repos through our auction channel, so I think it's just another thing that we do that makes it easy for us to run a finance business or easier to run a finance business, because we don't have to rely heavily on outside parties to dispose of repos. So it's a factor, but I don't think it's a big one.","Thomas W. Reedy","Yes. And, Matt, I'd also point out, we're not -- in the event that we go through this test and we determine it's the right thing to do for us, our goals are not going to be to outcompete other people in the subprime space. We're looking at it as potential profit and risk mitigation in our business.","Matthew R. Nemer - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay, great. And then on the warranty business, I'm curious just why the cancel rate has ticked higher. It seems like at $10 a month on a $200 or $300 payment, it's not something that you would really pay a lot of attention to.","Thomas W. Reedy","Yes, Matt, we're not going to be able to go into any granularity on what is driving the cancel rate, but we have observed a higher rate of cancellations on the ESP we've originated over recent years. And as a reminder, that product is cancelable anytime during its life, and we have to return a pro rata amount in the event the customer cancels it. They could cancel it at will. They could be canceling it because they're buying a new car, because they got repo-ed, for any number of reasons. So as we sell that product, we book a reserve, and it's an estimate, just like it would be on CAF loan losses, that we have to tune on a periodic basis. If you remember, we had a $0.01 adjustment in the fourth quarter. The portfolio has gotten a lot bigger. We've actually sold over $700 million of the product since 2010. And we've seen the movement, so it's appropriate to adjust the reserve amount here.","Matthew R. Nemer - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I guess, do you think that's -- should we view that as more of a macro consumer issue? Or is it -- does it have something to do with, you think, with your offer?","Thomas W. Reedy","Like I said, we can't go to that kind of granularity. What I would view it as, from your perspective, is a very slight worsening in the profitability of ESP because we have a different view on what's going to be returned on a go-forward basis. And if we see different behavior going forward, we'll change it again. But it amounts to a small adjustment in the go-forward reserve, and a minimal, maybe 1% less profitable on the ESP that we sell. So it's a few dollars a car.","Matthew R. Nemer - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And then just lastly, the stats on the web visits and the mobile usage are pretty strong. What does that mean for your business model? I mean, are those customers more likely to convert? Are they more likely to refer you to a friend? Have you kind of thought through what that could mean from a financial standpoint, longer-term?","Thomas J. Folliard","Yes, it's a little hard to say, but I just clearly think this is where consumers are going. And they're spending a lot more time on the web prior to coming to the store, and we've seen that trend for several years. So it's not surprising that the growth of web traffic dramatically exceeds the growth of foot traffic. I think people are showing up more prepared. So I think it has lots of ramifications for the business, but it's really difficult to figure out what that is right now. But in general, I think it's positive. I think we have a great app, and I think we have a great website and a great search engine. And I think we're providing tools that customers want so that they're better prepared to make a decision.","Operator","Your next question is from John Murray (sic) [Murphy].","John Murphy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","It's John Murphy. Just a follow-up on the CAF question here on the subprime side. What is the motivating factor there? Is that really just to grow CAF earnings, which is a good thing, or is that a response to this pullback in credit availability you're seeing from your subprime partners? And also, what was the highest that subprime was as a percentage of sales at the peak?","Thomas W. Reedy","Yes, John. As I mentioned, we've worked on this for over a year, so it's not a reactionary move at all. Customers with challenged credit have become a meaningful part of our overall business, and they're a meaningful part of the used car market, so we feel like we owe it to ourselves to get smarter about this space. Whether we're in it or not with our partners, we need to understand it a little better. We considered a number of options, including a joint venture or something like that, but we determined this is the best way to learn. So I hope -- that's probably the best way to address [indiscernible].","Thomas J. Folliard","Yes, I mean, John, when this was 3% or 4% of our business, it wasn't as big of a discussion point. But when it's 15% plus, we have to look at what's in the overall best interest of the company. So this is just a step in that direction to really learn more about the segment.","John Murphy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","It seems like it makes a lot of sense. But what was the peak percentage, is it 18% kind of...?","Thomas J. Folliard","21%.","Katharine W. Kenny","It's 21%.","John Murphy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","21%, okay, great. Then just a second question on vehicle pricing, up $125. Tom, was that just -- is that just a function of mix? Because there's always this expectation -- or there's this expectation in the market that used vehicle pricing might come down, but that doesn't seem to be happening at all.","Thomas J. Folliard","John, I missed the beginning part of that. What did you say, used vehicle pricing?","Thomas W. Reedy","Up $125.","John Murphy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Your revenue per unit was up $125 year-over-year, and it's a pretty strong number. I'm just curious what you're seeing for used vehicle pricing. Is that mix or -- I mean, there's an expectation that used vehicle pricing will come down, and that's just not happening.","Thomas J. Folliard","Yes, I've never seen it come down other than in the recession, when it dropped a couple thousand dollars in less than 6 months. So I mean, we don't view $100 as a very big number on an over $19,000 average retail, so we didn't really spend any time looking or talking about that.","John Murphy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then just lastly, bench of general managers for new stores, where are you at on that process?","Thomas J. Folliard","We feel like we're in really good shape. Our opening plan, as we've announced, 10 to 15 stores over the next 3 years. This is the first of those 3. As a percentage of the base of stores that we have, it's actually a smaller percentage than what we've grown in the past. And I think we've done a really nice job over the last few years of building up our pipeline, both in terms of real estate availability, people availability, getting folks trained and ready to go and having people prepped to move to new markets. So I feel like we're in really good shape.","Operator","And your next question is from Matt Fassler.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I'd like to dig a little bit deeper into subprime as well, and just get a better understanding from you as to sort of the operational differences in managing a subprime business from running CAF as it exists today. And also, if you could give us some sense as to the sources of funding as you launch your pilot? And then, if it's successful, whether you would anticipate funding subprime through the ABS market or through some other vehicle.","Thomas W. Reedy","Sure, Matt. So I'm not going to go into a lot of detail about what we're doing as far as managing services. But our game plan is to randomly route a small percentage of customers to CAF and run them through the scoring model that we've developed and provide great customer-friendly service. One thing I think is important to remember, we've got a great team in Atlanta that runs a great finance business, and we already serve a pretty wide spectrum of credit. Some customers need more attention than the others as far as calls, et cetera. We're viewing this as an expansion, really, of what we already do. And like I said, without getting into details, we've built upon our account servicing techniques, and I think it will be appropriate -- it will be helpful for this space. But I think we'll also learn some things and have some benefit in the business we do today from it. As far as funding, at this point, we're just going to use cash on hand to fund the test, it's very small. To the extent we decide to go forward with this as a line of business or an initiative, we'll explore other options, and we would plan on trying to do something, to the extent it's available. Whether it's in the ABS market, conduits, that will be -- we'll determine that as we see fit.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And then just a quick follow-up, this just goes back to core used vehicle sales. Obviously, the supply of newer vehicles coming off lease seems to be starting to gush, and it's plentiful relative to where it had been in recent years. Are you seeing that flow through to your buying opportunities? What's your sense of whether that's actually materializing the way the numbers say it is and what that does for your sourcing and volume potential going forward?","Thomas J. Folliard","Yes, it's -- I think the gush you're talking about in leasing is leased percentage of new cars sold, and that's really a lot more recent. So those cars, really, have not started coming back in any big numbers. So as we've talked about last quarter, that our mix shift between 0- to 4-year-old and 5- to 10-year-old really hasn't moved very much. But clearly, if the SAAR stays -- continues to move up in the 16 million plus range and the percentage of leased vehicles is higher, then, ultimately, those cars will come back at the auction. It really hasn't started to happen yet, but we expect it to, and I think that's good for us.","Operator","Your next question is from Sharon Zackfia.","Sharon Zackfia - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","So a couple of questions on CarMax Auto Finance, and then I had a question for Tom as well. So on the tightening of credit, it didn't look like, based on the percent of subprime sales in the quarter, that it had any kind of noticeable impact. So has it been more of an impact as you've gone into the fourth quarter, or was it near the very end of the third quarter?","Thomas W. Reedy","Yes, I think, as we mentioned in the release, late in the quarter we saw a change of behavior. And every call, last 3 -- 2 or 3 calls, I've been asked whether we see any reason to think that our partners' behavior may be different than it has been. And this time, we do. So that's why we're talking about it.","Sharon Zackfia - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. And I mean, are the loans you're going to generate through CAF, are they expected to be a substitutive of the loans that you would have generated through the third-party lenders, so kind of cannibalizing the third-party? Or is it a significantly different scorecard than your third-party lenders use, so it would be additive, if I'm making sense there?","Thomas W. Reedy","It's our own scorecard, but we plan on routing to CAF just like we route to our other third-party lenders. So it would eat a little bit into what they're doing.","Thomas J. Folliard","We're not going into this, Sharon, thinking we're going to add a bunch of incremental sales because our third-party providers are missing the boat in this arena. This just becomes such a big percentage, we don't want to have kind of so little visibility into this area, particularly one that's so costly for us.","Thomas W. Reedy","Right. It's important to remember that these sales through these partners are about 1\/3 as profitable as something that goes through the -- either the CAF or one of our other channels. So there's a big economic [indiscernible] there between...","Thomas J. Folliard","Yes, there's quite a lot of incentive there.","Sharon Zackfia - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","And I assume, if this is a good pilot program and you expand it further sometime in the future, you wouldn't indefinitely fund this through your own balance sheet, right?","Thomas W. Reedy","No. As I said to Matt, I think we'd look at alternatives to fund this. And as I also mentioned, we're looking at this as a play for profit, potentially, and risk mitigation. And at this point, if this test makes sense, we'd envision us being one of several partners in that space, not trying to grab all of the share.","Sharon Zackfia - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. And then just a quick question on marketing. I mean the year-to-date marketing spend is pretty flat, which, I think, is relatively unusual. And I was hoping somebody could speak to whether that's just more efficiencies you're getting in the marketing team or in the buys that you have, if your impressions are actually up year-over-year or if those are flattish? Just any indication of what's going on with marketing because I'm just surprised that it's not up more.","Thomas J. Folliard","Well, we have pretty good comps for the first 9 months of the year. So that, hopefully, is going to drive some leverage. And we do have some timing. We'll spend a little more on the second half of the year. We are planning along running a Super Bowl ad this year. That's -- it's a few million dollars. It's not dramatic, but it's -- there will be a little bit of timing into the fourth quarter. But we expect the business to leverage in a number of different areas. And if we're running -- we were 16, 17 and 10 in comps for the first 3 quarters, so...","Sharon Zackfia - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","It was actually flat in dollars, though. I mean, I was just looking at it in dollars, not as a percentage of sales.","Thomas J. Folliard","Yes, and we think of it as dollars per car sold. So that's -- when I say leverage, I'm talking about in dollars per car sold.","Sharon Zackfia - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. You're going to force me to watch the Super Bowl, that's the master plan.","Thomas J. Folliard","Yes.","Operator","Your next question is from Brian Nagel from Oppenheimer.","Brian W. Nagel - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","So I, too, want to ask a question about subprime. If -- what can you -- is there any way to quantify the impact to your -- upon your sales of these actions the lenders have taken here recently? I mean, in other words, how should we think about how much that is, either in the current quarter or going forward? How much could this weigh upon your used car sales?","Thomas W. Reedy","Yes. I mean, we aren't very good at predicting the future for any part of our business, which is why we don't give guidance. And I think it's just too early to tell. We don't know where they're going to land as far as where they dial in at how much they're going to tighten, so we can't give any guidance going forward. But we -- like I said, it is a -- we have observed a change. We get asked this question every quarter, and we thought it was important to let you know.","Thomas J. Folliard","And there's way too many other variables.","Thomas W. Reedy","Yes.","Thomas J. Folliard","When you think like the question Matt asked about supply and customer traffic and the growth in our web traffic. There's just a lot of things, a lot of moving parts there, so it's very difficult to predict.","Brian W. Nagel - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Got it. And the follow-up question, someone previously asked about the performance of your new stores. Just wondered if you could clarify it. And just given that you opened some more new stores, how would you characterize overall the performance of the stores?","Thomas J. Folliard","Yes, as a group, with all of our new -- the new stores are at or above our expectations. So we're very pleased with how openings have been going. And yes, it's a pretty diverse set of stores, too, spread out across the country, and that will be the case going forward as well. So just what we're really focused on is continuing to improve our business model each and every day and make sure that when we open a store, we have an experienced CarMax team in place, so when a customer walks in the door, they get a great experience. And we've been very pleased with how that's gone so far.","Brian W. Nagel - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","And one more follow-up, if I could, just going back on subprime. Again, so I think someone else asked, is there -- could you -- is there any way you could tell the reason behind the change in behavior of your partners? The question I have, have you seen anything that suggests that the performance of these subprime loans is actually deteriorating?","Thomas W. Reedy","Well, we don't participate in this space, so I can't really comment on that. But I think I would hypothesize that they're -- they have not been as happy with what they've seen -- that they've originated over the last 2 years, and they're adjusting their portfolio accordingly.","Thomas J. Folliard","Look, a number of times over the last several quarters we've said that our subprime providers have gotten more and more comfortable and more and more aggressive with the CarMax origination channel. It just makes sense that, at some point, you'd bump up against some performance metric and probably have to scale back a little bit. But again, we don't run their business. They run their own business. We're happy to have them as third-party providers, and -- but we're going to expect some movement in the way they lend over time.","Thomas W. Reedy","Yes. And as we mentioned, that profitability difference is significant, so we're actually happy to trade 3 of those for 1 CAF sale anytime you tell us and any time we could take that trade.","Thomas J. Folliard","That's why it's another difficult thing to really figure out because, I mentioned all those other moving parts earlier, it doesn't take a lot of non-tier 3 sales to make up for 1 point or 2 of loss.","Operator","Your next question is from Craig Kennison from Robert W. Baird.","Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I'll start with a quick one on subprime and then move in a different direction. I assume that this has no impact on the fee that you will pay to your origination partners.","Thomas W. Reedy","No, it doesn't. As Tom said, we don't influence their behavior. The one way that we could theoretically do it is by paying them more or less, but I think you've seen when we've announced our tests, we've elected to leave that as it is and figure out the business a little bit better ourselves.","Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","That helps. And then just changing direction here, on the real estate side, Tom, I know part of the strong return on capital that you generate is because you've got a good real estate team that buys real estate at the right price. What are you seeing in that market today? And do you feel like you can still get the kind of returns as with those rates -- or those costs go up?","Thomas J. Folliard","We feel pretty good. We've not committed to a single piece of real estate that we didn't think we could make a very good return on. So are there things that are -- coming out of the recession, were there things that were less expensive than they were before? Sure. And now, going into places like -- look -- it's starting to look at Portland, Seattle, San Francisco, Boston, Philly, are they places that are more expensive? Absolutely, but we expect to sell more cars there. And we've also done a nice job over the last few years of improving our profitability. So in terms of availability and our ability to make a great return, it's been no problem at all.","Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","And with respect to reconditioning costs, obviously, you've moved the needle there over time. Is there still any room at all to reduce costs there?","Thomas J. Folliard","Yes, we do still think there's some room. I think it's -- as we've said before, the next 50 or 100 will be a lot more difficult than the first 250 or so. But it's a constant effort for our teams to try to figure out how to get more consistent and how to eliminate waste from the system and, at the same time, not compromise our quality. So I think our store teams have done a fantastic job to this point, and I expect to still be able to make progress going forward.","Operator","And your next question is from Scot Ciccarelli from RBC Capital Markets.","Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","It will be remiss of me not to ask at least one subprime question here.","Thomas J. Folliard","We might have to valid check [ph] you and just say, \"Look, we've already answered that question 7 times.\"","Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And I've heard that from you before, actually. So I guess my question is, where are you comfortable with subprime penetration levels? I mean, historically, you guys have kind of talked about -- Tom, you've kind of talked about 20%-ish kind of level. But now you're experimenting it with -- experimenting yourselves with subprime. Like has the thought process in terms of how much subprime is going to be as a total of your business started to change?","Thomas W. Reedy","Scot, I don't think it has at all. We don't know the right number, but one thing, I think, we need to be clear about is we're not intending to drive subprime penetration at our business up by getting into this initiative here. As I said, we're looking at potentially being one of several partners. We'll have our own set of credit parameters and our own origination model, which we do not expect to be more aggressive than our partners. So I don't think we're giving any indication that we think we're moving -- trying to move the needle on how much subprime is in the business.","Thomas J. Folliard","Yes, that's correct. That's not our goal at all in doing this. We don't expect this to have, really, any impact whatsoever on the percentage of sales represented by subprime.","Thomas W. Reedy","Yes, we're looking at whether it makes sense to take a share of the profit and to try to mitigate risk.","Thomas J. Folliard","We've been getting asked for years about the amount of money we pay to get one of these deals done and wouldn't it make sense to think about it differently, and that's what we're trying to do.","Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Understood. So it's really a substitution effect here. But historically, you've also talked about you're kind of comfortable with 20% penetration levels of subprime. Does that thought process change if the new model is, let's call it, significantly more profitable than what the old subprime model had been?","Thomas W. Reedy","No, I don't think it does. As I said, we're not looking to expand the amount of subprime in our channel. And when you look at the amount of subprime business that we do, it's not out of line with the marketplace overall. We've got -- we've looked at external data to that point, so we're not -- I think subprime is going to be what it is based on customer flow through the door and who's applying and what's going on in the economy. And we'll run a business that makes -- if we -- if this test is successful, we'll run a business that makes economic sense. But I don't think we have -- I feel comfortable that we're not out of line with the mix of subprime in the auto space, in the used auto space, and we're not trying to drive it up.","Thomas J. Folliard","And, Scot, we've never really put a number on that. What I've always said about this segment of business is each incremental -- each individual customer, first of all, is getting a great deal at CarMax because we're not changing the price because they happen to be in this segment. Second of all, we've been subsidizing the deal by paying a discount to get them done. And we deliver very high-quality products. So I think if you're in this credit space, we're a terrific place to buy a very high-quality car and get a great experience that maybe you can't get elsewhere. And also, since these lenders don't see the loan until all of the other providers have declined, we've been sure that these customers and these sales are 100% incremental. So despite the fact that they're lesser in terms of profitability, it's 100% incremental profit. So on an individual customer basis, we feel really, really good about this offering. And as Tom said, when you look at it as a percentage of our total sales, we're going to sell 0.5 million cars this year. You would expect us to be somewhat representative of what kind of credit mix looks like in the U.S., and that's kind of where we are right now.","Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay, understood. I will ask about the test that you're doing, though. Like some of your -- some of the loans within your typical CAF portfolio are already subprime if you just kind of look at what FICO scores are and APRs and the securitizations. Why the call out about the test? Because you don't want the blended FICO score or credit quality of existing securitizations to change?","Thomas W. Reedy","Well, if you think of -- you're absolutely right, Scot, that we do serve a wide spectrum of credit, as I mentioned before, and we're looking at this as expansion. But the way credit routes in our business is it goes to CAF, it goes to our Tier 2 lenders, it goes to our Tier 3 lenders. We want our customers to have an opportunity to get all those various offers and get the best financing for them. And this is just -- in this particular space are customers that we have not served before, and...","Thomas J. Folliard","But I would say that you're right, in that some of the stuff we originate ends up performing like this, which gives us more confidence in our ability to manage it. Because we've been managing receivables, although it's a small percentage, it's still a big enough chunk that we feel like we have experience to do this well. And part of calling it out is to separate it out and look at it as a separate investment and see if we can make a return on it. But if we just originated this different set of business and put it into the securitization, we wouldn't get as good -- as favorable terms as we're currently getting. And once we get this all -- a test in place and we decide whether or not we want to go forward, we'll figure out how to fund it then.","Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay, that's all very helpful. And then just one more question regarding wholesale. Looks like wholesale units were a bit sluggish. I know you guys don't break out comps for the business, but given the store growth, it would suggest that the comp will be in negative territory, which just seems odd given kind of the strength in the rest of your business. Any thoughts there, Tom?","Thomas J. Folliard","No, I still think -- I've always thought that wholesale and retail, over time, will grow around the same. And you've been following us for a long time, you've seen huge swings that don't necessarily match up. If you go back to 2001, I know that's a long term to look at it, our wholesale growth and our retail comps have been about the same, but -- and I expect that over time. So 4% this quarter compared to 15% sales growth is a little bit off, but I think, over time, they'll be more closely aligned.","Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","But nothing that you noticed in terms of why the wholesale unit growth was slower this quarter, maybe buying fewer vehicles or something?","Thomas J. Folliard","No, I mean, clearly, we bought more because we had growth, but not as many as what our sales growth would have predicted. But in terms of our buy rate, it was very strong, and we don't see any reason to worry about it.","Operator","And your next question is from Rod Lache from Deutsche Bank.","Dan Galves - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","It's Dan Galves for Rod. I came on the call a little late, has anybody asked about subprime yet?","Thomas W. Reedy","That was good.","Dan Galves - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So I got a couple of questions. The first one is related to the new stores that are kind of now in the comp base, would expect that they're growing faster as they ramp up to the corporate average. Do you see that as providing a meaningful positive to your same-store -- overall same-store comps yet? Or is that something still to come?","Thomas J. Folliard","It's all just built into the comp expectation. And remember, too, that the base is so much bigger that even when you get a store at, say, its second year and it has a higher percentage comp growth, it's a very small number of units in the big scheme of things, so...","Dan Galves - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","But as you end up with like 30, 40 stores in the next couple of years that are in year 2 and year 3, do you see that as being a potential positive to comps?","Thomas J. Folliard","Yes, but as we've talked about a comp range in the past of something like 4% to 8%, we think that range is still a pretty good one. One other thing to remember is we're going to open a lot of stores back into existing markets. So sometimes, a satellite store can actually hurt comps in the other stores because there is some cannibalization. So it's a pretty complex model to figure out.","Dan Galves - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, got it. Got it. And then the last one is the third-party finance fees, just rough math, if you divide that by the subprime volume in your business, you get to about $800 per unit. Is that the right way to think about it? Or are there -- is there third-party finance income in there as well? It's just looking -- go ahead.","Thomas W. Reedy","We've said this before, in our subprime segment, today, we pay about $1,000 a car to the third-party provider.","Operator","And your next question is from Rick Nelson from Stephens.","N. Richard Nelson - Stephens Inc., Research Division","I'd like to ask you about provision for loan loss. It looks like it picked up sequentially. If you could speak to delinquencies, what you're seeing there.","Thomas W. Reedy","The provision for loan loss picked up dollar-wise year-over-year, but as a percent of receivables, it's flat. And if you're saying sequentially over the quarter, this is the time of year where we'll typically see, coming into the holiday season, delinquencies may pick up a little bit, but that's a normal seasonal trend. People are focused on other payments.","N. Richard Nelson - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Got it. Also, I'm curious about the CFPB, they've put out a bulletin in March, how that's affecting your other third-party credit providers and if that's having any impact at CAF?","Thomas W. Reedy","I don't -- to date, it's had no impact to CAF as we have not been visited yet. We have spoken with our third-party providers who have had interaction with the CFPB. I don't believe it's impacting any of our business. It's -- their focus is on a couple of things: one is making sure that people are treated equally and fairly; two, that the products aren't overly profitable. But as I said, as far as Wells Fargo or Cap One and the impact on the business they're doing with us, we haven't seen any.","Operator","And your next question is from Jamie Albertine from Stifel.","James J. Albertine - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I dialed in a little bit late. I just wanted to follow up, if I could, on the SG&A side of things. We've talked about it both with you guys at your Analyst Day and I've heard you referred to it on prior conference calls. But from an SG&A per unit perspective, can you just remind us kind of where we are today versus prior peak? And you've done a really good job of sort of highlighting the opportunities on items like reconditioning costs coming down, and it sounds like there's still room to go there. But maybe if you can talk sort of high level about your top 2 or 3 priorities as it relates to SG&A cost reductions and, therefore, leverage as you -- your growth story sort of plays out for the next 2 or 3 years.","Thomas J. Folliard","Yes, I don't really know what the peak was, but we were down almost $100 per unit sold in the third quarter compared to last year. You referenced reconditioning costs. Remember, reconditioning costs are in cost of goods sold, not in SG&A, so we kind of try to think of those 2 things as 1 big bucket of opportunity. We will eclipse $1 billion of SG&A this year and probably, I don't know, $600 million or so of reconditioning. So it's a pretty big opportunity to try to find efficiencies. And in terms of our priorities, it's largely -- in the SG&A bucket, it's largely going to be around how do we operate our stores consistently, how do we staff better, how do we make sure we're properly staffed for peaks and for valleys in terms of traffic and sales. And it's a pretty seasonal business, it's a pretty labor-intensive business, so there's lots of opportunities to try and get more and more efficient in that regard. So that's kind where our efforts are focused there. We're really proud of all the progress we've made on the cost of goods sold side in terms of reconditioning. But I think with SG&A, there's probably some opportunity in there, and we're focused on going after it.","James J. Albertine - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I should have clarified that, and I apologize, and I appreciate you calling that out on the COGS side. Is it fair to say then that if you look at the 2 buckets, it's predominantly going to be more SG&A-driven from this point going forward, given that the bulk of reconditioning improvement you've already performed [ph]?","Thomas J. Folliard","Not necessarily because the bulk -- remember, the bulk of SG&A is going to be rents and advertising. And some of the fixed overheads we can only make so much progress on. We have to have enough people in our stores to have them up and running and pay our bills. So I think when you look at the 2 buckets and you break it out into things that are somewhat less manageable, let's say, then there's opportunity in both.","Operator","And your final question is from Bill Armstrong from CL King & Associates.","William R. Armstrong - CL King & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Tom and Tom, this is the first we've heard of any hiccups in the overall subprime model lending market. And you mentioned earlier that you do not believe that this is CarMax-specific. What -- I was wondering if you could maybe elaborate on what you're hearing or seeing in the market that leads you to believe that this is beyond CarMax?","Thomas W. Reedy","No, I think -- we've had conversations with our partners. And as I've mentioned, they have CarMax as a part of their overall portfolio. And they fine tune that portfolio and their origination standards based on what they're experiencing. And I think that is the result of us, other business they're doing. And all I can say is that they have indicated that this is not a CarMax-specific issue.","William R. Armstrong - CL King & Associates, Inc., Research Division","If the subprime consumer is starting to get a little overextended with debt, particularly auto-related debt, how does that impact your view on this test that you're now doing? And it sounds like it might be -- you might be extending that at just the wrong time. How do you look at that?","Thomas W. Reedy","If you believe the market has been overheated over the last couple years, then the last couple years would have been the wrong time to enter this. We're not trying to time the market. We're not trying to figure out what's the best time to enter it. This is a longer-term initiative. The reason we're going now is because we're ready to go now. We've been working on it for over a year. And we're in a position where we believe we can start originating and servicing sometime this quarter. And remember, this is a very small test for us. This is smaller than other tests we run at CAF as far as pricing and in terms. And at the end of the day, while we are going into it expecting to make some money, it's not material to our overall business or even to CAF's overall portfolio.","William R. Armstrong - CL King & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Understood. Okay. And then just one quick housekeeping question. The increase in allowance on ESP returns, what was the dollar amount on a pretax basis?","Thomas W. Reedy","It's about -- it's $0.02.","William R. Armstrong - CL King & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Right. What is the dollar amount on a pretax basis?","Thomas W. Reedy","Yes, we don't disclose -- we haven't disclosed dollar amounts on our estimate adjustments.","Operator","And I'm showing no further questions at this time.","Thomas J. Folliard","Okay. Thanks, everyone. Happy holidays. Thanks for all your support and continued interest. And of course, thanks to all of our associates for their dedication and their hard work and what they do every day to make CarMax what it is today. We'll talk to you again next quarter. Thanks.","Operator","And that does conclude today's conference. You may now disconnect."]}}
